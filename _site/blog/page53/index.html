        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/04/what-makes-baas-relevant-to-apis/">What Makes BaaS Relevant to APIs?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p>Unless you are a BaaS provider or a mobile application developer, the linkage between BaaS and APIs may not be immediately clear. But once you study the space, you quickly notice that APIs are the heart of BaaS, providing platforms with the flexibility and resources they need to meet mobile developers needs.</p>
<p>BaaS and APIs are working together in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native BaaS APIs </strong>- Each BaaS provider offers up a default set of REST APIs for manipulating core data and object stores, providing programmatical access to almost every part of the BaaS platform</li>
<li><strong>Custom APIs</strong> - Most BaaS providers allow for the design, deployment and configuration of custom REST APIs from data an objects defined via the system. Turning many BaaS platforms into API deployment frameworks, opening up a whole new channel for development</li>
<li><strong>Deploy BaaS Platforms&nbsp;</strong>- The growth in number of APIs resources, coupled with the BaaS movement opens up the opportunity for new providers to step up and deliver BaaS stacks, using their own API resources, bundled 3rd party APIs or a combination of the two.</li>
<li><strong>An API Blueprint</strong> - The patterns that are emerging among BaaS providers provide an excellent blueprint of what types of API resources mobile developers are demanding. &nbsp;Closely watching the BaaS space has potential to provide a blueprint of what API resources are in demand, which aren't and potential opportunities for new API resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>BaaS is a natural progression of APIs from single uses to meaningful stacks of resources for developers. As the number of APIs a developer might use in an app grew from 1 or 2, to potentially 10 separate APIs, the need for aggregation and consolidation of resources grew as well. &nbsp;Mobile app developers don't have time or resources to maintain infrastructure as well as discover, qualify, integrate and maintain relationships with 10 separate API providers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs have helped identify and make available essential resources developers depend on like compute, storage, messaging and authentication, and within the BaaS framework, the next generation of essential API resources are being identified like geo, voice, targeting, friends and virtual commerce. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a danger that BaaS will move us back to more rigid, platform approaches to application development, but BaaS has the potential to be a kind elastic glue, that will bring together authentication and other essential resources into a permanent or temporary, but meaningful stack for developers to put to use.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p>API calls and passing on cloud storage costs are the most common ways to approach BaaS pricing. &nbsp;But beyond these two areas, there are numerous other ways BaaS providers are pricing BaaS services for developers.</p>
<p>With mobile app users being the center of the world in mobile app development, it makes a per user charge charge for BaaS services seem logical. A per user fee, potentially couples a BaaS provider monetization strategy with their developers. &nbsp;In this approach a provider may assume their developers will be monetization each end-user of their platform, thus can afford to pay more as they add users.</p>
<p>Other BaaS providers state that charging developers based upon API calls and number of active uses results in a kind of success tax. &nbsp;Meaning the more successful your app is, the more active users and API calls you will have, equally a significantly larger BaaS bill. &nbsp;There is still a lot of open discussion around this point.</p>
<p>BaaS pricing is far from standardized. &nbsp;It is much more a reflection of the IaaS layer beneath the BaaS providers than it is about the end users of the platforms. However there is a lot of experimentation going on in Baas, resulting in numerous other approaches to pricing across 45 BaaS providers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> doesn't focus on market or investment opportunities. I keep an eye out for product and innovation opportunities, which are a much different beast. These represent places where there are gaps in the delivery of API driven resources that developers will need to deliver the generation of not just apps, but compute.</p>
<p>There are numerous opportunities for innovation within the umbrella that is being defined as BaaS in the areas that are obvious and fast growing in market spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile -&nbsp;</strong>We are 2-3 years into the solid growth of the mobile smartphone market. &nbsp;This is nothing new. &nbsp;But with the adoption rate, the hype and the potential within emerging markets, we can ignore the opportunity within the mobile sphere. As the demand for mobile apps grow, the demand for efficiencies in mobile app development will grow exponentially. If a business can efficiently go to market with steady flow of high quality apps designed for web, mobile and a wide variety of mobile platforms, it will succeed in the current space</li>
<li><strong>Tablets -&nbsp;</strong>Tablets are displacing the desktop, and even laptop computers. The world of developing apps for mobile is rapidly morphing into a blurry world of hundreds of different devices from iOS to Android. &nbsp;There is a lot of potential for delivering BaaS platforms that focus specifically on the needs of emerging tablet devices across manufacturers</li>
<li><strong>Readers -</strong>Devices are blurring the lines between phone, tablet and dumb terminals. Across the publishing industry, from providers like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Nobles, we are seeing reader devices like the Kindle and Nook. &nbsp;As we see publishing applications like Flipboard and Zite find an audience we will see a growth in demand for backend services that support reader and other consumption focused devices</li>
<li><strong>Niche -&nbsp;</strong>Most BaaS providers are about delivering a general purpose stack of resources, allowing developers to design, develop and deploy apps across any business sector. &nbsp;Among the current pool of BaaS providers there are already the emergence of niche or specialty platforms in the area of gaming, e-commerce and advertising. &nbsp;There is a lot of opportunity to deliver BaaS platforms that deliver specialized area such as education, finance, government or beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Transport -&nbsp;</strong>Technology is penetrating every aspect of our daily lives. Automobiles are becoming a platform for digital deliver, with auto companies like Ford and GM getting into the API game. BaaS is a universal backend platform that can be tailored to any implementation. &nbsp;Our vehicles will have very different requirements if we are a soccer mom or a fleet of delivery vehicles in NYC. Lots of opportunities to understand the world of BaaS in the service of transportation.</li>
<li><strong>Internet of Things -&nbsp;</strong>The Internet of Things is the catch all bucket for "everything else" in the world of Internet enabled devices. &nbsp;We put everything from quantified self and 3D printing to smart grid technology into the Internet of Things bucket. &nbsp;This is the biggest, yet to be fully explored opportunity in BaaS. &nbsp;With the special needs of the power grid or public water supply it only makes sense there would be backends dedicated to each sector. &nbsp;This leaves a whole world of opportunity and speculation within the Internet of Things.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to delivering a precise, meaningful backend that drives technology, there will be unlimited opportunities for new platforms. &nbsp;When you view BaaS as a relevant stack of valuable API resources, bundled with a sensible business model, the model can be applied into many business sectors.</p>
<p>Beyond just mobile, tablets, readers and niche opportunity, once the world of Internet of Things expands, the opportunity for BaaS to connect our physical worlds to our virtual worlds will be unlimited.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/04/what-are-the-common-building-blocks-of-baas/">What Are The Common Building Blocks of BaaS?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p>After reviewing the top BaaS providers like Appcelerator, Appery.io Kinvey, Parse and StackMob, a pattern of building blocks begin to emerge. Building blocks that BaaS providers are using to assemble their platforms into meaningful stacks that developers can put to use. &nbsp;While each BaaS provider has their own approach, a handful of common building blocks emerge, allowing a coherent definition of what is a BaaS provider to emerge.</p>
<p>Using this list of common building blocks I looked to find other companies that offer similar backend services, resulting in the discovery of 45 total BaaS providers. After reviewing each BaaS provider, each feature of their offering was entered into a database--uncovering a common blueprint, of which building blocks mobile developers are seeking.</p>
<p>Over 200 building blocks have been identified in over 40 areas, across 45 BaaS providers. 37 building blocks in over 18 areas have been identified as common between at least 3 providers before they are included within my common BaaS blueprint.</p>
<p>This common BaaS blueprint represents one potential blueprint for using APIs, that are just not about consuming single API for a mobile app, but aggregating them to improve the overall delivery, management and life-cycle of mobile applications.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p>The approaches to BaaS pricing are still evolving. &nbsp;Most of the providers have gone with an API call or storage cost approach to pricing, but there still is much debate about just which pricing model is most beneficial to developers and will ensure BaaS providers are profitable.</p>
<p>The struggle in BaaS pricing reflects a struggle between BaaS platform providers covering their costs, while generating a profit for investor,s and the demands of developers who are often needing to start with a freemium tier, but may have radically different needs once their applications are in production, serving potentially hundreds or thousands of users.</p>
<p>Today, you see most BaaS providers pricing reflect the platform in which they are built on. &nbsp;Many of the current BaaS providers operate on Amazon Web Services, so the BaaS pricing is currently reflecting their upfront platform costs, compute and storage.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
        <p>The mobile app development space has grown into such an opportunity, it has begun to attract the attention of some of the heaviest hitters in the API space, Amazon Web Services, SalesForce and RackSpace.</p>
<p>These tech giants are evolving their approach to delivering the cloud resources so that it better meets the demands of mobile developers, &nbsp;This movement signals the beginning of consolidation in the BaaS space, and the Commoditization of many of the common BaaS building blocks.</p>
<p>While it is a positive for the space that analysts are identifying as a $7.7 billion opportunity by 2017,&nbsp;and that top players like AWS, RackSpace and SalesForce are noticing, it could point to the beginning of the end for many of the start-up BaaS providers.</p>

<h1>Backend as a Service</h1>
<p>There is an emerging trend in mobile application development, that people are calling backend as a service (BaaS), also known sometimes known as mobile backend as a service (MBaaS). With the growth in the number of mobile devices like iPhone from Apple, Android from Google, Windows Phones from Microsoft and the historic contender Blackberry, a number of BaaS providers are emerging to meet the demand for building, deploying and managing the mobile app life-cycle.</p>
<p><strong>What is BaaS?</strong></p>
<p>BaaS is an approach for providing web and mobile app developers with a way to connect their applications to backend cloud storage and processing while also providing common features such as user management, push notifications, social networking integration, and other features that mobile users demand from their apps these days.</p>
<p>This new breed of BaaS services are provided via custom software development kits (SDK) and application programming interfaces (APIs). BaaS is a relatively recent development in cloud computing, with most BaaS start-ups dating from 2011 or later. The global BaaS market is&nbsp;estimated to grow from $216.5 million in 2012 to $7.7 billion in 2017 from a <a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/baas.asp">report&nbsp;published</a> by <a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com">MarketsandMarkets</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How Does BaaS Differ From IaaS and PaaS?</strong></p>
<p>Baas has evolved out of frustration around deployment of IaaS platforms like Amazon Web Services, just to fire up a single new mobile application--accompanied with the fact that the traditional PaaS offerings have not stayed on top of what is needed for mobile developers. BaaS is about abstracting away the complexities of launching and managing your own infrastructure, then bridging a stack of meaningful resources targeting exactly what developers need to build the next generation of mobile apps.</p>
<p>BaaS, has a lot of the same intent as PaaS, to speed up the application development process, but BaaS is purely a backend, providing an infrastructure that automatically scales and optimizes, bundled with a set of essential resources developers require, like content, data, messaging tools and all best 3rd party, API driven services they are used to like Facebook, Twitter and Dropbox. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Are The Benefits of <strong>BaaS</strong>?</strong></p>
<p>BaaS is all about making developers lives easier. BaaS is born out of a shortage of mobile developer talent and an overwhelming demand for high quality mobile apps, not just on iOS, but across Android, Windows and Blackberry devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>BaaS Delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiency Gains</strong> - Reducing overhead in all aspects of mobile app development, increasing efficiency at all stages of development</li>
<li><strong>Faster Times to Market </strong>- Reducing the obstacles to take a mobile app from idea to production and overhead with operations once in production</li>
<li><strong>App Delivery With Fewer Resources</strong> - BaaS supports development with fewer developers and supporting data and IT resources</li>
<li><strong>Optimize for Mobile and Tablets</strong> - BaaS providers have put a lot of time and resources into optimization of data and network for mobile apps, and reduce fragmentation problems across multiple platforms and devices.</li>
<li><strong>Secure and Scalable Infrastructure </strong>- BaaS provides a bundled infrastructure that deals with scalability, security, performance and other operational headaches, leaving developers to do what they do best</li>
<li><strong>Stack of Common API resources</strong> - BaaS brings common and essential 3rd party API resources into a single stack, preventing developers from having to go gather them separately</li>
</ul>
<p>BaaS tends to reflect what is consider to be a no-ops development environment that allows companies and developers focus just on building the best applications with the most unique feature set. &nbsp;All of the infrastructure deployment and management that is historically associated with developing applications is abstracted away into a single backend platform.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Build With BaaS?</strong></p>
<p>While BaaS is primarily focused on mobile application development, the approach has characteristics that can easily be used across multiple areas of development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Development</strong> - While BaaS is focused on mobile application development, it provides a much more flexible approach to development web applications. It provides all the opportunity of PaaS, with less interface restrictions, just a meaningful stack of resources to build &nbsp;variety of web apps.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Apps</strong> - BaaS is designed with developing mobile apps in mind. &nbsp;BaaS providers are focusing on optimizing data for mobile, bringing together essential resources like geo-location, social, places and other critical elements of mobile apps.</li>
<li><strong>Readers -</strong> Publishing to Kindle and other devices that are intended to support the world of book and magazine publishing. &nbsp;Devices like Kindle, Nook and other healthcare or education specific devices are emerging and being driven by BaaS</li>
<li><strong>Launch APIs </strong>- BaaS platforms provide easy to deploy API frameworks as part of their data and object stores. BaaS provides a quick way to launch APIs and other infrastructure around data and resources, potentially making it available to mobile or web developers</li>
</ul>
<p>What is possible with BaaS varies depending on the platform provider, but we are starting to see some common building blocks emerge from the 40+ BaaS providers on the landscape currently.</p>
<p>BaaS is a natural response to software development being moved into the cloud, and the decoupling of common resources into individual APIs. &nbsp;In 2013 we know we need our platforms to perform and scale in the cloud, while bringing the resources we depend on into meaningful sets that we can efficiently build apps around, without having to go gather them from around the web.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 May 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-lane-in-api-we-trust.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I sent three emails this morning to people, explaining what it is that I do and how they can get involved. This process reminded me that I need to do the same here via the blog on a regular basis, to help people understand what API Evangelist is, and my vision for it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite popular belief I do not evangelize any single API to developers, my role (self-appointed) is to evangelize <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> APIs to the masses, most importantly beyond the developer community--penetrating business, marketing and other key groups.</p>
<p>At API Evangelist I monitor the entire API space. To do this I track on 2000 of the best of the APIs out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've gone through the entire <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb Directory</a> and hand pick the ones that are worth paying attention to, and I continue doing this in real-time as they are added. Its not that the rest aren't worthy of use, just not an approach I feel is worth showcasing to other API owners.</p>
<p>700+ of these APIs have blogs, 1000+ have Twitter accounts and many have Github accounts. I monitor all in real time. I also track on 250+ blog feeds from mainstream tech blogs (TC, Gigaom, etc) as well as lesser known feeds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I watch all this in real-time and tag everything using a centralized system I've developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I derive my blog posts and generate what I call my&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/"><span class="s1">API Stack</span></a>. The API Stack isn't meant to be a definitive list of who are the best, in a single order, but a living stack of which APIs are worth paying attention to, and are doing innovative things on a week to week basis.</p>
<p>I generate The API Stack using my home grown ranking system which is based upon 3 types of signals:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;- Number of blog posts, tweets, github repos and other internal activity from the APIs themselves</li>
<li><strong>External -</strong>&nbsp;@mentions of twitter, stack exchange, hacker news, tech blogosopher, github repo follwers and activity</li>
<li><strong>Analsyst -</strong>&nbsp;My curation, flagging w/ notes, voting up and writing stories about an API or company</li>
</ul>
<p>From all of this weekly process I have carved several areas I focus deeper on:</p>

<p>These areas will evolve and grow as my research continues and the space changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;From all of this research I produce short form analysis (blog posts, project sites) and long form content (whitepapers, books).&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep things simple I provide a single standard monthly subscription to partners wishing to access of all this for $1500.00 / month.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li class="li4"><strong>Writing&nbsp;</strong>- Access to all of my long form content.&nbsp;&nbsp;White papers, research, etc.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Data</strong>&nbsp;- I generate a lot of data exhaust tracking, ranking and curating the API space.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have JSON data available across all aspects of my work.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Logo</strong>&nbsp;- Placement of maximum 250px width logo on right hand menu of API Evangelist properties.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>4 Consulting Hours</strong>&nbsp;- Four hours of conversation via phone, skype or hangout each month.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Keywords</strong>&nbsp;- Your company name plus one other keyword or key phrase of choice which will link to URL of your choice.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Weekly / Monthly Summary -</strong>&nbsp;I produce a weekly and monthly summary of the top APIs and industries, with curated news and my analysis from the API industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>This monthly subscription provides access to all research, data and writing I produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm willing to negotiate other relationships, but this helps me keep a nice pool of clients, and me knowing I'll be in operation next month.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps me focused on research and not chasing new customers all the time.</p>
<p>Sometimes I also do specific industry research looking for patterns and opportunities as well going deeper by targeting specific APIs, like Twitter or Twillio, but I try to keep targeted research feeding into my overall pool of industry data, providing value to the bigger picture and overall space.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you understand what it is I do, and if you'd like to get involved, feel free to reach out.</p>

<p>I am tracking on 2000 APIs that I have deemed worthy enough to pay attention, out of the 9000 on <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, 13,000 in <a href="http://apihub.com">APIHub</a> and numerous APIs in <a href="http://mashape.com">Mashape's marketplace</a>.  In addition to these APIs, I'm also closely watching <a title="backend as a service providers" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">30+ backend as a service providers</a>, <a title="reciprocity providers" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">20+ reciprocity providers</a> and emerging big data, analysis, visualization and other emerging platforms who are using APIs in new ways.</p>
<p>I was reading some of the great research coming out of <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank">OPENi</a>, which is a "Open-Source, Web-Based, Framework for Integrating Applications with Cloud-based Services and Personal Cloudlets"--specifically the post on <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/openi-api-framework-part-i-studying-the-landscape-of-cloud-based-services/">OpenI API Framework: Studying the Landscape of Cloud-Based Services</a>.</p>
<p>What is great about OPENi, is they are doing all this research and planning, and sharing the process with everyone publicly.  Which is great for everyone, but will take some time to play out, as they study, plan and execute in the space.</p>
<p>As I watch aggregate API providers like <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> plow forward and reciprocity providers like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> deliver some amazing integrations, using APIs, and bridging some of the most meaningful cloud platforms in our world--I can't help but think about how much redundant work is going on amongst startups.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/openi-api-framework-part-i-studying-the-landscape-of-cloud-based-services/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/openi/OPENi-Blog-API1.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to the definitions of specific APIs, the nuances of their interface and authentication, each of these service providers is doing their own work, in a silo. In a perfect world, API providers would provide Swagger definitions, standard oAuth implementations, etc.  API owners would do a lot of the legwork for these providers. &nbsp;As we know, this isn't the reality, and each of these aggegrators, reciprocity providers, analytics tools are all mapping these API connections on their own.</p>
<p>I can't help but think about, how if providers stepped up, communicated with each other, they could establish some sort of commons for all of these API definitions to reside. &nbsp;They could colloaborately develop a way they could identify the meaningful APIs, hang Swagger definitions and code for connecting and authenticating in a multitude of programming languages.</p>
<p>Each provider could still maintain their secret sauce, what happens before and after each API connection, allowing them to have their own unique approach to API aggregation, reciprocity, analysis, visualization or real-time tools. But by sharing the API definitions and working together on the connections, they could spend more time on what makes their companies unique, rather than hand-rolling each API connection in isolation.</p>
<p>Just some random thoughts, as I navigate the world of APIs, from within my own silo!</p>

<p>Hey everyone.  I'm heading out to the Dallas-Fort Worth area the week after next, Tuesday, May 14, to kick off the <a title="DFW API Professional Meetup Group" href="http://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/">DFW API Professionals Meetup</a>.</p>
<p><a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://therightapi.com">TheRightAPI</a>&nbsp;team were so kind to invite me out to speak, hang out and talk APIs, to help kick-off the area API group. Both&nbsp;<a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://therightapi.com">TheRightAPI</a>&nbsp;and backend as a service (BaaS) provider <a href="http://www.proxomo.com/">Proxomo</a> are sponsoring the shindig.</p>
<p>The group will be meeting at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=7000+Texas+161%2C+Irving%2C+TX">Microsoft Campus, 7000 Texas 161, Irving, TX</a>.  We are thinking we'll kick it off with food and drinks from 6:00 - 6:45 PM, and I'll start talking around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>After that we can just hang out and talk about APIs and see what all y'all are doing with APIs in Texas.  Ping me if your in the DFW area, so that I know you will be there.</p>
<p>Look forward to seeing you there and connecting.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 May 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/freemium-customers.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had a question from an API owner land in my inbox.  It is regarding the amount of attention and resources that should be spent on on-boarding new customers.  Directly from the email:</p>
<blockquote><em>How would you suggest companies place a quantifiable value on free API users?  I know that it is very important to have a lot of people use your API so that they can make great things with your API and also give people a chance to really understand the value of what the API offers, but do you have any thoughts on how companies should decide how much to spend on an API conversion (AdWords, Hackathons, etc.)</em></blockquote>
<p>Let's first address the freemium part of the question.  It is my opinion that every API should have a freemium layer.  But only as one part of a well planned developer incentive ladder.  This freemium tier is the top layer of your funnel.  It will provide a way for people to test drive your API, understand what it does and the value it can deliver in their world.</p>
<p>Your freemium layer should be easy to access, no billing required and provide a sensible access to your API resources--also your freemium tier should never appear as if it is in danger of going away. &nbsp;But freemium should be that first step, with clear, meaningful next steps towards on-boarding users as paid customers.  Provide clear paths to becoming a solid, revenue generating and contributing participant in the platform.</p>
<p>Make it clear to developers that at a freemium level they don't get support, that they have to pay to get that.  Don't let this tier of users dominate you.  With this said you better have good docs, code samples, active forum, FAQ and other essential building blocks for your self-service, freemium customers to use.  But the amount of resources dedicated to your freemium customers should be minimal.</p>
<p>In my opinion, your resources should go into supporting your paid tiers of customers, the one who fee your revenue model, communicate and provide feedback to your platform and deliver value to your platform and business--reciprocating the value you have provided them.  API ecosystems are a two-way street.</p>
<p>The second part of the question I think is regarding how much resources you should spend to attract developers into the top part of your funnel, potentially bringing them into your freemium tier, with hopes of quickly converting them into paid.  I have a different perspective on this than probably many other companies.  I'm a fan of organic campaigns vs. paid campaigns.</p>
<p>My approach to API Evangelism is about generating organic content that will help explain what an API does and the value it delivers.  I hack PHP, Python, Ruby or mobile projects against the API. I find problems to solve, that may reflect what my target audience is trying to solve.  I just don't think very many people are ever going to look for an API. They are going to be looking for a solution to their problem, and it may just be the solution your API provides.  So advertising and traditional marketing is harder to dial in.  I prefer identifying, coding, solving the problem and telling the story that speak to the customers I'm looking for.</p>
<p>The downside of an organic API evangelism campaign is it takes time to work.  It takes months before you see anything. It is a very SEO driven approach, but it is how I've built API Evangelist over 3 years.  Its lower cost than Google Adwords spend and hackathons, but takes someone with passion and domain expertise, mad programming skills and the ability to write stories, publish to Github and work social media like kung foo master--to execute!</p>
<p>The moral of the story is, that you should spend as little as you possibly can on bringing in developers into your funnel, and supporting them in operating at your freemium tier.  Don't let the freeloaders rule your world.  But this is easier said than done.  Its a lot of work to generate resources that will bring the right customer in the door, in an organic way, and it <a href="/2012/09/18/simple-api-developer-tracking-framework/">takes a lot of outreach to engage with the customers</a> you have in the door to develop a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">sensible developer and partner framework</a>.</p>
<p>I think I have several more stories to derive from this great question, so stay tuned.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://parse.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/parse-cloud.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I don't personally use <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a> or any other <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">backend as a service</a> (BaaS) provider to build mobile applications.  I'm just playing role as analyst when it comes to the backend as a service space, but I am a developer so I can tell when any technology provider is speaking to developers or just marketing and hock'n their wares.</p>
<p>Each week I monitor the tech blogosphere, the API space and where it has expanded into the backend as a service space and driving mobile development.  I pull 300 + feeds from random blogs and 700+ feeds from APIs providers.  I see the contrast between what Techrunch, GigaOm and NextWeb produce alongside what API and BaaS providers publish to their blogs.</p>
<p>Day after day you can really start smelling the bullshit. The positive side is that this high profile bullshit really makes good quality posts, that are actually about solving problems, stand out.</p>
<p>I see a lot of posts come out of BaaS providers, and day after day, Parse is producing high quality posts, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/04/29/versioning-and-verification-for-your-aws-security-group-configuration/">Versioning and Verification for your AWS Security Group Configuration</a> and <a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/04/09/six-creative-ways-to-use-push-notification-marketing-in-your-mobile-app/">Six Creative Ways to Use Push Notification Marketing in Your Mobile App</a>.  When you read their blog, it is mostly posts that are about solving problems that developers are facing, and goes beyond just using Parse.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons Parse was an attractive investment for Facebook, but I think the Parse blog is a very positive signal that Parse is more than just about building a company for acquisition--Parse is building a platform that solves developers problems. Another important aspect of this, is they tell the story of how they do this in real-time. &nbsp;Without telling the story, you can be doing some amazing things and nobody will know about it--Parse gets this.</p>
<p>Another sign of Parse's conviction, is the blog post rhythm hasn't changed since the acquisition of Facebook. I get the feeling that I will continue showcasing Parse's approach, much like I have done with Twilio, because they just get it.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-lane-in-api-we-trust-trimmed.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>Listening to an episode of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a> yesterday, renewed a concept that John Sheehan(<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), founder of <a title="Runscope" href="https://www.runscope.com/signin?next=%2F">Runscope</a> made in an <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/03/12/apis-are-dead-long-live-apis/?fromcat=all">article he wrote for NextWeb back in March</a>. In the post, John walks us through his &ldquo;Three Commandments for Using Someone Else&rsquo;s API&rdquo;, which, after listening to him talk about his story on <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/post/46485798823/episode-8-im-going-to-withdraw-my-objection">Episode 8 of Traffic and Weather</a>, I couldn't stop thinking about commandment #2:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Thou Shalt Not Forego Talking to a Person</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>An open API is a great way to test drive an integration, but it does not absolve you from the responsibility of building a relationship with the provider. If you can&rsquo;t reach someone, that should be all the reason you need not to use that API.</p>
<p>This commandment comes out of Johns unique experience which spans:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twilio - Experience managing large, successful developer ecosystem</li>
<li>IFTTT - Experience being consumer of not just one, but many APIs</li>
<li>Runscope - Providing tools that make API developers lives easier</li>
</ul>
<p>This experiences is what make John&rsquo;s perspective unique.  He doesn&rsquo;t just understand delivering APIs and managing developers, he knows what it is like to be a developer and consumer of APIs.  Which I think makes him either just the right balance or he&rsquo;s his own worst enemy, not sure--could be both.</p>
<p>Anyways, regarding John&rsquo;s commandment: <em>Thou Shalt Not Forego Talking to a Person</em>.  In the past I have put a lot of pressure on API providers to consider <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">different potential layers of their API ecosystem</a>, and work hard to have a consistent approach to communicating, supporting and engaging with your developer ecosystem.  While this all holds true, and API owners should focus on healthy developer outreach, it is a two sided coin, in which developers are accountable too.</p>
<p>The target audience for API Evangelist is API owners, so I guess my point is that as an API owner you have to craft a healthy communication and support framework, but also explain to developers when they sign up or are getting started, that while you&rsquo;ll work to support them, it is up to them to step up and meet you halfway.</p>
<p>In the hype fueled tech blogosphere it's easy to take sides, rather than actually discuss the nuances of API ecosystems, and give sustainable advice--something that only comes from domain experts like John Sheehan.</p>

<p>Have you taken a moment and looked at the APIs AT&amp;T is offering through their <a href="http://developer.att.com/">developer program</a> lately? I think it is an interesting spread of API resources for a leading telco to offer, and is very telling about their strategy.</p>
<p>This is one thing I like about my API monitoring platform, is that I'm forced to dive deeper into companies that are ubiquitous in the space, and make sure I'm kep in tune with where they are actually going.</p>
<p>I thought <a href="https://developer.att.com/developer/basicTemplate.jsp?passedItemId=12500043">AT&amp;T's API catalog</a> was interesting in its current state:</p>

<p>Some of the APIs they offer are pretty straightforward like MMS, SMS, Location and Speech. &nbsp;But the TV, Healthcare, Notary and even advertising seem like they are from a different planet. Which is a signal in itself I think.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T pops up on my radar a lot because of their presence at hackathons, and coverage in the blogosphere. &nbsp;I'd like to make more time to dissect AT&amp;T's approach to APIs from an outside perspective. I think there is a lot to learn from their strategy, both good and bad. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned...</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><a href="/trends/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/trends.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I study the API space.  I want to understand how we got where we are at, and try to understand where we are going with our usage of APIs.  To do this I monitor the best of the existing and new APis, using the blogosphere, Twitter, LinkedIn, Github and the open web looking for examples of how people are using APIs in different ways.</p>
<p>Currently I monitor the blogs of 804 API related companies and 205 blog feeds from other news and blog sources, as well as around 1000 API twitter accounts.  As I read and curate this every day, I tag items according to a process I've evolved over 3 years of operation.  Then at the end of each week I look at which tags are trending for the week, based upon what I've written and other news items I've curated along the way.</p>
<p>This is how I monitor trends.  When Is see a tag trending, and I feel the area is interesting or has potential, I tend to spin off the topic into its own trend area.  Now I can monitor it separately and potentially give it more attention, with the hope of finding new sources of information, companies and domain experts in this area.</p>
<p>I have done this with four main areas I've seen trending in 2013:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Aggregation</a></li>
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Backend as a Service</a></li>
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Reciprocity</a></li>
<li><a title="Aggregation" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Realtime</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the areas I've had time to isolate and spin off into their own research projects.  I have a short list of other areas I will tackle very soon, including voice, data analysis and visualization.</p>
<p>None of these project areas are concrete.  They can change at any time, becoming entirely new areas or stay as it is, and since each project is its own Github repository, it can go idle, without any impact on the overall network--leaving it open for anyone else to use the data and content available within the project.</p>
<p>I will add new trending projects as I find them and have time, as well as add news, companies, APIs, tools, services and any analysis to existing project areas.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/04/28/api-priorities/">API Priorities</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2013</span>
        <p>I spend a lot of time on API Evangelist getting excited about APIs.  Going on three years doing this, I'm getting a little more hardened in my view on what is "good" in the API space.  Along with that evolution, I'm getting my priorities in order.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/priorities.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>While I may get excited about cloud computing APIs or quantified self APIs, there are other areas I think are straight up priorities--ones that we can't ignore.  To support this I'm launching several research projects into areas I have labeled as API priorities:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Federal Government" href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Federal Government</a></li>
<li><a title="City Government APIs" href="http://city-government.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">City Government</a></li>
<li><a title="Education APIs" href="http://education.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Education</a></li>
<li><a title="Library APIs" href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Healthcare</a></li>
<li><a title="Library APIs" href="http://libraries.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Libraries</a></li>
<li><a title="University APis" href="http://university.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Universities</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These represent areas I'm actively doing research in, looking for the best APIs, tools, services, building blocks and news while also generating as much analysis and white papers as I can to help define what is going on.</p>
<p>As with all of the API Evangelist network of research projects, everything is a work in progress and represents what I have time to dive into.  If you see anything missing, or feel some priority areas are not represented, let me know.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.cfnnet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/commercial-fueling-network/commercial-fueling-network.jpg" alt="" width="170" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm always looking for easy, dead simple approaches to explaining APIs to people.  Having real world examples, that folks can relate with, go along way in helping people wrap their heads around the very abstract concepts that are APIs.</p>
<p>While going for a walk today I was thinking back when I use to build technology for my parents trucking company, when one of the fuel expenses was for <a href="http://www.cfnnet.com/" target="_blank">Commercial Fueling Network</a> (CFN), which is a self-service commercial fueling station.</p>
<p>Whether your a long haul trucker or local contractor, you can use CFN to get at an essential resource for your business, whatever the application. Any business can apply and join CFN, get a "key" to access fuel resources in a self-service way.</p>
<p>APIs are the same approach to selling any "virtual" online resource, as CFN is to selling a "physical" fuel resource. CFN doesn't just put free gas alongside the road for anyone to take.  They have a portal where you know to go to get your resources, providing you with a key to access the fuel resources you need.  CFN then bills you for the usage of their resource.  You can be sure CFN has extensive data on how much fuel they sell and who it was sold to.</p>
<p>With virtual resources, whether you are a iPhone developer or website developer you can use APIs to get at essential resources you will need for your business, whatever the type of applications you are developing. &nbsp;Any developer can apply to use an API, and get a "key" to access the resources in a self-service way.</p>
<p>The best part about the online approach is you can turn ANYTHING into a resource.  Your resource can be data in a database, specialized code you've developed or interact with anything in the physical world.</p>
<p>This example works well for helping people to understand how APIs work, by using a real world example they may have experience with.  The best thing is, you can continue evolving this example by talking about the payment APIs used to process credit cards while fueling or the usage of APIs to interface with accounting or other administrative systems for businesses who use CFN.</p>
<p>I'm adding this to my list of white papers and see if I can create a more polished version of it.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/services/universe-expansion.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>As the universe of APIs expands, I&rsquo;m working to find new ways that I can discover, educate myself, then organize information around the most meaningful areas in the API space.  As part of this effort I&rsquo;m reorganizing <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> site into a network of small story groups, so that I can focus on a specific piece of this expanding API universe.</p>
<p>Each portion of API Evangelist will run using what I call my <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com" target="_blank">Hacker Storytelling</a> format, where I use Github Page, Jekyll along with a variety of JSON driven widgets that tell a story around a specific topic.</p>
<p>The first story group I&rsquo;m tackling is redefining two of my main sections which I had called <em>&ldquo;service provider&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;tools&rdquo;</em>. My original intent was to find resources people could use to deploy APIs, and if it was an online service I put it in service providers and if you could download and install, it went under tools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m abandoning this approach and dismantling these sections and breaking them into goal oriented stories:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Design</a></li>
<li><a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Deployment</a></li>
<li><a title="API Managemet" href="http://management.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Management</a></li>
<li>Evangelism</li>
<li>Monetization</li>
<li><a title="API Discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Discovery</a></li>
<li>Consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't have evangelism, monetization or consumption ready to go yet, but design, deployment, management and discovery are coming together nicely. You will be able to get at news, analysis, services and tools within these areas, as well as some overall thoughts about each area of the API universe.</p>
<p>I'm doing this to help me focus on each aspect of the API space, allowing me to see just the news and the best of the companies who are active in that area. This approach really helps me curate and write very focused stories and white papers that serve each topic. I hope it offers similar value for you.</p>
<p>My objective is to allow people to find information from two main areas, either using APIs or providing APIs. You can then navigate to individual areas within those two goal areas, with some overlap between them. In addition to toolkits for using or providing APIs, I'm also rolling out other story groups in the areas of API trends, priorities and opportunities.</p>
<p>So stay tuned&hellip;<a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> is always a living research project.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/04/26/apis-the-federal-government/">APIs &amp; The Federal Government</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Building-a-21st-century-platform-to-better-serve-the-american-people-1.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It is has been a while since I updated any of my research around APIs &amp; the Federal Government.  In May 2012, I started monitoring the progress of the White House Digital Strategy, where I setup a <a href="/federal_government.php">monitoring system that pings all 246 agencies</a> to see if they have published their digital strategy yet.</p>
<p>As we approach the one year anniversary, I expect we'll see a lot more news emerge around what various agencies are doing as part of the original mandate by the White House.  As of today there are now 23 federal agencies who have published their Digital Strategy at their domain.</p>
<p>I have published <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">all of my research around my APIs &amp; the Federal Government research at a permanent Github repository</a>.  I will continue pushing all my research, curated stories and analysis there in real-time.  I have also published a handful of JSON data sets I have generated as part of the research:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-with-social.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Social</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-digital-strategy.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/blob/gh-pages/data/federal-agencies-digital-strategy-with-social.json">Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy &amp; Social</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the JSON data for these areas, along with the PHP script I used to harvest, store and publish this data using the JSON version of each agencies Digital Strategy.</p>
<p>While you can pull a list of federal agencies via <span>from the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/index.shtml" target="_blank">Federal Agency Directory API</a><span>, and each agencies social data using the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml" target="_blank">Federal Social Media Registry API</a>, the logos included with each agency is something I hand-rolled, so you won't find it anywhere other than here. &nbsp;I gave the data to the GSA, and I hope they incorporate the agency logos into the Federal Agency Directory API.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">Federal Government Github project</a> will be a permanent, living place for me to publish stories, news, data and the scripts I create around my research in the area.  I'm using my <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format to keep everything up to date, openly licensed, while also keeping everything machine readable by default.</p>
<p>I'm categorizing this project under "API Priorities".  It is a critical area that we need as many people involved as possible.  If you need an idea for a project, let me know.  I have endless ideas to suggest on how we can evolve our government using open data and APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hundred-dollar-bills.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>There was a lot of buzz in the API space over the last two weeks.  I'm not a big on being first with news from the world of APIs, I leave this approach to the tech blogs like Techcrunch, RWW, GigaOm, The Next Web and others.  I'd rather simmer on things for a bit, think beyond the press release, and craft a post that offers value beyond the initial announcement and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churnalism">churnalism</a>.</p>
<p>To get everyone up to speed,  four major things happened in the API space over the last two weeks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/04/17/intel-acquires-mashery">Intel Buys Mashery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ca.com/us/content/Integration/Layer-7-Technologies.aspx">Computer Associates Buys Layer 7 Technologies</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2013/04/23/programmableweb-joins-mulesoft/">MuleSoft Acquires ProgrammableWeb</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.3scale.net/2013/04/thank-you-to-investors-and-customers/">3Scale gets $4.2M in Funding</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no arguing that these are some pretty significant signs the API industry is picking up the pace, especially when you have companies like Intel and Computer Associates taking notice and making investments.  I've been tracking on the space for 3 years now, with round-ups of API service providers in <a title="API Service Providers 2011" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/">2011</a> and <a href="/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">2012</a>. For 2010, 2011 it was all an uphill battle, but in 2012 I started seeing things heat up with the <a href="/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">introduction of several new API service providers</a>,&nbsp;then really stepping up in November 2012 with the <a href="/2012/11/13/axway-acquires-api-management-service-provider-vordel/">acquisition of Vordel by Axway</a>. But, the last couple of weeks are pretty outstanding, with not just acquisition of two separate API service providers, but also the fact that one of them is API pioneer Mashery, being purchased by chipmaker Intel.  Love or hate Mashery, they help define the space and have been at it a while a while, and we all have an industry, partly due to their work.</p>
<h3>VC Cycles More Than API Cycles</h3>
<p>Personally I feel the recent acquisitions are indeed positive signals for the industry, but I think they are also just part of the natural cycle that is set in motion by the types of businesses, companies like Mashery and Layer 7 are looking to build. These are companies that are designed for an exit, an with Mashery raising almost $40M, after multiple rounds, as well as Layer7 at $20M, with just a handful of rounds.  I don't do predictions, but I would say that Apigee is next with their $70M, in a Series E round.  Any takers IBM?  AT&amp;T? Oracle? &nbsp;The signals are more that these companies are ripe for picking, than it is a sign that the API space is booming.</p>
<h3>The Enterprise Opportunity</h3>
<p>The acquisitions of&nbsp;Vordel, Mashery and Layer7 tell me that the enterprise is interested in APIs, whether it is for mobile, big data or the internet of things--the enterprise wants in. Duh?  That really isn't much of a signal. It is logical, and if you are building an API service provider company, that is looking for an exit, you are going to build your company so that it appeals to the enterprise. It isn't really API business, it is just business. I know that this is what many of you focus on as "being the opportunity", but in the end it is just short-sighted and doesn't reflect the real potential of APIs.</p>
<h3>The API Opportunity</h3>
<p>The real opportunity in the API space is about making sure that <strong>EVERYONE</strong> can design, develop, manage, discover and consume APIs, allowing them to significantly change their company or the industry they exit in.  This is why ProgrammableWeb (PW) finding a new home at MulSsoft, and the $4.2M in funding by 3Scale excites me more than the acquisitions of Mashery or Layer 7.</p>
<p>First, ProgrammableWeb is the grandfather of API discovery, it's history and future are important to how we market our APIs as well as discover APIs for consumption, two sides of a very important coin. &nbsp;So it is critical that PW remain live and being a vibrant piece of the API industry, something I believe that MuleSoft can deliver on, in a way that makes sure PW has a signficant a role in the future of API discovery. Alcatel-Lucent was completely abandoning their API efforts and it would have been a huge blow to the space if PW went down the toilet with Alcatel-Lucent's self-destructive vision of the future.</p>
<h3>Why The 3Scale Investment is Important</h3>
<p>I know all my haters will laugh, but I think the meager $4.2M investment made in 3Scale, is truly a positive sign for the API space.  3Scale isn't building an API service provider company for an exit.  3Scale has been <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the only freemium API service provider in the space since the beginning</span>.  Over the last 3 years, I've had multiple arguments with people across the space that the API opportunity for APIs is about unlocking enterprise resources with APIs, when in reality I feel the true API opportunity is about making sure every single business, organization and government entity understands APIs, stands one up, manages, iterates and evolves it until they get it right, without spending a fortune and being locked into contracts that are ultimately about boosting the numbers of a company intent on their exit.  3Scale has been doing this for years, and the $4.2M is just enough to grow and scale to the next logical and sustainable level.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-craft/API-Craft-SFO-July-2012.png" alt="" width="335" align="right" /></p>
<p>I know the 3Scale approach it is not the sexy "startup way" or the "big numbers" that the TechCrunch and Silicon Valley audience loves, but to me it is a healthy way to approach what the API space truly needs. &nbsp;3Scale's approach to running their business, and helping people stand up and manage their APIs is a realistic, healthy and sustainable way that API owners, developers and the overall space really needs.  3Scale is profitable and sought a sensible next round of funding to do more of what they are already doing. They aren't brining in customers to boost numbers or strictly pandering to the enterprise, ultimately seeking an exit over delivering a quality product.  3Scale focuses on delivering the resources, tools and services that people need to understand and successfully manage their APIs. The sign that 3Scale can get the funding they need to keep moving forward, shows the space has a healthy edge.</p>
<h3>Meaningful Services, Tools and Educational Resources</h3>
<p>Successful acquisitions of API service providers, by large enterprises, will not define the API space as "healthy". To deliver on the OG API vision, we will need a wealth of API resources, tools and services that make APIs accessible to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYONE</span></strong>.  There will be lots of money to be made when every individual company, organization or government organization can stand-up, run and iterate and find success with APIs for whatever their personal objectives or monetization goals are.</p>
<p>There is opportunity in the API space! &nbsp;This is demonstrated by the buzz in the last couple weeks.  But lets not get distracted by the opportunity to make money and selling to the enterprise. Let's focus on the opportunity that APIs afford individuals, companies, organizations and our government, and the impact APIs can make on the end-users or customers these companies sell to, or are in service of.</p>
<p>Ubiquitous API knowledge, tools and resources represent a much bigger opportunity for everyone, beyond the big money deals that seem to catch the headlines and dominate our attention.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale and Intel are both API Evangelist partners. &nbsp;Although I have never actually taken money from 3Scale. &nbsp;Maybe things are different now that they have the big bucks!! :-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://intel.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/intel/Intel-logo.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/04/17/intel-acquires-mashery">Intel is reportedly buying API service provider Mashery for &ldquo;a range of $120 million to $180 million&rdquo;</a>, according to ReadWrite(Web). As I reflect on this, two main questions come to mind:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Was it a smart acquisition for Intel, and worth their money?</li>
<li>Is this a logical move for Intel since they are a chip maker?</li>
</ol>
<p>Was Intel&rsquo;s acquisition smart for Intel?  If they are serious about playing in the API game, which all signals I&rsquo;ve seen say yes, I think it was smart.  They didn&rsquo;t buy Mashery for their tech, although their tech was a nice add-on to <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/">Intel's existing API Gateway</a>.&nbsp;They bought Mashery to buy their market share.</p>
<p>Is the acquisition worth 120-180M?  I&rsquo;m not sure about that.  I don&rsquo;t think Masherys current market share is worth all that, so I think this is an investment in the past and the future more than current market share.  Mashery is the pioneer of the API space, owning that history has value, if you can deliver on the future of the API space.  Which I think Intel is more capable of than Mashery was all by itself.</p>
<p>Next is this a logical move for Intel?  They are maker of physical things like  motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphic chips, embedded processors, not of things virtual like APIs.</p>
<p>Intel is known for making the thing essential ingredients &ldquo;inside&rdquo; our PCs, laptops, servers, smart phones and digital devices.  They have been the driving force of &ldquo;compute&rdquo; for the last 40 years, basically my entire life.  I&rsquo;ve heard lots of chatter today that Intel moving from building the physical ingredients, to virtual APIs is too big of a switch for Intel, and they will fail.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/intel/intel-Expressway-Service-Gateway-Whiteboard.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Obviously I don&rsquo;t know shit about chip manufacturing, but if Intel wants to be the leader in the next 40 years of computing, moving from central processing units (CPU) to distributed processing units (DPU) makes sense.  In the past they have provided the computer, memory, graphics, networking and other essential elements we needed for personal, server or mobile computing.  While these elements are still relevant at the physical level, compute has moved into the clouds and when it comes to the components or resources we will need to deliver the next generation of laptop, tablet, mobile, server, automobile or anything in the realm of Internet of Things, you will need hardened and secure API compute resources.</p>
<p>Intel will not be building and deploying APIs for fun and games on the Internet.  Intel will be the gateway of the essential resources that are driving our mobile apps like SMS, voice, video encoding, etc, all the way to vital healthcare, climate monitoring and military grade API resources that will drive everything from the private sector to governments and NGOs worldwide.</p>
<p>I feel the Intel vision of APIs won&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t apply to all aspects of web APIs, open data, and various aspects of the open web. But I think Intel has what it takes to deliver the hardened and secure compute resources we are going to need to drive the next 40 years of web enabled technology.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Intel is a partner of API Evangelist and Mashery has never been a partner of API Evangelist. :-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/person-building-blocks.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>On a regular basis I review my API consumption to evaluate how I&rsquo;m using various APIs, and what I&rsquo;m paying for them.   <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/02/the-apis-that-i-depend-on-for-my-business/">I depend on around 20 APIs to make API Evangelist work</a>, and I need to make sure I&rsquo;m using them to their fullest potential while also being mindful of budget.</p>
<p>As a part of my regular review, I am looking at the differences in pricing between three key services:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://www.fullcontact.com/developer/">FullContact API</a> -</strong> I use FullContact for all my company and individual contact intelligence.  I go through phases of light or heavy use depending on research projects I have going on.  Full Contact provides me with per API call rates depending on the endpoint and call volume, and they limit me between four packages Trying It out (Free), Getting Started ($19/month), Gaining Traction ($99/month) and Rolling ($499/month)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/">Alchemy API</a> -</strong> I use Alchemy API to primarily pull text content from blog posts, so I can use it internally for indexing.  With Alchemy I get access to three packages Free, Small Business ($250.00) and Basic ($800.00)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS APIs</a> -</strong> I use AWS for all my computer, storage, database and DNS API services.  With AWS I pay by the resource, bandwidth transfer and storage and the other parts and pieces or specific actions in cloud computing.  There are no packages, just modular API resources I use and get billed for.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m just one use case, but figured I&rsquo;d share my thoughts on how I use these three API resources within my little world.</p>
<p>For Full Contact the jump from $19/month to $99/month isn&rsquo;t too bad.  I&rsquo;ll lump all my processing together into a single month and get lots of work done.  So I tend to toggle each month between these two tiers based upon my needs.</p>
<p>For Alchemy API I operate within the free tier and stick with the rate limit of 1,000 API calls per day.  If a blog post doesn&rsquo;t get pulled because I hit my limit, I queue it for another day when I have room within my daily limit.   The jump from zero to $250.00 / month is really just too big of a jump for me to make.</p>
<p>My Amazon Web Services bill runs between $250.00 and $1,000.00 / month.  Depending on how much traffic, harvesting, processing and other crazy stuff I&rsquo;m doing.  I have a buffet of compute, storage, database, IP address, monitoring,DNS and other cloud computing modules that I have developed and associated with pricing in my head, so that I can make decisions in the moment about whether I can afford to process a bunch of data, launch new API, website etc.</p>
<p>I have a few good friends in the API space that feel API rate limits stimulate creativity, innovation and work-arounds.  I agree with that statement, and think every API has to understand its own consumer and make the decision they feel is best.  But in the end, I personally like single API resource pricing based upon units, that I can scale infinitely as needed in any moment.  I&rsquo;m am more likely to integrate services into my world when they are independent bite size chunks, with pricing not restricted by other services or service tiers.  Each module tends to have different value in my world and I like to make independent decisions about how to use just that resource, disconnected from all the other resources.</p>
<p>The world is starting to look different when I depend on 10-20 APIs vs 1-2 APIs, and I can imagine when I reach the point where I'm depending on 100-200 APIs I will have an even greater need to have API resources be priced independent of other services or limiting pricing tiers. &nbsp;</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/04/17/conflicting-emotions-about-api-providers/">Conflicting Emotions About API Providers</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/conflict-with-myself.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a walking conflict most of the time.  You should try being me, it can be tense about 40% of the time.   I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of example of what I mean to help bring you a little closer to what I experience each day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with what I consider to be the 2nd most important API of all time (#1 being AWS), Twitter.  I love / hate Twitter.  They really deliver on everything around their API except in regards to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Rate Limits</strong> - Their rate limits suck!</li>
<li><strong>Competition</strong> - They don&rsquo;t approach potential competition sensibly</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - They aren&rsquo;t good communicators</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than those three <em>"simple areas"</em>, Twitter delivers a damn good API.  I find it very hard to criticize what they do, except for the fact that having suffocating rate limits, and shutting off access for integrations you view as competitive, can well, be a pretty quick downer.</p>
<p>An example of Twitter in action is with their recent post about <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/symbols-entities-tweets">Symbols entities for Tweets</a>.  I love this idea, I&rsquo;m working through thoughts that are similar, when it comes to <a href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">markup APIs or what I&rsquo;m calling dictionary APIs</a>.  I think that a dictionary, symbol or other lookup functionality around an API is cool and has a lot of potential...right up until the point you realize they are have been <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/07/30/why-isnt-the-ftc-looking-into-twitters-increasingly-anti-competitive-practices/">sharecropping a lot of this innovation from the Twitter Ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, I just have to live at odds with the way I feel about Twitter.  I can&rsquo;t stop showcasing the cool stuff they are doing, just because I do not agree with their approach to API rate limits, communication, competition and sharecropping (or is it cropdusting?)</p>
<p>Another similar conflict in my life is around the <a title="Pearson API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/apis">Pearson API</a>.  As a company I&rsquo;m not 100% in agreement with what Pearson is up to, but from an API perspective, I am a big fan of the companies approach.  They follow what I consider to be a lot of the best practice for the space, and have a model API program I think other publishers should follow.  This canyon is made even wider by the fact I live and work with <a href="http://hackeducation.com">notorious ed-tech trouble maker Audrey Watters</a> who is not shy about sharing her hatred of Pearson.</p>
<p>In the end, I think my inner conflicts make for a better lense to see the API space through.  I will keep sharing the good, the bad and the ugly as I see it.  I really believe that Twitter is the second most important API around, and I can&rsquo;t help but showcase what they are doing, while also holding them up as them up as the poster child of how to do it both right and wrong at the same time!</p>

<p>The ability for me to own <a href="/admin/blog/kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a>, point it at a server, host a website and a blog has been an critical part of my online world and professional career for over 12 years now.  My blog goes back to June of 2007, but I have had a site and portfolio up there since around 2000.  Having control over my domain has enabled me to store years of my writing, research and projects in a central location that I have control over, allowing me to land jobs, contracts or evolve into entirely new domains that have expanded my audience in ways I never imagined, like with&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<p>Anytime I can teach this approach to someone else and empower them to own their own domain, I&rsquo;ve jumped at the chance, resulting in numerous individuals who have their own thriving domains--including my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://audrewyatters.com">Audrey Watters</a> with her blog <a title="Hack Education" href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>.  Understanding what is necessary to purchase, own and manage your domain, servers, sites, applications and other portions of our digital lives is something everyone should do! But be careful, you just might change the world, and make a significant impact like Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audrewyatters</a>) has.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/reclaimyourdomain/mit-media-lab-phillip.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Last weekend while at MIT, I had a chance to work on a project that takes this concept of owning your domain and looks to make it an educational resource anyone can take advantage of.  I ended up at the MIT Media Lab after being summoned for an&nbsp;<a title="open learning hackathon" href="http://open.media.mit.edu/hackathon.html">open learning hackathon</a>&nbsp;by MIT and Phillip Schmidt (<a href="https://twitter.com/schmidtphi">@schmidtphi</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="https://p2pu.org/en/">P2PU</a>. &nbsp;During the event&nbsp;I had the pleasure of plotting and scheming with infamous technology educator Jim Groom (<a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a>) and education rabble rouser Audrey Watters on an&nbsp;<a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/a-domain-of-ones-own-to-community-syndication-hubs/">idea Jim brought with him</a>, that was born out of the <a href="http://umwdomains.com/">University of Mary Washington Domain of One's Own Project</a>.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/reclaimyourdomain/kin-jim-brainstorming.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>After the hackathon was kicked off properly Friday afternoon, Jim and I spent the afternoon of whiteboarding, followed up by a quality evening of beer drinking, in which Jim, Audrey and I hatched a plan we called #ReclaimYourDomain, which would act a hub to allow anyone to easily learn about taking control over their domain, complete with the tools for actually delivering on the promise.</p>
<h3>#ReclaimYourDomain Hub</h3>
<p>Allowing users to take control of their domain will start at a centralized hub where anyone can begin learning about the nuts and bolts of domain ownership, but also find a wizard that will walk them through the sometimes confusing process.  The #ReclaimYourDomain hub is an open source platform that could be launched by a teacher or department within a school, career training center, or any other institution that would like to help individuals own their own domain, and be the central support for them until they could operate completely on their own.</p>
<p>Right now the #ReclaimYourDomain Hub will run as stand-alone service at <a title="reclaimyourdomain.org" href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org">reclaimyourdomain.org</a>, but eventually it will be available for anyone to deploy on any server.  The #ReclaimYourDomain Hub will start with a simple home and about page, but focus on a simple wizard that will walk an individual through purchasing and setting up their own online domain.</p>
<h3>#ReclaimYourDomain Wizard</h3>
<p>The focal point of#ReclaimYourDomain is a simple, six step wizard that will walk any user through owning their own domain:&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="olist">
<li><strong>Claim Your Domain</strong> - Allow users to select, purchase and setup domain</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> - Select from common resources such as a blog</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> - Where resources like a blog will be located using services like Github, Dropbox or Amazon S3 or EC2</li>
<li><strong>Details</strong> - Title, summary, photo and a full bio of the domain owner</li>
<li><strong>Contact</strong> - Provide contact information for the domain user that visitors can use to contact them</li>
<li><strong>Hello World </strong>- Something to kick off the launch of a domain like writing the first blog</li>
</ol>
<p>When done running the #ReclaimYourDomain wizard, the service will purchase a top level domain, setup a basic profile site for the user and configure the resources (like a blog), chosen during the wizard. Right now the only resource #ReclaimYourDomain will offer is a blog, but will deliver in other resource areas in the future. To start I'd like to see several definitions of what a blog is:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blog @ Local Server with Wordpress</li>
<li>Blog @ AWS EC2 Linux + Amazon RDS + Linux with Wordpress</li>
<li>Blog @ Github Pages with Jekyll</li>
<li>Blog @ Dropbox with Jekyll</li>
<li>Blog @ Amazon S3 with Jekyll</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to successfully setup a domain, landing page and blog for a user, but the mission is to educate the user about the process ,different resources, location configurations by providing a series of learning objects and migration paths which will allow users to make educated decisions about which options are best for them.  If you want to understand more about why this is important read Audrey's <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/04/11/reclaim-your-domain/">Reclaim Your Domain: A #ReclaimOpen Hackathon Project</a> and Jim's <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-open-learning/">Reclaim Open Learning</a>, located at their domain blogs.</p>
<p><a title="Brain Gears" href="http://fineartamerica.com/featured/4-brain-design-by-cogs-and-gears-setsiri-silapasuwanchai.html" target="_blank"><img style="pading: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/gears-brain.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<h3>Learning Objects</h3>
<p>With digital literacy the mission, #ReclaimYourDomain will provide a series of structured learning objects that will educate users at every step of the setup, configuration and management of their domain.</p>
<p>Learning objects will be available via a centralized help center, while also being linked individually throughout the domain setup wizard and management process so users can access whenever needed, at just the right moment.</p>
<p>As Audrey says, the goal of #RelcaimYourDomain is not just to provide an easy button for buying a domain and setting up a blog, it is to actually educate users about the process, equipping them with essential web literacy skills along the way.</p>
<h3>Domain</h3>
<p>Each #ReclaimYourDomain user will be given their own domain, complete with a static home, about and contact pages.  The domain will always provide a user with a single landing page that will represent their online persona. A #ReclaimYourDomain domain site will provide users with two key services:</p>
<p><a title="Sir Edmund Hilary - Mount Cook by Vanessa (EY), on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vanchett/424399237/"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/174/424399237_b60c7e1732.jpg" alt="Sir Edmund Hilary - Mount Cook" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Resources</strong> - The ability to add different resources like a blog, and configure what application is used and where the blog is hosted within their domain</li>
<li><strong>Links</strong> - A tool for adding titles and urls that link to existing services a user might depend on like Flickr, Facebook and LinkedIn--services that are unlikely to ever be hosted as a local resource</li>
</ul>
<p>#ReclaimYourDomain is designed to educate users about all the services we depend on, while providing the knowledge and tools to incrementally take control over their:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Online Domain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Critical Services</strong></li>
<li><strong>Personal Data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The process of educating average Internet users about taking control of their worlds in these three essential areas is no easy task, it will be a process that will never fully be complete--requiring a constant flow of open educational resources to empower domain owners about our ever changing digital worlds.</p>
<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p>Each #ReclaimYourDomain site will have a dashboard allowing each individual to manage their details, contact information, resources and links. The dashboard will be tighlty coupled with the help center, which will provide access to all learning objects, but also provide meaningful analytics that will help users understand the activity that occurs within their domain.</p>
<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>Each #ReclaimYourDomain site will also have a programmatic layer allowing discovery of profile detail, resources and links.  The #ReclaimYourDomain user domain site will automatically generate not just an HTML home page, but an XML and JSON version providing a programmatic directory for accessing domain details, links and valuable resources like your blog RSS or Twitter accounts.</p>
<h3>Domain Modules</h3>
<p><a title="Reclaim" href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org" target="_blank"><img style="pading: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/reclaimyourdomain/puzzle-cloud-services.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>#ReclaimYourDomain will initially employ a handful of modules, but eventually could provide access to a robust library of common or niche components.  While the goal is to empower users to set up application within their domain, the platform will easily support common cloud services like Tumblr, Flickr, Evernote and others--with the intention of educating users about the pros and cons of each service, with clear migration paths between resource services and various locations.</p>
<p>Each domain module will come complete with setup, management, migration and even backup, storage and syndication options allowing each module to work independently while providing domain owners with the largest amount of control. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All domain modules will have their own learning objects to support educating users about all the parts and pieces of domain literacy, exposing the technology, business and political layers each resource and its underlying services possess. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>Currently Jim, Audrey and I have a mocked up version of <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">#ReclaimYourDomain Hub</a> and a <a href="http://template.reclaimyourdomain.org/">#ReclaimYourDomain domain site</a>. &nbsp;All the buttons and lnks work, so make sure and click around to see it in action. &nbsp;I need to gather my thoughts from the project, then I will be publishing all #ReclaimYourDomain code and a framework for planning via Github.</p>
<p>#ReclaimYourDomain is not just about setting up a domain and blog.  It is much more than that.  It is meant to be a hands on, digital literacy platform to teach anyone about reclaiming, owning and managing their online domain.</p>
<p>Giving someone the ability to own their domain can look as simple as having a place to put your thoughts via a blog, but could also evolve into an aggregate location to store and link all of a peron's projects, allowing them to be used as part of your online CV and potentially a digital badge or credential system. The possibilities are really endless. However to achieve this vision, we have to educate people about the building blocks of a domain, the importance of taking control over essential services within your domain, and asserting ownership over as much of our personal data as we possibly can, through this enlightening process.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more on #ReclaimYourDomain, and if you&rsquo;d like to get involved feel free to <a href="http://kinlane.com/contact/">contact me</a> directly or stay tuned and I&rsquo;ll have the Github project up shortly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Studio Sketchpad" href="http://studio.sketchpad.cc/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/studio-sketchpad/studeio-sketchpad-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote yesterday&rsquo;s piece on <a href="/2013/04/09/api-education-with-codecademy/">API education with Codecademy</a> back in February.  I didn&rsquo;t publish because I wanted to do more research on suggested areas of improvement for the Codecademy team to balance my criticism.</p>
<p>The point of yesterday's post was not to bash Codecademy, it is to incentivize them to make their platform better.  Until then, I can't really recommend as an <a title="API Building Block" href="/buildingblocks/">API building block</a>.</p>
<p>The publishing of my post yesterday was triggered after seeing an example of what is possible after seeing another learn to code platform called <a title="Studio Sketchpad" href="http://studio.sketchpad.cc/" target="_blank">Studio Sketchpad</a> by Ari Bader-Natal (<a href="https://twitter.com/studiosketchpad">@studiosketchpad</a>).  Studio Sketchpad is an open studio platform for creating beautiful code, aiming to be a open studio for individuals learning to sketch beautiful code on the web canvas--built on a mashup of the Sketch from <a title="Processing" href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing</a> and the Pad from <a href="http://etherpad.com/">EtherPad</a>.</p>
<p>Studio Sketchpad, while still a work in progress has many of the essential elements I feel should be part of any learn to code with API tool.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Learn By Yourself</strong> - You can select lessons and learn online at your own pace</li>
<li><strong>Learn With Instructor </strong>- You can learn in real-time with the assistance of instructor</li>
<li><strong>Create Lessons</strong> - Instructors can build and record lessons and publish to a gallery, providing code walkthrough, with audio (using SoundCloud), complete with playback</li>
<li><strong>Cloning</strong> - You can clone a sketch (lesson) and tweek, edit and make learning more hands on</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong> - You can see the, interact and fork sketches at any point in the evolution of the script</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - You can embed the sketch within your site, allowing for use on your site</li>
<li><strong>Render</strong> - All code renders so you can see the results of the lesson and your modifications</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> - Allow you to share to your social networks</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong> - You can export code lessons to use outside of Studio Sketchpad</li>
<li><strong>Licensing</strong> - Sketches are openly licensed allowing for reuse, remix and learning</li>
</ul>
<p>I found nine additional features, beyond what is available via Codecademy.  I strongly feel both <span style="text-decoration: underline;">embeddability</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">learn with instructor</span> are critical to API education. &nbsp;My primary arguement in yesterday's post is I can&rsquo;t endorse sending our API users away to learn about an API.  API education is an hands-on, iterative process, and we have invested too much in our API ecosystems to ship our users off to boarding school.</p>
<p><a title="Studio Sketchpad" href="http://studio.sketchpad.cc/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/studio-sketchpad/studio-sketchpad-example.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Secondarily API education is not just people learning about your API, it is about you learning from your API consumers and making your API endpoints, resources and community better.  As API owners there is so much to learn through interacting with our API consumers as they learn and integrate with a platform.  API education isn&rsquo;t a one way street.</p>
<p>I understand everyone in Silicon Valley is cheering for Codecademy, but I think that we are setting the bar too low.  What Ari has created with Studio Sketchpad raises the bar, and really delivers a platform that can help people truly learn about programming.  His implementation is for learning about Canvas, and would take some work to retrofit for PHP, Python, Ruby and would need some sort of emulator to work for iOS and Android, but the important elements are all there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also concerned with where Codecademy has opted to set the bar, since they are a YCombinator company, based on the fact that the technology Studio Sketchpad is built Eitherpad has its origins in YCombinator <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=977015">before Google bought it</a>, and in its early incarnation as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppJet">AppJet</a>.  There seems to be some sort of broken feedback loop at YCombinator, and I don&rsquo;t think Codecademy is consciously ignoring the past, but I think there is a lot they can learn from their own investor's technology history, our <a href="http://guide.hackeducation.com/techies.php">rich history of teaching people to program</a> and some of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">proven building blocks for API support and education</a>.</p>
<p>I hope Codecademy and other platforms who are looking to teach people to use APIs receive both my posts as constructive criticism on how they can evolve their platforms to better serve not just the API consumer, but also API owners--resulting in truly helping educate the masses about the potential of APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/fist.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Last week Twitter expanded its Twitter Cards initiative to <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/04/02/looking-to-find-new-apps-twitter-adds-third-party-app-discovery-and-deep-links/">allow 3rd party app developers to include links to download apps within Tweets</a>, opening up new opportunities for app discovery via Twitter.  Yay, for app developers...</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t try to explain the <a title="history of Twitters approach to their ecosystem" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">history of Twitter's approach to their ecosystem</a>, their <a title="Twitters tight fisted approach to cards" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/13/twitter-launches-new-not-so-open-graph-aka-twitter-cards/">tight fisted approach to Twitter Cards</a>, and how it affects this latest app discovery announcement.  Matthew Ingram does an amazing job (as always) of capturing the essence with <a title="Twitter plays its platform hand, and it is the one holding all the Cards" href="http://gigaom.com/2013/04/03/twitter-plays-its-platform-hand-and-it-is-the-one-holding-all-the-cards/">Twitter plays its platform hand, and it is the one holding all the Cards</a>.</p>
<p>My point is, their announcement isn&rsquo;t that exciting. Could you imagine what would be possible if Twitter decide to actually use an open standard like <a title="Open Graph" href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a>, and allowed developers to innovate within Tweets using Twitter Cards?</p>
<p>I fully understand Twitter wants control over their platform, and I don&rsquo;t deny any platform the right to assert control.  And yes, Twitter allows their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/programs/twitter-certified-products">approved partners</a> to play in this arena.  But that isn&rsquo;t open! &nbsp;And, it isn&rsquo;t part of the OG vision that Twitter was built on.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Twitter is missing out on soooo much opportunity for innovation in the space that exists within a Tweet.  Sure, not every developer idea would be good or even viable, but without opening it up, we will never know what is possible, and what end-users would want and embrace. &nbsp;It is all up to Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So much missed opportunity for innovation, in the name of control. :-(</p>
<p><strong>Correction:</strong>&nbsp;I call Open Graph a Standard. &nbsp;I should have said protocol. &nbsp;I will leave as is, and just admit my error.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/finger-pointing.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />How To Get Your Grandma, Mother, Daughter and Sister to Understand APIs? You stop using gendered approaches when explaining what an API is.  I&rsquo;m not going to cite any of the past or recent examples of this (you know who you are). And I don&rsquo;t care <em>"how you didn&rsquo;t even mean to do this"</em>, when you wrote your API example.  There really isn&rsquo;t a line between sexism and ignorant sexism.</p>
<p>If you really want everyone to understand what an API is, provide well written, plain english examples, that are framed around solving a problem your grandma, mother, daughter or or sister will understand--using problems they truly face in their lives.</p>
<p>It really is that simple.  As long as you are using gendered terms to describe what we are doing, you are raising the barrier to entry. &nbsp;And when you do this, you are talking down to a person and making them feel small, stupid and all the other power trips that go with sexism.  And yes, those thing are still there even if you <em>"didn&rsquo;t mean to do it"</em>.</p>
<p>So let &lsquo;s make sure and keep API examples about solving problems and putting the valuable API resources to use, and not about gender, and get EVERYONE on board.</p>
<p>End of story! And if ever step over this line, call me out. I welcome it, cause I'm not perfect or exempt.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/04/09/api-education-with-codecademy/">API Education With Codecademy</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/codecademy/codecademy-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As I do with many of my stories, I&rsquo;ve been stewing on the news that online education platform Codecademy started offering API programming lessons for popular APIs like Twilio and NPR back in January.  While at first glance this seems like an important evolution in API education, I wanted to really think through all the details of API on-boarding before I passed judgement.</p>
<p>Codecademy&rsquo;s claim to fame is a pretty slick code view where you can edit your code and then a view window, which will process and run your code, letting you know if you&rsquo;ve done it right or not.  Each class is broken into several lessons, allowing you to finish at your pace, with a accompanying Q&amp;A forum, glossary and scratch pad--with a badge showing you passed the course.</p>
<p>Codecademy offers API classes for YouTube, SoundCloud, Parse, Twilio, SendGrid, NPR, Sunlight Foundation, Bitly, PlaceKitten and Stripe APIs and handful of others, with each class using Python, Ruby or JavaScript as the programming language. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Codecademy is a novel idea for helping existing developers understand the ins and outs of learning a new programming language or learning an API, using their wizard driven, code tutorials.  But it shouldn&rsquo;t be the only tool in your toolbox for helping people understand your API.</p>
<p>First I don&rsquo;t think people (especially non-developers) want to &ldquo;learn a programming language&rdquo; or want to &ldquo;learn an API&rdquo;.  In my opinion, APIs are about opening up access to resources that anyone can take advantage of, even non-developers.  Because many APIs are built on HTTP and use simple key authentication, it makes them extremely hackable and something that anyone can put to use.  I don&rsquo;t think we need to require people to be programmers to use APIs, we can allow varying grades of coders, scripters and hackers to put APIs to use to solve problems they face in their everyday worlds.</p>
<p>When looking to educate your potential consumers about your API, you should focus on some sort of project that your target audience will relate with.  I&rsquo;m assuming you have done a great deal of due diligence on the market you have entered, as well as profiled any developers who are already registered for your API.  So you have a good idea of the types of problems your API will solve and potentially how users will put it to use.  With this knowledge you should be building lessons that speak specifically to these problems, not generically &ldquo;learn your API&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Next there are plenty of established building blocks like interactive documentation, blog, forum, frequently asked questions, youtube and Twitter that you can use to build lessons that focus on specific projects or problems your known target audience will need to solve.  I just can&rsquo;t advocate sending users away from your site to learn about your API, when you already have the building blocks you need to teach them in your API area.</p>
<p>Additionally, by using existing building blocks to construct specific lessons for potential users you will receive the SEO benefit, which will draw in new users looking to solve the problems you&rsquo;ve identified.  Most users won&rsquo;t know they need to learn your API, they will be Googling that they need to solve a problem, and come across your API.  You will miss out on this if you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">solely rely</span> on an online platform like Codecademy.</p>
<p>Beyond SEO, you will deprive new users of the additional benefits provided by your API ecosystem, like direct and community support.  On Codecademy you won&rsquo;t be there to answer their questions along the way, and they won&rsquo;t be able to access the knowledge and wisdom of your existing developer community--an essential aspect of taking your API from just an area, to a community and ultimately an ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/apis" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/codecademy/codecademy-api-page.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>My objective on API Evangelist is to help API owners be successful in their API initiatives by understand the best practices to deploying and managing their APIs.  I think Codecademy is a very cool platform and if you have the resources it is something you should add to your toolbox.  But if your API team resources are short (as they are in most), you need to rely on many of the existing building blocks you have and build meaningful education material for your API that users can find and put to use within your API area, where you can make sure and support them in real-time.</p>
<p>Looking at the lessons Codecademy has, I don&rsquo;t think they have the resources to offer lessons on all the top APIs, and I think they should focus on lessons around other common building blocks that API owners could put to use educating users, such as HTTP, oAuth, JSON, etc.  I think its easy for all of us 8% alpha geeks to get excited about tools like Codecademy, but when the rubber meets the road with the mainstream I think we have to think deeper about how we approach teaching people about tech and APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Apr 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/aws-pricing.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get a lot of inquiries from API owners about how they should price their API access in a way that will make sense to developers, but also help them generate revenue from their valuable API resources.</p>
<p>As most of us are still trying to figure out sensible pricing for our new APIs, or better understand how to adjust and evolve pricing to better suit existing developers--Amazon is busy reducing their cloud API pricing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a simple email from Amazon today:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dear Amazon S3 Customer,</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We are excited to announce that we are reducing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R=2SXVU4T3VRUWB&amp;C=J2HG6JVZ1C5L&amp;H=PVA7GS7QEGLCGOTDJIF9KXXMGHEA&amp;T=C&amp;U=http%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fs3%2Fpricing%3Fref_%3Dpe_12300_29052180_8" target="_blank">Amazon S3 request prices</a>&nbsp;in all nine of our regions. We are lowering the prices for GET requests by 60% and the prices for PUT, LIST, COPY, and POST requests by 50%. For example, in the US Standard Region, we are reducing the price of every 1,000 PUT requests from $0.01 to $0.005 and the price of every 10,000 GET requests from $0.01 to $0.004.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We are happy to pass along these savings to you as we continue to drive down our costs. The new lower prices for all regions can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R=2SXVU4T3VRUWB&amp;C=J2HG6JVZ1C5L&amp;H=PXMXBBGNPMWR1VAGFSTZAJIJ7Y8A&amp;T=C&amp;U=http%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fs3%2Fpricing%3Fref_%3Dpe_12300_29052180_7" target="_blank">Amazon S3 pricing page</a>. New prices are effective April 1st and will be applied to your bill for all requests on or after this date.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Sincerely,</em><br /><em>The Amazon S3 Team</em></p>
<p>These price reductions are becoming more frequent across the numerous AWS APIs I depend on like S3, EC2 and RDS. &nbsp;I have been an S3 user since 2006 and EC2 since 2008, and I didn't see price reductions at all in the early days, but they seem to be a common part of doing business in the cloud today.</p>
<p>The obvious explanation is that competition in the cloud space is heating up, especially with Google stepping up their game, but I think there are other lessons for API owners here. That spending the time to initially develop a sensible pricing model for your API is important, but also continuing to understand how it is working for developers and how they are accessing and putting your API resources to use--which will allow you to reach a place where you know your API, developers and the space you operate so well, you can reduce pricing, while actually increasing your revenue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At some point I would like to go back and document all the AWS pricing, to see at what point they were able to have enough of an understanding to begin delivering price reductions, and also see if there are any other correlations in the market that I can identify that have coincided with their pricing decisions. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/angry-birds-are-amazing/images/32024326/title/angry-bird-photo" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/angry-bird.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming professionally since 1988, so I&rsquo;ve been around quite a few developers in my career. There seems to be a lot of moments lately that cause me to look back at this career, reassess what I've learned, and adjust the direction I'm going with this mined wisdom. &nbsp;This week I&rsquo;m reflecting on the recent insanity around Adria Richards, my role as the API Evangelist, and spending time thinking about the tech space's inclusiveness as I&rsquo;m hanging out with my 12 year old daughter for spring break.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, in just about every position I&rsquo;ve taken, whether as a programmer, manager, lead, architect and VP, I&rsquo;ve encountered developers who are challenged by me, my role, skills and approach to tech.  I can remember 3 separate roles I&rsquo;ve had where one of my first assigned tasks was to fire a developer who had made everyone&rsquo;s lives miserable, because before I came along they couldn&rsquo;t fire them (him), because they were dependent on them for their skills.</p>
<p>Quality technical talent is hard to find, and many companies can&rsquo;t afford to lose the talent they already have.  No matter what the personality defects or the workplace issues might be.  Many developers know this and work it to their advantage, taking advantage of power they possess for their own selfish goals.</p>
<p>This power struggle does not just exist between developers and non-developers.  As a programmer I encounter developers who always have to one up you, and make you feel stupid for what you don&rsquo;t know.  It might be a programming language, database platform, technical library or just the fact you use Windows vs Mac.  Some programmers can co-exist, but many feel the need to challenge others, while assuming a defensive position around their established fiefdom.</p>
<p>Outside the corporate firewall I see this behavior extended to online interactions, where programmers make non-developers feel insignificant for what they do not know, and belittle other developers for what skills they lack.  Something that often can extend into other more harmful, trollish behavior.  Developers can be quick to jump one others in an online environment,  creating very uncomfortable or hostile situations.</p>
<p>Many places I&rsquo;ve worked or contracted with, this power struggle plays itself out as the classic IT bottleneck.  IT bottlenecks are often portrayed as lack of resources, but more often than not they represent power struggles around budget, technology and other lesser evils.  Think about some of your IT interactions--is it always a shortage or resources or lack of desire to actually deliver?  It can be very hard to tell sometimes.</p>
<p>While the root of this behavior I feel is insecurity, I think ultimately it is all about power.  I also strongly believe one of the by-products of this reality is the sexism, racism and other negativity that is a systemic issue in the tech space.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/information-technology.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not writing this to say that all developers are power trippers.  They aren&rsquo;t.  But us technologists have a huge problems with wanting to be keepers of the knowledge.  I&rsquo;m not excluding myself from this.  I fall victim to the desire for power and glory.  I&rsquo;m not exempt.  But I work really, really, really hard at trying to transcend this past I share with the rest of the tech space.</p>
<p>I believe APIs are letting the IT resources out of the bag, and so is the consumerization of other areas like cloud computing, storage, email, web and mobile development, etc. APIs are bringing valuable IT resources closer to the people who can use these resources to solve problems.  I saw the opportunities around APIs playing out from 2005 through 2010, and in middle of 2010 I decided to start <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> to help spread the word to the masses about the potential of APIs--bridging a gap that has created between developers and non-developers.</p>
<p>It is very important that us technologists ground our work in the assistance of other non-technologists.  We have to work very, very, very hard at being nice and make what we do inclusive.  It isn&rsquo;t easy.  Listen to the <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/post/44802468357/episode-7-i-went-through-three-cliches-there">first couple minutes of the API podcast Traffic and Weather from the other  week</a> and you will hear how much work I put into making sure I&rsquo;m pleasant, but make an impact when engaging not only non-developers, but developers alike.  It is critical.</p>
<p>If you are a developer, please join me in making sure everything we do is as inclusive as possible for other developers, non-developers and most importantly of other sexes, races and anyone we encounter in what we do.</p>

<p><a title="I read your Terms of Service is one of the biggest lies on the Internet" href="http://tosdr.org/">I read your Terms of Service is one of the biggest lies on the Internet</a>.  We agree to terms of service for each and every service we use online, without ever reading and understanding exactly what we are agreeing to.</p>
<p>This is one of the most damaging aspects of online life, as through this process we are giving away our rights, ownership of our data and allowing for our privacy to be compromised each and every day.  While not all services are abusing this, there are many online services that use this to their advantage, in an effort to maximize the amount of value they extract from their platform and end users.</p>
<p>Service providers have to go further in educating users about the terms of service they are agreeing to.  There is a great example of this in action, via an article in NextWeb called &ldquo;<a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/29/now-this-is-how-to-write-a-terms-of-service-document/">now THIS is how to write your startup&rsquo;s Terms of Service</a>&rdquo;.  The post showcases how <a href="http://heello.com/" target="_blank">real-time sharing platform Heello</a> has provided <a href="https://heello.com/terms" target="_blank">plain english descriptions, next to each &ldquo;legaleze&rdquo; paragraph in their terms of service</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://heello.com/terms" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/heello/heello-terms-of-service.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is nothing new. <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/terms_of_service">You see it with other providers like Tumblr</a>.  But I think it is a very simple enhancement to API terms of service that can have a huge effect, and begin leading us in a more healthy direction when it comes to educating end-users about the TOS they are bound to.  While companies need the protection of a legal terms of service, there is no reason you can't provide your end users with a translated, plain english version. &nbsp;It doesn't take much work, and really sets you apart from other API service providers.</p>
<p>Do you know of any other examples of online services going above and beyond to help educate end users about terms of service?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/28/the-noun-project-api/">The Noun Project API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> is <a href="http://thenounproject.com/developers/">soliciting feedback on their upcoming API</a>.  If you aren&rsquo;t familar with The Noun Project, it is a innovative visual language project, that is creating a library of icons that will enable people to visually communicate and interact around the globe. Direct from <a href="http://thenounproject.com/about/">The Noun Project about page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>Humans have been using symbols to communicate for over 17,000 years because they are the one language everyone can understand. Symbols can transcend cultural and language barriers and deliver concise information effortlessly and instantaneously. They allow people to communicate quickly, effectively, and intuitively. And for the first time ever, this language is being combined with technology to create a social language that unites the world.</em></blockquote>
<p>The Noun Project wants <a href="http://thenounproject.com/developers/">our feedback on what a Noun Project API might look like</a> and what we would use it for. &nbsp;So, I wanted to take a moment and share my thoughts, about what I would use The Noun Project API for, and some thoughts about what the endpoints might look like.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable</strong> <br />Normally an embeddable strategy for an API is in the background, relinquished to just one of the tools in the toolbox.  With the Noun Project I think a healthy embeddable strategy would be front and center, providing a wide array of buttons, badges, widgets and other items users could syndicate across the web.  The library of embeddable tools should be open for submission, much like the core of the Noun Project.  Designers could generate custom button sets, badges and other embeddables for users to choose from.  The Noun Project's embeddable strategy would make the Noun Project API accessible to everyone, even non-developers.</p>
<p><strong>Builders and IDE </strong><br />A Noun Project API would enable a next generation of mobile and web application apps, as well as other visualization and big data analysis tools to integrate consistent imagery.  Makers of integrated development environments (IDE) could provide button, icon and other UI components with a wealth of meaningful icons, that could become the new default in modern apps.  Think how Twitter bootstrap is raising the bar in overall app user interface quality?  Love it or not, Twitter Bootstrap has made things look better, and consistent use of the Noun Project images could go even further.</p>
<p><strong>Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words </strong><br />The Noun Project API would enable a wealth of text to image visualization possibilities, allowing developers to accompany and represent everyday text in much more impactful ways.  Imagine if in addition to titles and summaries, you always had a Noun Project icon to reference when reading on the web and via your favorite applications.  A couple examples might be:</p>
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project-idea.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog &amp; News Listings</strong> - Often times our blogging platforms have a way to upload an image to represent a post or story.  The Noun Project could be used as visual cues for stories in certain categories or programmable determined by the text content of a story, dynamically pulled from the Noun Project API</li>
<li><strong>Link Representations</strong> - When faced with a link, all you have to reference is the title and possibly a description.  The addition of a Noun Project icon, pulled from the API after indexing the content of links page would help users make a determination of a site&rsquo;s content before clicking</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong> - The Noun Project could be used to provide visual references for emails, SMS, Tweets, Facebook Wall posts and other common forms of digital communication. &nbsp;Icons could be suggested based upon message content.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few ways The Noun Project API could be used to dynamically offer visual representations for common textual objects we encounter in our every day lives.  I&rsquo;m sure a developer community would come up with many more examples, once the API is available.</p>
<p><strong>Network Graph</strong><br />Built into The Noun Project API would be a representation of the social and network graph of an image.  You could see how popular a particular image or set of images is.  You could apply this into the filtering and retrieval of images via the API, as well as have as part of the image meta data to use in your own application logic. To achieve the level of meaning the project intends to, a graph will be needed to show the use, reach and impact of each image and sets of images.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Network </strong><br />Also built into The Noun Project API should be a partner layer, that reflects the core mission of the project.  Every image returned by the API would be complete with all meta data regarding its creator and how the image can, and is being used across the network.  The Noun Project Partner Network would give more control and insight for designers to see how their images are being used as well as commercial, volume and other monetization opportunities for designers--a layer that could be part of the overall Noun Project revenue strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution</strong> <br />Without an API, the usage of Noun Project images is a manual process, leaving attribution up to the user.  With an API and a healthy branding and attribution framework, The Noun Project attribution would be built into the embeddable strategy as well as bundled into each and every Noun Project API response.  This would provide The Noun Project network with easy attribution, which doesn't just credit designers, it will be the basis of The Noun Project marketing. Imagine being able to visualize the entire syndication for a single icon! Without an API this is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Bridging the Digital to Physical </strong><br />The Noun Project API would allow innovative new ways to use Noun Project icons in the physical world as well as the digital.  An API could allow for the printing on demand of icon templates in various sizes, and ship them to users for creating signs and other real-world uses that could be permanent or possibly even ephemeral, with the use of temporary paints or spray on chalks.  This process wouldn't be a one-way street either.  With a Noun Project API, developers could build icon recognition applications that could snap a picture of an icon printed (permanently or temporary) and immediately connect users back to the virtual world around the icon, either based upon its meaning, designer or some new represenation that has emerged as part of the Noun Project network graph.</p>
<p>That are just some of my initial thoughts around how a Noun Project API could be put to use in meaningful ways.  Regarding what The Noun Project API would look like. I'd like to see some of the following endpoints:</p>
<p><a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/noun-project/the-noun-project-clicking-heels.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Designers</strong> - Endpoint for icon designers, with access to their profile, collections and icons&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - Enpoint for Noun Project user accounts with access to account and billing settings as well as favorite, saved, purchased icons and collections</li>
<li><strong>Icons</strong> - Endpoint for all icons, allowing to to search and filter individual icons as well as add and update existing icons for my designer profile</li>
<li><strong>Collections</strong> - Collection endpoints allowing me to search, filter and pull individual icon collections</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary</strong> - Endpoint for all words used for icons, allowing a dictionary that developed can reference while developing providing a reverse search for icons</li>
<li><strong>Graph</strong> - API access to all graph related events like popular icons, collections and designers as well as trending icons collections and reverse searches on popular keywords or phrases</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure there are more endpoints that could be identified in the future.  I think the most important aspect is to just get an API launched, and have a healthy strategy for engaging users to find out what should be put on the roadmap. Just starting simple and making sure to expose all aspects of the core Noun Project is an important beginning--the rest will come.</p>
<p>What a fascinating project the Noun Project is.  I strongly believe that it order to fulfill its full vision, the Noun Project has to have an API.  The Noun Project API will be essential to syndicating the icons across both our physical and virtual worlds, provide a way for users and designers to interact around the icons, while also providing the most meaningful licensing framework possible that would even include much needed revenue for both designers and the Noun Project, and keep this very important project alive.</p>

<p>I depend on <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> to move data around the cloud. &nbsp;I syndicate blog posts from <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> to Blogger and Tumblr. &nbsp;This isn't just blind syndication, it is SEO and also plan B scenarios to make sure my content exists in multiple areas.</p>
<p>When it comes to the IT decisions for API Evangelist, I carefully evaluate what services I use. &nbsp;If I begin to depend on an account, after 6 months I need to start paying a fee to secure some sort of quality of service (QOS). &nbsp;This is how I roll.</p>
<p>Not all platorms allow for this. &nbsp;In my opinion, all FREE platforms should have <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/">relief valves for users</a> like me, who want to move to some sort of paid account, assuring me some sort of service level agreement (SLA) or I'll move away.</p>
<p>For example: Once I started using Evernote regularly, I moved to the premium level. &nbsp;I bought into Pinboard at an early rate, once I was hooked. &nbsp;Inversely, I can't pay for Twitter, Facebook and some Google services. &nbsp;Today it is about IFTT.</p>
<p>In light of me losing Google Reader I'm taking a hard look at all my services. &nbsp;IFTT is on the chopping block.</p>
<p>I have about 20-30 jobs running at IFTTT, moving data around between my cloud services, in a way I depend on. &nbsp;I need to move this into the realm of premium or paid services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? &nbsp;Sell me on your service.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/iris-media/iris-media-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent some time drinking IPAs and talking education technology with Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) and a friend of ours Adam Wendt (<a href="https://twitter.com/skinnyblimp">@skinnyblimp</a>), the COO of&nbsp;<a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank">Iris Educational Media</a> last week.  IRIS Educational Media is a behavioral research and development company that provides educational resources for parents, parent educators, K-12 school staff, including teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals, and direct support employees.</p>
<p>During our discussion, Adam was describing how he wanted to make Iris Media resources available for people to use on any platform, by providing valuable embeddable tools and resources for organizations and professionals to use on their own sites and portals.</p>
<p><a title="Iris Educational Media" href="https://www.irised.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/iris-media/iris-media-video.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As Adam was talking, of course I&rsquo;m thinking API.  An API would not just a way to drive their own line of embeddable tools, but would also allow for other 3rd party developers to build specialized tools and widgets for other platforms that Iris Media might not have awareness, time or resources to focus on.  Wanting to be available on numerous platforms is easy, but actually delivering on them can be costly and time consuming--APIs are a way to share this load with a 3rd party community.</p>
<p>An API could power Iris Media&rsquo;s syndication similar to Youtube. The Youtube API, plus a robust embeddable tool strategy is behind the massive syndication and growth of the popular video platform. Iris Media could go further with its own API, by integrating a partner layer within their API platform, and provide developers, organizations and educational professionals the ability to earn revenue by syndicating or developing widgets and applications on top of the Iris Media API.  This revenue could go a long way in ensuring some of these essential educational professionals organizations stay in operation and continue making an impact.</p>
<p>Engaging with people like Adam, who are truly making a difference in priority areas like education, is why I continue doing API Evangelist.  APIs can help Iris Media be more successful in reaching its audience, but also empower the huge number of important individuals and organizations on the ground in communities around the globe, who deliver essential education where they are needed most.</p>

        <p><a title="tecnically philly" href="http://technical.ly/philly/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/city/philadelphia/tecnically-philly.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A <a href="/buildingblocks/roadmap.php">roadmap is an essential part of a healthy API ecosystem</a>.  The transparency and communication that come with providing a roadmap for your API and open data initiative will go a long way in building trust with your community.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2013/03/26/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-release-schedule/">City of Philadelphia is sharing its roadmap of data sets</a> that it intends to open in the coming months, by providing a <a href="https://trello.com/board/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-pipeline/51487d15bb68f5de3b0099b0">release calendar using cloud project management service Trello</a>. In addition to seeing the datasets the city intends to release, you can also see any data sets that have already been published.</p>
<p>According to the open data roadmap, Philadelphia is releasing data on street closures, energy consumption, evacuation routes, campaign finance, bike racks, budgets, expenditures and city employee salaries to name just a few.</p>
<p><a title="tecnically philly" href="http://technical.ly/philly/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/city/philadelphia/city-of-philly-open-data-roadmap.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>This type of transparency doesn&rsquo;t just build trust with citizens and developers, it provides an incentive for the city government to deliver high quality public data, in a meaningful and timely manner.    There is still a lot of work to be done once this data is available, in order to develop quality analysis, visualizations, other APIs and tools that can be used in mobile and web applications. But what Philly is doing is a great start.</p>
<p>The City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s approach to its open data roadmap is good to see.  It is something all cities should have, as well as all API owners.  Your roadmap will set expectations within your community, guide your own initiatives and provide a healthy blueprint for moving your efforts forward.</p>

<p>NASA has a <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/skymorph-imagery-api/">pretty cool challenge going on</a>, to create an API for SkyMorph, a database of optical images and catalogs generated by the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program.  According to the NASA description, SkyMorph provides:</p>
<blockquote><em>access to imagery by time and position or searching by specific asteroid or other moving object. The time dimension, unique to SkyMorph, allows users to discover changes in the intensities of stars, e.g. supernovae, or to discover moving objects, e.g. comets</em></blockquote>
<p>NASA is challenging us to help build a RESTful interface that would enable developers and citizen scientist to access SkyMorph imagery, lowering the barrier of access to the data and encouraging innovation around the program.</p>
<p>Ok, how cool is that!  APIs that enable everyone to help track on and understand objects in the sky, along with NASA.  It is projects like the <a title="SkyMorph API Challenge" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/skymorph-imagery-api/">SkyMorph API Challenge</a> that keep me excited about APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/21/interactive-api-documentation-with-swagger/">Interactive API Documentation With Swagger</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Swagger " href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/reverb-for-developers-swagger.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It is becoming more common for API providers to deliver documentation using what's known as <a title="interactive API documentation" href="/buildingblocks/interactive_documentation.php">interactive API documentation</a>, instead of the usual static API documentation.   Understanding how to use an API can be tough sometimes, and rather than just reading about it how it works, interactive API documentation allows you make real calls against an API, while learning about the interface.</p>
<p>While there are several approaches to delivering interactive API documentation, my personal favorite is using <a title="Swagger " href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>.  Swagger comes built in with <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, which is the API management platform I use for the <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">API Evangelist API</a>, but Swagger is available for anyone to use as an <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki">open source project</a>.</p>
<p>Interactive API documentation using Swagger starts with a Swagger definition, which is a JSON representation of an API endpoint. In this case, the endpoint is for accessing my blog posts:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/5216806.js"></script>
<p>This JSON describes everything about my very basic endpoint, which allows users to query almost 3 years of API Evangelist blog posts. Using this definition, Swagger generates the following API documentation automatically:</p>

<p>As someone learning about the API Evangelist Analysis API, this describes the endpoint, which fields are required to make an API call, but it doesn&rsquo;t just describe this with text, it provides an interactive interface in which I can enter my API keys, provide a query value and actually make a request against the API:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-interactive-documentation-2.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t just learn about the API endpoint.  I learn about what keys are needed and fields are present that allow me to request different information of the API endpoint. It allows me to actually see the request to the API, the resulting body of my API request.</p>
<p>This type of hands on learning is essential to onboarding new users with your API. I can read your API documentation and not see the value, but when I am walked through how to build a request, and actually see the value returned in real-time, it changes the game.  As a developer I&rsquo;m more likely to understand and integrate with an API when I am given interactive API documentation over static pages.</p>
<p>The benefits of describing your API using Swagger don&rsquo;t stop with just providing <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui">interactive API documentation</a>. Swagger can also help deliver <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen">code samples</a> in multiple programming languages for developers to put to use, <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">generate server side code</a> for new APIs and <a href="/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">provide potential benefits for API discovery</a>.</p>
<p>It is well known that <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">API documentation is the number one pain point for developers</a>. Make sure your API documentation is hands-on, and interactive, so developers will understand the value your API delivers immediately, and go from learning, to integration, in as short of period as possible.</p>

<p>Way to go brogrammers. &nbsp;You made sure a bright light in evangelism was partially dimmed tday. &nbsp;Really? With all the shaming that goes on targeted at women, you don't have balls to take a little shaming when you arer being a sexist pig? &nbsp; C'mon...ummm have some balls?</p>
<p>As I've <a href="http://kinlane.com/2012/12/30/sexism-in-the-tech-space/">said it before, us guys are going to have to eat shit with a side of humble pie for many years</a> to come to balance this whole sexism thing out. &nbsp;Let's own it.</p>
<p>All it would have taken is a humble apology from those gentleman in response to the Tweet, then some healthy discussion about why what they said was wrong, and move on kids. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I sure hope the hacker news crowd steps up and defends every woman that is shamed by guys now, as they seem to be a defender of this now. So if you Tweet out shaming a woman in a career changing way, know hacker news will be all over you...right? &nbsp;Right?</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/seabourne-logo-2013.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm tracking on a new wave of application frameworks and API centric architecture patterns, that are not just helping deliver the next wave of web &amp; mobile apps, but also bridging, aggregating and providing interoperability and transformations between APIs platforms.</p>
<p>One company I've been watching closely is <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a>.  The Seabourne team has an approach to application development that follows a very interesting set of principles:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Information Flows Instead of Pipelines - </strong>Information operates in &lsquo;flows&rsquo; where inputs and outputs are flexible and happen at any point. Flows are fluid and flexible, unlike structured, point-to-point pipelines</li>
<li><strong>Data has Multiple Owners -</strong> Information flows are composed of multiple streams of data owned by different partners and vendors. Any process must accommodate multiple canonical sources for different information</li>
<li><strong>Use APIs to Move Information -</strong> By using APIs to move information around, we decouple the data from the underlying technology and vendor, and make it possible to combine information from different technologies. APIs provide a flexible, low cost base to grow the system and meet changing needs</li>
<li><strong>Integrate Data Across Systems - </strong>Information lives on multiple systems inside and outside the organization. There is tremendous value to be had from combining multiple data sources together into a single information stream</li>
<li><strong>Translation Rather Than Standardization -</strong> Information is stored in multiple structures and formats. Any effort to manage information should focus on translating between structures rather than trying to develop a common schema</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that pretty much describes the challenges we face building web and mobile apps today, and Seabourne's approach isn&rsquo;t just about building apps, it is about organizing resources from multiple providers to build the best app you can. To see it in action you have to check out the project they just implemented using their approach called <a href="http://govinfo.io/">GovInfo</a>.</p>
<p>Using GovInfo, anyone can sign up to receive alerts from more than 100 different federal agency websites. GovInfo gets its information from a large number of sources ranging from RSS, APIs or scraped from HTML sources. Once acquired, the framework de-dupes, cleanses and normalizes the data as needed, then makes available for publishing or pushing out via email, SMS or other means.</p>
<p><a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/govinfo_diagram.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>The Seabourne approach is not just <a href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/">rethinking extract, transform and load (ETL)</a>, but also makes your app platform centered around acquire, process and publish, in a way that improves flexibility, centralizes processing rules for all incoming information and reduces the amount of time it takes to add new sources of data, all while providing scalability, in a very granular way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching Seabourne evolve and constantly refine their approach to distributed application design ranging from their <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">deployment of the FCC web site</a>, to the <a title="launching of MyFCC" href="/2011/12/20/the-fcc-lanches-api-curation-platform-called-myfcc/">launching of MyFCC</a>, and now the next iteration of their platform driving GovInfo.  I&rsquo;ll keep following what they are doing with their<a href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/"> AP2 approach</a> and watch the <a href="http://seabourneinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/case-studies/Seabourne-Information-Management.pdf">tools</a> and best practices that are a result of their innovative approach to application development using APIs.</p>

<p>It was inevitable.  <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">API Evangelist now has its own API</a>.  I had a couple partners ask for more sophisticated access than provided by RSS or JSON dumps out of my platform. &nbsp;So I launched a handful of API endpoints, allowing you to get at information from my world.</p>
<p>I currently have 13 endpoints providing access to the core of my platform, in 8 key areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Name, logo and description of the 2K APIs I'm activtely monitoring</li>
<li><strong>API Stack</strong> - Access to my weekly and monthly API stacks</li>
<li><strong>Analysis (Blog) - </strong>Access to my entire blog catalog</li>
<li><strong>Service Providers -</strong> Access to all API service providers I track</li>
<li><strong>Tools -</strong> A full catalog of all the API tools I've found</li>
<li><strong>Curated News - </strong>Title and links of news that I personally curate from my 2K+ feeds</li>
<li><strong>Notes -</strong> Notes I make during my daily and weekly curation</li>
<li><strong>Building Blocks -</strong> The common building blocks I've identified after looking at 2K top APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot more data behind my firewall that I want to open up.  I do a lot of research on top APIs like Twitter and Google as well as trending areas like <a href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/trends/baas.php">backend</a>, <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity</a> and <a href="/trends/realtime.php">real-time</a> service providers.</p>
<p>I will also be opening up API endpoints into the site traffic for <a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>, <a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a> and my other properties.  And toying with opening up some collections of my personal data like calendar, projects, checkins and other aspects of my world.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m only issuing keys to API Evangelist subscribers and partners, but let me know if you are interested in getting at any of my data.  Eventually I&rsquo;ll make much of it openly available, but I&rsquo;m still formulating my approach, and playing with different service compositions--so things will change.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/19/web-harvesting-to-api-with-importio/">Web Harvesting to API with Import.io</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Import.io" href="http://import.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/import-io/import-io-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had a demo of a new <a href="http://import.io">data extraction service</a> today called <a title="Import.io" href="http://import.io">Import.io</a>.   The service allows you to harvest or scrape data from websites and then output in machine readable formats like JSON.  This is very similar to Needlebase, a popular scraping tool that was acquired and then shut down by Google early in 2012.   Except I&rsquo;d say Import.io represents a simpler, yet at the same time a more sophisticated approach to harvesting of web data and publishing than Needlebase.</p>
<p><strong>Extract</strong><br />Using Import.io you can target web pages, where the content resides that you wish to harvest, define the rows of data, label and associate them with columns in table you where the system will ultimately put your data, then extract the data complete with querying, filtering, pagination and other aspects of browsing the web you will need to get at all the data you desire.</p>
<p><strong>Connect</strong><br />After defining the data that will be extracted, and how it will be store you can stop and use the data as is, or you can setup a more ongoing, real-time connection with the data you are harvesting.  Using Import.io connectors you pull the data regularly, identify when it changes, merge from multiple sources and remix data as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Put The Data To Work</strong><br />Using Import.io you can immediately extract the data you need and get to work, or establish an ongoing connection with your sources of data and use via the Import.io web app or you can manage and access via the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.import.io/">Import.io API</a>--giving you full control over your web harvesting connections, and the resulting data.</p>
<p><a title="Import.io" href="http://import.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/import-io/import-io-connectors.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When getting to work using Import.io, you have the option to build your own connectors or explore a marketplace of existing data connectors, tailored to pull from some common sources like the Guardian or ESPN.  The Import.io marketplace of connectors is a huge opportunity for data consumers as well as data scraping junkies (like me) to put their talents to use building unique and desireable data harvesting scripts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about database to API services like <a title="database to api with EmergentOne" href="/2013/03/01/mysql,-postgresql,-rds-to-api-with-emergent-one/">EmergentOne</a> and <a title="database to api with slashdb" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/18/database-to-api-with-slashdb/">SlashDB</a>, I would put Import.io into the Harvest to API or ScrAPI category--allowing you to deploy APIs and machine readable datasets from any publicly available data, even if you aren&rsquo;t a programmer.</p>
<p>I think ScrAPI services and tools will play an important role in the API economy.  While data will almost always originate from a database, often times you can&rsquo;t navigate existing IT bottlenecks to properly connect and deploy an API from that data source.  Sometimes problem owners will have to circumvent existing IT infrastructure and harvest where the data is published on the open web. &nbsp;Taking it upon themselves to generate the necessary API or machine readable formats that will be needed for the last mile of mobile and big data apps that will ultimately consume and depend on this data.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="/2013/03/19/web-harvesting-to-api-with-import.io/">web to API service Import.io</a>&nbsp;earlier today, and before I close the Evernote for this story, I wanted to highlight something else I thought they did interesting, on their <a href="http://import.io/pricing">pricing page</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought they provide a very honest peak into how they are pricing their services. &nbsp;First off, they admit that they are a young company, which is cool, but they also lay out some pretty interesting points around their business philosophy::</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>We are a free service. We will always provide a free-to-use tool</li>
<li>We will introduce premium features. Some of these you may have to pay for</li>
<li>We will always provide you with a tool to export your connectors</li>
<li>We will let you know if we are going to change anything that may impact your usage of import.io</li>
<li>We are currently in Developer Preview. Some things might not work as expected</li>
<li>Free accounts may be volume-limited as we move from Developer Preview to production</li>
<li>We will never spam you or share your details with any third parties</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these points are something I feel ALL startups should commit to as part of their services to their users. One thing I'd also like to see from startups, is some mention of their exit strategy. &nbsp;What is the end goal? &nbsp;I think this is a relevant question for all startups, as is also good one for Import.io after the Google acquisition and shut-down of a similar service called Needlebase, back in 2012. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal isn't to pick on <a href="http://import.io/">Import.io</a>, but along with the other items they outline, I think all API startups should be openly discussing everything listed above.</p>

<p>Last week <a href="http://openbadges.tumblr.com/post/45364274104/introducing-open-badges-1-0">Mozilla launched their new Open Badges platform</a>, as an open standard to recognize and verify learning.  I immediately started thinking about how it could be applied to APIs for incentivizing developer participation and success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come across other badge programs, but Mozilla is the first open approach I&rsquo;ve seen, providing free software and an open technical standard, that any organization can use to create, issue and verify digital badges.</p>
<p>So I was thinking, as an API owner, you could use Open Badges to structure a series of rewards for developers who reach important milestones integrating with your API, and engaging with your ecosystem.</p>
<p>Some examples badge-worthy milestones might be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Achieve X amount of API calls</li>
<li>Published application to showcase</li>
<li>Published open source code library</li>
<li>Developed more than one application</li>
<li>Revenue generated from application</li>
<li>Supporting the forum and conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>It would take a bit of planning to developer the right approach to badging for each API, as goals would be different for each provider. But, providing badges could provide an incentive for developers to work towards meaningful goals you have tied to important KPIs for your API strategy, While also providing an easy way to track your most knowledgable and potentially trusted developers.</p>
<p><a href="http://openbadges.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mozilla-open-badges/mozilla-open-badges-diagram.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>If API providers start issuing sensible and consistent badges for API knowledge it would also provide additional ways to measure the size and overall health of the API developer community.  I could envision badges that would serve specific business sectors or even around city, state and federal government APIs and civic efforts.</p>
<p>I will add Mozilla Open Badges to my list of <a href="/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a> and explore other ideas about how an API provider can establish badge programs to incentivize and reward healthy API developer activity.</p>

<p>Google launched a <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/03/build-collaborative-apps-with-google.html">Realtime API for the Google Drive Platform</a> today.  It is the API version of the same functionality available on Google Drive, that allows for you and other collaborators to type, edit, annote and chat with each other within a Google Doc.</p>
<p>To use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/" target="_blank">Google Drive Realtime API</a> you add the Google Realtime Javascript library, then you can give any local object on an HTML page realtime behavior.  The JavaScript library and Realtime API handle network communication, storage, presence, conflict resolution and sync changes using what they call a CollaborativeString object.</p>
<p>The Realtime API isn&rsquo;t just for documents, it can be used for productivity apps, games, entertainment and much more.  The only limitation is a developers imagination within their own applications.</p>
<p>Google gives a <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/realtime-quickstart">quick start</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/reference/">documentation</a> and other resources to get you going, and they provide a pretty cool <a href="https://realtimeplayground.appspot.com/">realtime playground</a> for building stuff with the API in a hands-on, interactive environment.</p>
<p>There are other players in the realtime space already, like <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> and <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>.  Google&rsquo;s entry into the arena is a signal that there is developer demand for realtime tools and provides validation for the other startups.   I&rsquo;ll play with Google Drive Realtime API some more and talk with the folks at Pusher and Firebase and see what their thoughts are and how it compares.</p>

Imagine if you hung the API design for each iteration of the Twitter API on a wall.  There is so much to interpret.  It expresses the vision of Twitter founders and employees, it is in direct response to a million developers and the needs of 500 million users around the globe. &nbsp;What an impression!!!</p>
<p>While JSON might be the only way we have to visually describe an API, each web, mobile app and data visualization could also be considered an artistic representation of the Twitter API.  You could fill an entire gallery with JSON representations of each endpoint and each of its versions, applications, and visualizations.  Creating interactive art exhibition of the Twitter ecosystem.</p>
<p>I remember back in 8th grade(1984) I was in my social studies class with Ms. Schuler.  She brought in some fractal prints, she said were created by her mathematician boyfriend.  She walked us through how each visual was actually a math problem.  This was the same year my math teacher Mr. Hathaway got around 20 Commodore Vic 20s, which he didn&rsquo;t know how to setup and run, so a handful of us stayed after school and helped setup the lab.  At this point in my education I hated math, and without seeing the beauty of the fractal, I may never have developed a passion (obsession) for computing.  My counselors told me I&rsquo;d never have a career in computers, because I was so poor at math. Ha! Eat it middle school counselors!</p>

<p>Jer Thorp&rsquo;s tweets really resonate with me.  APIs are a technical, business and political representation that can interpreted in so many different ways.  When I read a <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">swagger definition of an API</a>, images begin to form in my mind around the intent of the APIs author (think girl in red dress from the Matrix).</p>
<p>Sometimes an API will invoke kindergarten images in my mind telling me the designer didn&rsquo;t have the experience it took to represent their information and resources properly.  Other times they invoke very precise images, almost too precise, alerting me to the fact this API was designed by another application and not a human.</p>
<p>On a very rare ocasion I will see an API design that you can tell was hand crafted, with the love and care of a individual or group of individuals who considered the needs of many end users, developers, and other consumers.  After several iterations an artful API representation will also begin to bear the technical, business and political imprints of its time.  Much like a painting will have certain styles, approaches, shapes, sizes, colors and materials going into the ink and canvas, or maybe markings of war, its owners or poor care.</p>
<p>In my opinion APs are a very artful representation of sometimes very complex data or programmatic resources, that have the possibility to evoke very emotional responses from the developers that build on them or the from the end-users who are the intended audience.</p>
<p>Thanks for planting this seed in my head Jer.  It is a topic I will visit often, as I&rsquo;m no doubt going to stumble across patterns and approaches that are more art than tech, as I&rsquo;m navigating this amazing API driven world I'm obsessed with.</p>
<p>And remember you heard it from Jer Thorp (<a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt" target="_blank">@blprnt</a>) first!</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.slashdb.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/slashdb/slashdb-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I would say the most common path to an API is from your company's database.  This makes database to API connectors, tools and services a pretty valuable area of the API space.  While there will always be high profile APIs dominating the tech blogosphere, most APIs will be launched quietly from small companies, by connecting them to various internal data sources.</p>
<p>During <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, I met a new API service provider, called <a href="http://www.slashdb.com/" target="_blank">SlashDB</a>, that focuses on just delivering APIs from your database.  Once installed on any web server, SlashDB connects your internal databases and constructs a REST/HTTP web service, easily making database content accessible by URLs for getting, updating, inserting and deleting in a secure way.</p>
<p>SlashDB provides connectors for Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostGreSQL, IBM DB2 and Sybase--covering the top 5 databases you will find in the enterprise or small to medium businesses.</p>
<p>I notice that SlashDB also has Microsoft Excel connectors.  I will have to investigate this further and do another story on API deployment from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  I know this will sound insane to the RESTafarians, but I think much of the worlds data is locked up in spreadsheets, on individual computers, throughout companies around the globe.</p>
<p>I've added SlashDB to my list of next generation API service providers like <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">EmergentOne</a>, <a href="http://apispark.com/" target="_blank">API Spark</a> and <a href="https://apiengine.io/" target="_blank">API Engine</a>. &nbsp;Check it out, and let me know what you think.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2013</span>
        <p>This post is more rant, and about me working through my thoughts on this subject, which is why its on <a href="/admin/blog/kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a> and not <a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a> or <a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>. &nbsp;This post is an aggregation of ongoing thoughts I'm having around my role in the API space, a diagram I drew the other day while enjoying an IPA, and inescapable thoughts fueled up by a post by&nbsp;Patrick Meir over at iRevolution, called <a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/03/17/neogeography-and-democratization/">Crisis Mapping, Neogeography and the Delusion of Democratization</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Meir kicks up a bunch of thoughts related to how I perceive my role in the API space, which I believe is to help keep a certain amount of oxygen (aka open) present in the space, which I believe is the key ingredient in why the expirement we know as APIs is working. &nbsp;At first glance, API Evangelist looks like just a blog, but in reality it is a pretty complex system of data stores, API connectors, jobs and curation that I'm using to help draw a map of the API space that I can follow. Currently it looks something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-resource-to-last-mile.png" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-resource-to-last-mile.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>The way I see the space, is there are a shitload of resources, awaiting to be exposed via APIs that are both public and private resources. The stewards of these resources have the ability to select from tools and resources to deploy their API resources, using various building blocks for accomplishing this.</p>
<p><strong>API as a Service</strong><br />Additional to standing up your own API, there is the phenonmenon known as BaaS, PaaS and SaaS. &nbsp;Many of these platforms can actually help you deploy API resources, while also consuming and deploying resources of their own. &nbsp;For example, Kinvey allows you to deploy generic APIs from data stores you setup on their BaaS platform, bt they also consume API resources and makes available to you from eBay, and other places, while also providing you with their own API resources that you can use to rapidly deploy mobile apps. This layer is complex, lots to think aobut here.</p>
<p><strong>Top APIs</strong><br />There is a breed of API resources that are changing the landscape, both in whats available and how you do it. &nbsp;Leaders like Twilio, SendGrid, Amazon Web Services, Google and others are providing API resources and approaches to delivering API resources in ways that are influencing the API economy in big ways. &nbsp;These players stand out, and are worthy of identifying as separate group.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong><br />API consumers have to be able to find API resources. &nbsp;Historically we've only had ProgrammableWeb for this, but we are seeing growth in number of directories, IDE integrations and other evolutions in how we describe, share and discover APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enablers</strong><br />There are several evolving approaches to using APIs that deliver entirely new use cases for APIs, enabling new value that API providers and consumers can tap into. &nbsp;API aggregation from providers like Singly are bringing together existing API resources into easier to use, aggregated interfaces. &nbsp;Reciprocity providers like Zapier and IFTTT allow resources and value to transfer between API platforms in the clouds and behind the firewall. &nbsp;Application frameworks like <a href="http://ql.io/">ql.io</a>, are changing how we bridge APIs and rapidly build API driven web and mobile applications. &nbsp;Real-time providers like Firebase and Pusher are connecting and providing APIs that make the exchange of API driven resources real-time. &nbsp;These are just a of the few of the new areas of API enablement I'm seeing emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Reseller</strong><br />Platform providers like BaaS, PaaS and Saas, plus the enablers, discovery services and top APIs all represent reseller and partnership opportunities for individual companies deploying API resources. &nbsp;This is the wholesale world of getting your API found as well as being baked into an existing consumer base. &nbsp;Without a reseller or partner layer to your API, you are just a single API in a ever growing flood of API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Last Mile</strong><br />However, this is all just the piping or tubes of this fascinating new API driven economy. &nbsp;The entire purpose of having these API pipes is to deliver the "last mile". &nbsp;APIs began by delivering resources to distributed web sites, and enabling sharing and embeddable widgets and buttons. &nbsp;With the birth of the cloud, APIs began delivering wholesale infrastructure resources for use indistributed cloud environments. Then with mobile we saw the demand for APIs skyrocket--what will it do with big data, sensors, devices, cars, home and building and beyond?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which brings me back to my role as API Evangelist. &nbsp;I feel compelled to keep the discussion of the pipes occuring within all the "last mile" conversations. &nbsp;I understand the VC's and companies under their control want to monetize the last mile. &nbsp;This is fine. &nbsp;But I want to prevent the API pipes from getting paved over in the process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want ANYONE to be able to get at the pipes behind the tablet applications their children use. &nbsp;I want ANYONE to be able to get at the data that went into any infographic, visualzation or report. &nbsp;I want ANYONE to understand the pipes that connect our physical worlds via sensors, devices to our online worlds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want the pipes to stay open, accessible, transparent and part of ALL "last mile" conversations. &nbsp;Which brings me back to&nbsp;Patrick Meir article. &nbsp;There were several key quotes I'm processing in regards to how I view API resources, API pipes and the last mile API Products that are derived from them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Feenberg&rsquo;s own view is constructivist, &ldquo;emphasizing that technology development is humanly controlled and encapsulates values and politics; it should thus be open to democratic control and intervention.&rdquo; In other words, &ldquo;technology can and should be seen as a result of political negotiations that lead to its production and use. In too many cases, the complexities of technological systems are used to concentrate power within small groups of technological, financial, and political elites and to prevent the wider body of citizens from meaningful participation in shaping it and deciding what role it should have in the everyday.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;Meaning Hacking" is often hijacked by "Deep Technical Hackers"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Democratizing information flows and access; promoting Open Data and Do it Yourself (DIY) </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Innovation with free, highly hackable (i.e., open source) technology; letting go of control.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"the artful alteration of technology beyond the goals of its original design or intent,&rdquo; enables &ldquo;Deep Democratization"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Freely pro-viding the hackable building blocks for DIY Innovation is one way to let go of control and democratize"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The control over the information is kept, by and large, by major corporations and the participant&rsquo;s labor is enrolled in the service of these corporations, leaving the issue of payback for this effort a moot point. Significantly, the primary intention of the providers of the tools is not to empower communities or to include marginalized groups, as they do not re-present a major source of revenue."</em></p>
<p>There are so many lessons to be absorbed from CrisisMapping and Neogeography, when it comes to the API economy. &nbsp;Sorry for just posting these quotes as just a list, but I'm still absorbing and just needed them published in single place, so I can reference and re-read while thinking on this subject. &nbsp;(Thats right, I read my own blog!)</p>
<p>I don't think there are any easy answers here. &nbsp;I just want to make sure we keep the conversation including the pipes and not just about the resources and last mile products delivered on top of the pipes. &nbsp;So we don't cutoff the oxygen needed for the API economy to work for EVERYONE!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/17/beyondget-or-otherverbs-an-augmented-api-platform/">BeyondGET or OtherVerbs, an Augmented API Platform </a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/augmented-post.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have a idea for a new API platform.  Since I do not have any startup aspirations, I prefer setting my ideas free, for anyone to use, instead of acting on them myself.</p>
<p>This idea is an evolution from an earlier one, which I had while working with the CityGrid API, called &ldquo;augmented places&rdquo;. &nbsp;While at CityGrid I constantly had people asking if they could submit data back to the API.  Stating they had a better list of pizza places in Brooklyn or vegan restaurants in Santa Cruz.  I had to always turn these folks away, and one morning I sketched out  &ldquo;augmented places&rdquo;.  It would be a service where anyone could submit their own meta data about a place, either adding an entirely new place, updating an existing one, or even remove a listing. It would provide an external service that could augment all places APIs, not just CityGrid.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the other night, I did some data journalism for my girlfriend Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), which included <a href="/2013/03/16/using-the-crunchbase-api/">pulling data from the Crunchbase API</a>.  I pulled 3000 education startups from around the world, then after delivering to her in a JSON object and Google Spreadsheet, I immediately used the script to pull any API related startup, for my own needs.  I quickly compared a handful of results with my existing API database and in many cases, I have much better information on some of these companies than CrunchBase.  Yet I have no way to submit this data back to CrunchBase, to correct or add to what they have.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/augmented-put.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is common in the open API space.  Most data APIs only allow you to /GET.   Allowing for the other verbs /POST, /PUT, and /DELETE, usually require not just more resources to deploy and manage, but also a certain mindset that is open to receiving information from your API consumers, which could range from internal and partner users, to the general public.  Some places I&rsquo;ve worked, are just scared shitless of repercussions of doing something like this.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my idea for a new API service.  Let&rsquo;s call it <strong>BeyondGET</strong> or <strong>OtherVerbs</strong>.  A service that would allow people to add API resources they&rsquo;d like to augment with the ability to POST, PUT and GET.  So I could add an entry for Crunchbase using api.crunchbase.com/v/1/company/.  I would define each entry with a Swagger definition, and the system would create a basic data store for the entry.   You could now submit changes to existing records, as well as entirely new records or mark a record for deletion--providing an augmented, external, crowdsourced layer on top of potentially distributed API resources.</p>
<p>Developers could use a primary API resource as well as the augmented version of the API if they choose.   You would have to add some sort of trusted user layer, so developers could only show data submitted by trusted sources. &nbsp;Seems like some sort of Git layer for versioning would be needed as well.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/augmented-delete.png" alt="" width="330" align="right" /></p>
<p>API owners could also choose to use an augmented layer as a sort of crowdsource queue for their API.  The API owner could decide which users they trust and what data was relevant enough to let back in.  It could act as a DMZ for your API.</p>
<p>There would also need to be a data licensing layer to all of this, that if well crafted, could open up the potential for revenue sharing or at least virtual credits to use against other API services.  I know CityGrid was discussing how they could reward API consumers for their contributions, and I could see this being a way to deliver on that across the API space.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;d love to hear thoughts on this.  Or run with building a version of it yourself.  It would be awesome to see a whole breed of augmented API service providers pop up, allowing me to add a new section about it at API Evangelist. :)</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/16/using-the-crunchbase-api/">Using The Crunchbase API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/crunchbase/crunchbase-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Audrey</a> came to me last night and said she had a project that she wanted to tackle, using the <a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase API</a>.  She wanted to pull a list of education startups that were founded in 2010-2012, showing their investments, CEO, founders and other related company information.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago, I helped Audrey download a PHP Twitter bot, reverse engineer and make it work for an objective she had around Tweeting random responses to a certain type of tweet.  I figured she was ready to see what it took to hack on an API and get the research data she needed.</p>
<p>Audrey wanted to pull a list of startups that were educated related.  We started with the /search endpoint, using the query keyword &ldquo;education&rdquo;.   The query parameter appears to search the title, tags and overview of each Crunchbase entry, pulling way more than what we needed, 5700 in total.  Each search returned 10 startups, with a handful of fields for each company, not nearly enough information.</p>
<p>To prove we could get what we needed, we took the first startup returned, grabbed the name and used it to perform a company /entity search, returning a wealth of information.  We had what we were looking for including date founded, amount raised, CEO, founders as well as description, logos, addresses and other vital company information.</p>
<p>Back to the /search endpoint.  Each search only returned 10 results, when there were actually 5,700.  I looked at the documentation and the only parameter listed, was &ldquo;query&rdquo;.  No way to control how many results returned, paginate or otherwise.  So I start guessing, appending page=, and max=, maxrows=, anything to get more results.  Eventually I was able to change the page, so I was able to write logic to loop through each page, getting at all the results required.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/crunchbase/crunchbase-search-endpoint.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>For each returned result from the /search endpoint, I would take the company name and perform a company search on the /entity endpoint.  However each call to the endpoint would yield a 301, redirecting me to another URL.  So the search for:</p>
<blockquote><em>http://api.crunchbase.com/v/1/company/Noodle+Education.js?api_key=[key]</em></blockquote>
<p>Get a 301 returned, with the following redirect URL:</p>
<blockquote><em>http://ec2-107-21-104-179.compute-1.amazonaws.com/v/1/company/noodle-education.js</em></blockquote>
<p>So for each /entity endpoint I would have to make two separate cURL calls to get a single record for a company.  An approach that is guarantee to get CrunchBase into the API billionaires club (as chatty APIs do), or at the very least generate a nice bill with their API management provider.</p>
<p>Next, I needed to create a table to store the data in, I looped through the JSON object and spit out a list of fields, so I could generate a SQL script to create the table.  There were a few duplicate fields, but quickly got a table up and the data inserted.  The data is decent.  There are a lot of issues with absence of default values, empty objects with available images, addresses, etc.  But nothing I&rsquo;m not used to wading through, to get what I need from an API.</p>
<p>With the /search endpoint based upon a single keyword search, that spans title, overview and tags, the search returned a lot of companies that didn&rsquo;t fit our search.  As we prepared to enter each record into a database, we would apply further filters, making sure there companies founded in 2010 or greater, and met other criteria, before actually inserting.</p>
<p>Now we had a MySQL table filled with 772 education startups.  I exported as CSV, uploaded as a Google Spreadsheet, and shared it with Audrey.  Game over.  She had what she needed.  Overall it took about 3 hours start to finish, which she felt was tedious, and feeling there was a lack of clarity regarding the whole process--something she couldn&rsquo;t have done with me and my API programming skills.  This is a problem CrunchBase.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/crunchbase/startup-ecosystem-visualization.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Audrey is your target audience</span>.  This needs to be dead simple.  She shouldn&rsquo;t have to blindly navigate the API endpoints, documentation, data structures and holes in the data.  These are things I&rsquo;m used to having to cobble together, but an analyst like herself, won&rsquo;t have the time and patience.</p>
<p>I can tell the CrunchBase API was created by someone who didn&rsquo;t give a shit about the data, let alone use the API to build anything.  I saw a job posting from CrunchBase, so I know they are looking for someone to own the API.  I hope this person can become a steward for this great set of data, and make it into a meaningful API--there is a lot of potential there.</p>
<p>Quick feedback for whoever takes the job, regarding some building blocks to focus on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong> - Establish more meaningful names for the existing endpoints, while establishing some new ones</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Get the documentation complete!!  So what if you have I/O docs, if all the fields aren&rsquo;t defined</li>
<li><strong>POST / PUT</strong> - Al</li>
low folks to add and update data either after they curate and add to it, or from their own databases
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - Create a blog, that lets me know someone is home.  Its so evident nobody is. </li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Provide me with an active Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ account to interact with you on and share what I&rsquo;m doing with your data</li>
<li><strong>Branding</strong> - I need some guidance with branding of CrunchBase data, when I publish in the wild</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - Holy shit, the opportunity with badges, buttons and widgets around CrunchBase data.  This data is made for crunching and sharing in stories</li>
<li><strong>JS Library</strong> - You need a plug and play dictionary, demographic JavaScript library that allows bloggers, analysts, etc to embed on pages and provide a library with a rich set of demographic references, funding links and other vital data people will cite in stories and reports around the web</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet</strong> - From the I/O docs, provide export as CSV and to Google Spreadsheet.  Build Google Spreadsheet templates that allow users to enter their key into cell and it will pre-populate a spreadsheet with the data they are looking for, with the analysis, visualizations and other tools analysts will need</li>
</ul>
<p>CrunchBase is a goldmine of data.  As it is, I can make use of the data and generate value.  But the API won&rsquo;t remain at the center of that, I will extract the value I need and not return much to the platform, because well...it sucks ass.  I can&rsquo;t write back, and I do so much work to get the value I do, I feel like its mine after I&rsquo;m done. Especially if the platform has no person or personality that I consider an owner or steward. &nbsp;I don't feel beholden to give anything back. &nbsp;Just take...not good for your business.</p>
<p>You guys have a lot of potential within the <a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/io-docs">CrunchBase API</a>, I hope you dedicate the resources to make it work, and find a steward for the API that will actually care about what you have, and interact with your API consumers in a meaningful way.</p>
