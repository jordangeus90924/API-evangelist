{% include JB/setup %}<p>In my effort to better understand API access, I’m studying how API owners control access to their APIs, with most recently being around Rate Limiting.The other day I asked, why do we limit API access for developers, and even explored rewarding developers for heavy usage.As I continue to understand the impact of rate limits on developers it’s becoming clearer that for an API to successfully impose rate limits, you should also be offering rate limit release valves in the following ways: Increase Request Form - There should be a formal, self-service way to request rate limits either for valid uses that you hadn’t considered bumping up against rate limit ceiling, or quite possibly for non-commercial purposes.Utility Pricing - Providing a pay as you go model, where users meet the courtesy limit, they can put in their credit card and pay for what they use above and beyond the default rate limit.There are many points of friction for developers trying to integrate with an API.</p>
