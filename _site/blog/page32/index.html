<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-bad-actors-on-both-sides-of-the-api-fence/">As I think about the bad behavior that occurs on the API consumption side of API operations</a>, I'm considering ways that I can help API providers address these problems when they arise within their ecosystems. What can you do when bad actors have access to your APIs? Also more critically for some providers, what can you do to prevent bad actors from on-boarding with your API program at all?</p>
<p>I strongly believe that companies should be as public with their API efforts as possible, but when it comes to which developers you let in, and which ones you don't, I'm finding I'm becoming more conservative in my thoughts--as long as you are transparent about the process. I'm still forming all of my thoughts around this (hence the blog post), and I'm sure is something that will keep evolving as I continue to push forward my awareness of the API space.</p>
<p>When I see a new sign-up for my own APIs, I like to be able to verify who the new consumer is. I like to see a real name, and potentially a company name, but also when I Google the combination, I like to see an active Twitter, LinkedIn, or Github account. It is easy to tell real people, from personas that live n the shadows, and I prefer verifiable people use my APIs.</p>
<p>If you are a public API consumer, I do not think it is unreasonable to ask you to maintain some sort of public presence, to verify who you are, and what you do. I know for many enterprise developers this is insanity, which is why I put LinkedIn profiles in the mix--I do not expect everyone to be super popular on Twitter, and a die-hard Github user. However, in 2015, you really should consider!</p>
<p>As I'm going through my own API on-boarding process, trying to make smoother (it isn't the best right now), I am considering how I will articulate what behavior I expect of my API consumers--in plain English. This post is just part of my iteration, putting my thoughts out to the universe, getting feedback when I can, but ultimately knowing that I am the sole decision maker when it comes to setting the tone in my own API community.</p>
<p>What tone are you setting? Do you verify your API consumers? What is the bar you set for a place at the table?</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dollar-sign.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am continuing to push my research around API <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">monetization</a>, <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">plans</a>, and <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">partners</a> forward, whilep preparing for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">my API lifecycle keynote at @Defrag and @APIStrat</a>. Along the way, I am also exercising some of my API pricing and planning strategies with my partner in crime at <a href="http://apiware.io">APIware</a>, as we think through some new products that we are developing.</p>
<p>How I approach pricing for API products, is on a resource by resource basis, <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">considering all of the API monetization tools in my toolbox</a>. For example, when i launch two new API endpoints for <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/11/27/adding-a-new-alpha-endpoint-to-explode-api-oadf-into-separate-files-for-each-unique-endpoint/">exploding API definitions</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/11/27/adding-a-new-alpha-endpoint-to-tell-me-how-big-my-api-endpoints-are/">telling me how big my APIs are</a>, I quickly run down my list of monetization building blocks to see which areas will apply to these new resources. The reality is, until these APIs leave an alpha stage, they will just exist in my internal consumption tier.</p>
<p>Even though these APIs aren't ready for prime time yet, I am already thinking through which of my API monetization building blocks will apply. Will I charge for access? Are they available in the freemium tier? Do I offer only a trial version of them? Ultimately it all comes down to who I will be targeting with these resources, and in this case it will be primarily hardcore API architects--something that helps me define how I will price these resources, and which service tiers I make them available in.</p>
<p>When it comes to generating revenue from APIs, rarely are there a one size fits all solution. You should be considering each resource based upon the value it brings to the table, who you are targeting with this resource, and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">weighing all the tools in a modern API monetization toolbox</a>. Remember the business of APIs resembles the technology of APIs, where you do things in small chunks, and you iterate, until you find the optimal value proposition that works for the platform, and your consumers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://api.foxycart.com/docs"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/foxycart-api-screenshot.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am still catching up on my feeds, and open browser tabs, and one tab that has been open for a couple of weeks is <a href="https://medium.com/@lukestokes/why-your-colleagues-still-don-t-understand-hypermedia-apis-1a5a2cf82540">Why Your Colleagues Still Don&rsquo;t Understand Hypermedia APIs</a>, by Luke Stokes (<a href="https://twitter.com/lukestokes">@lukestokes</a>) of <a href="http://www.foxycart.com/">FoxyCart</a>. The post is very thought provoking for me, and represents what I feel is the very pragmatic front of the hypermedia movement, from someone who has helped move the concept of a hypermedia API from academic discussion to reality, with the <a href="https://api.foxycart.com/docs">FoxyCart API</a>.</p>
<p>His challenges at the end of his post really set the stage for me:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So how do we find a balance between idealism about what Hypermedia API documentation systems &ldquo;should&rdquo; be and what they practically are? How can we move the whole ecosystem forward by encouraging client developers to code to link relationships instead of hard-coded URLs? How do we help pave the way for the future but not look like unsophisticated outsiders in the process? What pragmatic steps should we take to be like the other cool kids using standard documentation presentations while at the same time saying, &ldquo;Um, yeah, don&rsquo;t do that. Don&rsquo;t code to the URL, code to the link relationship instead.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>For me, his questions illuminate the canyon between where the API community is currently with API design, and the vision of where we should be going with our API design practices. The more I play and learn with hypermedia, the less I see it as the lofty vision for the future, and the more I see it as a set of practical design patterns that will make my API work more meaningful.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of API definitions like Swagger (now OADF), is that it was designed for documenting your API, after it was already designed--awesome, but not remotely about API design. Where the concept of hypermedia is all way back the other direction, where you have to put some serious thought into your API design, before you ever roll up your sleeves to write code--big gap between these worlds.</p>
<p>J<a href="http://apiary.io">akub, Z, and the Apiary.io</a> team has done some amazing work to bring the mainstream conversation closer towards API design, much than hypermedia folks had ever done--until recently. What Luke asks, reflects the work we have left to bridge the divide, and emphasizes that it has to be something that scales. This is why Swagger was successful, because it provided the section of the bridge that API architects needed to solve an immediate problem that on the table, at scale--documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is, the masses are pretty short-sighted, and often unwilling to the heavy learning and lifting needed to "code to link relationships, instead of hard-coded URLs". Unfortunately we will need more tooling to help us build more sections of the bridge (beyond Swagger), as we won't be able to it all at once. I think the important thing with this tooling, is we need make sure with each section of the bridge that we build, we are also educating API architects, and client developers around HTTP, media types, link relations, and other empowering hypermedia concepts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, Luke got me pumped with his questions. I do not know what the answers are either, but I want to lend a hand to help figuring it out, and will be asking these questions over and over in my head, showcase solutions that y'all are working on, and tell stories here on the blog, until we make some progress.</p>

<p>I'm neck deep in government open data again, and as we are gearing up for the presidential election, you really begin to see the potential for accurate, real-time election data via APIs. There are a number of leading election-related APIs at the federal level like we have from the&nbsp;<a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/">Sunlight Foundation</a>, and you see the emergence of high value APIs out of government like the&nbsp;<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/07/08/openfec-api/">Federal Election Commision (FEC) API from the 18F</a>, but with the amount of money in politics, and scope of what is at stake, I can't help but feel there is a huge opportunity out there for more election APIs.</p>
<p>Seems to me that there is an opportunity for some API savvy activistpreneur to step up at the city, county, state, and even the federal level. I'm not just talking about election districts, candidate, and other common building blocks of elections we experience, but real-time sentiment, superpac spending, and other influential information that if availablle for distribution via APIs, could shift the balance one way or another. It would take a healthy assessment of the current landscape, but I think you could identify some low hanging fruit to get started with.</p>
<p>One you get going on the API journey around election data, if you do it right, you will learn a lot, and discover other valuable content or data sources, and see patterns that the rest of might not see. The use of social platforms over the last 8+ years of elections was all API driven, and is just the tip of the iceberg--an API dedicated to elections seems like a huge opportunity to me, in coming months and years.</p>
<p>Let's get to work!</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-unhappy.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've always been a strong advocate for the API consumer, which is one of the primary motivations for me working to define best practices that API providers can follow across their operations. The majority of my negative experiences, when it comes to APIs, has been as an API consumer, not as an API provider.</p>
<p>As I do this API Evangelist thing longer, and longer, the bad behavior by API consumers becomes more clear to me, and I'd say rivaling much of the bad behavior by API providers that I have seen, and in some cases helping actually drive it. I do not have any bad actors in my API community, but through conversations I have had with leading API providers, I'm hearing some pretty crazy stories.</p>
<p>Badly behaved API consumers range from signing up for multiple accounts, rather than paying for higher levels of access, to trolling within the community, treating other developers badly, platform owners horribly, and just being a shitty API community citizen. You will never truly understand how badly API consumers can behave, until you've operated an API platform, and had a large number of consumers putting an API to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I will always keep my critical stance towards API providers, as I feel they often set the tone for a community, I am increasingly more understanding when platforms have to tighten things down, and get more critical when it comes to the public availability of API resources. In the end, I will always push for more public transparency around every aspect of API operations, but I am increasingly advising companies to have a tight grip on their API service composition, and what resources developers get access to, before they prove they are trustworthy.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">The API Lifecycle (My Talk From @Defrag and @APIStrat)</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2015</span>
        <p>I recently told the story of how I view the API life-cycle, based upon my research across the space, at the <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag Conference in Broomfield, CO</a>, and at my <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in Austin, TX</a>. I spent two weeks pushing my research forward in preparation for these talks, and wanted to take a moment to gather my thoughts, and share the narrative of my talk.</p>
<p>When I first gave this title and abstract for both the Defrag and APIStrat keynotes, I called it "the 17 stops along a modern API lifecycle". After pushing my research forward, to support these talks, it became 26 stops, then those became what I am calling "lines", resulting in me just call the talk "the API life-cycle".</p>
<p>I use my public speaking as a vehicle for my API research, helping me polish my work, and ultimately pushing me to craft better narratives around my work, but most importantly, make it more coherent, and make sense to the average individual. One way that I do this, is to root my stories in history, build upon the earlier work in the tech space, and anchor them to other relevant areas of our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Everything I do as the API Evangelist is built on the hard work of men and women who came before me.</p>
<p>From the 1940s...</p>

<p>Getting us to the current decade, where I saw the potential of delivering the compute resources we needed for the mobile devices, that were quickly becoming ubiquitous in our daily personal as well as business lives. Designing, deploying, and managing APIs in support of mobile was the catalyst for my research as the API Evangelist in the summer of 2010.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/compute-2010s.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>As the API Evangelist, all that I do is map out what I am seeing across the API space, mapping out what API pioneers like Amazon and Salesforce are doing, as well as how recent API darlings like Twilio, SendGrid are executing on their API operations. I take this awareness, and map it against the services that leading API service providers are offering, in hopes of establishing a more coherent view of the overall API space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I conduct my research in hopes of helping API providers better understand how to establish a more successful strategy, but with a focus on being able to articulate this not just internally, but with developers, partners, and potentially the public at large. APIs are important. They are increasingly the pipes that are driving our personal, and professional worlds, and it is important that we do them as well as possible, so that they benefit everyone involved.</p>
<p>In 2015, I feel like I am the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck">Henry Beck of the API space</a>. If you aren't familiar with his work, he was one of the original minds behind a different way of thinking about mapping, designed for public transportation, that is still used today to describe major transit operations in cities around the globe.</p>

<p>In 1933, Henry Beck created a map of the London Underground, that was decoupled from earlier ways of mapping and communicating around transit resources, in a way that was focused on how the resources would be experienced by end-users, evolving beyond a focus on the transit resources themselves, and their location in our physical world.</p>

<p>Earlier approaches to mapping out the subway reflected traditional mapping techniques, and were bound to legacy physical elements like roads, rivers, mountains, and buildings. While maps like this one from 1889, were technically accurate, they didn't always convey an increasingly complex subway system to end-users as they experienced it.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/1889small.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Even into the new century, subway maps were plotted along roads and rivers, leaving them coupled to legacy elements, and ways of thought,&nbsp; ignoring the fact that end-users of the subway were not thinking in these terms as they put the transit system to use. Riders just wanted to know how they needed to get where they were going, and not be burdened with these legacy elements they often do not even see.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/1902small.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>By 1915, public transit engineers like Henry Beck were rethinking how they mapped the transit infrastructure, in a way that helped them better communicate their increasingly complex infrastructure internally, but most importantly, in a way that helped them communicate externally to the public.</p>
<p>In 2015, this is what I feel like I am doing. Mapping out all the stops along the increasingly complex API life-cycle, in a way that helps API providers better understand their own life-cycle, but also like the subway map infrastructure, in a way that helps them communicate to consumers, and end-users.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/api-lifecycle-tag-cloud.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>At this point in my research, I am asking myself how&nbsp; I take the 26+ common areas of an API life-cycle and create standardized lines, that I could possibly be communicated in a common way, using the subway map analogy. As I approach the end of 2015, I have&nbsp;809 building blocks, in 149 categories, across these 26 common areas--I need a more universal approach to plotting these out, and the subway map is providing me with one possible way of doing this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I am facing, is how do I properly map out these lines, in a way that reflect the role the play in an overall life-cycle? This is the difficult place I find myself currently, but will be working to solve using the subway map tools I am developing. They beauty of this analogy, is that I will be able to create multiple iterations over time, as well as be able to fork, and evolve maps for different platforms--similar to how multiple cities use the same subway map for their cities unique infrastructure.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<!--Begin Layer 2 -->
<p><br />Even once I find a rhyme and rhythm to mapping out the lines, stops, stations, and flows for my version of the API life-cycle, how will I do the same for the actual APIs themselves? I will need each API to follow a version of the API lifecycle, but also potentially possess its own, entirely separate journey, unique to a single API or potentially a stack of APIs.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-resources-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br />Eventually I envision a world where I don't just have my entire API life-cycle mapped out, as well the journey involved with each of my APIs, and the API collections I define, I want a real-time visualization for my entire infrastructure. I want to see where each API is on the API life-cycle, as well as see where each of my API consumers, and even API users are on their own journey.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/london_underground2-interactive.gif" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This might seem like a pretty tall order, but when you take a closer look at things, you realize that over 75% of the elements present in my API life-cycle definition, also has an API. <a href="http://3scale.net">My API management with 3Scale has an API</a>, and my <a href="http://apiscience.com">API monitoring with API Science has an API</a>. I'm increasingly choosing API service providers that have an API, because I need them to be a real-time contributor to my overall API lifecycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br />With my API infrastructure being API driven, I can now think of my API life-cycle subway map in API terms. I can dynamically plot out each API I operate as a journey, depicted as its own subway line, and also make sure each API interacts with its respective API life-cycle journey--all using APIs. *mind blown*</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-resources-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br />But wait there is more! It gets even better--it just so happens that <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html">I also have an API for the subway map</a>. It is just an alpha version, but using this API, I can dynamically plot out the map of each area of my API life-cycle, as well as for each individual API, and its own journey on the life-cycle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/Subway-Map-API.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>I'm not sure where all of this API life-cycle mapping will go. I'm hoping it will help me think through the API life-cycle, in the context of my overall API industry research, as well as my own APIs that I operate. I am hoping the process will help me decouple the way I approach my APIs from some of my legacy ways of thinking, built up over the last 25+ years a software architect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping I will start to see my APIs in a new light, breaking away from thinking about them in a linear way, through the lens of the applications I build on top of them, as well as the resources they are developed from. I want my APIs to be decoupled from much of their legacy constraints, and reflect more how they will be consumed by developers, and experienced by end-users.</p>
<p>I am not under any illusions that this process will be easy, and it will probably take a great deal of time, and iterations, much like it did for early subway architects, when it came to mapping out early transit infrastructure.</p>

<p>Until finally, I'm hoping I will find a way to describe my own API life-cycle, and APIs, in a universal way, that could work for other API providers, and even API service providers. It took over 15 years of iterating on early London Underground maps, before they finally landed on this design in 1933.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/Beck_Map_1933.jpg" alt="" width="85%" /></p>
<p>Beck developed an approach to mapping transit infrastructure that would also work for defining complex transit infrastructure over almost a century later. The approach he helped define, is still applied as part of how we map out, as well as communicate transit infrastructure, around the globe in 2015. I hope I can apply some of the same principles to begin defining the virtual API infrastructure we are increasingly depending on in 2015.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/tubemap.gif" alt="" width="85%" /></p>
<p>While Ian Bogost was tweeting in jest about using a subway map for all written and visual communications, the tweet was very timely and relevant for me. It came across my Twitter timeline, just as I was crafting my subway map keynotes for Defrag and APIStrat. While I do not favor the subway approach for "all written and visual communications", I do think it has potential for "discursive synthesis" of the potentially complex API infrastructure that we are building in 2015.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/ian-bogost-twitter.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Through my work, I am hoping to establish a sort of subway map line "toolbox" for communicating around the API life-cycle that I have spent the last five years defining. I am looking for this toolbox to give me a way of communicating&nbsp; and collaborating with others in a way that reflects common API industry approaches, while also being able to customize for specific platform needs.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-key.png" alt="" width="660" /></p>
<p>In addition to having a toolbox that reflects a modern API life-cycle, I am hoping the subway map approach gives me a set of tools I can use to visual the life-cycle of every individual API within my control. I desperately need a common way visualize my APIs, as well better understand where they exist within my overall API life-cycle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-key-resources.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Having a common way to describe and communicate around transit infrastructure is critical to society operating, and the global economy. I feel pretty strongly that having a common way to describe and communicate around the API infrastructure we are increasingly depending on is just as critical&nbsp;critical to society operating, and the global (API) economy.</p>
<p>We need an approach that reflects how companies around the globe are already operating their APIs, acknowledging the value of existing successful patterns of interoperability, established by the Amazons and Twitters of the world, but also allows for the flexibility, customizablity, and unique needs of individual companies, and industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standardization, as well as uniqueness of what I'm talking about can be seen in the beautiful array of subway maps for major cities around the globe. These amazing maps meet the transit needs of each cities, while also embracing the principles laid out by early transit planners like Beck.</p>

<p>My storytelling at events like Defrag and APIStrat, as well as on my blog, always reflects where I am at with my research. Next I will be crafting more meaningful version of subway maps for each area of the API life-cycle, as well as an overall view showing all&nbsp;809 building blocks, in 149 categories, across the 26 areas I track on as part of my research.</p>
<p>I am anticipating that I will hit some areas where the subway map analogy fails me. I am already thinking about some ways of augmenting API specific elements on the approach, to help me better communicate specifically about API infrastructure. An example of where I'm bending this, is the concept that an individual API can have its own map, and line, as well as be a passenger on other lines--I just need to come up with a sort of wormhole station connector element that helps communicate this relationship and / or transition.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">As always, you can find my research on the home page of API Evangelist</a>. As I complete subway maps for each of the 26 areas, as well as the overall map, I will make sure they are available as part of the navigation between each areas of my research. I am hoping to also use some JavaScript magic, in conjunction with the subway map analogy, to make navigating my research more of a journey, than just clicking around my site.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-power-button.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just read <a href="https://medium.com/@TomSteinberg/the-pill-versus-the-bomb-what-digital-technologists-need-to-know-about-power-b1aede7facc9#.y28fb5vb6">The Pill versus the Bomb: What Digital Technologists Need to Know About Power</a>, by&nbsp;Tom Steinberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/steiny">@steiny</a>), and I'm reminded of the important role APIs will (hopefully) continue to play in helping provide a transparent window into some of the power structures being coded into the algorithms we are increasingly relying on in this digital world we are crafting.</p>
<p>In this century, we are seeing a huge shift in how power flows, and despite the rhetoric of some of the Silicon Valley believers, this power isn't always being democratized along the way. Much of the older power structures is just being re-inscribed into the algorithms that drive network switches, decide pricing when purchasing online, via our online banking, and virtually ever other aspect of our personal and business worlds.</p>
<p>APIs give us a window into how these algorithms work, providing access to 3rd party developers, government regulators, journalists, and many other essential actors across our society and economy. Don't get me wrong, APIs are no magic pill, or nuclear bomb, when it comes to making algorithmic power flows more transparent and equitable, but when they are done right, they can have a significant effect.</p>
<p>If APIs are a complete (or near complete) representation of the algorithms that are driving platforms, they can be used to better understand how decisions behind the algorithmic curtain are made, and exactly how power is flowing (or not) on web, mobile, and increasingly connected device platforms--API does not equal perfect transparency, but will help prevent all algorithms from being black boxes.</p>
<p>We may not fully understand Uber's business motivations, but through their API we can test our assumptions. We may not always trust Facebook's advertising algorithm, but using the API we can develop models for better understanding why they serve the ads they do. Drone operators may not always have the best intentions, but through mandatory device APIs, we can log flight times and locations. These are just a handful of examples that APIs can be used to map out digital power.</p>
<p>All of this is one of the main reasons that I do API Evangelist. I feel like we have a narrow window of opportunity to help ensure APIs act as this essential transparent layer for ALL API operations across industries. As the established power structures (eye of Sauron) turn their attention to the web, and increasingly APIs, their powers of transparency are becoming more diminished. It is up to us API Evangelists, to help make sure APIs stay publicly available to 3rd party developers, government, journalists, end users, and other key players--providing much needed transparency into how algorithms work, and how power is flowing on the web and mobile Internet.</p>

<p>It can be easy to stumble across the base URL for one of my APIs out on the open Internet. I design my APIs to be easily distributed, shared, and as accessible as possible--based upon what I feel the needs for the resource might be. You can find most of my APIs, as part of my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master stack</a>, but there are other APIs like my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/screen-capture/">screen capture API</a>, or maybe my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/screen-capture/">image manipulation API</a>, that are often orphaned, which I know some people could use some help identifying more of the resources that are behind API operations.</p>
<p>To help support discovery across my network of APIs, I'm going to be supporting requests for Content-Type: application/apis+json for each endpoint, as well as an <a href="http://apisjson.org">apis.json file</a> in the root of the API, and supporting portal. An example of this in action, can be seen with my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/">blog API</a>, where you can look into the root of the portal for API (<a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/apis.json">kin-lane.github.io/blog/apis.json</a>), and in the root of the base URL for the API (<a href="http://blog.api.kinlane.com/apis.json">blog.api.kinlane.com/apis.json</a>), and for each individual endpoint, like the (<a href="http://blog.api.kinlane.com/blog/">blog.api.kinlane.com/blog/</a>) endpoint, you can request the&nbsp;Content-Type:&nbsp;application/apis+json, and get a view of the APIs.json discovery file.</p>
<p>It will take me a while to this rolled out across all of my APIs, I have worked out the details on my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/">blog</a>, and <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">API</a> APIs. Providing discovery at the portal, API, and endpoint level just works. It provides not just access to documentation, but the other critical aspects of API operations, in a machine readable way, wherever you need it. It is nice to be on the road to having APIs.json exist as the media type (application/apis+json), something that isn't formal yet, but we are getting much closer with the latest release, and planned releases.</p>
<p>Next, I will push out across all my APIs, and do another story to capture what things look at that point. Hopefully it is something I can encourage others to do eventually, making API discovery a little more ubiquitous across API operations.</p>

<p>I am back home in Los Angeles, after another great edition of <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice--this time in Austin, TX</a>. I have had a few day to decompress, and took a day to reboot my brain by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/23/sharing-235k-api-definitions-with-the-english-language-api-recipe-book/">crafting 235K+ API definitions for the English language</a>, resulting in some time to reflect on what happened last week in Austin.</p>
<p>First of all I want to thank <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>. Without the API infrastructure provider, APIStrat would not happen. Second I want to <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/sponsors/">thank all the sponsor s who get involved</a>, without your support the conversation wouldn't happen. Third, I want to thank the speakers and attendees for making it such a meaningful conversation.</p>
<p>I tend to use that word, "conversation" a lot when describing APIStrat, but I feel pretty strongly that it is the conversation that occurs at APIStrat that helps move the entire API community in a very meaningful way. The conference always renews my energy, and strengthens my relationships with other important folks in the space that I rely on for my research and storytelling.</p>
<p>Thank you so much to everyone who came to Austin last week and participated, and special thanks to Steve and the 3Scale team for investing so much into the API community, while asking for so little in return.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-copyright.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I needed a side project to reboot my mind after @APIStrat this last weekend, so I opened up my notebook and picked a project that I've been meaning to give some attention to, one that would help me clean my slate, and let me get back to my regular work levels. The project I picked is one that I came up with a little over a year ago, but recently had flushed out my vision further, as I hung out at my favorite watering whole drinking an IPA.</p>
<p>It took me several iterations before I landed on a name for this project, but my working title is <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/">the English Language API Recipe Book</a>. I find myself in an awkward position these days, when it comes to the concept of API copyright, which is something I have taken a firm stance on with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/22/what-we-can-do-to-make-a-difference-in-the-wake-of-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case/">my work around the Oracle v Google ava API copyright case</a>, and the release of the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API licensing format API Commons</a>, but is something, in the end, I just do not believe in.</p>
<p>You see, in my opinion, API definitions should NOT fall under copyright. Like recipes and menus, API definitions should not be open for anyone to use. To help me make my point, I wanted to craft <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/">the English Language API Recipe Book</a>, publishing an open API definition for almost every word in the English dictionary. I found a reasonably complete list of every English word, and auto-generated an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Open API Definition Format (OADF)</a> specification for each of the 235K+ words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each API definition, I cover the base GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs for each word, providing a basic query via a parameter, and return a name, and description as the basic underlying data model. I am already playing with other variations of database models, and have also generated another dimension for each word, by again iterating through each word, and adding it as a secondary level resource. I am also playing with other relationships, and ideas for expanding the dimensions of this recipe book, but wanted to get this first version out the door.</p>
<p><a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/english-language-dictionary-notes.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Overall, I just want to show how easy it is to programmatically generate API definitions, and add this English Language API Recipe Book to my already growing number of API definitions, <a href="http://theapistack.com">from popular APIs that I include in the API Stack</a>. Through this work, I wanted to emphasize, that no matter how much work you put into the naming, ordering, and design of your API definitions, they are not creative works that you should lock up and defend--your API definitions should be open, easily accessible, shared, and designed for reuse.</p>
<p>While I do not think any of the 235K+ API definitions should have copyright applied, I will putting all of these into public domain, using a Creative Commons license, as act two of this production. This is more theater than anything, but using API Commons, I will make sure every word in the English dictionary, crafted as a basic web API, is available for anyone to use, anytime, anywhere (as it should be, DUH). I recently stated in a keynote, after launching API Commons, that I was going to be the "Johnny Fucking Appleseed" of publishing openly licensed API definitions, out in front of slower moving corporations like Oracle--the English Language API Recipe Book is just the beginning of this.</p>
<p>Next up, I will be crafting a series of OADF API definitions for <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a> and use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to bundles as a more meaningful collection. I will be using these data models to further automate the English Language API Recipe Book, and establish additional dimensions to this collection. <a href="https://github.com/english-language-api-recipe-book">You can find the English Language API Recipe Book on Github</a>. I have published as a Github organization, with a separate sharded repository for each letter of the alphabet, containing a separate OADF definition for each word in the dictionary, and indexed using APIs.json to index each letter, <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/apis.json">as well as for the overall recipe book collection</a>--making it all machine readable by default.</p>

As one of the organizers, I can say that pulling together the perfect lineup of speakers and topics is always a daunting challenge, but then at some point before the event happens, the schedule always seems to take on a life of its own.</p>
<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">The APIStrat Austin schedule</a> has reached that point again. We have enough killer speakers and companies present, it has attracted other killer speakers and companies, resulting in a mindblowing 3 days of workshops, keynotes, panels, and sessions--if you haven't taken a look <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">at the schedule lately</a>, take a few moments.</p>
<p>I was going through, looking for problems, missing photos, etc, and the scope of the people and companies present just struck me how amazing it has become, and I had to share.

        <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-licensing-stack.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/22/what-we-can-do-to-make-a-difference-in-the-wake-of-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case/">I've spent a lot of time thinking through the licensing we apply to APIs, as part of my work on the Oracle v Google API copyright case</a>. The licensing around APIs is still in flux, with the current precedent being that APIs are copyrightable. Even though I do not believe this stance, I encourage API designers to make sure and apply one of the more liberal Creative Commons licenses to your API definitions, taking a pre-emptive stance in the conversation.</p>
<p>In my experience most API providers, let alone consumers and the public at large, do not understand the separation between an APIs definition, and the code that runs the API, and often even the code that consumes an API. To help us visualize the separation, as well as think through the licensing implications of each layer, <a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com/">I have setup a specific research project that addresses API licensing</a>, in hopes of spending time regularly researching the topic, as well as telling stories that help people navigate how to license their APIs.</p>
<p>Here is how I'd break down the five most common layers of the API licensing stack, and some ideas for how you can apply licenses to these layers of API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Server Code -</strong>&nbsp;For many APIs, your server code will be your secret sauce and kept proprietary, but for those of you who wish to open source this critical layer, here are some options. To help you navigate the licensing, I recommend using&nbsp;<a href="http://choosealicense.com/">Github's Choose a License</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache</a></strong>&nbsp;- The Apache License is a free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). The Apache License requires preservation of the copyright notice and disclaimer. Like other free software licenses, the license allows the user of the software the freedom to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software, under the terms of the license, without concern for royalties.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL</a></strong>&nbsp;- The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is the most widely used[6] free software license, which guarantees end users (individuals, organizations, companies) the freedoms to run, study, share (copy), and modify the software. Software that allows these rights is called free software and, if the software is copylefted, requires those rights to be retained.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a></strong>&nbsp;- The MIT License is a free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is a permissive free software license, meaning that it permits reuse within proprietary software provided all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data&nbsp;</strong>- Serving up data is one of the most common reasons for deploying an API, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://opendatacommons.org/">Open Data Commons</a>, provides us with some licensing options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/">Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)</a></strong> &mdash; The PDDL places the data(base) in the public domain (waiving all rights).</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/">Attribution License (ODC-By)</a></strong> &mdash; You are free to share, create, and adapt, as long as you attribute the data source.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Content -</strong>&nbsp;Separate from the data, APIs are being used to server up short, and long form content, where liberal&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Common</a>&nbsp;licenses should be considered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></strong>&nbsp;- This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0">CC BY-SA</a>&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to copyleft free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a></strong>&nbsp;- Use this universal tool if you are a holder of copyright or database rights, and you wish to waive all your interests in your work worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Definition -&nbsp;</strong>The part of the discussion be defined (unfortunately) by the Oracle v Google Java API copyright legal battle, and in light of the ruling, I urge you to consider one of the more liberal&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Common</a>&nbsp;licenses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></strong>&nbsp;- This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Client Code -</strong>&nbsp;Separate from your server side code, you should make sure all of your client side code SDKs, PDKs, and starter kits have an open source license applied-o-remember you are asking them to potentially integrate this into their business operations. Again&nbsp;I recommend using&nbsp;<a href="http://choosealicense.com/">Github's Choose a License</a>&nbsp;to help you navigate this decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache</a></strong>&nbsp;- The Apache License is a free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).

</ul>
<p>This list does not reflect all of the licensing opportunities available to you. These reflect the licensing options that I recommend you consider, as part of your API operations. I want as many APIs to thoughtfully consider the licensing for their entire API stack, and I'm kick-starting these research to provide a short, concise guide for API providers to consider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I get my way, every layer of the API stack will be licensed as openly as possible, however I add some extra concern for the <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition layer</a>. I know many of my readers will argue that this is just code, and should be licensed along side your server side code, but this is not true-modern API definitions are increasingly available as JSON, YAML, Markdown, that is telling a very important story that is having a significant impact on how we do business, and live our personal lives--a story that should be able to retold and echoed across the digital landscape, without licensing restrictions.</p>
<p><a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com/">My API licensing research</a> is just getting going. I will be rounding it off with examples of the approach used by leading API providers, news and stories I curated from across the space, as well as more&nbsp;<a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>&nbsp;tooling that helps you define the licensing for your API, and share in a machine readable way.</p>

<p>We reached another significant milestone in the API space today, after being acquired by SmartBear this spring, the Swagger specification is being moved into a Linux Foundation grouped called the <a href="https://openapis.org/">Open API Initiative (OAI)</a>.</p>
<p>SmartBear has been working with the core group of vendors including 3Scale, Apigee, Capital One, Google, IBM, Intuit, Microsoft, PayPal, and Restlet over the summer to hammer out the details of the organization, and the charter that drives the group forward.</p>
<p>Its no secret, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/22/how-to-build-an-api-brand-through-consistent-storytelling/">I am a pretty big support of the specification</a>, and happy to see it be reborn, within the community driven group, as a community driven open spec. I&rsquo;m looking forward to continuing my development of interesting things on top of the OADF  specification, and telling stories about what the community is building as well.</p>
<p>If you have a cool tool or service that you have built on the spec, make sure and let me know, so I can share the story with my network.</p>

<p>I wish I had more time to spend on designing, and deploying APIs the way I desired. Without any real funding of individual APIs, I can only go so far with them, which usually doesn't go beyond the minimal viable API. However, even with this reality, I have two APIs I would love to see done right, and keep nagging at me.</p>
<p>One API is my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/curated/">curated news API</a>, which I currently have a pretty bare bones JSON definition to represent each news article I curate from the API space (date, title, author, body, url). As I have time, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">I've been trying to craft a Siren representation of this same resource</a>. The opportunities for exploration of my archive of curated API news going back to 2011 is pretty huge (in my opinion).</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/audio/">I've also been having delusions of a hypermedia enabled version of my audio API</a>, which I use store audio files I find, create, or publish. It is a CRUD version of what I'd like to see, but recently I've been thinking of ways I could craft a more audible version of API Evangelist, but in order to do it right, I need a hypermedia enabled API experience.</p>
<p>For me, ,this takes hypermedia beyond many of the discussions I have been exposed to, moving my motivations into the realm of user experience, and not about building a client that will rule them all, or just as a matter of principle--I just want to deliver the right experience. How do I allow consumers of my audio API to define their own experience? How do I craft some experiences, based upon my view of the API space--as I see the world?</p>
<p>This is where hypermedia goes beyond the technical, and moves into the experiential realm where I'm hoping that I can manifest some more money to pay for tehse API designs to become a reality. ;-) Thank you for your support!</p>

<p>When I started API Evangelist in 2010, I tracked on one area--API management. Over the years this expanding to be about API deploy, and design, and most recently monitoring and discovery. As I approach the end of 2015, I've expanding this to be 30 separate areas of research.</p>
<p>I have almost 200 projects I'm pushing forward in one way or another, but these 30 years reflect the API space I am working so hard to make sense of in 2015. While all of my research is a work in progress, I have these core projects as part of my regular monitoring, and I will be updating as much as possible.</p>

<p>While this may seem like a lot of areas to keep track of, I'm finding it easier and easier to do, as it all continues to come into focus for me. I also have other research areas I'd like to merge in here, and maybe some other areas I'd like to to migrate out of existing research, into new areas.</p>
<p>As I'm preparing for my keynotes at Defrag in Colorado, and APIStrat in Austin this month, I'm refreshing all of my research, and trying to use my work to craft a hopefully interesting talk, while also sharing some nuggets of wisdom from the vantage point I enjoy.</p>
<p>All of my research is licensed CC-BY, is machine readable by default, and runs on Github, so if you have any questions you can submit an issue, or ping me directly. If you are feeling adventurous you are also welcome to fork any of my work and incorporate it with your own work, or even submit a pull request and contribute your own thoughts to my research.</p>
<p>As always you can find <a href="http://apievangelist.com">this working list of research on my the home page of API Evangelist</a>--thanks for tuning in!</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.slashdb.com/"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/slashdb-new-logo-sideways-medium.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I read a lot of blog posts, and press releases about open data these days, and when I find a dataset I think offers a lot of value, or is just interesting enough to help push forward, I either try to incorporate into my <a href="http://adopta.agency/">Adopta open data work</a>, or I just put it out to my followers to see if anyone can help.</p>
<p>As I was monitoring the space yesterday I came across the&nbsp;<a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/">Ranking Digital Rights 2015 Corporate Accountability Index</a>, which <em>"evaluates 16 of the world&rsquo;s most powerful Internet and telecommunications companies on their disclosed commitments, policies, and practices that affect users&rsquo; freedom of expression and privacy."</em>--<a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/download/">I saw there was an excel and CSV versions of the report</a>, but I didn't see an API, so I tweeted out:</p>

<p>Victor Olex (<a href="https://twitter.com/agilevic">@agilevic</a>) from <a href="http://www.slashdb.com/">SlashDB</a>, turned around an API endpoint in a matter of a couple of hours. Here is what Victor sent me:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="s1">I took your Twitter challenge and created the API for Ranking Digital Rights data. The data model does not include scores for individual lines of business, but it does have all qualitative data needed to make sense of it.

<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/slashdb-ranking-digital-rights-diagram" alt="" width="100%" /></p>

</ul>
<p>These are very resource oriented API endpoints, meaning they look like the raw resource they are generated from, but it demonstrates the value of using cloud services like SlashDB to do a lot of the heavy lifting for you when deploying an API. Getting an API up and running, so that you can start building web, mobile, data visualizations, and other tooling is an important first step--then you can also start iterating on, and begin the process of defining the next generation endpoints.</p>
<p>As you can see the SlashDB interface allows me to dill down using the URL, referencing the databases, relationships, and other resources that are exposed. What I like about SlashDB, is it lets you navigate the resources and relationships through the generated HTML pages, and then retrieve the XML or JSON you will need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next steps for me, is I'd like to craft a simple Github Pages hosted landing page, and define a base set of meaningful API endpoints that would allow potential API consumers to quickly understand what is contained in the the&nbsp;<a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/">Ranking Digital Rights 2015 Corporate Accountability Index</a>, and hopefully incentivize someone building something cool on top of it.</p>
<p>Thanks to&nbsp;Victor Olex (<a href="https://twitter.com/agilevic">@agilevic</a>) and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slashdb.com/">SlashDB</a>&nbsp;more doing this important work--you guys rock!!</p>

<p>I am a big advocate for making sure the on-boarding process for developers is as friction-less as possible. Developers should be able to signup, and login without anything getting in their way. This is why normally I wouldn't suggest adding anything unnecessary to to signup and login process, but <a href="https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/login.jsp">I saw something over at Cloud Elements that I thought was interesting</a>.</p>
<p>First, let me know that Cloud Elements gets bonus points because they <a href="https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/login.jsp">emphasize signing in with your Github or Google account.</a> I am a big fan of keeping all my API accounts linked to my Github profile--it just makes sense to me. I'd love it if API providers allowed me to store keys, SDKs, and other resources within my private Github repository, that I use across all the APIs I depend on. (I'm sure someone will tell me not to do this, but nobody has yet to convince me of why)</p>
<p><a href="https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/login.jsp">What really caught my eye logging in,</a> was the updates they provided at the bottom of the login screen. There was an image, with a simple message telling me that v1 of the Cloud Elements API was sunsetting, with a simple "Read More" link, so I can get more details. I like this concept of adding these type of critical updates to the login screen for developers.</p>
<p>I am going to add a flexible messaging area to signup and login screen, as part of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">my suggested on-boarding building blocks</a>. Developers may not be regularly logging into their API developer portals, so I wouldn't depend on this channel for everything, but in addition to the blog, Twitter, and other channels, it might make sense as a way to share important information with API consumers.</p>

<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I've had a handful of suggested building blocks when it comes to authentication, as part of my API management research</a>, but after taking a look at the <a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-scopes">OAuth Scopes page for the Slack API</a>, I'm going to add another building block just for listing out OAuth scopes.</p>
<p>For platforms who provide OAuth, scopes are how access to users content and data is being broken down, and negotiated. When it comes to industry levels, OAuth scopes are how power and influence is being brokered, so I'm going to start tracking on how leading providers are defining their scopes--I am sure there are some healthy patterns that we all can follow here.</p>
<p><a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/14/the-future-of-public-private-sector-partnerships-being-negotiated-at-the-api-oauth-scope-level/">I have had the pleasure of sitting in on OAuth negotiations between major utility providers, as part of my work with the White House and Department of Energy</a>&nbsp;in the past.&nbsp;This work has given me a glimpse into the future of how access and sharing of data will be negotiated in the future, with OAuth scopes and APIs playing a central role.</p>
<p>It will take me some time to standardize how I gather, store, and publish the OAuth scopes for each API, but I can get started by bookmarking any provider who shares their OAuth scopes, and encourage other API providers to do, by suggesting a formal OAuth scopes page as one possible building block you should consider when crafting your API strategy.</p>

<p><a href="http://apimetrics.io/2015/11/03/apimetrics-second-api-performance-report-social-networks/">APImetrics just released their second API Performance Report for Social Networks</a>, aggregated from data they have been gathering from monitoring social networks since 2014. APImetrics is publishing the report to "..understand the impact these APIs were having on social media based on geographic location and specific cloud service provider."</p>
<p>I'll let you read the report yourself, I just wanted to highlight the importance of this type of API monitoring from 3rd party services like APImetrics. The other providers I watch closely like <a href="http://apis.how/8nlsropidv">Runscope</a> and <a href="http://apis.how/h1h2mnxnc4">API Science</a> also monitor 3rd party APIs like this, but I think publishing formal reports on a regular basis like APImetrics is doing, is healthy for the space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, I would like to see an aggregate location where all API monitoring service providers can publish their data, in a common format, and the larger API community could process, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">help establish an API rating solution that we can all take advantage of</a>. Historical, and real-time data will be key to establishing the open rating system that we need.</p>
<p>I would say that social, cloud, and messaging apps kind top the list of APIs we should be monitoring and rating, but eventually it would be nice to have this be commonplace for any public API in the space. Part of helping us evolve the <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a> conversation, is establishing a baseline for rating the good APIs from the bad ones, and work like the social network report from APImetrics helps us get closer to this possible future.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/27/api-monitoring-should-be-baked-into-your-api-strategy-by-default/">I love that AWS is baking monitoring testing by default in the new Amazon API Gateway</a>. I am also seeing new service from AWS, and Google providing security and testing services for your APIs, and other infrastructure. It just makes sense for cloud platforms to incentivize security of their platforms, but also ensure wider success through the performance and load testing of APIs as well.</p>
<p>As I'm reading through recent releases, and posts, I'm thinking about the growth in <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">monitoring</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, and <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com">performance</a> services targeting APIs, and the convergence with a growth in the number of approaches to API <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, and what <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com">containers</a> are doing to the API space. I feel like Amazon baking in monitoring and testing into API deployment and management because it is in their best interest, but is also something I think providers could go even further when it comes to investment in this area.</p>
<p>What if you could establish a stage of your operations, such as QA, or maybe production testing, and the compute and bandwidth costs associated with operations in these stages were significantly discounted? Kind of like the difference in storage levels between Amazon S3 and Glacier, but designed specifically to encourage monitoring, testing, and performance on API deployments.</p>
<p>Maybe AWS is already doing this and I've missed it. Regardless it seems like an interesting way that any API service provider could encourage customers to deliver better quality APIs, as well as help give a boost to the overall API testing, monitoring, and performance layer of the sector. #JustAThought</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2015</span>

<p><span>When planning the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference, the team works very hard to make the speaker and session line up reflect what we see across the API space. The conference is meant to be an open, non-vendor and non-product focus, discussion about what individuals and companies are facing when it comes to being API providers, as well as API consumers.</span></p>
<p><span>When we closed the call for papers for APIStrat this year, it was clear that API consumption would be one of the sessions, but &nbsp;as we progressed in the process of locking down talks it was clear that API consumption should be something that we should move to the main stage. To help highlight the importance of this discussion, I wanted to ask Mark Boyd (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mgboydcom"><span>@mgboydcom</span></a><span>), the conference chair for APIStrat his thoughts on why we did this:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>This year has seen two major API consumption challenges: For API providers looking to continue their growth, 2015 has often been about putting their API in front of non-dev users and making their API accessible to a wider audience. We're seeing an increasing use of tools like Google Sheets and slackbot integrations trying to make API functionality available to people who don't code. For businesses and enterprises generally, the increasing use of external APIs has meant more challenges for dev teams in aggregating APIs and using multiple APIs consistently. Each API they are using might come with different terms of service, differing rate limits, different terminology for the same subject matter, and different ways of measuring units. For example, most API consumers I hear from are frustrated that each API they use seems to have a different way of measuring and displaying time formats!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>As APIs keep growing in mainstream business use, there becomes a tipping point in scaling the API economy where it starts adding complexity rather than removing it. We think that 2015 is that tipping point and we need to start solving how end users can consume APIs without it creating new challenges for them. We've got some of the best minds who are thinking through how to solve these issues - Mark Geene from Cloud Elements, Paul Katsen from Blockspring, Taylor Barnett from Keen IO, Kirsten Hunter from Akamai, Noam Schwartz from Similar Web, and Todd Sundsted from SumAll have all navigated their way through making their APIs accessible to others or building an abstraction layer so that all the APIs they are consuming are working in unison. This will be a great panel session for API providers who want to make it easier for their developer community to consume their APIs, and great for API consumers to learn some of the tools and tricks that can make it easier to integrate external APIs into their own work.</em></p>
<p>I think Mark nails it. For me, this session moving to the main stage demonstrates that APIs are going mainstream, as more, and more of the "normals" are tuning into the API conversation. <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">The API consumption panel at APIStrat this month includes</a>:</p>

<p><span>All of these panel participants are API providers, service providers, as well as consumers -- making for a pretty potent discussion about APIs. These companies are all very aware of the challenges API consumers face, because they are doing it at scale. If you are an API provider looking for the best advice on how to streamline use of your API, these are the people you want to tune into.</span></p>
<p>As part of the storytelling around @APIStrat, I will be digging deeper into each of these companies, and profiling what they contribute to the API space.

<p>Many of you that have attended any of my talks, have heard me tell the audience about the importance of sharing your API stories. As an API provider it is the most important tool in your toolbox, above and beyond any technical or business advantage you have. I'm spending more time lately, gathering up the things I say over and over in my talks, and other in-person conversations, and craft simple stories that echo these little nuggets of wisdom on the blog.</p>
<p>If you do not tell the story of what your API is doing, nobody will know--it really is that simple. The drumbeat from your blog, should echo the activity that is going on via your API. Your day might be filled with a hectic stack of activity from your view, but your API consumers, analysts, and storytellers like me, we do not see any of this activity, and we all need to hear about your day on your blog, amplified by your active Twitter account.</p>
<p>I can tell you that the APIs who are doing interesting things, and are telling the story of these things, end up on my blog, and in the major tech blogosphere much more often, than those that do not. I'm not telling you to craft amazing essays about your operations, I'm just asking that you blog daily, or every couple days, on the often mundane, but potentially highly valuable stories from the trenches of your API operations--it is something that, the more you do, the easier it wil gets.</p>
<p>While the goal of blogging is to communicate externally with your API consumers, and the public at large, my secondary motive is to expose you to a very beneficial by-product of blogging in this way. When you get into a rhythm where you are working through your ideas, operations, and API road-map, in such a public way, you develop a very different view of your platform, one that is closer aligned with your community, and potentially the industry you are looking to play a role in.</p>
<p>I want you to share your API stories, but more importantly I want your API to be successful, and regular telling stories to your community, and the public, will increase these odds significantly in my experience.</p>

<p>As I explore through API portals, looking for the successful approaches to APIs, I'm increasingly seeing formal partner programs, <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/index.html">resulting in me expanding the topic as its own research area</a>. My objective is to keep track of how the APIs I track on operate their partner programs, resulting in the list of organizations I reference in my research. I also want to try and identify what some of the common building blocks of API partner programs are, in addition to the news stories that I have curated about partnerships--which is the fuel of my research.</p>
<p>I have recorded 31 separate partner programs, which I found through the course of my API monitoring and research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are all companies who have formal partner efforts that provide a higher level of access to their API. There are many companies who feel their developer programs is a partner program, but what I am looking for is a partner program that looks to certify developers, and give them more benefits through deeper participation with a platform.</p>
<p>After looking through these companies I've recorded a handful of what I'd consider to be some of the common building blocks of these API partner programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is just a start, after I spend more time looking through these programs, and learning more, I will evolve further. As I do with my other areas of research I will publish all of this as a white paper when I can. You can stay in tune with the <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/news/">API partner related news I find on the research site under news</a>, the <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/companies.html">official company partner programs I've flagged under organizations</a>, and <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">the common elements I have recorded under building blocks</a>--it will change as I have time, so check back regularly.</p>
<p>Next, I think I will look at the types of partnerships that these platforms are offering, and study the relationship between their partner programs, and their general API access. If I can, I will also track on which partners are showcased as part of each program, to try and get a vibe for which companies are working hard at establishing partnerships across the space. There is quite a bit of curated news to still go through and make sense of all the partner related activity I have been coming across for the last couple years. It is always hard to get my research up to speed with how much information I have curated over time, and the more I research, the more information I seem to collect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know of any partner programs I don't have listed, feel free to let me know.</p>

<p>I have a notebook of story ideas I can do from any moment, but I find that I foten need some sort of inspiration to kick them off properly. I got that this afternoon in a Tweet from Leah Bannon, reminding me how important it is for me to have stories for non-developers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tools that make it easier for non-devs to do stuff with APIs are the most under appreciated and awesome things in tech right now imho</p>

<p>There are many tools available right now that let's anyone publish an API, you just have to know the right tools, and right process to get the results you need. Thanks to Zapier, <a href="http://apis.how/mqashcq6gb">you can connect to the API driven services of a wide variety of cloud tools, and using Google Spreadsheets and Zapier</a>, you can easily store data and content, to be used in a simple API--all without writing any code.</p>
<p>The most useful example of this, is using popular form services like <a href="http://apis.how/dp1jeyo2dm">Wufoo</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/a6shmgr13k">Gravity Forms</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/hatabecuhu">Typeform</a>, and <a href="http://apis.how/cxz1whvjh7">Survey Monkey</a>, you can collect just about any information you want, crafting exactly the form and fields you want, then using Zapier you can route the form results to a Google Spreadsheet. Once you have your Google Spreadsheet, <a href="http://apis.how/5ytnitnakm">you can then easily publish an API, complete with documentation using Restlet's cloud API deployment, and management services</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going to save the detailed how-to for a future post, but I wanted to kick-start, what I hope to be an ongoing series, of simple exmaples of how non-developers can consume and publish their own APIs, without being a programmer. My goal is to help encourage anyone to understand the value of aggregating valuable data and content using Google Sheets, and then allowing it to be put to use anywhere, by deploying an API with Restlet.</p>
<p>If you need help with this example, let me know and I will expedite my next how-to post.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-plan.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have some really amazing resources exposed as APIs. Everyone is doing it these days, and I have some good ones, now I just need a plan. You know, actually, I need several plans, that will help me expose these resources to the right people, while remain as much control as I need, and also generate revenue from these resources, tailored to whoever I am offering them to.</p>
<p><strong>Starting With The Essential API Building Blocks</strong><br />I want to allow anyone to access my valuable APIs, however I want to control exactly how much they can access, and even limit it to a free trial, and a small amount of calls upon the API. I am going to call this Plan A, also known as my freemium layer, meant to just wet the appetite of any potential API consumer. I ow have a basic level of access to my API resources, that anyone can sign up for 24/7, yet I get to dictate exactly how many hits on the API they can make, and who gets access.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Beyond Plan A For My API Strategy</strong><br />Plan A only gets me so far, I need to also be able to establish additional plans that help me cover the costs of my operations, and hopefully also generate some revenue from API access and usage. I need to be able to establish any number of plans that I will need to be successful. Each additional plan that I offer, lets call them plan B, C, and D, should have the ability to sign-up 24/7 without approval, possess a trial version option if necessary, and allow for charging of setup costs to get going--if I so choose.</p>
<p><strong>Defining Usage Metrics That Are Meaningful To Me</strong><br />All of my plans will start with these elements, but then should allow me to set any other metric I desire. I want to track on API call, by message, according to bandwidth consumed or stored, the time period in play, the scope of compute being applied, and much, much more. Any of my plans should be able to to measured in these units, or anything else I want to define. If an API plan provides access to a blog, product catalog, the requirements might be different than when I provide access to images, videos, podcasts or other heavy objects. I should be able to define the metrics, and set a price per metric that can be applied to each APIs I am making available.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Limitations For API Access</strong><br />Each of my plans should have well defined units of operations (metrics), cost per unit, and volume pricing, but also should possess limitations of what can be accessed. I need to restrict some plans to a daily amount, limit server loads by only allowing a certain amount of requests, bandwidth, per second, minute, hour, day, week, or month. If I want, I should be able to leave API access open ended. How I define the access for each of my API plans, should be tailored exactly for my intended audience for each plan, with an infinite number of plans possible.</p>
<p><strong>Which APIs Methods Are Available In Each Of My Plan(s)</strong><br />No plans are created equal. Which API resources, and methods, and verbs, are available in any given plan is again, tailored to the intended audience of each plan. My Plan A allows limited reading from just a handful of resources for everyone, while my Plan C allows for reading and writing from a variety of API resources, designed for a specific group of partners, defined by me. My public facing plans encourage consumption of specific resources that I have crafted, while my partner plans encourage two way usage, incentivizing my partners to add, update, and curate information available via the API resources I have made available.</p>
<p><strong>All The Variables I Need To Compose The Plans I Need</strong><br />I can create as many APIs, and individual methods, and package them up into plans, and measure their access by call, bandwidth, storage, time period, compute, and other critical metrics. It is within my control to set limitations, and volume levels of access across these metrics, charging exactly what I need to incentivize API usage, while also covering the costs of my operations, and bring in a healthy bit of revenue in the door as well--I have a full toolbox of what I need to orchestrate my API driven business model(s).</p>
<p><strong>Provide The Features My Consumers Will Need Along With Each Plan</strong><br />Along with the access of API resources within each plan, I need to also bundle other features, like support, service level agreement (SLA), and other resources that consumers will need to be successful with integrations. Again, each plan should be tailored for the intended audience, providing the API access they need, while also makes sure all their adjacent needs are met along the way as well.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-conductor.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Providing Variable Unit(s) of Value For All API Transactions</strong><br />Whether its an API call, bandwidth transmitted, or duration of resource usage, you have measurable units of value, where a price can be set, in a way that lets it be adjusted by volume, or each plan level. An API call might be one cent (for sake of discussion), but if you access more than 10K per day, it goes down to half a cent per API call. For partner plans, each API call might be 1/10th of a cent by default, with 1/100th of a cent if you access more than 10K per day. Each API has its unit of value, with the price for this unit of value variable depending which plan you are in, and how much you consume.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Know What Price To Set For Each Unit Of Access?</strong><br />You have an API, but where do you even start understanding where to price this resource, which you feel is really cool and valuable, but might be completely meaningless to others. You can start by looking at competing API providers, and follow any precedent that has been set in the industry to date. Beyond following the lead of others, you can break down your own story, and dial in exactly what it costs to deliver an API, and set the price for the industry, and lead others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Did Cost To Acquire What Is Need For An API Resources?</strong><br />Every API starts somewhere. What did it take to discover the idea for an API, negotiate or license its usage, or maybe you had to purchase some content, data, or access to a programmatic resources. Before you get to work developing an API, there will be some investment to bring an API idea to production.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Has Gone Into Developing An API?</strong><br />Beyond the acquisition of an API, like the API usage itself, this might be a two way street, it might not just be costs associated, but also investment from other partners, investors, or otherwise. What has gone into normalizing resources, designing and developing the database, server, and the API itself. Consider the network too--what will it take when it comes to network bandwidth, and what are the DNS considerations to manage traffic. Thanks to cloud computing, there are many ways to meter areas like compute, storage, and bandwidth, make sure and put these tools to work for you.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What Are The Realities Of What It Will Cost To Operate An API?</strong><br />What are the costs associated with maintaining the central truth of an API, its definition? What are the hard compute, storage, and bandwidth costs associated with API operations? I'm sure you have a good handle on what these are. How much do you have invested in management, monitoring, security, and evangelism? There are a lot of costs to consider beyond the visible aspects of API operations, but there are also a lot of associated costs to operations that often get left behind like support, and the creation of additional resources.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Let's Discuss Who Will Be Access An API And Our Plan For Different Levels&nbsp;</strong><br />Now we have a better handle of what goes into acquiring, developing, and operating an API, but who actually be accessing the API, and who do we need to offer different plans to, tailored for their relationship with me, and their unique needs. We have discussed the opportunities around free, and free trial access plans, but what about other pro bono approaches like not-for-profit, and educational or research plans, to help eliminate costs for consumers, and encouraging meaningful access.</p>
<p class="p1">Once we have establish the entry levels of access we can begin crafting additional levels of retail, partner, or internal levels of API access. It doesn't need to stop there, you can craft as many plans for API access as needed to meet the needs of every potential group, inside or outside of a company. API providers should work to be as transparent as possible with available plans, and what is available within each plan level, all the way up to partner tiers and potentially reseller or private label tiers of access.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Now That We Have A Better Understand Of What Goes Into Our APIs, How Do We Set Pricing?</strong><br />Even though we know what went into an API, we don't always know how API consumers will perceive the value around an API, so we must be ready to adjust pricing based upon this perception. How we limit, and incentivize usage needs to reflect this value, and the relationship with each group of consumers. There should be paths that incentivize usage, encourage the purchase of resources in bulk, by the timeframe (monthly, quarterly), or maybe at specific times that benefit the provider, or the consumer. Remember, pricing is a two-way street, that can benefit the provider, as well as the consumer, but strike the balance that makes API platforms go round.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Let's Remember There Isn't Always Direct Value Generation From APIs</strong><br />Something that often gets overlooked in API operations is the indirect value they can generate. APIs are a potential marketing vehicle when done right, pushing forward the exposure of a brand, driving web or mobile traffic, or generating valuable data and content through network and application activity. Many of these activities can be measured, just like with direct API consumption, but should be treated different than commercial consumption, and potentially act as marketing, advertising, and word of mouth around the value an API brings to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Greasing The Wheels With Valued Partners</strong><br />Public APIs have dominated the conversation for some time now, but web APIs bring just as much, or more value to trusted partners. APIs make it so I can quickly share the valuable resources I possess with those I feel would benefit most. While I try to make all of my APIs publicly available, it is my partners who get preferred access, and if I do it right, they can generate value via my APIs, and benefit what I am doing. If I do this the right way, I should be able to generate revenue from my APIs, while also sharing that exhaust with my trusted partners, and if they are the right kind of partners, they kick exhaust back my way as well.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Realizing The Value Of APIs Internally</strong><br /><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">As we've learned from the Steve Yegges rant about APIs at Amazon</a>, and&nbsp;as the myth tell us, Bezos ordered everyone at Amazon to use APIs for the exchange of internal API resources. Amazon understood that APIs bring agility, and efficiency when done well, and can help internal groups work together, and like public API access, internal consumers can also have plans tailored specifically for their needs. This is where the true benefits of APIs are evident, and unfortunately is the aspect of APIs that is least discussed out in the open for everyone to learn from.</p>
<p><strong>Units of Value Can Go Both Ways, Depending On Who Is Access An API</strong><br />It is very common for APIs to charge for access, restricting access by some of the common units of value listed above. It is less common for APIs to pay consumers for access APIs, incentivizing the publishing of content, posting of images and videos, and other value generating ways of putting APIs to work. What is the value of the first image added to an API for a business location vs. the 10th photo added? What is the value of encouraging API consumers to add their own content to a a system, augmenting existing information. There are endless ways to encourage developers to contribute to a platform, the only limit is your own plan for defining the boundaries of this participation.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-transfer-cloud.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>We Should Be Making Value Transferrable Across API Providers</strong><br />All of this provides a standardized way for API providers to define the value of API resources, and incentivize usage, while also generating needed revenue. Money is spent accessing some resources, while money is generated for publishing or refining other resources. This two way value generation shouldn't be locked up within each API providers silo, and be transferrable between API providers. In 2015, developers are using not just one or two APIs, they putting many different APIs to work, and while API providers need to cover costs, and generate revenue, so do API consumers. It is two sides of the same coin--the API balance.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Compare The Value Of Value Across API Platforms?</strong><br />The first challenge we will face is transferring this value from one silo to another. Even when platforms have comparable API resources available, rarely will it be an apples to applies comparison. While this exercise gives us a better look into how resources can be defined, and have a price applied to their consumption across multiple plan levels, this is limited to discussion around each individual platform. Before we can compare the value across API platforms, we need to standardize the business model for each API, and establish a ranking system for each provider, that will act as a weight when comparing provider to provider, and across many providers within an industry.</p>
<p>This is just my way of exercising my views around the development of API business models. Next I will explore the concept of API rating in 2015 as I see it, and try to find the linkage to the unit price established as part of API management operations in this post. Everything I discussed above is not hypothetical. It is rooted in API infrastructure solutions provided by companies like 3Scale. To craft this story, I had my 3Scale administrative console open for my own APIs, and theoretically walked through some of the known approaches to API monetization.</p>
<p>Once I am done playing with my thoughts around rating APIs and the resources they provide, I think I'll revisit this post about plans, and craft a formal look at Amazon, Twilio, and other well known APIs, and help provide ready to go API business model blueprint that others can follow. While there is endless ways to experiment and play here, I think most of the API space is just looking for ready to go business models, that are proven and make sense, that they can plug into their operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-rating.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>API rating is a conversation I have several times a year, with different groups, and is a conversation that seems to occurring with a little more frequency in recent months. How do we know which APIs are the good ones? What constitutes a good API? How do we measure whether a contract (the API) is being adhered to, by both API provider, and potentially the consumer as well. How will we establish the Standard &amp; Poors or Moodys for the API economy? These are the API rating conversations I am having with folks.</p>
<p>These are all great questions, and something many companies have approached me looking help in solving, with nobody moving forward with this in a meaningful, and sustainable way. So to help apply some CPR to the subject, I am going to explore API rating some more, from my own point of view, in hopes of guiding some existing conversation I'm already having on the subject, and also hopefully generate some new ones. I want to quantify where we are at with this problem, what work I've put into, and maybe establish an open blueprint that the community might be able help run with.</p>
<p><strong>Starts With API Discovery</strong><br />Before we will ever have a usable approach to API ratings, we are going to have to also work on our API discovery problems. We have one open format, designed to not just index the technical side of APIs, but also the business, and political side of operations--<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. The problem is we haven't reached a critical mass where a machine readable index of API operations is available for most of the public APIs available, as well as private indexes of the APIs that exist behind the firewall. It will take time, but soon, every actor in the API economy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fitbit.com/apis.json">from Fitbit</a>, up to&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.trade.gov/apis.json">the International Trade Administration</a>, will have&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json indexes</a>&nbsp;of their API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Next, What Makes A Good API?</strong><br />There are many things that goes into making an API good, or bad, and unfortunately many of these characteristics are difficult to track on in any sort of automated way. I'd say that API design is the number one complaint against APIs, but until recently there were not really any good ways to measure API consistency across many disparate APIs. I'd say the number two complaint against an API is around the documentation--good, clean, intuitive, and up to date documentation is always telling. However we can talk about API design and API documentation until the cows come home, and will make no progress on solving the question of how to measure, and quantify what a good API is, and what a bad API is.</p>
<p>In reality, there are a number of criteria that could be used to help separate the good APIs from the bad APIs. I've worked to aggregate what I consider to be some of the common building blocks across API design, deployment, management, and almost 20 other stops along the API life-cycle. From this research, I can provide a pretty good starting point for establishing a baseline rating that can be applied against all types of APIs. Part of my motivation in crafting this post, is to organize these thoughts, and publish as a potential v1 open blueprint, to help move conversations forward. I'm not saying this is what should be, but just a list of things to consider as the community contributes something.</p>
<p><strong>The Technology of APIs</strong><br />This is where all API operations, good or bad begin, with the technical implementations of the API itself. When you are dealing with something as technical and abstract as an API, it can be hard separate the technology from everything else, but I feel it is an important exercise, even if I don't always get it right. Here are some of the technological aspects to consider when rating APIs from the technical view:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design</strong>&nbsp;- How is the API designed? Is it simple, web-focused, and follows moderns conventions, and leverage HTTP over language specific characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;- What sort of authentication technology is employed? Are modern approaches from &nbsp;basic keys, too tokens, and OAuth employed?</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>&nbsp;- Is the API available? Our there significant outages involved in recent times, and what is the overall track record for a platform.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>&nbsp;- Will the API scale technically, and meet the demand of its users. Does the underlying code, server, and database scale with the demand.</li>
<li><strong>Code Resources&nbsp;</strong>- What extra code resources area available around an API from CLI to SDKs, and starter kits. Code resources play big role in API success.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks -&nbsp;</strong>The presence of webhooks for me, tells me that a platform operates as a two way street, contributes to availability, and scalability, and a nod towards real-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To establish a true rating criteria, you would need to break many of these things down, and establish a way of actually validating in a programmatic way. You would need to be able to look for consistent API design patterns, usage of HTTP status codes, and how available and scalable a platform is. With most of the technology of an API hidden behind the facade, you are left with little to go on, but the design, authentication pattern, availability, scalability, and any other technical resources that are made available.</p>
<p><strong>The Business of APIs</strong><br />I have worked hard to understand the line between the tech, and the business of API operations. I feel this separation is critical to truly understanding why APIs work. Like the technology behind, the business approaches to API operations can be subjective, and vary from provider to provider. However, in my work I have found some ways of identifying the healthy business practices, as well as some unhealthy business practices that exist in the space.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation -&nbsp;</strong>The availability of simple, intuitive, up to date API documentation, usually of the interactive kind is standard operating procedure of good APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration -</strong>&nbsp;Self-service, 24/7 registration for API access is a hallmark of good APIs--leaving access considerations dealt with via multiple tiers of API plans.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model -</strong>&nbsp;A clear business model, and pricing is always present in the good APIs. It can be easy to spot the bad apples, because they tend to only be free.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- What support resources area available? Are there multiple channels of self-service, or direct support that have regular person behind the scenes supporting?</li>
<li><strong>Communication -</strong>&nbsp;Does an API platform communicate? Are there multiple channels like a blog, Twitter, or other social accounts available?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Change -&nbsp;</strong>How often, and rapid is change on the platform, and are changes communicated through a road-map, and other available channels?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>An API platform reflects the core business values of the company that operates it. The business of an API sets the tone for their entire community, something API consumers can contribute to, but it is ultimately left to the platform provider to set overall. It is fairly easy to identify bad actors, because of significant gaps in the business model, support, and communication around platform operations. There are many other aspects of API business operations to consider, but this provides a good base to start.</p>

<p><strong>The Politics of APIs</strong><br />In the last three years, another significant line has emerged when determining which APIs are good ones, and which are the bad ones. While much of this area depends on legal building blocks of API operations, I call it the politics of APIs, because it tends to reflect the politics of a company, or maybe the industry it resides in. Some of these areas will make or break APIs, and definitely put them in the good or bad bucket.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -&nbsp;</strong>What is in a terms of service? Are the heavily weighted towards the platform, or do they allow for innovation by consumers, within the ecosystem?</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Policy -</strong>&nbsp;What does privacy look like on a platform? What do official policies state, and what does actual practice look like on the platform, and among consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Platform Security -&nbsp;</strong>How is security handled across platform operations? How open is a platform about their security policies. This will be the number one criteria going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency -&nbsp;</strong>How transparent is a company with platform operations, and the overall roadmap. Is there an adversarial relationship with community, or an open, collaborative one?</li>
<li><strong>Licensing -&nbsp;</strong>What software, content, and data license are in place? How is the API interface, server, and client code licensed, as well as the supporting content, and resources for the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits -</strong>&nbsp;What rate limits are imposed by the provider, and are they consistent and fair across access plans? Do rate limits favor the platform or consumer?</li>
<li><strong>Investment -</strong>&nbsp;Who is invested in the company behind an API platform? Where in the investment cycle is a company, and how much money has been invested?</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just a handful of the political elements of API platform operations, but they are the usual suspects when it comes to determining the good APIs from the bad ones. This area tends to be the hardest to nail down area of how we would rate API providers in my eperience. This is where the most amount of smoke and mirrors is deployed, and nothing is ever what it seems, but this area makes or breaks many API operations, in more situations than the other technical and business elements listed.</p>
<p>The areas I provided across the technical, business, and political considerations for rating APIs as good or bad, can be broken down much further. I have specific questions that should be asked about API design, communication, and platform licensing, but for this discussion I just wanted to highlight the core groups of considerations. The separation between these areas, as well as the overlap is tough to see sometimes, but is something that is coming into focus, with the more APIs that I look at through this lens.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Make One Such API Rating Model Work?</strong><br />With a rating definition in hand (theoretically) how do we move forward actually making this a reality. This is a huge problem, one very few people or companies truly grasp the scope of, and one that wave of new startups think they can solve, only to watch ALL of them fail. This is a problem that I feel will take four distinct groups to make happen, each bringing their own assets to the table, when it comes to making one such API rating model work.</p>
<p><strong>The Essential API Provider Signals</strong><br />What information can API providers share, and what signals are the sending, either consciously, or unconsciously, that can be included as part of a rating system? There are numerous aspects of API operations on the open Internet, that are ripe for discovery, monitoring, and ultimately rating how a provider approaches their operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog -</strong>&nbsp;An active blog is a great way to understand the viability, tone, and overall presence of an API provider, with a RSS bonus for monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter -</strong>&nbsp;An active Twitter account is second to a blog, when it comes to understanding&nbsp;the viability, tone, and overall presence of an API provider.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Github -</strong>&nbsp;The social coding platform is quickly surpassing Twitter and a blog as the most important signal an API can send about their viability as a platform.</li>
<li><strong>Press -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A regular PR drumbeat out of a company is a great to understand the investment into any platform, and the tone that it will take in the community.</li>
<li><strong>Road-map -</strong> The regular update, and sharing of the platforms road-map providing as much information as possible about what is coming down the road for the platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may sound silly to track on such basic things, but when a platform is about to die, the blog and Twitter accounts go silent, and you see diminished activity on Github. These content and social signals are the heartbeat of modern API operations. If you aren't telling stories, being social, and pushing code on a regular basis, your overall rating in the space goes down.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-signals.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>The Signals From The Community, Industry, and Open Web</strong><br />What is the community saying about a platform? This is one of the benefits of being a public API operation is you can generate the right signals across the space that attract other developers, businesses, analysts, and generally open you up for inclusion in any potential API rating systems. What are some of the common signals the community sends, that could be gathered as part of an open API rating system?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog Sharing -</strong>&nbsp;Which blogs posts were shared across the community, and at large on social networks, and bookmarking sites?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Followers -&nbsp;</strong>How many Twitter followers does a platform have? Did they buy them?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Retweets -&nbsp;</strong>What gets retweeted by the Twitter community? What is the echo from platform operations?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Favorites -&nbsp;</strong>How many tweets have been favorited? Even if this is just for bookmarking, it acknowledges people are paying attention.</li>
<li><strong>Github Followers -</strong>&nbsp;How many Github followers does a platform have?</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo Stars -</strong>&nbsp;How many stars has been received across a platforms repositories?</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo Forks -</strong>&nbsp;How many repositories have been forked, and how many times?</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo Watchers -&nbsp;</strong>Are they watchers of a platforms Github repository? How many?</li>
<li><strong>Platform Stories -</strong>&nbsp;What other stories are told about an API provider, via popular tech blogs, and other industry news.</li>
<li><strong>QA &amp; Forum Discussions -&nbsp;</strong>What is the presence, and conversation on sites like Stack Exchange and Quora, and what is the overall sentiment?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the signals I tune into, when it comes to monitoring what API providers are up to across the sector. While there are no absolutes when it comes to these data points, they provide me a buffet of information to make my own decisions around, when it comes to what the community is thinking regarding any particular platform.</p>
<p><strong>What The Almighty Analysts Gods Think About An API Platform</strong></p>
<p>The third area that has a significant influence on the API space, is the analyst perspective. I put myself in this category, as I make a living analyzing the API sector. If we are going to strike a balance across the internal provider, and the public view of any single company, and its API offerings, we will need an informed analyst community to weigh in. Here are just a handful of the data points I include in my own analyst ranking variable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>My Notes -</strong>&nbsp;How many occurrences of a company are there in my notebook?</li>
<li><strong>My Curation -&nbsp;</strong>How many times have I bookmarked and curated a post from, or about a platform?</li>
<li><strong>My Posts -&nbsp;</strong>Have I written stories about a company? How many?</li>
<li><strong>My White Papers -&nbsp;</strong>Has a platform being referenced, or featured in one of my white papers or guides?</li>
<li><strong>My Tweets -</strong>&nbsp;Have I tweeted anything from a platforms Twitter account? Or a mention about them?</li>
<li><strong>My Gut -</strong>&nbsp;What is my general feeling, and gut reaction to an API platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>This reflects my own criteria that goes into my analyst ranking for a company, and yes, I have a tool that helps me calculate this across the companies, and individuals I track on. Other analysts are probably going to have their own formula, but is something I'd love to start seeing shared by the community--how do experts in the space, feel about existing APIs, and their technical, business, and political approach to API operations.</p>
<p><strong>There Is Always A Role For Government To Play In All Of This</strong><br />Whether you believe in the power of government or not, there will always be a role, both positive and potentially negative, for government of all shapes and sizes to play in this API rating system. Like other data points considered as part of this rating system, the following data points should be considered, but will mean different things to different folks, and APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filings -&nbsp;</strong>What are the SEC, IRS, and other government filings by companies who operate API platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Investigations -</strong>&nbsp;What are ongoing investigations by government agencies into companies who operate API platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Stories -</strong>&nbsp;What are some of the leaks, and other stories being told in media and government circles about how companies are viewed.</li>
<li><strong>Patents -&nbsp;</strong>Are there patent filings by specific platforms that impact the overall API space, down to specific industries.</li>
<li><strong>Legal -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;What court battles are being waged, at any level of our legal system, that impact specific platforms, and the industries they operate in.</li>
<li><strong>Legislation -&nbsp;</strong>What legislation is being planned, or is on the books that impact any specific sector an API provider operates in.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of government induced influences that could impact the rating any particular API platform may receive. Patents could be seen as strengths or even weaknesses, and existing court battles, filings, investigations, and other government influenced decisions may weigh into rating decisions as well. The involvement by the government of all sizes is only going to increase in the API economy.</p>
<p><strong>It Will Take Everyone Working Together To Make This Work</strong><br />A realistic API rating system or systems, will take work between all the groups listed above. API providers will have to step up and be more transparent, and share the data they possess. The developer community, API service providers, and the public at large will have to share information, and knowledge they accumulate from across the space. Analysts are going to have to step up, providing leadership and analysis across all industries, as well as within specific industries. The government will play a role in not just regulating industries, but also being API providers, and consumers themselves, providing valuable data, and aggregate resources, as well as informed analysis from the vital public sector perspective.</p>

<p><strong>How Do We Make Sure An Share An Open Blueprint For Rating Algorithm(s) Exists?</strong><br />This post is just an executive summary of the summary data points I'd like to see in a potential open API rating algorithm. Ultimately I'd like to see an API-Rating outline published to Github, outlining all of the areas I track on. I'm happy to be caretaker of these open blueprints, and use Github to store the algorithm, and public or proprietary data that goes into the end rating. Ultimately it should be an open, and transparent blueprint that anyone can follow, or contribute to.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Models For Incentivizing The Investing Of Open And Proprietary Data In Rating Algorithm(s)</strong><br />In establishing an open blueprint, and house the algorithm for an open API rating blueprint, I have ideas about how we can store open, and even proprietary datasets that goes into different areas of the API rating system. Using a Github organization, a series of public, and private repositories, it is easy enough to provide a central place for everything to live. I've seen evidence of strong currents in the space that will swoop in and snatch up tooling and specification that gains adoption in the space, and know there will be many groups who seek to influence the rating system disproportionately--it has to be an open blueprint, and have the ability to support public and private data, from a variety of players, that will drive the rating results.</p>
<p><strong>This Will All Take Time, But We Need To Start Somewhere</strong><br />As with the <a href="http://apisjson.org">API discovery work I'm doing with APIs.json</a>, I know this is a long game, and will not happen overnight. APIs are the driving force behind the growth in online commerce, social, cloud, mobile, and devices, touching almost every industry in 2015, the need for not just discovery of high quality APIs, but also being able to rate them, is only going to increase. We have to begin somewhere, and while some of what I propose seems far-fetched, it represents my efforts to define a rating algorithm, and I am the only person to put anything forward, beyond thinking it should be a startup.</p>
<p>I have most of the v1 algorithm available, it would just take some work to hammer into a coherent road-map. I have some of the data needed to get a v1 rating off the ground, going back to 2011 and 2012. With some work we could pull together other missing data. However to make this work, it would require API providers to step up and share data, and API service providers to do the same. Many leading API providers will be unwilling to participate, because they are rated highly without a rating system. It will be new APIs that will be willing to contribute to such as system, in hopes they can compete with the existing leaders.</p>
<p>I see, what I'm calling API Rating, as something that needs to evolve alongside my API discovery, and API monetization research. I will setup a project, and help me tune into the bigger picture. i will also formalize my look into crafting API plans, that are driven by the business model, and monetization goals of companies playing in the API game. Alright, moving on to crafting some blueprints for Twilio, SendGrid, and other common messaging APIs for their API plans, and API rating...then we'll do some comparison, and see how any of this will actually make sense in the wild.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Oct 2015</span>
        <p>After writing&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/i-have-a-bunch-of-api-resources-now-i-need-a-plan-or-potentially-several-plans/">I Have A Bunch Of API Resources, Now I Need A Plan, Or Potentially Several Plans</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">How Are We Going To Create The Standard And Poors And Moodys For The API Economy</a>, I wanted to combine what I had learned while crafting these stories, and try to look at how these two areas could work together. The API plan and pricing research is derived from <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm&quot;,">existing approaches to API service composition introduced by providers like 3Scale,</a> however the rating portion is fresh territory for me, with very few precedents to follow.</p>
<p>What I see when I start wading through a structured approach for API providers to craft meaningful API plans to serve up their API resources through, and how developers will be paying for API usage, via the apps they build, I begin to see the potential of a structured approach to API plans, and pricing. When you start thinking of the implications across providers, and consider the opportunities for developers to manage API consumption across API providers, and exchange the credits they purchased, or generated via API usage--a potential blueprint for an economic engine for the API space begins to emerge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to explore this concept, by crafting a visualization, and ponder how common approaches to API plans, and pricing, could be complimented by a standardized API industry rating system.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/API-plans-API-pricing-API-rating.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The only thing really original in this diagram, is the introduction of an API rating system, and the potential for developers being able to exchange credits between the API service providers they depend on. The rest of this standard API management approaches, that are defined by API providers like 3Scale. If you aren't familiar with modern approaches to API service composition, API providers can have many different API resources, as well as many different plans for subscribing to these API services, which provide a wealth of dimension for API providers to define, price, and limit how developers put API resources to use in applications.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>T Circle</strong>&nbsp;in the above diagram is where the current magic happens, when you put modern API management solutions to work for API operations. This allows you to mix and match access to your API resources, charging different prices, to different developer groups, introduce volume usage levels, and measure as many dimensions of consumption as you desire. Rarely do successful APIs have just one rate of access to them, this approach to API management allows providers to maximize access to resources, while also maximizing potential revenue around subscriptions, and usage consumption.</p>
<p>When you start putting API providers into standard API plans, and pricing framework like this, you start seeing intra-provider opportunities, industry wide benefits, as well as potential to really make API consumers lives much easier. If there were standardized ways to understand how API providers were pricing their resources, and how they tiered access, and adjusted pricing between these tiers, the API industry competition would heat up significantly. The problem comes in when you start allowing developers to transfer credits from provider to provider, while it may seem like you are transferring common units of value, but in many cases there are big differences between each API provider and what the value of one transaction may be.</p>
<p>Once you introduce an API rating system to the equation, it provides one possible way for rating each provider, and setting a benchmark that can be used to exchange credits between each platform. If each provider operated in a credit format, that could be cashed out using an exchange rate, or possible transferred from one platform to another, you'd start to see some potentially interesting market effects. I think you'd quickly see some negative, as well as positive effects, but I think some balance could be struck between some of the common API resources being served, and consumed across the API space. Newer resources, with fewer precedent would be very volatile for a period of time.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>R Circle</strong>&nbsp;in the above diagram is mean to reflect the potential of an industry wide API rating system, when you have standardized information on API pricing, across API providers. This pricing would vary across the plans each provider offers, but you could still come up with a median pricing for individual providers, and even entire industries. When you apply the rating system you could provide a potential exchange rate that could be applied when moving credits bought, and earned via each API platform, between API providers. Developers could explore which platforms allow them generate credits by engaging with API resources, exchange to other providers, where they could then spend the credits for other services they need, in lieu of cash. This also opens up the possibilities for markets for API credits exchanged across business sectors being impacted by APIs.</p>
<p>I'm just exploring concepts involved with common approaches to API plans and pricing, and brainstorming a potential API rating system, then using my imagination to understand the developer, and industry implications of this one possible future. Only one part of this equation exists, and it would take some significant work to bring such a thing into reality, but it is fun to explore, and consider one possible design for an economic engine, that could possibly scale, and drive the API industry.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/10/29/api-visualization-exploration-using-api-definitions/">API Visualization Exploration Using API Definitions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apihandyman.io/swagger/swagger-specification-visual-documentation/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/swagger-specification-visual-documentation.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are number of areas across the API life-cycle that are being expanded upon in the current space, thanks to the evolution of API definition formats like Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML. One area I haven't seen as much growth as I'd like, is in the area of <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">visualizations driven by API definitions</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two distinct pools of API definition driven visualization: 1) Letting you visualize the surface area of an API 2) Letting you visualize the resource made available via an API. One area my friend the <a href="https://twitter.com/apihandyman">@APIHandyman</a> has been exploring is around the surface area of API.</p>
<p>@APIHandyman has a nice prototype created that he is calling "<a href="http://apihandyman.io/swagger/swagger-specification-visual-documentation/">Swagger Specification Visual Documentation</a>". The API Definition driven visualization uses A <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js visualization</a> to help you explore the surface area of any API that is defined using Swagger. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/06/my-wish-has-been-granted-swagger-driven-api-visualizations-from-ardoq/">I have written about API definition driven visualizations before</a>, so I am happy to see the concept being pushed forward, as we have a lot of iterations to cycle through before we find a visualization format(s) that works for different API designers, architects, and developers.</p>
<p>The visual documentation that @APIHandyman created runs on Github, and he is looking for feedback on the micro tool, and where he should take it next. He recently added a bigger information display area, but could use the communities ideas on how to make it more useful. This type of work is a time drain. Every time I started playing with Swagger + D3.js I would lose an entire evening, and have very little to show for work, so I know how valuable feedback can be.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/30/swagger-visualization-layer-using-d3js/">API definition driven D3.js visualizations </a>will be the future of API design, management, and orchestration. APIs are going to continue to grow in number, and scope, and we will need simple, visual ways we can quickly traverse the landscape, and makes sense of things. If you are working on an API definition driven visualization tool, either for the surface area of an API, or helping visualize the actual resources being served up, please let me know so I can showcase.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/10/29/an-api-idea-http-status-code-clinic/">An API Idea: HTTP Status Code Clinic</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-clinic.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is one of my ideas for an API service provider, that I will never get time to do, but would love to see exist in the space, so I am happy to put out there for someone else to do. I'm calling this one an HTTP Status Code Clinic, which would be an API definition driven API service provider (why would you do it any other way in 2015), that would help API providers tailor more useful, and meaningful HTTP status codes.</p>
<p>HTTP Status Code Clinic would be a simple software as a service, complete with its own API (why would you do it any other way in 2015), and CLI for operating as well. You would pass it a Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML, or any other API definition format, and it would return a bunch of feedback on HTTP status codes returned (or not). The process could anchor the feedback in the current API design, while also providing HTTP status code education along the way.</p>
<p>The service would have to get crafty around how it walked through an API, requesting sample data, or requiring default values for query parameters, headers, body, etc. If it was done well it could be done as a kind of wizard that walked the user through each endpoint, what was returned, and might be better solutions, as well as additional status codes that could be used. You could also include examples from popular APIs like Twilio, Twitter, and others, to show what is possible.</p>
<p>I recommend you do this as a standalone service. While it might be nice to have as part of an existing service provider stack, I think it makes more sense to offer as a standalone clinic / service that API providers could use when they are ready. API designers and architects could make it part of the API design and definition portion of their life-cycle, as well as integrate into their existing systems using the&nbsp;HTTP Status Code Clinic API--other API service providers could also integrate the features into their tooling using the API</p>
<p>This is an open API idea, yours for the taking, it you want more detail from me on how I'd approach, I would be willing to do some tech investment for a piece of the action. Good luck!</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://apimatic.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apimatic-sdks.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the discussions we are having <a href="http://apiware.io/">behind the scenes at APIWare.io</a>, is whether we should be hand-crafting, or auto-generating SDKs for the clients we are working with on the design, deployment, and management of their APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is easy--we do both!&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many situations where I would push for the <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">API SDKs</a> to be hand-crafted, and designed for a specific API, as well as specific language or platform. However, with the increase in the number of APIs, and simplicity of some of the APIs I work with, crafting an API definition, and <a href="https://apimatic.io/">auto-generating your SDKs using a service like APIMATIC</a>, makes sense.</p>
<p>I've cracked open the APIMATIC SDKs, and only being fluent in JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and C#, I can only speak to these realms of operation, but I'm happy with what the APIMATIC team is producing. For me, this isn't a black and white game, it isn't hand-crafted vs. autogenerated--it is how you employ both approaches across your API operations.</p>
<p><a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC provides high quality SDKs in 10 languages</a>, some languages I do not speak. The APIWare.io team has a wealth of programming talent on the team, and while we could hand code libraries across these areas, for all of our clients, for many of the more straightforward APIs, it just makes sense to generate. We are already an API-definition first shop, where we craft Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML, or other required API definition format, so using this to generate SDKs makes sense in many situations.</p>
<p>Are you trying to figure out the best path forward for providing high quality SDKs for your API?Llet me know how my APIWare team can help.

        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://alternate.apievangelist.com/blog/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-design-fiction.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been writing some fictional stories on a project site I have called <a href="http://alternate.kinlane.com/blog/">Alternate Kin Lane</a> for some time now. Writing fictional stories in the tech space has provided a sort of pressure release valve for me, giving me a quick creative outlet throughout the week. Honestly, there are more stories in my notebook, than there are on the actual blog, but this is a sign for me that I need to spend more time working in this area.</p>
<p>I am making several shifts in my work lately, in response to kind of hitting the wall recently, a process that includes rethinking how I work on projects, and <a href="http://kinlane.com/2015/10/27/striking-the-right-balance-with-api-evangelist-partners/">partner with folks in the API space</a>, as well as an increased focus on the fictional side of my writing. I do not just want to write fiction that is derived from the tech space. I want to write fiction that helps me formulate my own view of the space, and who knows, maybe influence the space in similar ways my regular tech blogging has over the last five years.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with the concept of design fiction, it "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_fiction">is a method of critical design that uses fictional and narrative scenarios to envision, explain and raise questions about possible futures for design and the society</a>." Up until now I was just dumping some random, crazy ideas into my fiction notebook, and taking the time to publish a few of these on Alternate Kin Lane. Now I'd like to try and bring a little closer to my daily API monitoring and research, and see if I can use to explore concepts around the tech, business, and politics of the API space--which is touching pretty much every aspect of our personal and business lives in 2015, leaving a pretty wide playing field.</p>
<p>I think some of my writing on <a href="http://alternate.apievangelist.com/blog/">Alternate API Evangelist</a> will be just as dark as some of the stuff I've written on Alternate Kin Lane, but hoping my voice will evolve, and become more nuanced with time. The medium allows me to work through some potentially volatile concepts in a hopefully safer space--meaning, it gives me a quick out with people who disagree. It is fiction! ;-) I'm hoping this helps me work through unlimited number of scenarios that apply to the API space, but also gives me a place to vent, when the tech space gets me down--which seems to be quite often lately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I want this fictional layer of my research to be tightly woven to my regular API industry research, I also want the separation between fact and fiction to be very clear. I will put the hashtag <em><strong>#apidesignfiction</strong></em> in each story title, as well has clearly stating that it is fiction on the page, like I do with Alternate Kin Lane. This way any tweets, or social shares set expectations right away, clearly showing this is a different way of exploring the API space for me--not the API space we have, but the one we might have, or maybe should have, or maybe will have if we don't get our shit together!</p>

When you think about it, if a company is selling a product or service to API providers, encouraging an API focus--they should probably have APIs. :-)</p>
<p>As I was updating some of the news, companies, and reviewing the common building blocks I have aggregated across the 20 areas of research, I just poked my head around to see if I could find an API for each service provider. There are many things that look like a language specific API, but I am looking for a clear developer / API area, with a coherent web API available, as we'd expect from API providers in 2015.</p>
<p>After spending a couple hours looking through my core research, I found the following service providers, in the follow areas, actually had web APIs available:</p>

<p>This was my first pass through all of my core research looking for APIs, so I am sure I missed some--let me know which ones I missed. My design, hypermedia, performance, monetization, evangelism, embeddable, client, SDK, visualization, and virtualization didn't have any clear leaders who had easy to find APIs. I will update as I find them--which smells like an opportunity to me.</p>
<p>Eventually I'd like to see some common definitions to be established across all these areas of the API space, but as you can see, like the rest of the API space, there is a lot of work to be done. Now that I have a list of API service providers who have APIs, I can start crafting, and aggregating API definitions for all the APIs. Once i've done this I can start looking for the overlap across them, and see if I can highlight the common patterns, and establish some bridges for the differences between them.</p>
<p>Every potential stage of the API life-cycle will have to be automated in the future, and ironically APIs will be how we do that.</p>

        <p><a href="https://securedb.co"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/secure-db-on-premise.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was talking through the features, and roadmap for <a href="https://securedb.co">SecureDB</a> with their team the other day, and one of the conversations that came up was around <a href="https://securedb.co/encryption-features/">on-premise opporutnities for deploying encrypted user, data, and file APIs</a>. In my opinion, on-premise is something that has morphed from meaning "in our data center", to where wherever we store data and run our compute power--which could be spread across multiple cloud vendors.</p>
<p><a href="https://securedb.co">SecureDB offers an extremely valuable API commodity in 2015, encrypted user, data, and file stores</a>--something EVERY website and mobile application should have as part of their back-end. When you have something this valuable, and potentnially ubiquitous, it needs to run wherever it is needed. With this in mind SecureDB is available on demand, as a retail API solution, but they will also deploy it for you "on-premise" on AWS or Heroku, with "more platforms in the roadmap".</p>
<p>While a wholesale, on-premise, deploy anywhere API will not be required for all APIs, as some SaaS solutions won't benefit from this type of distribution, if you are a core architectural building block, or utility APIs like SecureDB, to compete in the API economy, your API will have to deployable to anywhere it is needed. With the explosion of Docker and Kubernetes, your API should technically be able to able to be deployed in any containerized environment, with a business model, licensing, and legal framework to support the different use cases.</p>
<p>The ability to deploy your API on Heroku is just a gateway drug to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/a-peek-at-the-future-with-white-label-apis/">the wholesale, white lable, containerized, API economy</a> that is coming, where the most agile, flexible, and interoperable APIs will dominate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you probably know, I'm always up for learning about APIs, so when <a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@Darrel_Miller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gblock">@GBlock</a> started doing their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRYw8VY7mFUg78AEuIbtyg">In the Mood for HTTP podcast</a>, I was all in. Both Darrel and Glenn are API experts, and respected leaders in the space, but more importantly both of them are super nice guys, and reflect a tone I love to experience and support across the API space.</p>
<p>The format for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRYw8VY7mFUg78AEuIbtyg">In The Mood For HTTP</a> is simple. The audience asks questions, and Darrel and Glenn discuss. They are both very graceful in how they answer questions, extremely knowledgeable on the subjects at hand, but they are also very opinionated, and they don't always agree--the exchange between them is educational, and very benefitial to the wider API community.</p>
<p>The API duo has quickly produced three episodes. I am listening to episode three as I write this post. My only critique of the podcast is I'd like to see better indexing of the episodes, with easy text version of the questions, and a link to that specific time in the Youtube videos. I'd love to have a library of these organized in a sort of API FAQ, that I can share with my readers, and reference throughout my storytelling.</p>
<p>I'm going to explore how I can get more involved, and provide some questions, and help drive their conversations. I've enjoyed doing this with <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>, and other API related podcasts that have emerged. On this note, I encourage anyone to create their own podcast in the space, and explore finding your voice when it comes to conversations in the API space. I know many voices across the space, who I hear at API conferences like <a href="https://twitter.com/APIStrat">@APIStrat</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/APIDaysGlobal">@APIDaysGlobal</a>, which I'd like to hear in more real-time, as Darrel and Glenn are doing--if you do, I'll help support!</p>
<p>Keep up the good work you guys!</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/11/some-potentially-very-powerful-api-orchestration-with-the-amazon-api-gateway/">As I've written several posts on the recent Amazon API Gateway release</a>, one of the side things I noted about the API solution from AWS, was that API monitoring is baked in by default. As stated on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway page</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>After your API is deployed, Amazon API Gateway provides you with a dashboard to visually monitor calls to your services using Amazon CloudWatch, so you see performance metrics and information on API calls, data latency, and error rates.</em></p>
<p>This may seem like common sense to many people who have been in the API space for a while now, but for many API designers, architects, developers, and business folk who are just getting going, API monitoring may not be default for all implementations.</p>
<p>To me, AWS baking in <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring</a> by default, demonstrates that the world of API monitoring has matured, marking an important milestone that all API providers should pay attention to. I've been watching this space grow over the last couple years, and similar to the API management space, the AWS release reflects the overall health of the API sector.</p>
<p>If you are operating any API In 2015, monitoring should be standard operating procedure, alongside your API documentation.</p>

<p>It can be difficult to know where to start when it comes storytelling around an API. Many of us who have been in the space, have followed the lead of Twitter, Twilio, Amazon, and others, but when you are new to the space, knowing where to start can often be paralyzing. This is something I am regularly helping clients and partners think through, and while&nbsp;<a href="https://securedb.co/">I'm thinking through the topic with SecureDB</a>, I figured I'd share the details with you my readers.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">If you are unfamiliar with how the API Evangelist network operates, I have common building blocks available for almost 20 core stops along the API lifecycle</a>. However, when many of my partners and clients are just getting going, they are often overwhelmed by the volume of data I provide, so I regularly find myself tailoring, and distilling down a specific strategy for each conversation I engage in. I wanted to help SecureDB understand where they can start with evangelism from day one, by providing a 101 list for API evangelism, but before I could do this, I needed to make sure they had a few API building blocks in place first.</p>
<p>Wait...before we got going with a 101 API evangelism list, let's make sure the most essential element is present?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value</strong>&nbsp;- Check! Encryption for all your data in this climate is critical.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Now, let's make sure the minimum viable&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a>&nbsp;are in place to support evangelism efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-boarding</strong>

</ul>
<p class="p2">With this base, now I can explore some initial&nbsp;<a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API evangelism building blocks</a>&nbsp;SecureDB can think about:</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Projects -&nbsp;</strong>What are some projects we could kick off exploring for storytelling purposes?  
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Users -&nbsp;</strong>Let's show basic example that secures a user base for any application.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Data -&nbsp;</strong>Move a little further and secure the data for an application.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Files -&nbsp;</strong>Beyond data, let's show how to secure files used as part of an application.</li>

<p>This list personalized for SecureDB, from the numerous building blocks I've aggregated across API management and evangelism strategies I've helped craft, and gathered by watching the approach of leading API providers. This is why I partner with companies like SecureDB, so that I can move forward, and ultimately share the information I've gathered, personalized in different ways, as a regular drumbeat on my blog(aka storytelling). It helps me evolve my ideas, share them with partners and clients, as well as with you my readers.</p>
<p>This is just an example of what I do behind the scenes for my partners, and an&nbsp;<a href="http://apiware.io">example of the approach brought to the table by my APIWare partner</a>. Let me know if we can help you get over the hump with your API strategy, whether you are at the beginning of the journey like SecureDB, or further down the line--I am happy to talk to you at any stage.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2015</span>

<p><a href="https://lockr.io/">An API key management service targeting Drupal developers came across my radar this week</a>. The service is very focused, in that it is a Drupal module, and is focused on helping Drupal developers manage the keys they use across a single app or installation, but I think it represents a potentially larger trend.</p>
<p>I think this particular solutions is just a symptom of a growing problem for developers of any type--how do you manage the number of keys you are depending on for you application(s). API consumers are in need of a plug and play way of to store, access, and manage the increasing number of API keys they put in use, otherwise we will be looking at a pretty serious security problem, adding to the existing security issues API providers and consumers face.</p>
<p>If you need evidence of the viability of API Key management solutions, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS has one</a>. Ok, why don't developer just use AWS? Well they should if it makes sense, but we also need other competing, and complimentary key management solutions, to ensure a healthy API space. Not all users are going to need full-blown IAM solutions, they just need a simple, encrypted place to put all their keys, and some utilities to help them manage them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I store my keys in a JSON config file stored in the private Github repo for any application I develop, and for each org, I have some crude API key management utilities to help me manage turnover. My server apps can cache the config file locally, and my client side apps run on Github Pages, using SSL, and Github OAuth to open up API key access they need.</p>
<p>I will be keeping an eye out for more API key management solutions, and begin the process of documenting the building blocks of these product and services, like I do with other areas. If you are looking to develop an API key management solution, feel free to reach out, as I have some feedback for your road-map along the way, and existing tools you could use to make it easier.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>I had a follower tweet out an interesting question about successful patterns for multi-linguarl APIs, which I thought was interesting enough to share as a story, adding to my research, and helping me tune into the topic better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the API economy unfolds, and APIs make their way into more countries around the globe, the need to standardize how we internationalize different layers of our API operations is only going to increase--making these types of conversation starters very important.</p>

<p>I see two key building block that I can extract from this conversation. One being&nbsp;Accept-Language for dictating which language your API should be speaking, and two, using a query string lang= to tell your documentation what language it should be speaking. I've added both as <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API design building blocks</a>, and the documentation reference to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a>.</p>
<p>I love questions like this, because it puts these topics on my radar, and after writing a post about it, and adding as some common building blocks, the chances I will explore further dramatically increases. This is the side of my research that keeps me getting up and sitting down at the pooter each day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/7/2538031/zypr-launches-voice-control-for-every-device">Shortly after the Zypr voice API came on to the scene in 2011</a>, I launched <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">my research into voice APIs</a>. Like many other areas of the API universe, voice has come in and out of focus for me, something I think will take much longer to unfold, than any of us could have ever imagined. Zypr quickly ran out of steam, and other similar solutions have come and gone over the last couple years as well, leaving my research pretty scattered across many different concepts of how voice and APIs are colliding--lacking any real coherency.</p>
<p>I took a moment last week to take a fresh look at my <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice API research</a>, because of a comment by Steven Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>), the CEO of <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>. Its not an exact quote, but Steve spoke about how voice is the future of API consumption, after he had attended the AWS:Reinvent in Las Vegas. I agree with him. Voice APIs is a topic that has been significantly stimulated with the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/echo">introduction of the Amazon Echo platform</a>, but I also feel also coincides with a critical mass of available API driven resources that will deliver some of the value these platforms are promising users.</p>
<p>Voice recognition has always been something that leaves a lot to be desired--think Siri. Even with these challenges there are many dimensions to the voice API discussion, and with the amount of resources now available via simple APIs in 2015, I feel we are reaching a more fertile, and friendly time for voice solutions to return the value end-users desire. We now have a rich playing field of weather, news, stocks, image, video, podcast, and other data, content, rich media, and programmatic resources, which can be linked to specific voice commands--something we didn't have before.</p>
<p>While there is still so much work to be done, but I agree with Steve's vision, that voice will play an increasingly significant role as an API client. I would add that like mobile, or the recent wave of wearables, voice will have special constraints when it comes to API design, further requiring API providers keep their APIs simple, and reflect how users will experience them, not just being a SELECT * FROM table WHERE q = 'search', with a URL bound to it.</p>
<p>I think the API providers who are further along in their journey, will get a boost as voice evolves as an API client, and voice enabled app developers are able to easily integrate valuable API driven resources into their solutions. Even with my new found optimism about voice APIs, I still think we are years away from voice solutions actually living up to, even a small portion of the hype they seem to get over the years. Regardless, I'll be working to keep a closer eye on things, and will be sharing via <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">my voice API research</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-puzzle-round.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been tagging companies that I come across in my research, and stories that I find with the term "orchestration" for some time now. Some of this overlaps with what we know as cloud-centric orchestration using Puppet or Chef, but I am specifically looking for how we orchestrate across the API lifecycle which I feel overlaps with cloud orchestration, but pushes into some new realms.</p>
<p>As I'm carving off my orchestration research, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/06/some-thoughts-for-the-coming-wave-of-api-hubs-garages-and-workbenches/">I am also spending time reviewing a newer breed of what I'm calling API hubs, workspaces, or garages</a>. Over the last year, I've broken out <a href="http://ide.apievangelist.com/">IDE research</a> from my overall <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API Discovery</a> research, and <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDK</a> from my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API Management</a> research, and <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">client</a> from my API Integration research. In parallel with an API-centric way of life, I want all my research to be as modular as possible, allowing me to link it together into meaningful ways that help me better understand how the space works, or could work.</p>
<p>Now that I'm thinking terms of orchestration, something that seems to be a core characteristic of these new&nbsp;API hubs, work spaces, or garages--I'm seeing a possibly new vision of the API life-cycle. I'm going to organize these new hubs, work spaces, and garages under my <a href="http://ide.apievangelist.com/">IDE research</a>. I am starting to believe that these new work spaces are just the next generation IDE meant to span the entire API life-cycle--we will see how this thought evolves.</p>
<p>This new approach to API IDEs gives us design, and development capabilities, but also allows us to mock and deploy APIs. You can generate API documentation, and SDKs, and I'm seeing hints of orchestration using Github and Docker. I'm seeing popular clients like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> evolve to be more like a API life-cycle IDE, and I'm also seeing API design tooling like <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet Studio</a> invest in HTTP clients to expand beyond just design, adding live client interaction, testing, and other vital life-cycle elements.</p>
<p>None of my research is absolute. It is meant to help me make sense of the space, and give me a way to put news I curate, companies I discover, and open source tooling into meaningful buckets that might also help you define a meaningful version of your own API life-cycle. I apologize if this post is a little incoherent, but it is how I work through my thoughts around the API space, how things are expanding and evolving in real-time--something I hope will come into better focus in coming weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">I am keynoting APIStrat in Austin next month</a>, and it is a big deal for me. Ok, its my event, and I probably shouldn't be that excited, but it is the first time I've ever keynoted it. ;-) It is the sixth edition of APIStrat, and Steve asked if I wanted to keynote, which I dismissed because it seemed too ego, but when he pushed back, I realized that I would be stoked to keynote.</p>
<p>I'm excited about the preparation for the talk, and trying to think about how I can incorporate my research, and working API operations into it. <a href="http://defragcon.com/">I'm also keynoting Defrag the week before</a>, so both my keynotes will march in lockstep. They won't be the same keynote, but they will reflect what I'm seeing across the API space right now, allowing me to use both venues as vehhicle to move my research forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apistrat-austin-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>My Defrag talk is titled, "<em>The 17 Stops Along The Modern API Lifecycle"</em>, which I'm guessing will grow as I prepare both these talks, but it will also be the same core theme of my APIStrat keynote. Over the last five years, the API space has been slowly coming into focus for me, and in 2015 I feel like I'm really starting to see some coherency in how things are working together, making for a clearer API life-cycle for me to reference.</p>
<p>Storytelling on my blog helps me work through my ideas, and doing it on stage at Defrag and APIStrat will help me organize them in a way that can benefit the entire API community. I haven't been this excited about two talks in a while, and I'm looking forward to sharing where my research has gone in 2015, on stage at two conferences I really enjoy supporting.</p>
<p>See you in Broomfield and Austin folks!</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/use-apisjson-to-organize-my-swagger-defined-apis-running-in-docker-containers/">I started playing with the possibilities when it comes to API deployment using virtual containers like Docker early this year</a>, exploring the constraints this approach to API deployment introduced, on my own infrastructure. The process got my gears turning, when it comes to deploying very simple data, content, and algorithmic APIs into any environment that runs Docker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As 2015 has progressed, I'm seeing containers emerge as part of more stops along the API life-cycle, specifically in <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a> and <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>. A new one that just came across my radar is <a href="https://apiplug.com/">API PLUG</a>. I haven't played with the containerized API deployment solution yet, but after watching video, and looking through site it seems in line with what I'd expect to see from a next generation, containerized, API deployment solution.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/23/reconciling-my-api-orchestration-research-with-the-evolution-of-ide-sdk-and-http-clients/">Overlapping with my previous post on reconciling API orchestration</a>, I'm seeing several stops along API lifecycle present in API PLUG, beyond just API deployment, it allows you to design, deploy, and document your API which moves well into the world of API management. As I'm seeing with other emerging solutions like <a href="http://apistudio.io/">API Studio from Apigee</a>, I predict we will see <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">monitoring</a>, and other critical layers of the API life-cycle emerge as orchestration layers of API PLUG.</p>
<p>I've added API PLUG to my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">API deployment research</a>, and I am still considering the best way to include them in other areas of my API research. I'm increasingly finding that modern API management solutions are spanning multiple areas of the API life-cycle, which further encourages me to modularize my research, but also tells me I'm going to need to create some sort of Venn Diagram visualization to help me better understand the reach of emerging API products and services.</p>
<p>Anyways, more to come on API PLUG as I play with, and listen to the stories they tell via their blog, <a href="https://twitter.com/apiplug">Twitter</a>, and Github accounts (I can only find a Twitter account, but I'm sure they are working on that! ;-).</p>

<p>Marketing your products and services in the API sector can often look very different than marketing of products and services in other sectors. Developers are a very different target audience, and to make things even more complicated, not all developers are created equal! Open developer are not like the enterprise developer, and healthcare developers won't have much in common with device-based, Internet of Things developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to market your API has been a session at every APIStrat since we did the first conference in New York City back in February of 2013, and <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">we just announced the latest edition of marketing for APIs at @APIStrat in Austin in November</a>.

        <span class="post-date">22 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/266_logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">It has been a year or two since I've given any deep thought to the Twitter ecosystem</a>. There has been such little meaningful action to come out of the social platform over the last couple years, I had all but given up on it being a platform with any sort of future for developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/656885664525357056">When Jack Dorsey apologized and solicited feedback from the community this week</a>, I honestly felt I didn't have much to offer when it comes to advice--I just wasn't prepared. Twitter does almost everything right when it comes to their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">developer ecosystem</a>...well on the surface, where they do fail, is within the most critical areas of API operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>&nbsp;- Twitter communicates about the usual mundane API platform stuff, but really lacks a tone and substance that really cuts through the BS for developers. In my opinion it will take years to recover from the tone set by Dick Costolo &amp; Ryan Sarver--they just did not respect developers at all, and it showed. This isn't something you recover from quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Access &amp; Rate Limits -</strong>&nbsp;While communications around access level and rate limits have gotten much more clearer, with a dedicated area in dev portal, and available inline within documentation, it will take going the extra mile before developers feel like there is truly a level playing field. It will require more API access to account level usage, notifications, dashboards, etc. to heal these wounds--real-time communication.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model -&nbsp;</strong>There is just no clear business model evident from the developer ecosystem--something that showcases how Twitter is making money, where the API fits into this, and the opportunity for developers to play in this game. I've broken down the pricing confusion involved with using the <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/06/twitter-api-integration-math-rest-api/">REST API</a>, and <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/21/twitter-api-integration-math-streaming-api/">Streaming API</a>, and <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/22/twitter-api-integration-math-reconciling-data-with-rest-and-streaming-apis/">tried to understand across the different levels of access</a>--even though my research is dated, the confusion still exists. There is no clarity when it comes to how I can grow my usage of Twitter (as a startup), therefore many resort to very bad behavior to make ends meet.</li>
<li><strong>Personality</strong> - There is no personality or face to the Twitter platform, thus it always defaults up the chain to current CEO. Maybe a new director of platform came on after Ryan Sarver left, but I couldn't tell you who it was. The platform needs a leader who will set the same tone Jack Dorsey is trying to set by returning to the CEO Position--Twitter needs a Jack who is specifically in charge of the platform vision, message, and will be the friendly face of the platform turnaround.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of communication, overall tone, and lack of transparency and clarity around access, rate limits, and the business model has just left a bad taste in the mouths of Twitter developers. I use the Twitter API actively as part of my business, but I would never consider building a new product that depends on the Twitter API--never, and I know many other developers feel the same.</p>
<p>I've long moved on from my utopian views of what the Twitter API could have been, there are too many powerful actors who are investors, and partners&nbsp; now for this ever to be a reality. I do not think Twitter should entertain and do business with ALL 3rd party developers, and eliminate rate limits--I am more experienced in API operations than this. However Twitter has to provide a clear ladder that developers can climb when it comes to accessing the API, ascending all the way up to partner levels, with transparency all along the way.</p>
<p>Twitter has to be communicating with the community at every step, and honestly the community needs to get better at communicating with Twitter as well. I respect the challenge that Twitter has when it comes to managing a million developers, and know these things are not easy, and it makes me happy to see Jack taking a clear stance, and reach out to the community for feedback.</p>
<p>As Jack Dorsey said, transparency is the key. Transparency around API access, rate limits, the road-map, business model, partner and developer revenue opportunities, will be critical going forward. It makes me happy to see language like "Developer Rules of the Road" finally gone from the legal side of platform operations--it was language like this that set a really bad tone for developers. I really hope Twitter can turn this corner, and&nbsp; reboot its ecosystem, as the platform plays a critical role in almost every industry, and in my opinion <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is the most important API out there today</span>. i would really like to be able to showcase Twitter as a platform that all API providers should emulate once again.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/10/22/how-to-build-an-api-brand-through-consistent-storytelling/">How To Build An API Brand Through Consistent Storytelling</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just had a call with one of my newer API partners, working with them on crafting version 1.0 of their <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API evangelism strategy</a>, and the subject of what content to generate, and which channels to use, when building up their brand arose. In my work, about 90% of the approaches I see implemented by API providers is a traditional PR strategy, where you create content, and push to popular channels to do the work of syndicating the message. While this approach works, and is something I recommend you do, I have a different way of building up my brand, and the partner or community brands that I invest in.</p>
<p>All of this begins with something that truly brings value to the table for everyone involved, without this, my approach will not work. Once you have something of value, you start working directly with this value, building things, experimenting and playing, while telling the story all along the way. If it isn't something you'd use yourself, and be able to innovate with, why would you expect anyone else to. If value truly exists around products, services, and tooling associated with a brand, you will build momentum with each story you tell, eventually encouraging others to do the same.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild is with the fast growing API definition Swagger. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">I started paying attention to Swagger closely in 2011</a>, and by <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/09/19/forget-being-neutral-and-objective-anymore-with-apis/">mid 2014 I had gone all in with Swagger</a>, and integrated into my own platform, and tooling, resulting in 265 stories that reference swagger over the last four years. Let me show the value driven by this type of storytelling--here are the plotting of my stories over the last four years:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-evangelist-story-swagger.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Here is a plotting of growth of the <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=swagger%20api">Swagger according to Google Trends</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/google-trends-swagger.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>This is how you build brand awareness organically. I'm not saying I'm solely responsible for Swagger's success--it all started with the value brought to the table by Tony Tam. Secondarily it was the community who ultimately <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/platform-integrations.html">integrated Swagger into their platforms</a>, <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/swagger-ui.html">used Swagger UI for displaying their API documentation</a>, and innovated in the <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">numerous other areas of API operations where the API definition format has been applied</a>. Most importantly, it has taken the storytelling of the community, about what they have done, that got us to where we are at in 2015 with the Swagger brand.</p>
<p>Along with the value brought to the table by Tony, and the community, I do feel I played a significant role in where the Swagger brand is today. I did this through building tooling with Swagger, searching out what others were doing, and telling the story all along the way. I wrote 160 stories in 2015 alone, and I did this all via my own blog. I beat this drum so loud, and so consistently, others wrote about what I was doing in top tier blogs like <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/05/kin-lane-api-commons">InfoQ</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/15/3scale-discounts-cost-of-managing-apis-through-nginx-open-source-server-gives-developers-access-services-quality/">TechCrunch</a>, as well as on other company and developer blogs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the power of storytelling. This isn't marketing, and isn't about products or services--it is about generating valuable exhaust around something API related, and telling the story along the way. This is something I enjoy helping API providers, and service providers understand as they try to differentiate themselves in 2015, and for a select few partners, I will be doing this around the value they bring to the table, across the API Evangelist network.</p>

<p>One layer I am working to add to my API research, are machine readable API definitions that I find, or generate from the APIs of the API service providers I keep an eye on. Within this new layer I'm aggregating these API the specs of the companies who are offering services within the emerging areas of the API sector.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/specs.html">The first area I've started aggregating is within API management</a>. 3Scale was very forward leaning with their willingness to open up their API definitions for <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">their own API management infrastructure APIs</a>. These are API specs that describe all of the features of the 3Scale API management platform, and represent one possible blueprint that API management service providers could emulate.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/specs.html">I have four separate API definitions included from 3Scale on my new page</a>, something that could be broken down further if it makes sense. I also just added a suggested API definition for API portals--crafted by the <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> team. They thought my idea for defining a common set of definitions across the 17+ areas I monitor was an interesting cenough oncept, and was something they wanted to explore further with me.</p>
<p>Zeeshan Ejaz Bhatti of <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> pulled together this spec:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!--  .gist {width:100%; height: 200px; overflow:auto}  .gist .file-data {max-height: 200px; max-width: 500px;}  -->
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/c1b0bf18ed7f67362a78.js"></script>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is just one potential starting point for providing a common interface for managing your API portal. Zeeshan feels that , if "API-Portals-as-a-Service", and other API management providers agreed on a common publish API format, it would benefit other API service providers like APIMATIC who are providing services to their customers via these API portals.</p>
<p>I agree with Zeeshan, and might&nbsp;<a href="/admin/blog/api-portal.apievangelist.com">play around adding an API facade for managing your API portal using Github + Jekyll, like I do with my standard API Portal template</a>. This is all work in progress. Right now I am just aggregating the API definitions for API service providers that have APIs. In my opinion this layer of the API space will differentiate API service providers from each other, demonstrating which ones will actually scale in the fast growing the API economy.</p>
<p>Next I'm taking <a href="http://monitor.apievangelist.com">API monitoring services like Runscope and API Science</a>, and aggregate their API definitions as part of my research.</p>

<p>I have used the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/usagov/Federal-Agency-Directory-API-Documentation">Federal Agency Directory API</a>&nbsp;for quite some time to lookup federal government agencies. <a href="https://www.usa.gov/developer">USA.gov has some highly valuable, and simple APIs</a> including the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/usagov/Social-Media-Registry-API-Documentation">Social Media Registry API</a>, which I find extremely useful. They recently added a new one for<a href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/developer/govt-urls.html"> searching government websites that do not end in .gov</a>.</p>
<p>The Non-.gov URLs APIs allows you to search for all websites that end in .com, .org, .edu, or other top-level domains, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal, state, local,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usa.gov/tribes">tribal</a>, commonwealth, and territorial government agency websites</li>
<li><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/otherfrb.htm">Federal reserve banks and branches</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fhlbanks.com/">Federal home loan banks</a></li>
<li>Libraries, archives, and museums, including&nbsp;<a href="http://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/">Presidential libraries</a></li>
<li>Department of Defense websites for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.defense.gov/Sites/DOD-Websites?category=Recruiting">recruiting</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.defense.gov/Sites/DOD-Websites?category=Academy">service academies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.usa.gov/recreation-and-travel">Travel and tourism</a>&nbsp;websites for states and U.S. territories</li>

<li><a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21663.pdf">Government sponsored enterprises</a>&nbsp;(such as Fannie Mae) [PDF]</li>
<li>Federal and state retirement systems</li>
<li>Task forces (such as the Preventative Services Task Force) and commissions (such as the 9/11 Commission)</li>
<li>A few select, non government organizations (such as the Red Cross) and public-private partnerships</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>I find the APIs coming out of USA.gov to be excellent examples of what ALL government agencies should be doing. The APIs don't have to be complicated, just provide simple read, and sometimes write access to valuable government data that should be public.</p>
<p>I am going to prioritize the creation of an API definition for USA.gov, and wrap their APIs in an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json file</a>, and add to my <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/stack.html">federal API stack</a>. The more of these APIs I have at my disposal, the more efficient I am at when it comes to opening up government data, and making existing API resources available across my research.</p>

<p>I've been working on expand upon <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">my API security research</a>, but it can be difficult to find API focused security solutions. Exactly what is security when it comes to APIs can vary. Are you looking to secure your APIs? Are you looking to secure your data or content using an API? This is why I started a research projects so that I can turn on my keyword monitoring, and begin scouring the landscape in real-time--the more I conduct research in an area, the better I get at it.</p>
<p>The best part of my research is that sometimes when I write about things, companies just come to me. This happened the other week, with an encrypted database API provider called <a href="https://securedb.co">SecureDB</a>. What this brand new API driven platform provides is default security for your&nbsp;accounts, data, files, and settings--exactly what we need in this cyber-insecure world we have created for ourselves.</p>
<p>I do not store any sensitive data, but if I did, I would not want to be in the business of storing it. Period! <a href="https://securedb.co/apidocs/">SecureDB gives you everything you need to manage your users account and identity, create the data stores you need, and store your appilcations files and settings in a secure environment</a>. All identity data is encrypted by default, and you get to set the encryption levels for all your data stores, allowing you to make sure everything sensitive is not readable on the server, even if it is compromised.</p>
<p>SecureDB is just getting started, but they have a lot of things in the works, including on-premise, containerized implementations, version that run on Heroku, white label solutions, and much more. I will be working with them to help them craft a marketing and storyteling strategy around their encrypted database solution, and establishing a deeper partnership between them and API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I'm pretty stoked on my ability to attract these types of API service providers just by publishing my research regularly, and talking about the areas these companies are providing solutions in. I'm just telling the first story about SecureDB to let you know they are out there, and get them established in my monitoring system, and overall research--stay tuned for much more on SecureDB, and the security solutions they provide--I couldn't think of a better time for an API like this, we are so going to need it.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-lifecycle.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is up to API providers to establish a coherent approach regarding how they rollout and manage their APIs, something that historically has just involved deploying and managing, but in the last couple of years we have seen more formal approaches emerge, something we are all calling the API lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2012, after we started standardizing our API development and management thinking using API definitions, the expansion of the API lifecycle was set into motion with the introduction of an API design-first way of thinking from the Apiary team. API definitions allowed us to get our development and management house in order, but also begin collaborating, mocking, and having a conversation around our API designs, way before we began the costly process of writing code.</p>
<p>In 2015, I am tracking on API definitions driving over 17 separate stops along this fast evolving API lifecycle. While some API providers who are further along in their API journey are incorporating all of these stops, many API providers who are just getting going, are still learning about all the stops along this modern API lifecycle. Part of this evolution is establishing just exactly what is your companies API lifecycle, something that can be a very personal thing, and we'll need more of our tooling to help us quantify this.</p>
<p>This is why I was happy to see evidence of API lifecycle management built into the tooling with the new AWS API Gateway. In my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/11/some-potentially-very-powerful-api-orchestration-with-the-amazon-api-gateway/">earlier post on the&nbsp;potentially very powerful API orchestration with the Amazon API Gateway</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Going beyond the types of integration you can employ when crafting, and deploying APIs using the Amazon API Gateway, the platform also provides a way to define stages that APIs will exist in from design, development, QA, production, or any other stage you wish. I like the concept of having a stage defined for each API, designating where it exists on the API life-cycle. I tend to just have dev and prod, but this might make me consider this a little more deeply, as it seems to be a big part of defining the API journey.</em></p>
<p>In my opinion, this is a sign of things to come. Right now it is just basically a way to tag your APIs, and define which stage of the API lifecycle they are in, but I can see see these stages being used to organize various stops along the API lifecycle, in a meaningful way for your API team. You could put testing and performance as part of your QA stage, and you can setup monitoring and security for your APIs that are in production, and much more.</p>
<p>While it is still coming into focus for me, I see the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">17+ stops along the API lifecycle</a> as something that could be organized into these various API lifecycle stages. I do not think there will be one API lifecycle blueprint to rule them all, but this new approach would allow API teams to craft their own vision, and allow them to share these blueprints for other teams to follow, either internally, or even publicly.</p>
<p>I hope we'll see more API service providers consider where they fit into the overall API lifecycle of their consumers, and provide features that helps users define what this means to their team. Maybe eventually we'll end up with a common language and tooling for helping API providers discuss and operate within a more coherent, flowing, and meaningful API lifecycle.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/13/bringing-api-building-blocks-to-life-as-the-apis-of-service-providers/">I mentioned the concept of what I call API building blocks coming to life by API service providers yesterday</a>. These are the features provided from API service providers that are made accessible via APIs. Mind blowing right? API service providers having APIs? Which then allows API providers to programmatically manage the operations of their own APIs? Who would have ever thought!! Actually it is a pretty clear example of API service providers who are kind of full of it, when they do not offer their own APIs--meaning they are telling you about the importance of APIs, but not actually practicing what they preach. It is kind of like API providers who do not use their own APIs in their applications (dogfooding).</p>
<p class="p1">Anyhoo. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">I have done a lot of work to define the common building blocks across API service providers, spanning over 17 stops along the API lifecycle</a>, and part of the next phase of my research is to connect these building blocks to actual API definitions that can help automate these vital API features. First up, <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">I took the 3Scale API, and generated this list of common building blocks represented in the API for their API infrastructure</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/adding-four-new-building-building-blocks-providing-an-api-management-api-blueprint/">I've been using a subset of the 3Scale API management API definition as my standard blueprint for other API providers should follow, for a while now</a>. All API providers should have an API for base API account management--meaning your API consumers should be able to manage their accounts, services, apps, and billing via an API. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">This will be a differentiation between API providers in the near future, and if you aren't up to speed, developers will be looking elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/24/how-open-source-api-proxies-and-other-api-services-and-tooling-can-strategically-partner/">This portion of my work is in response to a group of open source API management providers looking to encourage interoperability between their platforms, and what better way to do this than a common API management definition</a>. While not all API management solutions will have exactly the same features, if they can speak a common, API defined language, the better off the entire API space will be.</p>
<p>This is something I want to encourage across all 17+ of the API service areas I track on. I'm going to take a look at <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com">API monitoring</a>, and also try to generate a common outline from definition across some of the service providers I track on. I'm using API definitions to generate these outlines, and potentially merging across multiple API service providers. If you are one of the API service providers I track on, and have an API definition, make sure I have link so I can include in thi sportion of my research.</p>
