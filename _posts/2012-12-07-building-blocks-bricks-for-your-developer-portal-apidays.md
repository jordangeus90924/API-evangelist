I gave a talk at [API Days][2] in Paris, France this week.  This talk was using some of my usual material around the [building blocks of an API][3]. As I always do, I omitted some slides and evolved my presentation a little further.  This is one benefit of using [reveal.js][4], driven from the API Evangelist database--I can evolve my content and make better with each talk.

I discussed 5 main areas to consider when building your API developer portal:

  * History of APIs
  * API Design
