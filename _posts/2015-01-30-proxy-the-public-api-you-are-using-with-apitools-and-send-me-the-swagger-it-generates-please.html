<p><a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a> is a simple, <a href="https://github.com/APItools/monitor">open source</a>, API middleware that allows you to &ldquo;track, transform and analyze the traffic between your app and the APIs&rdquo;. With just a few clicks you can proxy any API you use, and when you make calls through the proxy, you get a bunch of valuable  information in return.</p>
<p>One thing APITools does, that is extremely valuable to me, is it generates Swagger definitions, mapping out the surface area of an API, with each call I make. These API definitions have a wide variety of uses for me, ranging from better understanding the API designs of popular services, to providing API search services through open API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>.</p>
<p>If you are regularly developing against a public API, can you take a moment to swap the baseURL with one created in APITools, make all of your calls to the API, then send me a copy of the Swagger definition? I would sure appreciate the help in creating Swagger definitions for all of the popular APIs available today. Don&rsquo;t worry all your work is openly available on both <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">API Stack for re-use and forking by anyone</a>.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)
