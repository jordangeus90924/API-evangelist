		<p>API Evangelist is about making sense of the world of application programming interfaces, or simple APIs. APIs have become part of every layer of our Internet connected world over the last 20 years, and this is my research project into understanding what is happening. As of 2019 I am also the Chief Evangelist for Postman, but I still use this site in the same way I have since 2010, as a workbench for what I am working on each day. Providing me with a very public way to work through my projects, while helping others see the world of APIs in different ways, and hopefully learn more about how APIs are being applied across our world</p>
		<p>This isn't meant to be a blog in the traditional sense of the word, and you should think of it as Kin Lane's personal notebook that he is fine with others reading. Once you spend time reading my work you will better understand that this is my souning board, helping me work through my ideas, and I am not doing this for page views, audience size, or other metric. However, after over ten years of doing this I tend to have a regular group of folks who are tuning in and providing commentary via Twitter, GitHub, and other channels.</p>

				<p><em>17 Feb 2021</em></p>
				<p>I am pushing forward how Postman can be used for public data. I have a whole mess of different data sets I need available for different projects I am working on. For one project I am aggregating ten separate environmental data sources available as a mix of CSV, JSON, and excel files, as well as a couple of actual APIs. I am looking to build an embeddable dashboard widget using data across these ten sources, and I am looking to organize all of them via a single public workspace, helping normalize them all as simple APIs returning CSV or JSON. The project is just a POC, and once it moves toward production we’ll launch actual APIs, but for now I am able to mock them using Postman. The process got me thinking about how this approach can be used to make simple public datasets available via forkable Postman collections. Simple Data APIs Using Collections As I began aggregating the datasets into Postman, the first couple of datasets were pretty basic. Simple CSV or JSON files, and a couple basic APIs. I just created a collection, added a new request, and pasted the URL into the request and pulled the data from the source. Once I had the response from each API I would save the response as an example for the request. Then the entire CSV or JSON would be stored locally within the collection. For most of them I’d convert the data to, or from JSON or CSV, and add a parameter property so that each response could returned depending on what format the consumer desires for the visualizations. Now that I have an example stored for each dataset as part of the collection I can mock the collection, making the data available as a simple “mocked” API. This approach provides a public or private URL I can share with anyone who is building a prototype application-—in this case a widget. Going from dataset...[<a href="/2021/02/17/open-data-using-postman-collections/">Read More</a>]</p>

				<p><em>11 Feb 2021</em></p>
				<p>I am working to load up all my API discovery experiences into my head for some upcoming conversations. So I sat down and pulled together a summary of my API discovery research to date to help refresh my memory of what has happened and how we got here. API discovery is the one of the few layers of the API space that I am personally committed to helping move things forward and being able to see all the moving parts together helps me keep doing this. Let’s take a stroll through my memory of the evolution of API discover over the last fifteen years so that I can speak more coherently about all of this with a variety of folks. ProgrammableWeb ProgrammableWeb was the first source of being able to discover API, and in 2020 it is still the place you go to find APIs. Really not much has changed in the last fifteen years with ProgrammableWeb except for the owners and operators, and the look and feel of the site. It is still where you go to look for new and existing APIs, and where you find APIs when Googling. I have fond memories of writing for ProgrammableWeb, and the site is still a great source of information for me, but I am left frustrated that PW hasn’t moved forward the API discovery conversation in any interesting ways over the years. I just think it is a missed opportunity, and reflects much about the API space that I think holds us all back. Mashape -> Rapid API After ProgrammableWeb, the next evolution in the API space when it came to API discovery was Mashape, which is now known as Rapid API. The API marketplace was born out of the age of API management and provides basic management capabilities alongside with API discovery services. Providing a pretty rich set of APIs you can search and onboard with using the Rapid API marketplace.

				<p><em>11 Feb 2021</em></p>
				<p>If you have followed my work you know that I like telling stories. Stories are the single most important tool in my Chief Evangelist and API Evangelist toolbox. None of the code matters in my opinion, and the stories surrounding the code is what makes the actual impact on our reality. The stories we tell each other, as well as the stories we tell ourselves. Everything in the world of technology and APIs is made up of stories. I am hovering around 5000 stories here on API Evangelist, which reflects everything I am when it comes to API Evangelist. Stories are how I make sense of the API world that has unfolded in the last twenty years. Storytelling is how I work through all of the things I do not understand, moving everything API from a very abstract realm into something that is more tangible, visible, and sometimes more meaningful to me in the real world. I couldn’t have done any of this without stories. Throughout my storytelling as the API Evangelist I have also taught myself to work through my own personal baggage over at kinlane.com. Applying the same methodology to my past and figuring out who I am today. API Evangelist has always been very much a performance, but the storytelling I engaged in as part of the performance went much deeper than being just a business production. Over the years, both of these streams of storytelling (apievangelist.com & kinlane.com) have influenced others in the world, having an impact on their storytelling, or help them embark on their own storytelling journey. I’ve learned a lot from these engagements, and made a lot of friends around the world because of a shared love for storytelling. This shared storytelling journey has recently manifested itself as a video conversation between Mike Amundsen (@mamund) and Aidan Cunniffe (@aidandcunniffe), which we are simply calling API Storytelling. We only have one discussion under our belt and we aren’t quite...[<a href="/2021/02/11/api-storytelling-with-mike-and-aidan/">Read More</a>]</p>

				<h3><a href="/2021/01/30/making-sense-of-the-different-types-of-api-testing/">Making Sense of the Different Types of API Testing</a></h3>
				<p><em>30 Jan 2021</em></p>
				<p>I have to admit something. I don&rsquo;t fully grasp the entire landscape of API testing. I mean, I have a pretty decent awareness and experience in testing APIs, but I can&rsquo;t close my eyes and coherently break down each layer or type of testing, let alone competently navigate the many different types of services and tooling available on the market for API testing. Like most other dimensions of the API universe the content and guidance on the subject of API testing is all over the place. After a couple of hours Googling and making my way through my bookmarks, I uncovered a pretty expansive dictionary for what I&rsquo;d consider to be under the umbrella of API testing. First off, I have to talk about API testing in the most general sense before I get into the more and less formal API testing approaches. It was a dimension of API testing I hadn&rsquo;t considered before I began working at Postman, but API testing meaning that I am just kicking the tires on a API, learning what it is all about, and how you use it. This is what the majority of Postman&rsquo;s 13 million users are doing when they say they are testing an API with the Postman platform. THis experimental and curious approach to API testing provides a great onramp to the world of API publishing and consumption, but does little to help us articulate what API testing is or isn&rsquo;t. Beyond just &ldquo;testing out&rdquo; an API, from what I can gather across about 25 separate API testing articles, there are 25 different layers to the API testing onion: Validation Testing - I am guessing a general type of validation &mdash; seems pretty broad. Functional Testing - Adopted as part of code testing practices, applied to unit of code. Component Testing - Similar to functional, but testing based upon small unit of compute. User Interface Testing - Testing of the API in the context of...[<a href="/2021/01/30/making-sense-of-the-different-types-of-api-testing/">Read More</a>]</p>

				<p><em>30 Jan 2021</em></p>
				<p>I love the word entropy. It means so many things to so many different people. In means different things in the physical realm versus the informational or virtual realms. It is one of those big words you can say to confuse people, or actually get yourself in trouble being able to actually defend your position on what entropy means when around smart people. It is said that famed mathematician John Von Neumann had told fellow mathematician and creator of Information Theory that he should use the word entropy instead of information because that no one understands entropy and then you can win arguments about your theory. I also read that Shannon and Norbert Weiner also dueled over the meaning, seeing it in very opposite ways. I like the word for all of these reasons, but mostly because of its relationship to uncertainty.&nbsp; In the realm of physics entropy means, a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system In the more virtual realm of information theory, the entropy of a random variable is the average level of information, surprise, or uncertainty inherent in the variable's possible outcomes. While I could easily use entropy as a metaphor for APIs in the physical sense, it is really the appropriation of it for information theory that really brings it home for me. Entropy in Shannon&rsquo;s time was centered around noise or static in communication, but when you look at how APIs enable communication between systems, and allowing web, mobile, device, and network applications to communicate, this static or noise reveals itself as friction, errors, outages, instability, unreliability, and misaligned business and political priorities.&nbsp; &nbsp;Think about the level of information one encounters when it comes to putting APIs to work these days. Consider the surprise one encounters when seemingly similar API resources speak entirely different dialects or behave inconsistently.

				<p><em>29 Jan 2021</em></p>
				<p>I am preparing for the next version of APIs.json and I am taking another pass over what the specification is, but also taking a fresh look at why the specification exists. Part of this fresh look involves assessing what I consider to be the low bar for an APIs.json index, as well as what the entire scope might look like. To help me (and you) understand the scope of what APIs.json or APIs.yaml can do when it comes to indexing our API operations and making them discoverable in a machine readable way. The most important thing to remember about APIs.json is that it is all about indexing API operations in a way that acknowledges that there are two sides of this API integration game which need to be indexed and made discoverable across an organization. Human Readable - Providing URL references for the aspects of API Operations that human stakeholders will need to understand what is happening with APIs and how to put them to work in applications. Machine Readable - Providing URL references for aspects of API Operations that are system and applications can use to make sense of API Operations, accessing as a machine readable definition. APIs.json is about indexing all of these human and machine readable aspects of our API Operations with an emphasis on evolving human readable elements to also be machine readable so that as much of the surface area of our API operations is indexable by other systems and applications as possible. There is another dimension of APIs.json as a specification that is helpful to understand beyond the human and machine readable elements, by providing a vocabulary for describing two separate scopes of API operations, helping define the scope of information provided. API Specific Properties - References to details about a specific API, providing human and machine readable details about an API, so that consumers understand everything that is possible. Common Properties - References to details that support all...[<a href="/2021/01/29/examples-of-minimum-viable-and-complete-landscape-apis-json-index-files/">Read More</a>]</p>

				<p><em>23 Jan 2021</em></p>
				<p>I am giving some much needed love to my APIs.yaml and API.json API discovery format while using the work to also just think about the wider API landscape. This is the original intent behind APIs.json&hellip;to help me make sense of the API landscape.&nbsp; Most folks are thinking about APIs as a producer, or as a consumer&mdash;hopefully both. However, there are fewer people who also pay attention to the entire API landscape, and APIs.json emerged out of this need for me in 2014. In 2020 I find myself totally immersed in the API landscape as part of my API Specification Toolbox project which grew out of Postman becoming a member of the OpenAPI Initiative, and I wanted toht spend why Saturday afternoon (I know I have a problem) thinking about the API landscape at the 250K.&nbsp; APIs.json API Property Types Using APIs.json or APIs.yaml you can define the properties of one or many APIs for a variety of purposes. Each API you describe can have an array of properties which can be common human readable elements like documentation or sign up, as well as machine readable properties like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or JSON Schema. APIs.json property types are intentionally human or machine readable with the intent on evolving every human readable element to have a machine readable element&mdash;think the relationship between documentation (Human) and OpenAPI (Machine) when understand the objective. I have several thousand API Providers and API service providers in my API Evangelist database. I track on the properties of all of these companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies that I come across. When I group the property types across the thousands of APIs I have indexed, I end up with this default set of building blocks for API providers, grouped by different areas of the API lifecycle. Onboarding These are the properties of any API operation that help consumers, or any other party onboard with the concept of an API, begin using the API, as...[<a href="/2021/01/23/evaluating-apis-json-api-property-types-alongside-openapi-extensions/">Read More</a>]</p>
