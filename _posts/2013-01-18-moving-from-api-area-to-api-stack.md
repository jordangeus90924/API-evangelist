{% include JB/setup %}<p>Finding APIs that compliment your API, and talking about the mutual benefits is nothing new.When I worked with the print API Mimeo, I would write code that used Mimeo API in conjunction with Box API or Dropbox API.Mashing up or bundling your APIs with other complimentary service can really help, when you are trying to explain the value your API delivers.I’m beginning to see patterns of even deeper integration and partnerships between APIs emerge--where one API provider will resell the API of another provider. APIs partnering with other APIs isn’t that new, but reselling of each others API services to their developers is a fairly new concept, providing a potential new wholesale channel for API providers.</p>
