			<p><em>02 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Master API architect at Layer7 Technologies Mike Amundsen (@mamund) has a great post this week on Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013.
One of the predictions that caught my eye was that "server mash-ups will increase but client mash-ups will decline"--he clarifies it with:
The increasing popularity of languages like Node.js, Erlang and Closure will make implementing server-side mash-ups more efficient and easier to maintain than doing the same work within a client application; especially for the mobile platform. This will reduce the &ldquo;chattiness&rdquo; of client-side applications and increase the security and flexibility of server-side implementations. The result will be a perceived increase in responsiveness and a reduced use of battery power on mobile apps.
As with my earlier post, individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous, I agree 100%.  This is where I&rsquo;m going with my post this week on virtual API stacks.  With so many individual resources available on the web, in the coming years we&rsquo;ll see increased &ldquo;mashing up&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo; of new stacks, that are meaningful to a particular app or group of developers.
An example of this in the wild is&nbsp;Singly, with their API aggregation or mashup, which is available as a service, but is also available as open source on Github as Hallway.  Another recent example is potentially the OpenKit Gaming BaaS, which promised to be an open stack designed for game developers.
My predication is we&rsquo;ll see many more returns from server side API mashups, than we did during the client side mashup gold rush days! &nbsp;Especially if providers open source these stacks, while also offering as a service.

			<p>I recently added the Traffic and Weather podcast to the right hand menu for everyone to enjoy. What John Sheehan (@johnsheehan&nbsp;) and Steve Marx (@smarx) are doing on the podcast is SO needed in the API space, I highly recommend subscribing to the podcast in your itunes and listening regularly. I was honored to be critiqued in the podcast this week, where they &ldquo;gently&rdquo; disagreed with my post from earlier this week on my speculation around virtual API stacks. So I wanted to &ldquo;gently&rdquo; respond and help clarify. The first 60 seconds, pretty much sum up rebuttal, where they make my argument for me by saying IFTT and Zapier are already doing this? Which is the whole basis for my story except I use Singly and Temboo as examples. All of these providers are in the same space in my opinion, I think maybe they are just referencing what they are familiar with (as John used to work at IFTTT). Second they read in that I&rsquo;m envisioning some grand discovery language? Not sure where this comes from. I&rsquo;m just referencing that API providers can provide JSON definitions of their APIs, which is happening with specs like Swagger, but not being done for discovery but for interactive documentation and code stub generation--the fact it is there is a plus for discovery. But I have zero visions of there every being a grand &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for discovery, but I feel you can't argue Swagger is picking up momentum. John and Steve also reference that I&rsquo;m calling for a &ldquo;standardized building blocks API providers can jump on?&rdquo; Not sure where this comes from. My arguement is that API will play almost no role in this process at all. They won&rsquo;t give a shit or prepare in any way. It will be 3rd party providers stepping up and building these abstracted platforms around existing API providers. Something we are already seeing with Temboo, Singly and yes IFTTT and Zapier as...[<a href="/2013/02/01/traffic-and-weather-virtualized-api-stacks/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>I had the pleasure of being on stage with Tim Herzog (@tgherzog), a Open Data Specialist from the World Bank yesterday at the DC API meetup at NPR. During the QA panel, at the end of the meetup, a question came from the audience, stating that open data from government is often boring, and thus is the reason much of what we see built on government isn't that exciting--alluding that there has to be more high value, exciting data that isn't being released. While I agree that much of the data made available from open government initiatives is boring and stale, and there are probably much better datasets available, I also think this is more of a storytelling problem, than a data problem. After the question was asked, I quickly answered by pointing to my left at Tim Herzog, and said the World Bank does an awesome job at this. If you look through the World Bank data catalog, and spend time looking through their blog, you see a symbiotic relationship between their open data, APIs and the stories they tell on the blog. This approach is similar to what I'm calling Hacker Storytelling, the only difference is I am hosting all my stories on Github as individual repositories. If you look at the home page of the World Bank data site today, there is a link to the blog post, "What does data tell us about debt of high income and developing countries?" This is a great example of not just providing a dataset, but actually telling the story around the data, while providing tools that let you interact with the data, making everything a very hands on experience--increasing the chances users will make an emotional connection with the data. According to the blog post, the World Bank maintains two quarterly databases of information on external and public sector debt of many countries. The blog post narrates what the statistical data from the Quarterly...[<a href="/2013/02/01/storytelling-is-essential-companion-to-open-data-and-apis-at-world-bank/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>
A new player in the Backend as a Service (BaaS) space has emerged, from former OpenFeint co-founder Peter Relan--called OpenKit. &nbsp;The new BaaS platform is targeting game developers, providing cross-platform tools for both iOS and Android. &nbsp;The core features of the gaming BaaS platform are:

Cloud data sync - Save game progress in the cloud with data storage. Sync it across both iOS and Android devices for a consistent gaming experience
Leaderboards - Drop-in leaderboard SDK's for both iOS and Android. Give your users the opportunity to compete against millions of other players
Facebook &amp; Twitter auth - Users login with familiar third party social networks like Facebook and Twitter. No need to create and manage accounts. OpenKit handles it all
Cross-platform support - OpenKit supports both iOS and Android. Our native SDKs are lightweight and will take just a few minutes to integrate into your game

OpenKit represents a trend I&rsquo;m tracking on where people are pulling together specialized or virtualized stacks targeting specific groups of developers.  Early movers in the space like Kinvey, Parse and Cloudmine have generally catered to all types of developers by providing them a backend stack, that assists them in rapidly building mobile and web apps. So naturally the next step is to see more specialized stacks, for smaller groups of developers.
I&rsquo;m stoked to see that OpenKit is completely open source, readily available on Github, as well as comes out of the box with a REST API.  Open source BaaS is something I was identifying was missing from the space.
I will add OpenKit to my trends section for Backend as a Service, where I&rsquo;m tracking on the BaaS space, and will dive in deeper and compare it with some of the other offerings we are seeing emerge.

			<p><em>01 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>I came to Washington DC this week for meetings with a couple federal agencies and a handful of private companies who contract with our government--including a conversation last night at the DC API Meetup Group, which met at NPR offices downtown. The API Meetup started with pizza, a healthy selection of beer and networking with around 50 API professionals and API curious from around the DC area. I was able to meet about 15 folks I know online, but have never had the opportunity to connect with in real life. Ben Balter (@BenBalter), one of the Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) kicked off the conversation with a presentation of some of the cool API discovery, CSV to API, DB to API and various tool he's developed during his time as a innovation fellow. I totally dig Ben's style, in making very small, but powerful open source tools that can make a real difference in how government opens up data via APIs. I was up next, giving a talk titled, "From Web, to Programmable Web, to Programmable World". I wanted to give everyone a healthy dose on the history of APIs, some views on where we are currently, and where API are going with an introduction to concepts like aggregation and automation. The talk is meant to be a 200K foot walkthrough of the API space, which also reflects all of the sections available on APIEvangelist.com. Next up was Gray Brooks from the General Services Administration (GSA) who walked through some of the open data and API initiatives coming out of the federal government. He is overseeing some very important aspects of the White House Digital Strategy, and is the point person for the execution of the digital strategy across all federal agencies. After Gray talked, Tim Herzog (@tgherzog) the Open Data Specialist at the World Bank walked us through what the World Bank is doing with their open data initiatives, which APIs are at the core....[<a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>One of the top five concerns I hear from companies considering APIs is regarding losing control of their brand. With APIs being about access to raw data and resources, companies immediately think that developers will extract the value, without any attribution or reference to the companies brand. Even with this being a major concern, I see many APIs implement very poor branding guidelines, giving developers zero direction regarding how to properly provide attribution. &nbsp;This is a missed opportunity to not just protect the API providers brand, but actually extend it and increase its value. With this in mind, I'm always on the lookout for good examples of API branding guidelines. &nbsp;One recent example I came across while monitoring my API Stack, is from the Active Network which provides activity and outdoor content via their APIs. Active Network starts with a great explanation of why they provide branding guidelines: At ACTIVE Network, we want you to be able to create fantastic applications with the ACTIVE Network APIs. At the same time, we don't want users to get confused about who is responsible for the data they are accessing, so we have some brand guidelines. Next Active Network explains to developers why branding guidelines are important to their own users: The ACTIVE brand holds credibility in the mind of the customer. It serves as a seal of approval giving customers the confidence to transact through a trusted source As a consumer utility, ACTIVE.com&reg; captures and records registration activity providing people with a record of their personal registration history if they need it at a future date Transacting for an ACTIVE powered activity, tells your customer who they need to call if they need help. ACTIVE&rsquo;s standard of excellence provides customers with 24/7 support 365 days a year Active Network also provides details on how to properly use their companies name (which I followed in my story), what attribution is required, and a complete branding kit for download...[<a href="/2013/01/29/protecting-your-brand-with-api-branding-guidelines/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
App.net has just released a File API to add to their messaging and communication stack, allowing any App.net account to natively store files via the social platform.
Each App.net account will be given a 10GB file storage area, allowing applications to read and write files, that can be linked and embedded within App.net communications.
This approach reminds me of what I&rsquo;m seeing within the backend as a service (BaaS) space with other common developer resources like user management, object storage and key-value stores.
App.net is just making sure developers have the resources they will need to be successful building web and mobile apps with the App.net API--a similar motivation for BaaS providers as wel as other API providers.
While many developers are fine with using multiple API providers to get what they need, I can see an opportunity to provide the essential resources developers will need within the primary API that they are building their app around.
As essential API resources are further commoditized, it seems like an opportunity for private label BaaS resources to emerge.  File storage could become something that any API provider could offer alongside their own resources, without having to reinvent the wheel each time.
Maybe such services already exist under other names, and I'm unaware of it, but it seems like a great opportunity for cloud providers to step up and offer private label, backend resources for API providers to integrate into their platforms.

			<p><em>28 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>Up until now we tend to think of APIs individually--we approach integration in terms of the Twilio API, Twitter API or the Facebook API. But as the number of public APIs has grown beyond 8K, and an unknown amount of internal and partner APIs become available, we are seeing new patterns of aggregation and interoperability emerge from companies like Singly, but also seeing automation be added into the mix by companies like Temboo, and entire backend stacks from providers like Parse. These new aggregated or backend stacks of API driven resources can be as general as object and key-value stores, user management and other developer commodities we see backend as a service providers (BaaS) bring to the table, or they can be very personal like the photos Singly is aggregating across Flickr, Facebook and Instagram and with friends and followers across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. As I see these new aggregate and BaaS providers emerge, at an ever increasing pace, I can&rsquo;t help but think--this still isn&rsquo;t fast enough (its my nature, you should try being me). If I want common mobile developer resources I can adopt one of these new BaaS platforms like Kinvey or Parse, or if I need personal and social resources, which have become part of the fabric of web and mobile apps, I can go to Singly. But what if I want a more specialized network, say just for education? I might need user management, object storage, key-value storage, access to commons social tools like friends and photos across multiple social networks, but I also need access to open courseware, teacher and student directories all via a very secure, auditable, efficient stack tailored just for K-12? I will have to wait, for the next wave of startups to emerge. While in NYC on Friday I had a great discussion with Temboo about virtualization. Not just the virtualization we&rsquo;ve come to depend on with cloud computing--which is the virtualization of compute,...[<a href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
API ecosystems are all about research &amp; development, and an opportunity for incubating ideas and apps in a way that invites 3rd party developers and companies to develop innovative ways of using your company assets and resources.  I&rsquo;ve discussed incubation within an API ecosystem before,&nbsp;and how companies are not just identifying developer talent and the best apps, but actually investing in companies via their API.
A new example of this in action is Nike's&nbsp;launch of their&nbsp;Nike+ Accelerator--a partnership with TechStars that will host 10 companies for a three-month, immersive, mentor-driven startup accelerator designed to spur development on the&nbsp;NikeFuel, the Nike+ FuelBand, and Nike+ Running API platform.
The 10 partner companies will be given the following:

$20,000
Access to the Nike+ APIs, Nike+ mobile SDKs, and Nike+ FuelBand Dev Kit (Beta) - you will be among the first in the world to receive this access
A Nike+ FuelBand for each team member
Tech support from experienced developers who've built companies, or built with Nike+ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
Code and solution reviews during the program
Mentor sessions with Nike executives and leaders in the start-up community
Two Investor Demo Days: one at the Nike World Headquarters and one in Silicon Valley
Real Access to Decision Makers


Then, at the end of the Nike+ Accelerator, each team will present to Nike executives, mentors, angel investors, venture capitalists, and tech industry leaders.
As an API publisher have you considered a built-in accelerator or incubation program within your API ecosystem?  And while I&rsquo;m at it, has your incubator or accelerator consider a partnership program tailored for API publishers?
Sounds kind of like a Reese's Peanut Butter commercial! :)

I&rsquo;m big podcast fan, and I"m always looking for something I can listen to in the background while I&rsquo;m coding or writing stories. &nbsp;Traffic and Weather is great for this.
The podcast dives into various topics ranging from Webhooks to oAuth, but keeps things light, where I think even non-technical folks can get up to speed on the latest in the space.  John and Steve make things very informative, while being friendly and keeping it conversational.
I added a widget to my right hand menu, which will always pull the latest episode from Traffic and Weather.  You can also click on the logo to go directly to their site.
Enjoy!

			<p><em>24 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>For the last seven years, when you wanted to find an API you went to ProgrammableWeb. It has been the definitive way to discover new APIs, and responsible for all the buzz in the space that has gotten the industry to where it is. Now that ProgrammableWeb is at 8400 APIs in its directory, and adding 50-100 each week, it will continue to get even more difficult to discover APIs. Even for someone like me who has looked at thousands of APIs, it can be very difficult and time consuming to find the API or APIs you are looking for. In 2013 there are even more ways to find APIs, new approaches that are looking to define the next generation of API discovery and consumption. Currently I&rsquo;m tracking on 4 API directories in addition to ProgrammableWeb: APIhub - APIhub is the best way to publish, discover and consume APIs. Search our database or browse through our most popular APIs APIs.io - APIS.io is an open source and free API registry service that allows developers to publish and discover REST APIs and interact with them online Exicon API Directory - Exicon helps marketers and enterprises find qualified developers through our online platform and advisory services Mashape - Mashape provides a world-class marketplace to manage, distribute and consume both private and public APIs by developers from all over the world APIs.io and Exicon have the least amount of APIs available, but both Mashape and APIhub are currently leading, with Mashape possessing over 1500 and APIhub has over 13,000 APIs available. In addition to providing the ability to search APIs and browse by category, these new generation of API directories are providing sophisticated tools like interactive documentation, code samples and ways to follow, share, like--providing social interactions for API developers with API publishers. Beyond these new bells and whistles, what&rsquo;s next for API discovery? To make developers lives easier they need programmatic ways to discover and understand APIs,...[<a href="/2013/01/24/the-next-generation-of-api-discovery/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Google is migrating samples and tools for App Engine, BigQuery, Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage to a new Github account, they are calling the Google Cloud Platform.
Google is going all in with its use of Github, something I'm encouraging API owners to do.  They are working to manage all of their essential API tools there like their start projects, which show developers how to get started with Google APIs as well as other helper tools like the OAuth 2.0 Helper, that helps developers be successful.
Github provides a lot of benefit beyond the obvious aspect of open sourcing your code.  Google is actively engaging with developers using Github alongside all of these open source projects.  If you think about it, this offers a more compelling way to engage with API developers beyond forums.  On forums you end up with a lot of general, sometimes senseless questions--Github anchors questions or issues and pull requests around actual code libraries, SDKs, starter kits and other integration areas.
Github provides potentially more meaningful actions to occur between you and your developer community, beyond making code more accessible and openly licensed.  It is good to see Google going this route.

			<p><em>24 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>This post comes from the&nbsp;SDK Bridge&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you. ProgrammableWeb is known for publishing the number of public APIs in its directory, and they regularly present an impressive&nbsp;graph&nbsp;that shows how this number has increased exponentially over time. However, not all APIs are public, and ProgrammableWeb is not able to obtain information on how many non-public APIs exist. SDK Bridge writes API documentation as a service, and many of our customers have us document their non-public APIs. That puts us in a unique position to be able to estimate what percentage of APIs is public compared to non-public. Definitions What exactly is a non-public API? For the purposes of this article, let's define a few terms. Public API.&nbsp;A public API is an API where the documentation is freely available on the Web. Using the API may require registering and paying a fee. Partner API.&nbsp;A partner API is an API where the documentation is not made available to the public, but is made available to select companies who have some kind of partnership agreement with the API provider. Typically the documentation is accessible through a password-protected website. Internal API.&nbsp;An internal API is an API that is only used by developers who work for the company that provides the API. Typically the documentation is available only on an internal website. Data Since its inception in 2008, SDK Bridge has written documentation for 23 web APIs. (Web APIs are only a portion of the writing that we do for software professionals. We also write SDK documentation, IT documentation, and training curricula, as well as create video tutorials for developers.) Of these APIs, 12 were public, 9 were partner, and 2 were internal. The following pie chart shows the breakdown: Web API documentation by type. For the non-public APIs (partner and internal), it's interesting...[<a href="/2013/01/24/estimating-the-number-of-nonpublic-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

Google released an update to the Transparency Report today, showing information regarding government requests for users' data on the Google Network.
Google's transparency report proves details on Government requests including who they come from, where the requests originate, types of requests and other critical information about how our government monitor us citizens and ultimately the entire world online.
There are stories on other blogs that state Facebook and other platforms should follow Google's lead with transparency reports of their own.  I agree.  We will never see our government mandate industry leaders to do this, so us people have to lobby corporations to follow Google's lead.
I see this type of transparency being critical to any company claiming they have an "open platform" or "open APIs".  I will be adding transparency report to my list of legal building blocks for all API owners.
As more and more of our world, economy and daily lives moves online and are transmitted via APIs, investigations by our legal system and government are only going to grow.  We need to establish a way to report on these inquiries in real-time and in an open way like Google has been doing for two years now.

After 2.5 years of telling stories on API Evangelist, I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at organizing my ideas, and putting out stories that showcase the best (and worst) from the Business of APIs. I&rsquo;ve gotten so efficient at it in 2012, I even launched API Voice which is dedicated to the politics of APIs, the API Stack which is dedicated to top APIs and Hack Weekends which is all about hackathons. When I meet people in the real world, I often hear, &ldquo;You sure blog a lot, I see like 5 posts a day coming from you!&rdquo; I do write a lot, but it comes in waves. I tend to write a lot of stories all at once, pumping out 15-20 pieces and then I trickle them out across the appropriate domain over the next couple days. In 2013, I&rsquo;m going to get even more efficient with my storytelling, with an evolved approach I&rsquo;m calling Hacker Storytelling. The process is based upon dwhat I already do, but uses a new blend of: Pages - HTML, CSS and text that frames a site, project or research Blogs - Chronological blog posts that walk through a project or research Presentations - Deck.js presentations that walk through a project or research Data - JSON, XML or database stores that drive the essence of a story APIs - Simple, data and representations derived from APIs I use these formats to tell stories across my blog, but in 2012 I learned some new techniques with existing and new technology that &nbsp;I have discovered, and will be employing a series of technologies that help me better deliver stories: Github Pages - A quick, easy and lightweight way to host websites on Github allowing anyone to build site with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

			<p>
Google has an SDK early access program setup for the Google Drive platform, and&nbsp;is inviting a select group of dedicated Google Drive developers to join the program. Giving them access to upcoming Google Drive SDK features and the opportunity to provide feedback.
Google isn't accepting everyone--they will be screening applicants based upon the type and quality of the application, number of users, and ability to implement and provide feedback on new features as they're made available.
An early access program seems like a good idea for API owners.  It gives you the chance to test out your alpha and beta APIs, client libraries, SDK's with a controlled audience, before you release them out into the wild.
With the number of developers Google has, I don't think it will be a problem getting developers to sign up.  But it seems like something you could even pay developers for, if you have a shortage of good developers in your API ecosystem.
An early access program fits right into earlier stories I've done on possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems.

			<p><em>21 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
WSO2's open source API management platform for creating, managing, consuming and monitoring APIs, now has the ability to track API usage through Google Analytics.
Since APIs are deployed using HTTP, the same transport we are using for websites, it makes sense that we should be able to see statistics for both our websites and APIs, side-by-side using Google Analytics.
After creating a new profile for your API in Google Analytics you can put the tracking code into your WSO2 API Management interface and begin seeing real-time or standard (24 hour) reporting on API traffic in the Google Analytics interface.
Since Google Analytics has an API and widgets, you will be able to use this data easily in other reports or system integrations that may need access to your API usage data.
It is great to see innovation around API analytics and reporting, beyond the standard dashboards we've seen from most providers. I'd like to see more stories and scripts to help automate API reporting using Google Analytics, StatsD and Graphite or platforms like Mixpanel.
Disclosure: &nbsp;WSO2 is an API Evangelist platform partner

			<p>It has been a while since I provided an update on the White House Digital Strategy. &nbsp;I monitor the progress of federal agencies participation programmatically, using JSON reports published by each agency at the agencies domain, /digitalstrategy. After running the script today, I notice 20 federal agencies with active footprints. &nbsp;There are about five more, but there are issues with the JSON version of their digital stratgies--I really want to focus on the programmatic value. So, across these 20 agencies I find 76 data API initiatives&nbsp;and 75 mobile API projects. To bring you up to speed, there are two specific milestones in the Digital Government Strategy that specifically address API deployment: 2.2 (Data) - Make high-value data and content in at least existing two major customer-facing systems available through web APIs, apply metadata tagging and publish a plan to transition additional high-value systems 7.2 (Mobile) - Optimize at least two existing priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for improving additional existing services&nbsp;&nbsp; To help shed light on where these progressive agencies are going with both their data and mobile intiatives I wanted to break them out into separate groups, for each agency.

			<p><em>18 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Backend as a Service (BaaS), sometimes called Mobile Backend is a Service (MBaaS) is a growing trend I&rsquo;m monitoring at API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 providers in the space, with two newly added open-source BaaS platforms.
Beyond the research, stories and analysis on BaaS, I just added a BaaS panel at the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference in New York City, February 21st and 22nd.  The panel will include six of the leading BaaS platforms:

Marc Weil (@marcweil) of&nbsp;Cloudmine
James Tamplin (@jamestamplin) of&nbsp;Firebase
Miko Matasumura (@mikojava) of&nbsp;Kii
Morgan Bickle (@morganbickle) of&nbsp;Kinvey
Ilya Sukhar (@ilyasu) of&nbsp;Parse
Ty Amell (@tyamell) of&nbsp;StackMob&nbsp;


API play a critical role in BaaS platforms by providing interfaces for the common services emerging in the BaaS space, like object storage, user management and location, to name a few, but also bring in other 3rd party services like Twitter and Facebook.
I will be moderating this new BaaS panel at APIStrat. Let me know if there are any questions about the space, you&rsquo;d like me to ask.

			<p>Finding APIs that compliment your API, and talking about the mutual benefits is nothing new. When I worked with the print API Mimeo, I would write code that used Mimeo API in conjunction with Box API or Dropbox API. Mashing up or bundling your APIs with other complimentary service can really help, when you are trying to explain the value your API delivers. I&rsquo;m beginning to see patterns of even deeper integration and partnerships between APIs emerge--where one API provider will resell the API of another provider. &nbsp;APIs partnering with other APIs isn&rsquo;t that new, but reselling of each others API services to their developers is a fairly new concept, providing a potential new wholesale channel for API providers. One recent example of this is in a recent partnership between Singly and Cloudmine. Cloudmine is a BaaS provider, and Singly is provider of personal and social data via aggregate APIs. With the reseller approach, Cloudmine developers get a vastly improved stack to develop against, with Cloudmine providing all the essential BaaS tools developers are growing accustomed to, while also having access to 30+ social, personal and other aggregate API services provide by Singly. The goal of this new approach is to provide developers with the most meaningful stack possible, in a single developer area. A MMS API provider like Mogreet could in theory, to better serve their developers, bundle image APIs like Flickr, Instagram and Facebook from Singly into their API area--providing a more robust stack to their developers who are building media enabled mobile apps. Now developers don&rsquo;t have to traverse to each API area on their own. APIs can mashup, bundle and develop a stack, which includes their own APIs, but might also have APIs from potentially several other API providers. &nbsp; Obviously there are lots of details to work out around authentication, pricing, etc., but the potential is obvious.

			<p><em>17 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I just posted a story on how I like the Guardian&rsquo;s approach to data journalism, and spending time evolving on last nights thoughts about the possibilities of Markup APIs.
As I&rsquo;m migrating much of the front-end of my websites to run on a home brew of Github Pages, Jekyll and JSON fueled Mustache Templates, I am seeing more of the potential of not just Markup APIs, but Markdown APIs that will run in a purely client side environment.
Imagine if I could go to a provider like the Guardian, US Census or other high value data provider, grab a link to a Markdown API JavaScript file that is relevant to a story or report you are working on. &nbsp;With this Markdown API I would be given a whole dictionary of markdown you could use.
An example would be, that when I wanted the 2010 population for New York City, I could just write [population|New York|NY|US|2010], or something like that and would print out the actual population for that year in NYC, with a link to the source.  Each time I used a markdown API it would add some sort of attribution to the source at the bottom of document.
Seems like we&rsquo;d establish trusted, centralized sources of information, allowing anyone (even non-developers) to put open data and APIs to use via easy to implement markup or markdown APIs.
Think of the potential if facts around the web actually had the backing of trusted sources, and were able to be embedded anywhere on the web, via apps or digital documents.
It would be fun to create a markup and markdown API for API Evangelist, with a dictionary of terms, facts and other data that were relevant to the API industry.

			<h3><a href="/2013/01/17/api-management-platform-emergent-one-launches-free-tier/">API Management Platform Emergent One Launches Free Tier</a></h3>
			<p><em>17 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Emergent One, one of the newest API management players on the block, just announced a new free development tier.
The Emergent One platform provides simple, cloud-based tools for connecting to your MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and quickly generating an API from your database.
I didn&rsquo;t sign up for their service when they first launched, because they didn&rsquo;t have a free tier, and I&rsquo;m unwilling to put in credit cards and commit to brand new services. This is something I have problem with from running development and IT teams who use a wide variety of cloud services.  I would spend a great deal of time each month chasing down charges and other issues from cloud services that were being experimented with.
The Emergent One approach to deploying APIs from common data sources, is one I think will resonate with users who aren&rsquo;t developers, but understand the importance of APIs, and are often restrained by unresponsive, limited or no IT resources.

Emergent One one is responding to user requests for a cheaper tier that support entry level API users, which will allow them to tweak their API strategies before spending money.  This is something I think is mandatory for all API service providers, something 3Scale were the first movers on, and we have seen Apigee implement recently, as well as&nbsp;Layer7 with their Apify.
I notice that in the email announcement of the 100% free tier, it encourages me to build new APIs at no cost, &ldquo;until launch&rdquo;.  I hope Emergent One will agree that a entry level pricing tier is not critical for users to get to know Emergent One, but essential for educating the masses about the value of APIs--allowing them to experiment. So le'ts please make sure it isn&rsquo;t only until launch.
I&rsquo;m setting up some APIs, directly from one of my Amazon RDS instances. &nbsp; I'll let you know when ready.

			<p><em>17 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I am a big fan of APIs that do one thing and do it well, like Twilio.  I had lunch with the team from a similar API yesterday, called Mogreet.
The Mogreet API lets you send and receive text or multimedia messages and use the platform to transcode, host and send video, audio and images for your web or mobile application.
When you think of the popularity of Instagram, the rebirth of Flickr and the ubiquitous value of photos and images online, it just makes sense that MMS is going to play a critical role in mobile app development in 2013.
I have a daughter, who sometimes responds to my SMS, email, chats and facebook messages.  Her attention span doesn&rsquo;t include always responding to her dad in "his" preferred formats. While she was visiting lately I sat on couch and watched her interact with friends and use her iPhone.   I noticed she communicated mostly in photos.

She communicates by taking photos and sending them, tweaking or distorting them and writing messages before sending, and spent a lot of time surfing and sharing silly photos from around the web--all in a social way via her smart phone.
A picture is worth a thousand words.  I'm not good at math, but that seems 6x more valuable than a Tweet.
When you start thinking about which killer features will emerge in our mobile apps this year, I&rsquo;m sure the majority will depend on photos or videos, making MMS a pretty critical API resources to have in your developers toolbox.
After taking a look at Mogreet, I predict we will see them fueling the next crop of meaningful mobile apps, much like Twilio has done for the last two years.

			<p><em>16 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>Over the holidays I added a new section to API Evangelist called "trends". One of the areas I&rsquo;m tracking on is what I&rsquo;m calling &ldquo;scripting platforms&rdquo;. While you can program against any API using the language of your choice, these platforms are aggregating APIs and make available through a custom language stack. This approach is different than what I&rsquo;m seeing from aggregate APIs like Singly. Scripting platforms may offer aggregate APIs, but are also providing a way to easily script against them, in new and abstracted ways. I&rsquo;m still trying to understand each company, as well as the nuances between each approach--so stay tuned. In the last couple weeks, I&rsquo;m seeing a possible new approach to programming against APIs come into focus, one that is using HTML instead of scripting--using Markup APIs. After reading Building Bridges Between GUIs and Code With Markup APIs by Atul Varma (@toolness) from Mozilla, you can really start seeing not just the potential around rich media and content like Mozilla is with its Webmaker platform, but deliver any API resource in abstracted, simplified markup anyone can put to use--without knowing programming. Lyre Calliope takes this further discussing how, &ldquo;Webmaker could be an opportunity to define an embeddable API strategy for the entire web&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;a Singly Markup API would lower the learning threshold for anyone interested in remixing all of their personal information together in new ways&rdquo;, in&nbsp;Markup APIs and the Read/Write Web. I envision Markup APIs, at their simplest working like Mustache Templates where you can easily render data from JSON templates, or be as robust as what Mozilla is doing with their Webmaker platform. &nbsp;Making the web embeddable and remixable like Lyre says.&nbsp; While scripting platforms are providing an important evolution in APIs for developers, by aggregating top APIs into new resources, the Markup API approach is an interesting evolution in APIs for everyone. &nbsp;And with browser based authentication solutions like Singly's, we can make this a...[<a href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I stumbled across the Google Civic Information API today, which allows developers to build applications around civic information including polling place, early vote location, candidate data, and election official information.  As soon as I landed on the home page, I scanned the left hand navigation, and noticed the option for "embeddable tool".
As you know embeddable tools are are something I advocate all API owners should consider when assembling the building blocks of your API.  I like Google's approach to the Google Voter Information Tool, which lets users look up their polling place, early vote sites, ballot, and election official information for the US 2012 General Election.
To support the embeddable tool, Google provides a quick overview, with instructions for "quick embed" and more granular options allowing anyone to configure region, address, local and other advanced settings.
Even though the 2012 election is over, I think Google's approach to providing embeddable tools with their APIs is potentially something that other API owners can follow, which will make your API accessible beyond just the developer community.

			<p><em>10 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>The mission of API Evangelist is centered around telling stories from the API space, shedding light on the innovative things developers and API providers are doing across all business sectors. Over the holidays I rolled my history of APIs series into its own section. It can be very difficult to understand who the players were in the API game, last year, let alone 10 years ago. If there aren&rsquo;t stories about what happened in 2001, it can be very difficult to piece together the history. In 2012 I also scaled up my API monitoring system to track the blogs and tweets of over 1000 APIs, providing a way for me to track activity across the space and establish my own API ranking system resulting in what I cal&nbsp;the API Stack. This too is very dependent on API owners telling or sharing stories around their operations. I&rsquo;m tracking on over 1500 APIs and only 1000 have blogs and Twitter accounts. With very few other signals to follow, such as stories in the blogosophere, social bookmarks on Hacker News and Reddit or QA on Quora or Stack Overflow--there isn&rsquo;t much to discover about these potentially valuable APIs. At first, I felt there was a flaw in the way I track on APIs. If an API offers value, but there are no stories for me to track on, it won&rsquo;t show up on my radar--leaving me feeling my approach could be flawed. On the flip side, going into 2013 I am eager to find &ldquo;new&rdquo; stories of APIs, feeling like I&rsquo;m constantly telling stories of Amazon and Netflix--contrasting this with the lack of stories around 500 of my APIs, I felt there is an important link. There is a reason I tell so many stories about Netflix isn't chance, it is because Netflix shares so much about its operations, providing fuel for my analysis and storytelling. To shed light on this, I sat down with Daniel Jacobson (@daniel_jacobson),...[<a href="/2013/01/10/netflix-storytelling-and-why-you-should-tell-stories-of-your-platform/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I'm rebooting the marketing and PR for the API Strategy &amp; Practice conference after the holidayz. After finding a new date for the event on February 21st and 22nd, we've gone through the session and speaker lineup and almost the entire line-up is coming back, with a couple of new entries including a new keynote from&nbsp;Jeff Lawson of Twilio.
We had a whole bunch of new requests for speaker additions over the holidays, and while we tried to squeeze in where we could, with such a killer lineup and the fact that everyone was committed to the new dates, we had to decline some pretty good talks.

Over the next week we are going through and confirming with all registered attendees to verify they will be attending, but since the event was sold out before hurricane Sandy, I expect we will be announcing the event as sold out pretty soon.
The event is designed to be an intimate 2 days between 300 industry professionals in the API space. &nbsp;So I recommend if you are excited about APIs in 2013, make sure and head over to API Strategy &amp; Practice site and register before its 100% sold out.

			<p><em>30 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>While writing about the&nbsp;history of APIs, it is easy to be so focused on just APIs, that you overlook the single most important player in the entire history of the web API--ProgrammableWeb. In July 2005, John Musser started ProgrammableWeb. According to his original about page: ProgrammableWeb is a web-as-platform reference site and blog delivering news, information and resources for developing applications using the Web 2.0 APIs. I started this site because I couldn't find what I was looking for: a technology focused&nbsp;starting point for web platform development. (For a bit more see my initial post.) Although no guarantees, the last time I started a reference site it somehow became Google's highest rated link on the topic. Given that this site will be a collaborative effort with community input as well, this can be what we make it. I hope you find the site useful. John Musser - Seattle, August 2005 I think John&rsquo;s&nbsp;original blog post&nbsp;on why he started ProgrammableWeb, says it all:&nbsp;Why? Because going From Web Page to Web Platform is a big deal. Web APIs are a big deal! Whether its social networking, government, healthcare or education--having a programmable platform to make data and resources available will be a critical part of how commerce and society operates from here on forward. &nbsp;&nbsp; John made a early decision to showcase open and RESTful approaches to deploying APIs vs. parallel attempts of&nbsp;Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) and&nbsp;Web Services, and focused on telling stories about open APIs--way before it was the thing to do in Silicon Valley. When I started API Evangelist in July 2010 (5 years after PW), and started talking about the business of APIs, the technology of web APIs was already widely accepted in Silicon Valley, because of the stories John Musser and Adam Duvander have told on ProgrammableWeb. As we close 2012, a year in which I think we can confidently say APIs are moving mainstream, and I feel we owe much of the success...[<a href="/2012/12/30/history-of-apis-programmableweb/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
You can learn a lot from the history of APIs, and following what the pioneers are doing. &nbsp;Salesforce isn't the coolest API within the Hacker News community, but when it comes to building an API ecosystem--Salesforce knows what they are doing.
I was reading through the Salesforce top developers highlights of 2012. &nbsp;Their highlights doesn't just showcase the success of the community, but what Salesforce feels is critical to keeping their ecosystem healthy.&nbsp;

800,000 developers and climbing:&nbsp;the Salesforce Platform Developer Community is growing at an unprecedented rate.
Cool new Salesforce technologies:&nbsp;Identity,&nbsp;Salesforce Touch Platform,&nbsp;Force.com Canvas, and&nbsp;Java on Heroku&nbsp;for the Enterprise were released.
Content is king:&nbsp;Great books such as&nbsp;The Salesforce Touch Platform Mobile Development Guide&nbsp;and Dan Appleman&rsquo;s new book&nbsp;Advanced Apex Programming for Salesforce.com&nbsp;hit the shelves.
Community is making noise:&nbsp;Salesforce Stack Exchange&nbsp;launched and is already at&nbsp;1,000 users.&nbsp;Developer User Groups&nbsp;have grown to 60 groups across the globe and climbing.
New leaders have emerged:&nbsp;Andy Boettcher,&nbsp;Junji Imaoka,&nbsp;Keir Bowden,&nbsp;Sanuki Ikou,&nbsp;Simon Goodyear&nbsp;&nbsp;are the most recent MVPs to join ranks of the&nbsp;Force.com MVP Program.
We are staying connected, more often and in more ways:&nbsp;Webinars,&nbsp;CodeTalks,&nbsp;Google+ Hangouts,&nbsp;Facebook,Twitter,&nbsp;Discussion Boards, and the list goes on.
Developer Events of Epic Proportions:&nbsp;10,000 Developers at Dreamforce &lsquo;12 with close to&nbsp;300 sessions, Developer Zones at Cloudforce in New York, Tokyo, and London, and Developer Weeks in Brazil and India.

What I hear when I read this list is that to get to 800K developers (holy shit), you need to constantly release new technologies, product resources and content to support your platform, give your community a voice with an emphasis on showcasing the leaders--while also engaging with developers both online and offline.

Salesforce has been building their API ecosystem for 12 years! &nbsp;Twice as long as Twitter. &nbsp;What they highlight as part of their developer community in 2012 is something you should be doing in your own developer community.

			<p>
Storytelling in the API industry is critical to the healthy growth of the space.  John Musser and ProgrammableWeb have been telling great stories in the tech industry, since way before APIs were all lthe rage they are now.
While I was at API Days this year,  I was speaking with Mike Amundsen (@mamund) of Layer7, and we started talking about how Amazon, Netflix (and I&rsquo;d add Twilio) tend to dominate the API discussion.  I considered my talks from API Days, and sure enough--Netflix and Amazon were in there multiple times!
There are other stories we tell around Twitter, Facebook Google and other smaller APIs, but Amazon, Netflix and Twilio were cornerstones of API folklore in 2012.  While I will keep telling these pillar stories (because they matter), as well as evolving other pioneers from my history of APIs section, I want to develop a fresh lineup of amazing API stories for 2013.
Stories like Johnson Control's, Panoptix API, and how a 125 year old company can change their culture and embrace a new way of doing business via APIs.
I will make sure there is easy access to the classic Amazon, Netflix and Twilio API stories.  I will also be adding new versions of some other classic stories from Salesforce, eBay, Flickr and other API pioneers.  But in 2013 I will be working to find a new set of API stories from brands and companies we know.
If you have an API success story you&rsquo;d like to share, please let me know.

			<p><em>27 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>I'm immersed in deep thought around my personal data, asking some important questions about my digital self--which includes the state of my online personal data. After reading 14 big trends to watch in 2013, by Alex Howard (@digiphile), I got immersed in World Economic Forums Personal Data: The Emergence of a New Asset Class paper. I'm still processing all of my thoughts around the paper, but one statement really stands out: The issues surrounding personal data &ndash; political, technological and commercial alike &ndash; are numerous and complex. The choices stakeholders make today will influence the personal data ecosystem for years to come. The World Economic Forum then outlines five key area that require action: Innovate around user-centricity and trust. The personal data ecosystem will be built on the trust and control individuals have in sharing their data. From a technological, policy and sociological sense all stakeholders need to embrace this construct. One particular area of focus is the continued testing and promoting of &ldquo;trust frameworks&rdquo; that explore innovative approaches for identity assurance at Internet scale Define global principles for using and sharing personal data. Given the lack of globally accepted policies governing the use and exchange of personal data, an international community of stakeholders should articulate and advance core principles of a user-centric personal data ecosystem. These pilots should invite real-world input from a diverse group of individuals who can not only articulate the values, needs and desires of end users, but also the complex and contextual nuances involved in revealing one&rsquo;s digital identity Strengthen the dialog between regulators and the private sector. Building on a collective sense of fundamental principles for creating a balanced ecosystem, public and private stakeholders should actively collaborate as the ecosystem begins to take shape. Those responsible for building and deploying the tools (the technologists) should more closely align with those making the rules (regulators) Focus on interoperability and open standards.

My name is Kin Lane, I am the API Evangelist.
While traveling the globe, dedicating my life to API evangelism, I only drink one beer--IPAs.
Coincidence?  I think not!
This blog is dedicated to discussing the amazing world of India Pale Ales, also known as IPAs.
Once you have acquired the taste for the hoppiness of IPAs, you'll never go back.

			<p>The end of the year is a great time to reflect--looking back at the year with a desire to quantify and understand ourselves. With our increasingly digital (social, cloud, mobile, APIs) lives, there are more opportunities than ever to ask our digital self very specific questions, and with the power the API get an answer back. Over the holidayz, I spent some time asking some questions I wanted to know about my world in 2012--things that were important to me, and help me feel healthy, happy, accomplished and ultimately successful. (aka.&nbsp;Optimize for Happiness) I broke these questions up into interest areas, then using APIs set out to find the services I use, or could use, that would help me answer these questions.

			<p>I was scrolling through my feeds today and I came across, "Earth As Art" from NASA. I clicked on the homepage and didn&rsquo;t think much, and moved on. Then I came across Earth as Art book from NASA on Flowing Data, where they showed an actual image from the &ldquo;Earth As Art&rdquo; collection. Sure, I suffer from ADD. But so does much of the world. I work through huge amounts of data on a daily basis, looking for gems. Sometimes I can find them myself, and sometimes I need help. The &ldquo;Earth as Art&rdquo; is an amazing collection of satellite photos from NASA. I feel the entire collection could be made into an exhibit, allowing us to experience, take in and discuss the meaning of art, created from space of the planet we live on. I also feel NASA&rsquo;s Earth as Art I think is a poster boy example of how APIs can open up and provide access to content, but also work as conduit for syndication, sharing, remixing and expression around content the owner may not have been able to see. The deployment of the Earth as Art collection at NASA has a title, description and meaningless photo thumbnail--accompanied by a PDF and iPad app. Obviously NASA saw the value in delivering an iPad app, and making the content accessible to the masses via a PDF. As soon as I saw the images I want to create something that would share, syndicate and bring awareness to their beauty. My hands are immediately tied, with only a PDF and iPad app--I am not equipped with the tools of a developer. If there were simply a JSON file of all images, titles, locations and details. Before I got to work, I looked around, but couldn&rsquo;t find any raw data for the project. So I created my own JSON representation of the Earth as Art PDF. JSON output is so much more valuable than PDF output. It...[<a href="/2012/12/22/amazing-visuals-but-lack-of-api-imagination/">Read More</a>]</p>

2012 has been a great year to be in the API space. We saw some pretty amazing growth, and everyone is talking APIs going into 2013.
I wrote 243 blog posts on API Evangelist in 2012.  The top 10 posts for 2012 were:

Barack Obama Directs All Federal Agencies to Have an API
Twitter Rolls Twitter.com Back to a Server-Side Architecture
The Secret to Amazons Success Internal APIs
APIs Are Forever, Wait No...They Can Go Away at Any Time!!!

			<h3><a href="/2012/12/20/history-of-apis/">History of APIs</a></h3>
			<p><em>20 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>The history of APIs is something I discuss a lot. &nbsp;The history of modern web APIs is something I include in all my talks, and I'm always surprised by how little people understand some of the more popular APIs that got us to where we are at. To further support this area, I've launched a History of APIs section where I've hung the stories I've already done in this area, and will be looking to dig up the history on other APIs that are shaking things up. When I'm talking to people about APIs, the term APIs can mean many different things. Sometimes it means hardware APIs, or the Java API or various other technical incarnations. Right now when you hear the term API, it probably means web API or an API built using REST, running on the same infrastructure the World Wide Web runs on. When it comes to APIs, I strongly feel that to understand where we are, we need to understand the short, modern history of the web APIs. There are several patterns to why the modern web API movement has worked, that I think you can take home and use in your own API strategy. Commerce While modern web APIs were officially born with&nbsp;Roy Fieldings dissertation Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures in 2000--Web APIs first appeared in the wild with the&nbsp;introduction of Salesforce&nbsp;on February 7th, when the company officially launched its API at the IDG Demo 2000 conference. Salesforce was an enterprise-class, web-based, sales force automation as a "Internet as a service", with XML APIs were part of Salesforce.com from day one. &nbsp;Salesforce&nbsp; Later in the year, on November 20, 2000,&nbsp;eBay launched the eBay Application Program Interface (API), along with the eBay Developers Program--which was originally rolled out to only a select number of licensed eBay partners and developers. &nbsp;Ebay Then on July 16, 2002,&nbsp;Amazon launched Amazon.com Web Services&nbsp;allowing developers to incorporate Amazon.com content and features into...[<a href="/2012/12/20/history-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m working hard to understand the emerging patterns of of how APIs used, work through the details, and grasp the differences in competing approaches--in hopes of identifying what is next when it comes to web APIs. One trend I&rsquo;m tracking on is the emergence of API scripting platforms. This is a difficult are to track on, because we script against APIs all the time, right? This is different. Scripting platforms are providing platforms and libraries to support easily scripting against multiple APIs. To help me understand this new approach to using APIs I&rsquo;m studying three separate approaches: Webshell - Authentication, integration and scripting platform. Temboo - Beyond&nbsp;code snippets, into ready-to-use processes, that simply API integration, taking care of authentication, credential management, updates and more Google Apps Scripts -&nbsp;A JavaScript cloud scripting language that lets you extend Google Apps, integrate 3rd party services and build mobile and web applications. All three of these platforms are bringing together valuable API resources, from multiple sources into not just a common interface, but providing a language library you can use to build apps efficiently across multiple API resources. I&rsquo;m still working to understand the nuances of each approach. For example, Google provides its JavaScript like, stripped down language, where Webshell focuses on JavaScript and CoffeeScript. Temboo provides ready to go processes or what they call choreos, with language SDKs in Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby and Python. Google Apps Script provides access to Google APIs and services, but recently opened up scripts to acts as connectors, that can be developed by 3rd party providers. Temboo has over 100 APIs in its library, while Webshell is just getting going with less than 25. I see what Webshell, Temboo and Google are doing as similar to the aggregation, integration and some times automation we are seeing in other trending API areas, but these approaches are actually building languages that allow you to be more expressive with not just single APIs, but fluently...[<a href="/2012/12/19/taking-apis-to-next-level-with-api-scripting-platforms/">Read More</a>]</p>

I'm working on a new trends section of API Evangelist. &nbsp;One area i'm tracking on is the opportunities around 3D printing and APIs. &nbsp;
I did some fun research, and laid down some interest thoughts on APIs and 3D printing in 2011. &nbsp;This was part of some research I was doing while working at Mimeo. &nbsp;
As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts. With this trends research into 3D printing, I am working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact.&nbsp;
I've identified 10 major components of 3D printing:

Creators&nbsp;- 3D designers of virtual print objects
Scanners&nbsp;- Scanning hardware for generating 3D models
Modeling Software&nbsp;- Applications for building 3D models
File Formats&nbsp;- File formats for storing 3D models
Warehousing&nbsp;- Virtual storage for 3D models
Marketplaces&nbsp;- Arenas for showcasing, distributing and ordering 3D products
Printers&nbsp;- Companies and hardware that deliver 3D printing
Process &amp; Materials&nbsp;- The process and materials that go into 3D printing
Makers&nbsp;- The people who understand 3D printers, process, materials and industries
Delivery&nbsp;- Logistics behind getting 3D printed products to consumers

Of course this is just my perspective of the industry and can evolve as I learn more, and collaborate with other industry players.&nbsp;
This series was just to help me understand the major components, and I will do another series on how APIs can impact these areas. &nbsp;I also have a summary post on&nbsp;ProgrammableWeb.com&nbsp;about the role of APIs in 3D printing.
3D Printing is something I will be talking about a lot in 2013. &nbsp;I think all of these areas I laid out have the potential to be radically transformed by APIs. &nbsp;I will be taking my original research on 3D printing from 2011 and see where I can evolve it based upon what is going on in the 3D printing space in 2013. &nbsp;&nbsp;

The number of available APIs is growing at a neck breaking speed.  I have trouble keeping up with individual APIs, and I feel I am losing touch with the nuances and trends within specific areas like music or travel.
I am getting more and more questions like this via email and twitter:

I am doing some research on music APIs. I am considering using one to integrate music streaming and relevant data into an app.  Can you recommend anyone who has technical or business expertise (or both) with these in particular?  I would love to speak with an expert to help lead me and my developers in the right direction.  Some points I am considering:

Technical capabilities (streaming speed, limitations of service, etc.)
Access to support from API parent company
Business opportunities or restrictions that arise when relying on the API


These are concerns that might be shared with other industries, but knowing the music industry--there are plenty of unique issues developers encounter when building applications and businesses around music APIs.
Back in February, I did write on how EMI is helping developers navigate building apps for the music industry, but beyond just shedding light on what others are doing, I don&rsquo;t have the time to specialize in the details of how APIs are transforming the music industry.
There is a huge need for more professionals to step up within specific industries and develop the domain expertise necessary to make sure APIs are being deployed with the proper technical, business and political building blocks, and help developers understand how to navigate the nuances of a particular industry being transformed by web APIs.
Could you be this person, feel free to connect with me. &nbsp;I see a desperate need for experts in the music industry, education, health care, government and other fast moving business sectors.

I had a chance to talk with the Johnson Controls, Panoptix API team this last week.  The Panoptix&reg; community&nbsp;offers:
a combination of software and services that easily and cost-effectively helps customers see more so they can do more to achieve optimized building performance and energy efficiency
To understand what Panoptix enables...imagine if all of our buildings:

Thought for themselves
Teach us to reduce energy consumption
Diagnose problems in real-time
Self correct when necessary
Call a service provider when they need repair or tuning

Panoptix starts with a cloud-hosted platform that enables buildings to collect and manage data, along with tools for automating operations at the building and space levels providing metering for electricity, water, gas oil steam, carbon and weather--with very granular level reporting up to overall trends of energy use.
To grow Panoptix, Johnson Controls introduced a marketplace of apps combined with supporting news, information, resources and entire community dedicated to building performance and efficiency management.
This marketplace and community is driven by an&nbsp;API developer area, allowing anyone to sign up and get to work developing apps and start selling them in the Panoptix marketplace.  The Panoptix API is free to use for anyone looking to developer one app, allowing you to collect 70% of revenue from app sales in the marketplace (an essential ingredient for developer success).
I like Johnson Controls approach to building a community around building management applications, data and resources--complete with a API driven developer area.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s great to see a 125 year old company open up their hardware and software with such an innovative approach.
I&rsquo;ll be digging further into how Johnsons Controls deployed the Panoptix API, with further entries to this blog series, and a full case study on their approach to delivering their API driven building management platform.

			<p><em>17 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Some great API questions for Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier over at Startup Juicer today.
Zapier is a company that couldn&rsquo;t have existed even a few years ago as API&rsquo;s were not commonplace. What other advanced do you envision changing the way businesses operate?
APIs are just the first piece, but it&rsquo;s still the wild west in the API world with APIs constantly changing. One thing that will happen is APIs will move away from polling driven to push driven. That way API consumers don&rsquo;t have to constantly asking providers for new data like a kid on a long trip asking &ldquo;are we there yet&rdquo; but can instead rely on the API provider to send us the data when we get to the proverbial travel destination.
What your thoughts are about the changing landscape of API access with some of the free big networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin are becoming increasingly restrictive in the way they allow developers to access their feeds?

The only services I&rsquo;m seeing become more restrictive in how they allow developers to use their APIs are free tools. Many those services are in the high growth stage and are starting to think about monetization and are experimenting with lots of different ways to make money. Unfortunately this means instability for developers. Zapier leans heavily B2B though. And B2B services are doubling down on their APIs. For them, more usage of the API leads to more usage of the core product and since their core product is a paid service that means more paying users and the paying users are upgrading to higher plans. That means a service like Zapier is highly valuable to both API providers and to consumers alike.
Those are just two of the questions Startup Juicer asked, head over to the full interview with Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier at Startup Juicer.

API service provider APIphany followed some of my advice this last week, and added support for Github, Facebook and Twitter in all of their developer portals.
Using oAuth from Twitter, Facebook and especially Github for API providers, just makes sense in this online world.  As a user, I don&rsquo;t want to create yet another login--I want to pick from my preferred social network.
It is good to see APIphany make sure their customers deliver friction-less onboarding for their developers, who are building mobile and web applications on top of their APIphany powered APIs.

			<p>I started tracking on Hackathons full time in 2011, as part of my API Evangelism toolbox. In 2012 I&rsquo;ve watched Hackathons explode and become a popular way for API owners to engage and build a relationship with developers. (if done right) As I do with other trending areas, I launched as its own site, hackweekends.com. I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of demand from hackathon organizers and sponsors to add events and other news and information. To support this I recently launched Hack Weekends on Github, so anyone can edit pages, write blog posts and add events to the calendar. A sort of crowd sourced hackathon hub. To further support the hackathon community I also wanted to provide an open source hackathon guide, helping anyone understand how they can throw their own hackathon. There were already two great hackathon guides out there which are Open Data Hackathon How to Guide and The Hack Day Manifesto---both licensed openly. So I took this excellent material and merged with my own material to create a Hack Weekends Guide. The Hack Weekends guide provides a very detail guide to throwing a hackathon, and I also included a website template that runs on Github Pages using Jekyll. My goal is to make it a plug-n-play guide with all the tools and resources you need to be successful in your communities hackathon Next I need to actually prove my &ldquo;open source&rdquo; approach to planning, designing and marketing hackathons. I&rsquo;m planning several hackathons to make sure the process works. The first hackathon I am planning is for OC Hackerz in Orange County, California. OC Hackerz is a big supporter of developers, and is in sync with my vision of what the hackathon space should look like, so they are a great partner to plan two initial hackathons: OC Hackerz Hackathon - Los Angeles - March 2013 The planning of the OC Hackerz Hackathon is meant to be an exploratory deployment of the Hack Weekends...[<a href="/2012/12/12/exploring-a-new-way-of-planning-and-executing-hackathons/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Singly is continuing its quest to easily explain what it does for developers. &nbsp;The San Francisco startup has re-launched defining itself as, fabric for connected apps, or AppFabric. &nbsp;
Singly puts it best:
Singly AppFabric empowers you to add social login, sharing and friend finding into your mobile and web applications.&nbsp;Singly DataFabric handles syncing, data formatting, de-duplication, and normalization letting you query by location, keyword, and more.
When building mobile apps you are going to need to bridge social networks for your users, allowing them to authenticate with their preferred platform as well as pull friends, images and provide sharing in a meaningful way. &nbsp;You either do this platform by platform, or you use Singly's AppFabric to do this for you.
The best example of this in the wild, is with Singly developed mobile app Timehop.

Timehop lets you see your photos and updates from this exact day in history.

To use Timehop, I need to sign up using Facebook (this is Singly).

Now I'm registered for Timehop and I have my Facebook history connected.

Using Singy AppFabric, Timehop allows me to easily connect my Foursquare, Instagram, Twitter and Flickr services.

Now Timehop can intelligently connect me to my friends across these networks and share my Timehop stories, where it is most important to me.
Singly is weaving together the most critical of social and personal APIs into an AppFabric, that developers can use to build the next generation of API driven mobile apps.
As a developer, you won't think of development with single APIs anymore like Twitter and Facebook. &nbsp;You can use AppFabric to build meaningful apps, knowing the social authentication, friends, sharing, photos and other objects across the multiple networks is at your disposal in a single, standardized interface.
Singly is AppFabric for our personal and social data, that developers can use to build the apps that we depend upon ever day.
Disclosure: &nbsp;Singly is an API Evangelist partner.

			<p><em>11 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>API Discovery is becoming an increasingly troubling problem. As an analyst, I see a dizzying amount of APIs each month. When I get asked to find a particular type of API, or group of APIs in a particular industry--it gets difficult to discover a meaningful results to any query. My options for API discovery historically has been ProgrammableWeb. The OG API Directory. Today there is a new player on the block, APIhub. APIhub is a fresh attempt at solving the API discovery, with over 13K APIs organized by category, type, protocol, format and security. API Hub is looking to provide a solution for two distinct groups: Developers - Developers need an ecosystem to discover, learn, test and use APIs Publishers - Publishers require a platform to publish, manage, engage customers, and monetize APIs With first release APIhub&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have much out of the gate that is different than ProgrammableWeb, except for a much cleaner layout, search tools that is not cluttered by news, mashups and advertising. Once you explore APIhub further, you start seeing early signs of deeper features. When you add or claim your API, your given the option to upload a API spec in a Swagger or WADL format, with more formats coming soon. If implemented for all 13K APIs, this could be a powerful discovery engine. Beyond programmatic discovery I see hints of ranking on the platform. Right now its just 5 star ranking, but have hopes for more sophistication on how developers, publishers and analysts can rank APIs in the future. Allowing consumers to find new and existing APIs in meaningful ways--other than just 5 star ranking or my number of followers and mashups built on an API would be extremeley valuable. APIhub, marketplace or directory is nothing new. You see folks like APIs.io trying to step up with a directory and startups like Mashape providing a hub of their own, in a similar attempt to create an API marketplace.

			<p>Hackathons have been a big part of current web API movement. They are one of the most meaningful ways API owners can connect with developers in person. &nbsp;Twilio, Amazon and Facebook have all used hackathons to build their ecosystems. I started a section on API Evangelist in 2011, dedicated to hackathons. And in early 2012 I rolled this section out as its own site, hackweekends.com. &nbsp;Over 2012 the number of hackathons has grown significantly--making it difficult to ignore hackathons as channel for reaching developers. This weekend I migrated the Hack Weekends directory to run on Github. It uses Github Pages and Jekyll for the blog. I deployed mustache templates and JSON files for the events calendar and curated news section. I&rsquo;m working on ways to easily crowdsource the management of Hack Weekends, while establishing it as an open source hub for the hackathon community. In addition to establishing Hack Weekends as a hub for the community, I wanted to create a guide to throwing hackathons. So anyone can organize their own event. To help feed this, I&rsquo;ve been gathering my own research on hackathons from attending, mentoring, hacking and organizing hackathons over last 2 years. I also knew that there was other really good information available from other hackathon experts. So I pulled together the best, open information on throwing hackathons and combined it with my own research. Pulling content from: Hack Weekends Open Data Hackathon How to Guide The Hack Day Manifesto With this content and my experience I wanted to organize into something more. Remixing and setting into motion, a guide that anyone can use to organize a hackathon. While maintaining the calendar for Hack Weekends, I see a lot of hackathon sites. To accompany the Hack Weekends Guide I wanted hackathon organizers to be able to easily deploy a website in support of the event. The Hack Weekends Guide comes with a hackathon website template as part of the Github repository.

			<p><em>09 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>At the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas, NV last week I discussed the "grass-roots web API movement" with quite a few enterprise folks. Walking through the exhibit floor, where I did my building blocks of an API workshop, I noticed the signage and discussions were all focused on APIs. During my discussions with multiple enterprise developers, analysts, architects and executives, one question seemed to come up a lot: Didn&rsquo;t we do all of this 10 years ago? What is different this time around? With a strong focus on the technology of web services, many in the enterprise fail to see the difference between SOA and API. In an effort to better tell stories in this area, I wanted to revisit the SOAP vs. REST argument, and refresh my thoughts. &nbsp;So I got to work pulling up old stories, and while conducting my research I noticed the same patterns I see in the REST debates--a heavy focus on the technical, with only a few discussions of the business and politics of web services. If you are new to the SOAP vs. REST debate, let me get you up to speed. Wikipedia defines SOAP as: SOAP, originally defined as Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of Web Services in computer networks. SOAP was designed as an object-access protocol in 1998 by Dave Winer, Don Box, Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein for Microsoft, with a specification of SOAP currently maintained by the XML Protocol Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). After SOAP was first introduced, it became the underlying layer of a more complex set of Web Services, based on Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI). SOAP, XML and Web Services are all part of earlier approach to APIs which is widely considered to be called Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). While SOA is still used in enterprise environments, it...[<a href="/2012/12/09/some-thoughts-for-the-enterprise-embracing-web-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been maintaining a calendar of hackathons for all of 2012. Originally it was just a section off of API Evangelist, but eventually the site needed to be its own project. Up until now its just been a blog and calendar of events I curate from Eventbrite, Twitter, Google, Eventful and event organizers. I spend about 8-12 hours a week curating the events and stories for blog posts, and with the increase in the number hackathons over 2012, so does the time I need to maintain. I was adding an API so other users can add to calendar or event guest post, then I decided I would like to also have databases of hackathon organizers, sponsors, vendors, venues and other key building blocks of hackathons. My goal is to create an information hub for the hackathon community. But an &ldquo;open API&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t seem like enough. I wanted everything about it to be open and accessible, as well as community owned. I decided to publish&nbsp;Hack Weekends on Github and run it like an open source project. I launched the site using Github Pages with Jekyll. These run the pages and blog for Hack Weekends. &nbsp;But, I needed something to run the calendar, and other systems. I wanted them to be simple--I went with Mustache Templates + JSON stores. The implementation isn't perfect. I had problems getting search and sort tools to work, so I scaled back to a minimal viable implementation. I got the following areas up: Hackathon Calendar - Listing of hackathons global, sorted by city (for now) Cities Hackathon Directory - Breakdown of hackathons by cities Hack Weekends Blog - Blog running on Jekyll, which I edit using prose.io Hack Weekends News - Curated, relevant hackathon links from my pinboard I will get all the bells and whistles in there soon. Before that, I&rsquo;m working on a basic Github template for planning and executing a basic hackathon.

I had the pleasure of speaking at API Days in Paris, France this week.  The organizers originally asked me to do one talk, but after some speaker shuffle, I ended up with three separate talks on APIs.
The second talk I did at API Days was The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal. &nbsp;This material was evolved from past stories I've done on Amazon's and Netflix's success with internal APIs. &nbsp;
I really want to tell more stories about other companies who have had success with internal APIs. But these are the hardest stories to come by, and I feel they are some of the most important API stories we can tell. &nbsp;
If you have a great internal API story you'd like to tell, I love to hear more. &nbsp;Feel free to email or DM on Twitter, and we can figure out the best format to tell your story.
You can view my presentation of&nbsp;The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal from API Days, and I believe the session was video taped, so I'm sure there will be videos coming soon!

			<p><em>07 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>
The organizers of APIs Days asked me at the last moment if I'd like to do a third talk at the European API event, due to last minute cancellations. &nbsp;Of course, I jumped on the opportunity to generate to material and work through it in front of a live audience. &nbsp;
The talk was on business models for your API as a start-up. &nbsp;On the plane ride over I reviewed John Musser's great material on API business models, and prepared a walk through, from a startup's perspective. &nbsp;
Then after watching Guillaume Ballas (@guillaumebalas) from 3Scale give his talk&nbsp;APIs for Biz Dev 2.0, Which Business Model? &nbsp;And watching other speakers I decide to scrap what I had put together, and went an entirely different direction.
I decide to walk through the evolution of an imaginary startup, keeping in mind 3Scale's philosphy that:

Let's not ask what business model for my API.You should be deploying an API for your business model. @3scale @guillaumebalas #apidays
&mdash; Kin Lane (@kinlane) December 3, 2012

Then I walked through what I would consider a robust, healthy startup business model with five tiers:
 

Free users
Paid users
Free developers
Paid developers
Partners
Incubation

Of course, this approach isn't for every startup. &nbsp;I highly recommend checking out 3Scale's presentation if you want to better understand which API business model is right for your startup.
I wanted to tell the story of how you could apply some or all of the monetization strategies outlined by John Musser in his work, while also listening to Guillaume from 3Scale.
The talk is rooted in my research on the Business of Twitter's API and experience I've had in the field consulting and building strategies with existing API owners.
You can view the presentation of my Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up, and I believe the session was video taped so I'm sure there will be video coming soon.

			<p>
I gave a talk at API Days in Paris, France this week. &nbsp;This talk was using some of my usual material around the building blocks of an API. As I always do, I omitted some slides and evolved my presentation a little further. &nbsp;This is one benefit of using reveal.js, driven from the API Evangelist database--I can evolve my content and make better with each talk.
I discussed 5 main areas to consider when building your API developer portal:

History of APIs
API Design &amp; Planning
API Development
API Evangelism
Whats Next for APIs?

My goal is to keep organizing and sharing my view on API design, planning, development and evangelism so my readers can put to use in their own API efforts.
It was interesting to talk through my API building block approach with API owners in France, after giving my talk. &nbsp;I learned a lot by talking with folks there. &nbsp;And I really think Europe has huge opportunity in front of it, when it comes to the API economy.
You can view my Building Blocks (Bricks) for your Developer Portal from #APIDays, I hope to recreate as a Google Hangout Video and publish to YouTube as soon as I make time.

			<p>
I got back last night from France, where I spent the week at the #APIDays conference, billed as the first international event on APIs in Europe.  The two day event was organized by&nbsp;faberNovel, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and byWebShell, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs
After some scheduling shuffling due to speaker cancellations API Days asked me if I&rsquo;d do three talks on APIs, instead of just my one--resulting in these three presentations:

Building Blocks (Bricks) For Your Developer Portal
The Secret to a Successful API is Internal
Business Models for Your API as a Start-Up


While the building blocks presentation is my usual material (but needs to be told over and over to new audiences), the other two talks represents entirely new work based upon other stories and research I&rsquo;ve done in the past.
I learned a lot while at API Days.  It was about 200 people, discussing APIs over the course of two days.  I was really impressed with the passion everyone had for APIs and the genuine interest in understand the essence of the web API movement--discussing ideas, philosophies and approach rather than just the technology of APIs.

I feel an awakening occurring in Europe right now in regards to APIs.  My Twitter has lit up in the past three months with new European based followers focusing on APIs, and flood of new requests for discussions and information about APIs.
With a very healthy stance on transparency, privacy and data ownership I think the EU has an excellent opportunity to become a major player in the API economy, and I predict good things to come out of not just France, but other EU countries in 2013.
I look forward to getting back soon, and talking APIs!

I read a great post recently about how a company called Teenage Engineering has started providing 3D CAD files that allow their customers to 3D print replacement parts for the products they make.
It is awesome to see things I talk about become reality. &nbsp;I wrote about the concept of a 3D printed junk drawer last year, while doing research on 3D printing and APIs.
Teenage Engineering is taking a big step, and potentially leading the industry in new ways. &nbsp;Can you imagine if companies by default, provide 3D drawings of common replacement parts and pieces for their products?
There is still a lot of gaps in how all of this can work, 3D printing is widely available yet, but with retailers like Staples playing around with offering 3D printing on demand, the future for 3D printing is looking pretty bright.

			<p><em>30 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
There was a great post last week on ProgrammableWeb from Curtis C. Chen (@sparCKL), on how a company called Spectagram has launched a new JavaScript library built on top of Instagram.
Spectagram uses JQuery to provide a basic set of embeddable tools for Instagram allowing users to embed widgets showing latest photos, popular photos, and photos by tag.
Instagram has been notoriously focused on their core product, which leaves a lot of areas open to its developer community.  Even the first version of the Instagram API was created by a passionate developer.
It is interesting to see such a sophisticated Javascript library developed by a developer, essentially rolling out something Instagram should be doing themselves, but obviously haven&rsquo;t prioritized.  Something I&rsquo;m sure many API owners would love to have happen in their communities.
For more information you can visit Spectagram for more deails, and get at full documentation at their Github repository.

			<p><em>30 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I conducted two workshops this week in partnership with Intel at the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas.  Working from my Building Blocks of a Successful API material, I put together a 30 minute workshop that I conducted at 12 and 6PM on Tuesday.
My workshop started with the history of APIs, then walked through API building blocks in 3 areas:

API Design&nbsp;
API Development&nbsp;
API Evangelist

Then I stepped back and emphasized that APIs are all about research &amp; development and business development for your company.
After stepping back, I looked into whats next with APIs with API aggregators like Singly, API automation platforms like IFTT and new API programming libraries like Webshell.
The goal of my talk was to plant a few seeds in attendee&rsquo;s mind:

APIs Are More Than Tech&nbsp;
APIs Require a Business Approach&nbsp;
Politics Can Be Biggest Killer of APIs&nbsp;
Focus Delivering Value

You can view the slide deck below for the workshop.  If you&rsquo;d like a custom demo feel free to contact me and we can do a Google Hangout.

			<p><em>30 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I got an email from Anthony Wu over at LearnSprout yesterday.  If you are not following what LearnSprout is up to, they are bridging legacy student information systems (SIS) and providing easy to use web APIs that application developers can use to build educational apps.
The email from Anthony was in regards to a SIS LearnSprout was integrating with, which he said:
IlluminateEd is the best SIS API we've seen so far!   Clean &amp; simple. OAuth, JSON, no bullshit. If every SIS did this, we could just move on to greener pastures. This kind of thing should be encouraged!
I agree with Anthony. The&nbsp;IlluminateEd API&nbsp;is clean and simple.  They intelligently use common technical API building blocks like oAuth and JSON, while keeping the API interfaces intuitive and meaningful and provide simple, up to date documentation.
My only criticism is simple, and would be about the description for the API:  &ldquo;This API allows third party applications to interact and communicate with the Illuminate system&rdquo;.   This is a classic mistake from API owners.  Unlike Anthony I had no idea what the Illuminate system is.  I can assume its a SIS, but they should really make it a little more description for newcomers.
Even though the API isn&rsquo;t perfect LearnSprout says it is better than:

Humans as APIs (i.e. office secretary mashup with Excel)
CSV as APIs (the status quo)
Screen Scraping as APIs (for some, the ends justify the means&hellip;)
Legacy DOS terminal emulation

Learsprout sees a lot of different approaches to accessing and sharing data between SIS systems.  They have a lot of value to bring to the industry, and I enjoying telling the story about what they are experiencing.  And I agree with Anthony and this type of effort should be encouraged within the education space.  Nice work IlluminateEd.

			<p><em>30 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Right before the Thanksgiving holiday, in an effort to make the Facebook platform more responsive and dependable for developers, Facebook announced Developer Alerts.  Developer alerts are a way for Facebook platform developers to receive critical information about their apps via email or Facebook notification.
Facebook Developer Alerts provide the following for Facebook app administrators:

Breaking Changes - If your app is using functionality that FB is changing or removing, you will be sent an alert at least 90 days before the change goes into effect
App Status Changes - If you have submitted Open Graph actions or created an app detail page for App Center, FB will use Developer Alerts to notify you when the status of your submission changes
Policy Violations and Enforcement - If your app doesn&rsquo;t adhere to FB Platform Policies you will be notified through these alerts

Facebook Developer Alerts are more than notifications, it is an issue management system which will allow multiple developers on a project to known when action is required or things have been resolved.
It seems like a great approach to improving communications between API platforms and its API application developers.  I think I will add platform alerts as an official API building block, and recommend it as something API should consider when developing their platform.

			<p><em>30 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Poster boy for how to properly run your API ecosystem properly, Twilio, recently updated their DOer Gallery to highlight developers in the Twilio ecosystem that build cool stuff on the popular voice and SMS API.
Twilio has the best record I&rsquo;ve seen of any API, when it comes to showcasing and being loved by their developer community, and I'm sure the DOer Gallery plays an important role in that.

The Twilio DOer Gallery has the following features:

Personal Details
Short Bio
Skills
Other Profiles
Projects

Devloper Galleries like Twilios might not be for every API platform.  But if you have a passionate base of developers you might want to consider giving them their own profile and a gallery where they can not just discover and interact with each other, it can let other companies find potential developers to execute projects via your API.
A Developer Gallery can be a great way to give your API developers some love and attention.  Twilio even features developers from their DOer Gallery on their blog in a "DOer of the Month".
Would showcasing your &ldquo;API DOers&rdquo; benefit your API community?

			<p><em>30 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
In 2012 the number of APIs has grown significantly.  We are transitioning from &ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t enough APIs&rdquo; to &ldquo;how do we more intelligently use many APIs&rdquo;.  As I track on this and the future of web APIs, I&rsquo;m noticing growth in the number of API aggregators like Singly.
A couple of weeks ago I was introduced Adigami, a "Singly for Analytics".  While Singly focuses on personal data API aggregation, Adigami is focused on aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today--covering seven key channels:


Web - Google Analytics
Search - Google AdWords, Microsoft Bing
Display - DoubleClick, Yahoo! APT, Facebook Ads, MediaMind
Social - Facebook Insights, Twitter
Mobile - Yahoo! Mobile, Verve Wireless
Email - MailChimp, SendGrid, ConstantContact, ExactTarget
Custom - Adigami can import proprietary data.

Operating your business on the Internet or "in the cloud" is a reality, and as we operate more and more in this cloud, each platform will have its own set of analytics--making the need to centralize and standardize analytics across channels and platforms more and more critical.
Adigami is just the tip of the iceberg.  I predict we&rsquo;ll see API aggregators emerge from top industries like government, healthcare and education.  In 2013 we will learn to more fluently communicate with web APIs with the help of API aggregators like Singly and Adigami.

Swag can be a critical tool in any API evangelist toolbox.  And stickers are one piece of swag that if possessing the right design, can be something developers will take home and put to use.
Earlier today Ari Fuchs (@arifuchs), developer evangelist for Aviary asked, &ldquo;who do you use to print your sticker swag?&rdquo;

attn devangelists and startup marketing masters, who do you use to print your sticker swag? cc/ @baconseason @swiftalphaone @kinlane

			<p><em>29 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
The legal building blocks of an API can be just as critical as the technical and business building blocks.  It makes sense to version and communicate your API terms of use (TOS) , privacy policy and branding guidelines alongside your code.
Since Github will allow document types other than code, such as markdown and PDF, it can make sense to use Github for managing the legal side of your API.
Using Github for the legal aspects of API operation will provide a level of transparency developers will appreciate, allowing them to download and store for their own records while being able to see the difference between each version, in a format that makes sense to them.
Just as with all other areas of an API, Github will allow you to completely manage the evolution of your API terms, privacy and branding in a way that is in sync with all the other technical and business building blocks of your API.
Consider using Github for API legal building block management.

			<p><em>29 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I am heading to Paris, France next week for API Days.  API Days is December 3rd and 4th in Paris and is dubbed as the "First National Event on APIs in Europe".   The two day event is organized by faberNovel, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and by WebShell, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs.
API Days&nbsp;sees the API economy the same way I do:
The Web 1.0 was readable, the Web 2.0 was social, now the web is programmable through application programming interfaces, aka APIs. Web APIs are a unique opportunity for companies, governments and developers to either better organize the governance of their IT into a scalable and flexible model, either leverage a complete ecosystem around the organization, exchanging data through the web for trillion of applications on billion devices. Because each civilization has been described by the way it communicates and make exchanges, API are the beginning of a programmable civilization.

The API event is hosting over 50 sessions from over 30 speakers--including two of my own talks:

The Secret to a Successful API is Internal
Business models for your API as a start-up

I&rsquo;m excited to see APIs getting interest in Europe.  And after working with the Webshell team for several months and learning more about FaberNovel, I'm excited to be working with both of them to drive API adoption in Europe.
If you are planning on going to API Days, let me know and I&rsquo;ll make time to talk.  If you aren&rsquo;t, I will publish more info about the event and my talks here on API Evangelist, when it is all wrapped up.

			<p><em>29 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>The team over at Chartboost have a pretty forward thinking blog post about what they see as the next generation of web application development. They feel that the future is about creating web applications, not sites. The server side should be an API and the client should be a self-contained app which uses the API as its back-end. With mobile applications following the same pattern. To practice what they preach, Charboost is overhauling their help site to be an API driven web app using the following approach: Push State - Provide site navigation without page refreshes by faking navigation and inserting JavaScript callbacks JSON-API - A REST API providing JSON to drive the site Responsive Design - Providing an application design that responds to mobile as well as it does laptops or desktop computers Vector (Icon Fonts &amp; CSS) - Using a combination of icon fonts and CSS3 to deliver the UI. SCSS - A new technology that uses CSS-preprocessing to make the CSS code cleaner and res-usable Markdown - Using the simple markup language to allow anyone on their team to write and edit help articles GitHub - Using Github to manage the help center as an open project I agree that their metholody has the potential to be one possible future of web and mobile application development. JavaScript and API development have both matured in the last 10 years, getting us to this point where you can build some damn sexy, but simple apps that run smoothly on the web or mobile devices. &nbsp; Or as Chartboost puts it: We believe that the web is finally reaching a tipping point. The culmination of a decade of incremental improvements to web technologies is upon us, and lets us do things in a way that is radically new and better. I&rsquo;m also playing around with my own approach to delivering apps in this way using Github + Jeckyll + Mustache Templates with JSON data stores,...[<a href="/2012/11/29/chartboost039s-api-driven-approach-to-application-development/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>Social analytics provider&nbsp;PeopleBrowsr&nbsp;has won a temporary injunction against Twitter today, with a complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court. It reads: PeopleBrowsr seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent Twitter from destroying its business, interfering with PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s contractual and prospective business relations, and restraining competition in markets using Twitter data. The complaint was filed in response to a trheat from Twitter to cut off PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s access to its Firehose by November 30, 201 &nbsp;PeopleBrowsr has had access to the full Twitter full firehose for over four years. According to the complaint: PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s products require the full Firehose feed. A mere sample of Twitter data is insufficient for PeopleBrowsr to provide the products its users expect. Though there are some data analytics companies that can provide certain limited types of Twitter data analysis based on sampling, PeopleBrowsr competes in a separate &ldquo;Twitter Big Data Analytics&rdquo; market, in which a few, highly sophisticated players analyze massive amounts of Twitter data to provide deeper insights. Twitter&rsquo;s decision to terminate PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s firehose follows a&nbsp;pattern of it consistently cutting off partner and developer access to the platforms and its data. In doing so Twitter&nbsp;has sought more control in their effort to monetize the social networking platform and provide&nbsp;investors with a return on their investment of almost 1.4B dollars. PeopleBrowsr states that it has &ldquo;invested millions of dollars and years of work in building a business based on the Firehose&rdquo;. It says it did so in rlying on Twitter&rsquo;s representations that it would maintain an &ldquo;open ecosystem&rdquo; and allow other companies to use of its data. Through agreements with Twitter PeopleBrowsr felt it could compete without fear that Twitter would cut off access to its data in order to influence which businesses succeed or to usurp business opportunities for itself. Twitter has consistently described&nbsp;the Firehose as a part of this open ecosystem that it would make available to &ldquo;everyone in the system&rdquo;, and this open approach was a key component...[<a href="/2012/11/28/peoplebrowsr-wins-temporary-injunction-to-keep-twitter-from-shutting-off-firehose/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Those of you who follow my blog, know my favorite API management service provider is 3Scale. It&rsquo;s no secret I&rsquo;m a fan of what they are doing. We share a vision of the API space and what a healthy API industry will look like. In support of that vision, 3Scale just launched a new open source API proxy build on the NGNIX web server technology--a move, I feel is important for 3Scale, as well as the entire API industry. What makes 3Scale&rsquo;s approach signficant, is that by deploying the NGNIX proxy, API providers don't need to rely on proprietary API proxy solutions, while also gaining additional benefits, such as acess to a library of 3rd party addons and modules available in the NGNIX ecosystem. All while employing an established technology that has been proven to deliver in highl volume production environments. In addition to the benefits provided by NGNIX, the proxy provides seamless integration with 3Scale&rsquo;s API management platform that delivers: API business modeling using service contracts, API rate limits and pricing rules API access control &amp; security with API key generation with user id, app id, oAuth API analytics &amp; reporting including alerts, statistics, business intelligence API billing &amp; payments supporting pre-paid, post-paid, PCI compliant, six separate payment gateways Developer portal for self-service registration and onboarding Interactive API Documentation for better adoption using Swagger This list represents everything you will need to get your API up and running. 3Scale enables you to do this both on premise or in the cloud, using a proxy that you cotrol--then alllowing you to choose which 3Scale API management services you need to use. But what is most important for me, is 3Scale allows you start off without spending any money. 3Scale has a free, entry level tier that will allow you to design, experiment and iterate until you find the meaningful API definition that works for your developers--at which time you can scale, paying for only what...[<a href="/2012/11/15/3scale-launches-open-source-api-proxy-built-on-ngnix/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>I was listening to a story about Nevada quietly starting their implementation of health insurance exchanges, as part of what everyone loves to call Obamacare. I&rsquo;m not even going to get involved in the politics and merit of making sure everyone is insured--I want to focus on the execution of it. Immediately I think: Where is the state health insurance exchange platform API? According to healthcare.gov an exchange is: A mechanism for organizing the health insurance marketplace to help consumers and small businesses shop for coverage in a way that permits easy comparison of available plan options based on price, benefits and services, and quality. By pooling people together, reducing transaction costs, and increasing transparency, Exchanges create more efficient and competitive markets for individuals and small employers. And the principles and priorities of state health insurance exchanges are: Establishing a State-based Exchange - Establishment of an Exchange is a critical step that States must take to be on track for achieving certification of an Exchange by January 1, 2013 under Section 1321. Promoting Efficiency - Exchanges must be mindful of costs for consumers, employers, and the federal government. Avoiding Adverse Selection - Successful Exchanges will avoid adverse selection by ensuring that those who buy through the Exchange are a broad mix of the healthy and the less healthy. Streamlined Access and Continuity of Care. Section 1311(d)(4)(F) requires Exchanges to evaluate and determine eligibility for applicants in Medicaid, the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and other health programs - Exchanges must also comply with all applicable federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. The federal government will provide critical building blocks and financial support for achieving an efficient enrollment process including verification of&nbsp;eligibility for tax credits. Public Outreach and Stakeholder Involvement - Section 1311(d)(6) requires Exchanges to consult with a broad range of stakeholders in carrying out their activities. Public Accountability and Transparency - Accountability requires transparency. Section 1311(d)(7) requires public reports on Exchange activities, and Section 1311(e)(3)...[<a href="/2012/11/13/where-are-the-apis-for-state-health-insurance-exchanges/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for meaningful API analogies, to stock my evangelism toolbox. Ways that I can relate the potential of APIs, in a way that anyone can understand, even non-developers. In my opinion, the success of the web API movement lies in the ability to extend, potentially complex resources in a very simplistic and universal way. So, as an evangelism I have to abstract away the complexities and make sure I connect with my audience. As I&rsquo;m tracking on the API space and working to quantify the potential future of APIs, I&rsquo;m struggling to find meaningful analogies to articulate where API driven platforms like Singly are moving the industry. But just as with the technology, leave it to the Singly team to do this for me. Singly made a slight shift in their branding recently, using the words API Fabric in the description of what they do. This seems like a slight change, but it truly is an exceptional way to describe the Singly approach to app development using social authentication and data.&nbsp; At first glance, to a non technical person, fabric may be defined as: fab&middot;ric/Ëfabrik/ Noun: Cloth, typically produced by weaving or knitting textile fibers With synonyms being cloth, material, structure, textile, texture and web. Using this definition of fabric as the source for my analogy can work by itself. It can help a non-technical person understand what is possible when you can quickly begin weave together apps using different APIs--visualizing some sort of woven textile, with unique meaning. Immediately helping anyone, visually relate to the potential when developing on top of social and personal APIs. If you are more technical, the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; might help you understand Singly at another level. In information technology, fabric is a synonym for the words framework or platform. In general, the term fabric can describe the way different parts of something work together to form a single entity. Fabric can be used as a...[<a href="/2012/11/13/the-api-fabric-for-the-next-generation-of-apps/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Socrata announced today that they are preparing to release an open source, cloud-based, open data system, called the &ldquo;Socrata Open Data Server, Community Edition.&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t already follow what Socrata does, they are the data platform behind municipal open data initiatives like NYC City Data, San Francisco City Data and Data.gov. The new Socrata Open Data Server is meant to be a reference for the open data standard they are actively evolving to promote data portability throughout open government data ecosystems, and support open source software policies in public organizations around the globe--called The Open Data Substrate. The goal of the Socrata open source strategy is to enable customers to rapidly accelerate the process of breaking data out of traditional database &ldquo;silos,&rdquo; move it to the cloud and opening it for mass consumption to end users and developers. &nbsp;The Socrata Open Data Server will support the ongoing evolution of open data standards in three key areas, that Socrata feels are required for a thriving open data ecosystem: Data Catalog Interoperability &ndash; Enable universal federation of different open data catalogs using a standard catalog schema, based on the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) Data Portability Based on Standard Data Formats &ndash; Standardize outputs including JSON, XML, and CSV, as well as RDF and other Linked Data standards. The goal is to evolve towards standard schemas that developers can use for popular data sets, based on real-world examples and collaboration between data publishers Application Portability Based on Open Data API Standards &ndash; Standardize the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used to programmatically access open data, using established paradigms and protocols such as REST, HTTP, and Structured Query Language (SQL) Socrata&rsquo;s move to open source their technology is in line with their mission: Socrata&rsquo;s mission is to help government organizations everywhere reap massive economic benefits from data liberation by promoting unfettered access, shareability, consumability and reuse of public data.

			<p>BandPage, a hub for musicians to manage and control their online presence, just expanded their reach with BandPage Connect, an API, allowing developers to build apps for the music industry. I wrote about their update once, publish everywhere with an embeddable API strategy back in July, feeling an API would be next. When it comes to a Bands most treasured assets, music is always held up as the most valuable piece of the catalog, but band info, events, venues, videos and photos of the band are essential to the success of these artists--emotionally connecting fans with their favorite bands. This is where BandPage Connect comes in. The API will allow bands to provide content to open API developers, as well as their partners, in a self service approach. BandPage Everywhere allows bands to easily manage their presence with robust embeddable apps that they can easily distribute across the web, but BandPage Connect takes this to the next level--allowing developers define what is next, when it comes to building web and mobile apps that connect bands with their fans. BandPage Connect provides a solid approach for the music industry to provide access to valuable band assets, but also provides a centralized way to control presence. Ryan Kavontrka, Digital Manager for Maroon 5, Sara Bareilles, Gavin DeGraw, and Eve 6, says, "There are a lot of platforms out there that have our bio, photos, and videos, but the info they have about us is out of date and we don't have a way to change it. This makes it so that any member of a band or their manager/label can update the content, not just the guy who knows HTML. If you're connected with BandPage, you know your entire online presence is up-to-date." All a band has to do, is manage their presence via BandPage, and they can use BandPage Everywhere to allow any fan or partner to easily embed content on sites and social networks, as...[<a href="/2012/11/13/bandpage-connects-bands-to-their-fans-using-an-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I don&rsquo;t know if you saw the big news last week, but software publisher Axway announced intent to acquire API service provider Vordel.  I&rsquo;m not a big fan of covering funding, acquisition or launch press releases, unless there a significant business story there.  But the acquisition of Vordel is another important sign for the API industry in 2012.
Financial terms of the deal haven&rsquo;t been disclosed, but the acquisition shows the API industry is maturing and producing desirable companies with proven API products, that larger software companies can use as a competitive advantage.  While Vordel's API management, SOA governance and identity management will help Axway&rsquo;s customers, I think Vordel&rsquo;s customers is probably the type of new client large software companies will want be also seeking out through acquisitions.

I always joke with John and Adam at ProgrammableWeb about, &ldquo;Is this the year of the API&rdquo;? They have been at it longer than I have, and are very hesitant to dub any particular year, the year of the API.  But, with the growth we&rsquo;ve seen in 2012, two open source API management platforms deployed and now a major acquisition in the space--I confidently would say 2012 is the year APIs came of age.
I predict in 2013-2015 we are going to see more of these types of acquisitions occuring.  Large software companies are going to need a robust set of API tools to bring legacy systems into the modern, API driven economy.  Companies that have invested in API management service providers like 3Scale and Mashape will see the return they are looking for, as the space continues to grow in the next five years.

I started actively looking for evangelists, advocates and ambassadors in multiple cities last week.&nbsp;I got a great response from quite a few folks who were already evangelizing in their communities or just curious about evangelism.
Even with the response I&rsquo;m still looking for evangelists in Portland, OR, Seattle, WA and Austin, TX.
If you're interested in attending tech meetups and hackathons in your town and evangelizing some innovative API and developer platforms, I want to talk more.
I was surprised to get numerous folks contacting me in other cities around the world, saying they were open evangelism in their area.  Even though I&rsquo;m actively looking in Portland, OR, Seattle, WA and Austin, TX, I&rsquo;m still looking to add other cities to my list--so don't hesitate to reach out.
Visit the interested in evangelism page, submit the form and I&rsquo;ll get you plugged in.

			<p><em>12 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
When you operate an API, you need to make sure and communicate with your developer community about what your plans are for the future, so developers can plan their own roadmap, and keep in sync with the coming changes to the API.
In addition to issue management using Github, API providers can use Github to manage their roadmap using the milestones features of the social coding platform.  Milestones can be directly related to issues or can be larger goals around where you intend to take your API.
Milestones give developers insight into what the plans are the future of an API, using just a title, description and target date.  Milestones are one of the simplest aspects of an API, but can go a long way in creating goodwill with your developers.
API providers have to balance transparency versus giving away information to competitors, something that will take regular consideration.  A transparent roadmap for your API will let developers prepare properly, while also letting them know what features are coming in the future--eliminating the possibility of competing with your own ecosystem.
Consider what you can include in your Github roadmap, and using Github for issue management.

Backend as a Service (BaaS) provider CloudMine and aggregated social API platform Singly announced a partnership today, to make sure the mobile applications developers are building using CloudMine have social baked in by default.
CloudMine is delivering on the BaaS promise and providing all the tools developers need to rapidly develop and scale their mobile applications, by providing a complete backend solution for developers including user management, object storage, push notifications, syncing and other essential tools developers need to be successful.

CloudMine + Singly Partnership Announcement from CloudMine on Vimeo.
Social is the logical next step in the BaaS evolution.  Social authentication, data, friends, followers are also essential for any developer building an app these days, so the partnership being CloudMine and Singly makes sense.  Instead of CloudMine aggregating these essential social tools, they can rely on Singly to bring this to the table for CloudMine developers--allowing CloudMine to stick with what they do best.
If you want more information, you can head over to CloudMine or Singly, and see how their approach can help your mobile app development.

			<p>Mobile app development is at the center of API deployment in 2012. Much of the interest in designing, developing and deploying APIs is so that you can successfully launch one, or multiple mobile applications. I get a lot of questions from companies looking to deploy APIs, where they can find development talent that will help them with their API driven mobile initiatives. Up until now I didn&rsquo;t have much to offer them, any mobile developer I know that is good, is already snatched up, and without direct experience deploying projects with a development shop, I didn&rsquo;t have one to recommend. Now that has changed, I&rsquo;ve been working with a rock star web and mobile dev shop called Concentric Sky. And over the last couple years I have really gotten to know their team of developers and management--and I&rsquo;ve been blown away by some of the projects they are producing: Encyclopedia Britannica - for iPad and iPhone - The definitive encyclopedia app. Over 80,000 articles, and thousands of photographs - and the &ldquo;LinkMap&rdquo; lets you explore each article with a dynamic view of related topics. NSF's STEP Central - Commissioned by the National Science Foundation (NSF), we designed and architected a robust, online community for STEP grantees to present and share their project information in a centralized place. United Nations CountryStats - Developed for the United Nations, UN CountryStats is a data visualization app for iPhone and iPad that makes it easy to compare key economic, social, environmental, trade, and area &amp; population indicators for 216 countries and territories. All data drawn from the United Nations' unique and authoritative data set. Those are just a few of the amazing projects come out of Concentric Sky.

I was trying to explain the experience of being at the Defrag Conference, to a friend&nbsp;the other day.  We are both gearing up for the event, next week (November 14th &amp; 15th), in Broomfield Colorado, and he had never been to one so I wanted to share a little about what the experience is like.
The Defrag event is organized by Eric Norlin, who also organizes Gluecon and Blur conferences, all at the Omni Interlocken resort in Broomfield.  Each of Eric&rsquo;s events have evolved each year, but currently reflect the following focus:

Gluecon - Cloud, Mobile, APIs, Big Data for developers
Defrag - What's coming next  in technology
Blur - Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

Eric has a unique way of bringing together the leaders from the space to discuss relevant technologies in a very intimate space.  The Omni Interlocken resort is a very key element to the events, which makes it unlike other events I attend.
The first of Eric&rsquo;s events I attended was a Gluecon, several years back.  We drove out to the location, and I remember thinking, &ldquo;oh man we are going to be stuck way out here for 4 days&rdquo;.  But as I learned, that is the point.

You are stuck in a very intimate location where you will eat killer grub, including beef sliders and drink some kick-ass craft beers while rubbing elbows and having deep technical and philosophical conversations with the deepest thinkers and leaders in our space.
Defrag and Glue are part of a small group of events I recommend you never miss in the space.  I&rsquo;m pretty burnt out on large technology conferences, but the value you walk away with from Defrag can&rsquo;t be found anywhere else--putting Defrag in entireley different category for me.
I hope to see you at Defrag next week. If your there, I&rsquo;ll buy you an IPA, while we talk APIs.

			<p>
Github should be the center of your API operations, with the most obvious use being for SDK repositories, but Github offers a lot of other valuable tools that you can use to manage your API platform.
One great use of Github is as an API issue management tool.  The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories, for processing by your development team.
To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management.  Think of it as repository for your API itself.
Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentially be part of the API product development cycle.

Github isn't just for code.  Github can be used for HTML documents and PDF's as well.  This opens up endless possibilities for management of documents you wish to share with your developer ecosystem.
One excellent example of this is publishing presentations from the various talks, hackathons and conferences you present at.  When you are done with a talk and would like to share with your community, you can just expose it as a PDF or HTML document, and push to Github.
You can also use this same approach for how-to guides and training materials you want to make available for your developers.  Allowing them to download and fork, or even follow the changes on Github, for the richest training materials an API provides.
Github provides a powerful way for you to version, evolve and share your essential API resources with the community--keeping them in sync with all other activity around your API.

			<p>
I'm digging on this statement from Gil Elbaz @ Factual. &nbsp;Gil is participating on a panel &ldquo;The Forest for the Trees: The Meanings of Data&rdquo; at the&nbsp;Techonomy Conference&nbsp;on Sunday, November 11th in Tucson, Arizona at the Ritz Carlton.&nbsp;
We live in a world of patterns. Now we&rsquo;re getting better at discerning them. As we see the big patterns in human behavior, and in the movement of money, products, jobs, weather, energy, disease, and even molecules and stars, a new era of understanding dawns. Can companies and governments draw proper conclusions fast enough? Where will this world of patterns discerned take us?
I've heard Gil talk several times, and I am a big believer in his views on data, and supporter of Factual as a platform. I firmly believe we can help companies and government draw proper conclusions, in very real-time ways, using APIs.

To speak in a more traditional marketing sense, a pretty standard sales funnel can be used to set the stage, defining the intake of developers as the top of your funnel, paid accounts and production applications the bottom of your APIs funnel--giving you a common framework for hanging KPIs on. &nbsp; However, when using a sales funnel to frame your API marketing efforts, be careful of being blinded that success will all be all about moving developers from the top, to the bottom of your funnel. While this is definitely a large part of your efforts, there are plenty of good things that can happen within the funnel that will further drive users into the funnel as well as build trust and evangelism efforts that can be essential to the growth of your API ecosystem. When planning your API sales funnel, the top is all about bringing in new registrations and the bottom should reflect the business objectives of your API. But your funnel flow shouldn't always consist of direct flow to the bottom--think about what other beneficial activities can happen within the funnel: Talent Acquisition - Finding new developers who understand your API and market Social Media Marketing - Tweets and other social media exhaust for users Story Building - New stories you can tell about the value your API delivers Idea Generation - Creative ideas around how to use your API Feedback - Quality feedback from developers about how to make your API better Evangelists - Develop the next generation of developer evangelists and advocates Brand - Awareness of your brand and the value it represents Trust...[<a href="/2012/11/05/api-kpis-should-be-optimized-for-developer-success/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I call it being an evangelist, but it has other names, such as advocate or ambassador.  Someone who is good at evangelism, in my opinion, starts with a love of hacking but is also having a love of helping others learn and understand technology.  I can&rsquo;t help being an evangelist, it&rsquo;s just part of my personality.
These days, I get enough requests for evangelists, so I decided to start finding passionate hackers within specific communities to help fill requests.  Some requests for evangelists are full time positions, some part time, while others involve just going to meetups and hackathons in evenings and on weekends as needed.
Currently I&rsquo;m on the hunt for some passionate hacker personalities in New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Austin, Atlanta and Portland.  If you live in these cities, are passionate about API, mobile, social and the cloud--you should consider a life of evangelism.
Even if you aren&rsquo;t quite sure what an evangelist, advocate or ambassador does, feel free to reach out.  Chances are you are already attending meetups, hackathons and already doing evangelism activities--you just aren&rsquo;t getting paid or receiving incentives to do so.
Visit the interested in evangelism page and I can answer your questions and get you plugged in. &nbsp;

			<p><em>03 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
One very powerful way to use Github within your API strategy is for developer profiling.  This approach requires the deployment of another Github solution, API Developer login using Github.
After you implement authentication for you API using Github, the Github API provides a wealth of opportunity for you to learn more about developers.
The types of developers you want for your API are also developers who have an active Github profiles.  Using Github, you can immediately tell if someone is an active developer based upon their presence and usage of the social coding network.
Github provides basic profile details, like where a developer lives and which programming language they use.  You can also see which other tools and code they following and commit to, giving an overall profile of their developer lifestyle.
Using Github you will also be able to tell if a user has downloaded or forked your own API SDK's, giving you insight into how well your SDK"s are being received and used.   There are endless ways you can use Github to stay in tune with your developers, but first you have to employ Github authentication as part of your API strategy--then get to work profiling developers, and better understand who they are.

			<p><em>02 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>I spend a lot of time trying to find company logos and a little blurb about what a company does. &nbsp;You'd think in this cloudy API driven world there would a simpler way. &nbsp;
I decided to create my own solution. &nbsp;I created an about.json file for API Evangelist.

When you need my company logo, a quick description about API Evangelist or other key information like my Twitter account or Blog RSS, you know where to find it.
Now, could you please create one for your company? &nbsp;You can copy my about.json above, go to JSON Editor Online, paste it in and create your own. &nbsp;When done, make sure and save to your desktop as text file and upload to the root of your site. &nbsp;
I'll always take a look at http://example.com/about.json first to see if a company has it, before Googling on my own for a logo and about blurb.
Maybe some day, every site will have one.

			<p><em>02 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) needs our help to explain to the Federal Circuit Court on why there should NOT be copyrights on APIs. As EFF published today: Earlier this year, we applauded District Court Judge Alsup for getting it right and holding that, as a matter of law, one could not copyright APIs. The case, Oracle v. Google, is now on appeal to the Federal Circuit, where a three-judge panel is going to revisit Judge Alsup&rsquo;s ruling. The EFF is soliciting the our assistance in how to help build the case, asking for feedback on two example areas: Software reimplementing someone else&rsquo;s API, calling someone else&rsquo;s API, or any other uses of third-party APIs for interoperability, competition, or innovation. Reimplementation of an API, where the resulting software benefitted the original API creator, perhaps by increasing the creator&rsquo;s user base or otherwise benefitted the developer community I think we are in the infancy of API deployment, so it&rsquo;s going to be tough to find many solid examples. &nbsp;But I think the two areas we can demonstrate the importance of no copyright on APIs, is within two business sectors that evolved on the web, using APIs and are critical to business and government today: Cloud - As EFF said, Eucalyptus reimplemented the Amazon API to offer a competing cloud storage service. You also saw the same with first implementation of Google Developer Storage and up to &amp; other providers: Dunkel Cloud Storage, âHost Europe Cloud Storage, GreenQloud Storage Qloud, ScaleUp Technologies, âConnectria Cloud Storage, Lunacloud, and DreamObjects Cloud Storage&nbsp;providing unprecedented interoperability for cloud computing. Social - Same as with cloud you have seen competition pop up for both Twitter and Facebook, mimicking their platform and APIs. Platforms like App.net have copied Twitter&rsquo;s social network providing competition, and potential value to Twitter users by allowing developers to use App.net for things they can't use Twitter for. I think another clear example of open API design being used...[<a href="/2012/11/02/help-eff-make-case-for-no-copryight-on-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
We are wasting no time getting the&nbsp;API Strategy &amp; Practice conference&nbsp;back on track, after being put on hold because of hurricane Sandy. With the current status of New York City, it&rsquo;s subways, airports, there is no way the event could have happened--we made the right decision to cancel.
We are currently discussing the best dates for rescheduling in January and February of 2013, and are hopeful that we will have date finalized next week.
While we are awaiting that process we figured we&rsquo;d spend some time and discuss the session lineup for the conference. We are rather proud of the keynote, panel and session lineup we&rsquo;ve pulled together, but we feel we can make it even better.
So we are going to hold a Google Hangout today at 11:30 AM PDT / 2:30 PM EDT, to discuss the API Strategy &amp; Practice session lineup and invite you to participate. If you&rsquo;d like to be a participant in the hangout, email me at&nbsp;[email&#160;protected]and if you&rsquo;d like to just watch the hangout, follow&nbsp;@apistrat&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ll tweet out the Youtube link right before.

To be the change I want to see in the world, I created an about.json file for API Evangelist.

Now you can programmatically pull information about API Evangelist, and I will keep updated as things change.

			<p><em>29 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
When it comes to API service providers, there is one brand that I would say is widely known, but when we are talking about APIs, often gets overlooked.  That company is Intel.
In addition to a whole suite of SOA and Cloud Middleware, all with an emphasis on security--Intel has a REST Web Services Gateway.   This provides a simple solution to the number concern I get from potential API owners:  How do I secure my API?
The Intel REST Web Services Gateway provides:

Invoke Security Token Service credential mapping or validation
Ensure throttling and SLAs by REST service
Extend Enterprise audit and compliance to WOA and REST
Detailed XML threat prevention and payload inspection
Service virtualization, proxy, and abstraction as a policy enforcement point
REST API security and management

You can find a summary of the product, a&nbsp;full data sheet, as well as some video tutorials over at Intel.

If you would like to know more, or have questions make sure and come to API Strategy &amp; Practice this week in NYC.  Intel will have a session on their approach to APIs, as well as be on a panel that I&rsquo;ll be moderating on API service providers. &nbsp;Intel is also a gold sponsor of API Strategy &amp; Practice--the event wouldn't be happing if it wasn't for Intel. &nbsp;Thanks!
If that isn&rsquo;t enough!  I will also be doing some workshops with Intel at the Gartner AADI conference in Las Vegas, the end of November. &nbsp;So you will have another opportunity to speak with both of us.
If you can&rsquo;t make to either New York or Las Vegas, drop me an email and I&rsquo;ll get you in touch with Intel.

			<h3><a href="/2012/10/29/api-developer-login-using-github/">API Developer Login Using Github</a></h3>
			<p><em>29 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>As with most social platforms, Github provides oAuth for their platform, allowing developers to provide secure credentials and authentication for their users via a Github account.
Service providers like Singly are providing two click authentication using Github's oAuth.  This allows any website or app to offer their users the ability to login with their Github profile.
Allowing authentication via Github is no brainer for API providers. Why require users to create yet another login, or even use Twitter or Facebook oAuth?  Allow them to login and retrieve API keys via the one social profile that reflects the programmer side of their online profile.
Github login can be implemented in any programming language, and because it is oAuth, it is something end users will understand.  In addition to providing easy authentication, you will be able to immediately see other important data about a developer that is available via their Github profile.
Consider the potential of using Github authentication as part of your API strategy.
