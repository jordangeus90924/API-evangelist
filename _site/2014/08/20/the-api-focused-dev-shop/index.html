<p>I tag a lot of interesting companies that show up during my weekly API monitoring. When I see a tag go from 1 or 2, to over 5 companies--I take a closer look to see what is going on. An increase in the number of companies focusing in a specific area could be a trend, or it could be nothing.
<p>The tag "API Agency" ticked over to 6 today, when I added&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aquevix.com/">Aquevix</a>, an indian company that is focusing on API development. As of August 2014 I now have six separate agency style companies that I've found who have a focus on API design and development:
