<p>There is an very interesting new 3D Print Exchange API from the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>. The NIH 3D Print Exchange is designed for publishing "biomedically-relevant" 3D models, that anyone can download and use as blueprint for printing on a their 3D printer.
<p>I've been <a href="http://3d-printing.apievangelist.com/companies.html">tracking on 3D printing APIs since 2011</a>, when I started profiling <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/19/api-driven-3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">how APIs were being used by printing, and 3D printing providers</a>. It is interesting to see an industry focused 3D printing API emerge, which I feel is a sign the space is maturing, and will continuing to evolve in 2015.
<p>Another thing to note in this story, is simplistic approach the NIH took in deploying their API. The 3D Print Exchange API has all the essential building blocks to help you understand what the API does, on-board with the API (another story), and get the support you need throughout integration via <a href="https://twitter.com/nih3dprint">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/niaid/3dpx_api">Github</a>, and <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4262712632302b2c36022c2b2a6c252d34">email</a>.
<p>The <a href="https://niaid.github.io/3dpx_api/">3D Print Exchange API</a> has all the fingerprints of <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> on it, demonstrating that APIs in the federal government will continue to pick up momentum with the assistance of 18F of the Presidential Innovation Fellowship (PIF) program out of the White House and GSA.

<p>We just added <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/picking-up-momentum-in-2015-for-apistrat-berlin-with-3-new-speakers/">three new speakers to the lineup for @APIStrat Berlin this April 24th and 25th</a>. I get pretty excited about this part of the event planning lifecycle, which is all about reviewing talks that being submitted, and working with the rest of the APIStrat, and now the API Days team, to develop the best lineup possible.
<p>Here are the three that we added today:

<p>An open project for me this month, is about better understanding how API keys are provisioned, and how developers are given access to valuable resources. As the number of APIs grows, so do the number of APIs that we depend on in any single application, forcing developer to have to manage many API keys, potentially from many different platforms.
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take an API expert to see that many <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">current practices by API providers requiring consumers to manually register for an account, will not scale</a>. We need more automated ways for not just discovering, but also on-boarding with APIs, allowing API consumers to begin using an API, without the current overhead required.
<p>One idea I&rsquo;m bouncing around in my own APIs, is allowing for instant account creation via an API, allowing you to programmatically generate new account, a new app, and API keys. Of course I do not want these new accounts to have full access to everything, and using my 3Scale API management I will create a specific service tier for these accounts, limiting what they can do.
<p>I want to take this another step further though, I do not want just any spammy, Johnny come-along to be able to create new accounts, without any sort of validation. To help filter, I&rsquo;m developing a Github account ranking layer, requiring you to pass along your Github user with the generation of new account, app, and keys. I will pull the profile for the Github user, and some statistics on their overall profile, and make some assumptions on the developers trustworthiness.
<p>Immediately this approach will limit API access for a number of people, which in some scenarios may not be ideal, but for my APIs, I&rsquo;m willing to allow instant account creation, and API access to people who have an active, verifiable Github presence. I&rsquo;ve been a proponent of API providers providing Github login for developer accounts for some time now, and this seems like a logical next step.
<p>We&rsquo;ll see where I go with this. It is more an exercise than it is a real thing, but who knows, in addition to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/14/storing-api-keys-in-the-private-master-github-repository-for-use-in-github-pages/">using Github to manage my API keys securely</a>, maybe I can actually use it to instantly access new APIs, without having the current overhead I face with each new API on-boarding experience.

<p>My <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/02/all-side-projects-are-now-hosted-on-github/">public websites have been running on Github Pages for almost two years now</a>, and slowly the private management tools for my platform are moving there as well. Alongside my public websites, I&rsquo;m adding administrative functions for each projects. Most of the content is API driven already, so it makes sense to put some of the management tools side by side with the content or data that I&rsquo;m publishing.
<p>These management tools are simple JavaScript, that use the Github API to manage HTML, and JSON files that I have stored either publicly or privately within repositories. I use Github oAuth to work with the Github API, but to work with other APIs I need a multitude of other API keys, including <a href="https://3scale.net">3Scale generated API keys</a> I use to access my own API infrastructure.
<p>My solution is to store a simple api-keys.json file in the root of my private master repository, and then again using Github oAuth, and the Github API, I access this file, read the content of the JSON file into a temporary array I can use wthin my management tools. If you do not have access to the Github repository, you won&rsquo;t be able to read the contents of api-keys.json, rendering the management tools useless.
<p>I will develop a centralized solution to helping manage API keys across all my projects, allowing me to re-use keys for different projects, and easily update, or remove outdated API keys. This approach to storing API keys in my private Github repository is allowing me to easily access keys in client-side apps I run on Github Pages, as well as via server-side applications and APIs&mdash;something that I&rsquo;m hoping will give me more flexibility in how I put multiple APIs across my infrastructure.

<p>When I discuss what is possible when it comes to generating both server and client side code using machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, I almost always get push-back, making sure I understand there are limitations of what can be auto-generated.
<p>Machine readable API definitions like Swagger provide a great set of rules for describing the surface area of an API, but is often missing many other elements necessary to define what server side code should actually be doing. The closest I&rsquo;ve gotten to fully generating server side APIs, is when it came to very CRUD-based APIs, that possess a very simple data models--beyond that it is difficult to make "ends meet".
<p>Personally, I do not think my Swagger specs should contain everything needed to define server implementations, this would make for a very bloated, and unusable Swagger specification. For me, Swagger is my central truth, that I use in generating <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/server-skeletons-in-restlet-studio-and-apispark/">server side skeletons</a>, client side samples and libraries, and to define testing, monitoring, and interactive documentation for developers.
<p>Working to push this approach forward, I&rsquo;m also now using Swagger as a central truth for my Docker containers, allowing me to use virtualization as a bridge between what my Swagger definitions cannot define for each micro-service or API deployed within a specific container.  This approach is leaving Swagger as purely a definition of the micro-service surface area, and leaving my Docker image to deliver on the back-end vision of this surface area.
<p>These Docker images are using Swagger as a definition for its container surface area, but also as a fingerprint for the value it delivers. As an example, I have a notes API definition in Swagger, for which I have two separate Docker images that support this interface. Each Docker image knows it only serves this particular Swagger specification, using it as a kind of fingerprint or truth for its own existence, but ultimately each Docker image will be delivering its own back-end experience derived from this notes API spec.
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting going with this new approach to using Swagger as a central truth for each Docker container, but as I&rsquo;m rolling out each of my API templates with this approach, I will blog more about it here. Eventually I am hoping to standardize my thoughts on using machine readable API definition formats like Swagger to guide the API functionality I'm delivering in virtualized containers.

<p>I continuing to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/using-containers-to-bridge-what-swagger-cannot-define-on-the-serverside-for-my-apis/">evolve my use of Swagger as a kind of central truth in my API design, deployment, and management lifecycle</a>. This time I&rsquo;m using it as a fingerprint for defining how APIs or micro-services that run in Docker containers function. Along the way I&rsquo;m also using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as a framework for organizing these Swagger driven containers, into coherent API stacks or collections, that work together to accomplish a specific objective.
<p>For the project I&rsquo;m currently working on, I&rsquo;m deploying multiple Swagger defined APIs, each as separate Docker containers, providing some essential components I need to operate API Evangelist, like blog, links, images, and notes. Each of these components have its own Swagger definition, and corresponding Docker image, and specific instance of that Docker image deployed within a container.
<p>I&rsquo;m using APIs.json to daisy chain all of these APIs or micro-services together. I have about 15 APIs deployed, each are standalone services, with their own APIs.json, and supporting Swagger definition, but the overall project has a centralized APIs.json, which using the includes properties, provides linkage to each individual micro-services APIs.json--loosely coupling all of these container driven micro-services under single umbrella.
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m just using APIs.json as a harness to define, and bring together the technical aspects of my new API stack. As I pull together other business elements like on-boarding, documentation, and code samples, I will add these as properties to my parent APIs.json. My goal is to demonstrate the value&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> brings to the table when it comes to API and micro-service discovery, specifically when you deploy distributed API stacks or collections using Docker container deployed micro-services.

<p>I find it more valuable to scrub the names of the APIs from about 75% of my stories, which I feel helps them be received by a widest possible audience as possible. If I say &ldquo;API Provider X&rdquo;, other providers just think I&rsquo;m talking about that company, but when I make it generic, I find API providers think I&rsquo;m talking about them.
<p>There are many reasons I would scrub individual or company names from a story, most often this is because they&rsquo;ve asked me not to reference them public, but are fine with me telling the story in an anonymous fashion. However, it occurred to me over time that there are other more powerful storytelling influences potentially behind leaving out specific characters.
<p>Early on I identified that there are a lot of API lessons to be learned across business sectors, but if you reference the specific company, or business sector, many business leaders or developers will put there blinders on, feeling this doesn&rsquo;t apply to them. Ideally companies would identify the potential of hearing stories from other ways of doing business, but unfortunately many lack the imagination to make the transition&mdash;lucky I have enough imagination to go around! ;-)
<p>I thoroughly enjoy storytelling in the API space. Over the last four years I&rsquo;ve developed a voice I enjoy speaking in, and have slowly built an entire toolbox of approaches like scrubbing people or company names, to make my storytelling more impactful, and potentially reach a wider audience. I feel strongly that I would never have been able to do this if API Evangelist was purely a marketing blog for a company, but because I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be able to focus exclusively on entire API space, spanning multiple business sectors, and left to my own devices when it comes to the editorial choices--I&rsquo;ve been able to grow my storytelling in ways I never imagined in 2010 when I first started.

<p>I talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/29/adding-rate-limits-for-apis-in-the-documentation-for-each-endpoint/">Twitter's inclusion of rate limits inline with documentation the other day, which is something I added as a new building block</a>, that API providers can consider when crafting their own strategy. Another building block I found while spending time in the Twitter ecosystem, was an oAuth signature generator inline within the documentation.
<p>While browsing the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter documentation</a>, right before you get to the example request, you get a little dropdown that lets you select from one of your own applications, and generate an oAuth signature without leaving the page.

<p>I am seeing oAuth signature generators emerge in a number of API platforms, but this is the first inline version I&rsquo;m seeing. I&rsquo;ve added this to my tentative list of oAuth and security building blocks I recommend, but will give some time before I add. I like to see more than one provider do something before I put it in there, but sometimes when it is just Twitter, that can be enough.

<p>As I read and listen to all of the Internet of Things stories coming out of CES, I&rsquo;m happy to be <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/01/08/375923229/privacy-security-focal-points-at-ces">hearing discussions around privacy and security</a>, come out of the event. I feel better about IoT security and privacy when I hear things like this, but ultimately I am left with overwhelming concern about of the quantity of IoT devices.
<p>There are many layers to securing IoT devices, and protecting the privacy of IoT users, but I can't help but the think that Internet of Things security and privacy will always begin by asking ourselves if we should be doing this at all. Do we need this object connected to the Internet? Are we truly benefiting from having this item enabled with cloud connectivity?
<p>I'm going to try and keep up with tracking on the API layer being rolled out in support of IoT devices, but not sure I will be able to keep up with the number of devices, and the massive amount of hype around products and services. At some point I may have to tap out, and focus on specific aspects of IoT connectivity ,around what I consider the politics of APIs.

        <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm about 1/3 of the way into <a href="http://theapistack.com/">generating Swagger specifications for the APIs at the 700+ companies that I monitor.</a> I have the Swagger specs for almost 250 APIs so far, and have no idea how many I&rsquo;ll have when I'm done (ha, will I ever be done), as the target is kind of ever moving. The only way to get to know an API better than having to create a Swagger spec for it, is to actually integrate with it.
<p>Thankfully I&rsquo;m not integrating with ALL of the APIs I monitor, but I do want to get more intimate with their API surface area, right up to actually having to integrate. There are four ways that I obtain a machine readable API definition for an API:
<ul>
<li><strong>Manually</strong> - Good ol fashioned elbow grease because there is nothing standard about an APIs documentation, or even the API itself, forcing me to hand craft a Swagger definition that works.</li>
<li><strong>Scraping</strong> - Some APIs documentation is pretty standardized, making it very easy to write a scrape script that harvests, and generates a Swagger skeleton of endpoints, headers, parameters, and other aspects of the interface.</li>
<li><strong><a title="APITools" href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a></strong> - Some APIs that I&rsquo;m actually integrating with, going beyond just a review of their API, I use APITools as a proxy, and make all my API calls via this proxy, and after I hit all the endpoints, I can grab the auto-generated Swagger definition from the APITools interface.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - There is already a Swagger definition available for an API, created by the platform owner&mdash;this is when I&rsquo;m in heaven. I love it when APIs create their own API definition, and even better when they create their own <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> file. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to also add to the list, that I use API Blueprint, RAML, I/O Docs, and Apigee Explorer formats as well, but I do not. While these formats are out there, it is an understatement to say they are tucked away, and hidden. I&rsquo;d venture to say the providers are actively assisting API providers in keeping buried, and hard to access&mdash;in my opinion each format should be front and center, accessible with a single click.
<p>This is one of the reasons I use <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>. If you look at Swagger UI docs, for each endpoint there is a RAW link which takes you directly to the machine readable API definition that drives it. Show me the equivalent on API Blueprint, RAML, Mashery, and Apigee API explorers, and interactive documentation and I&rsquo;ll eat my words. I'm creating my own API stack for converting between all of these formats, but alas this doesn't help me in my API discovery process, because these formats aren't easy to find.
<p>This disconnect, is one of the reasons there is so much fragmentation in API designs, and ultimately a lack of open tooling and services that support the entire API life-cycle&mdash;nobody wants to share their design patterns. Please help me document all the APIs in <a href="http://theapistack.com">my API Stack</a>, and if you know of an existing Swagger spec I don&rsquo;t have, send my way, or <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publish to the Github repo</a>. Also, if you are actively using an API, can you switch to using an <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools proxy and generate a Swagger spec</a> that way, and also send my way, or <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publish to the Github repo</a>.
<p>I wish I could convince all y'all of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/">importance of this layer of the API space being not just machine readable, but also accessible</a>. This is one reason why I&rsquo;m hand rolling all of these API definitions myself, is because I&rsquo;m just going to show you.

<p><a href="http://www.windley.com/">A blog post that caught my attention recently was </a><a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2014/12/fuse_kynetx_and_carvoyant.shtml">Fuse, Kynetx, and Carvoyant</a>, by Phil Windley (<a href="https://twitter.com/windley">@windley</a>). Phil is pushing the boundaries of connecting devices to the Internet, and is very vocal about his thoughts on the subject&mdash;something I support 100%. If you want a taste of what Phil is thinking, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZtz93hdc7I">his keynote from APIStrat Chicago 2014</a>.
<p>His blog post is a worthy read, but what really caught my attention was in the last paragraph&mdash;the simple statement that he is:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;using Fuse as a means to explore how a larger, more owner-controlled Internet of Things experience could be support</em>ed&rdquo;
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by this concept, and feel it reflects my mission with API Evangelist, where I&rsquo;m looking to create not just a more educated and informed API providers and consumers, but also a more knowledgable, and empowered end-user.
<p>The concept of a owner-controlled Internet of Things experience is something I will be keeping an eye on as I continue to be inundated with Internet of Things API stories. My goal is to better understand how IoT devices are being designed, and deployed, then provide some assistance in how we can ensure platforms lean towards a more &ldquo;owner-controlled experience&rdquo;.

        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/13esk6Q"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>As I am designing my APIs, one of the first things I decide is whether or not I will be making this public. If its a simple enough resource, and doesn't put too much load on my servers, I will usually make it publicly available. However if an API has write capabilities, could potentially put a heavy load on my servers, or just posses some private resource that I want to keep private, I will secure the API.
<p>I use <a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale for my API management infrastructure</a>--I have since 2011, long before I ever started working with them on projects, and organizing <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a>. When it comes time to secure any of my APIs, I have a default snippet of code that I wrap each API, validating the application keys, and recording their activity--which 3Scale calls the plugin integration approach.
<p>This time around, I logged into my 3Scale admin area, went to my API integration area, and saw the setup for the 3Scale Cloud API proxy that they are calling <a href="https://www.3scale.net/apicast/">APICast</a>. I can't help but notice the simple setup of the proxy--I give it a private base URL for my API, it gives me a public base URL back, and then I can configure the proxy rules, setting the rate limits for each of my API resources.
<p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/3scale-apicast.png" alt="" width="100%" />
<p>&nbsp;
<p>That is it. I can set up my APIs in a sandbox environment, then take it live when I am ready. It is the quickest way to secure my APIs I've seen, allowing me to instantly lock down my APIs, and require anyone who uses it to register for a key, and then I am able to track on how it is being put to use&mdash;no server configuration or setup needed.
<p>This easy setup, bundled with the fact you can setup 3Scale for free, and get up to 50K a day in API calls, makes it the perfect environment for figuring out your API surface area. Then when ready, you can pay for heavier volume, and take advantage of the other advanced features available via 3Scale. I'm still using the plugin feature for 90% of my endpoints, but some I will be using APICast to quickly stand-up, secure, and monitor some of my APIs. I will publish a how-to after I finish setting this one up.
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner.</em>

<p>When you use a well designed, and I hate saying it, but a RESTful API, you know it. I&rsquo;m not a <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/whatisarestafarian/">restafarian</a>, who is super strict about API design, but I do know an easy-to-use, intuitive interface when I hack on one. Having API resources defined as intuitive URIs, with a handful of sensible header or query parameters, that allows me to excercise my HTTP Verbs, just makes me happy.
<p>I do not expect all API providers to be API design experts, but one design pattern that always frustrates me is when you  pack all of your API resources into a single parameter. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr calls it &ldquo;method&rdquo;</a>, and <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/media/references/reference.html#Video_Read">Brightcove calls it &ldquo;command&rdquo;</a>, and while both of these media API providers then offer a rich number of &ldquo;methods&rdquo; or &ldquo;commands&rdquo;, I just can&rsquo;t help feel this single design decision always detours API integrationa &nbsp;down bumpier, darker side street or alley.
<p>Ultimately I can still get what I need done with APIs who choose to craft their resources in this way, but it takes more work, and requires me to create a special bucket of APIs, that don&rsquo;t quite fit in with the rest of the APIs I&rsquo;m profiling, and integrating with. I&rsquo;m often tempted, with the high profile APIs like Flickr and Brightcove, to craft a new API, and stand it up as a facade that you can use as a proxy, instead of directly connecting to Flickr and Brightcove APIs, but alas not enough time in the day.
<p>You will almost never catch me giving API design advice on API Evangelist, but in this scenario, I have urge you not to follow the design patterns of Flickr and Brightcove when planning your APIs.

<p>The properties of each API that is listed in an<a href="http://apisjson.org/"> APIs.json file</a> can be called anything, as long as you preface it with X-, and the URL can point to anything you wish--to me<a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/"> this is one of the most flexibile aspects of APIs.json</a>. The majority of APIs.json API properties are going to be to URLs designed for human consumption, but the ultimate goal of the project is to establish a core set of machine readable URIs that will help move the API discovery conversation forward.
<p>The first three machine readable properties for APIs listed in an APIs.json are:
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="API Blueprint" href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a></strong> - The machine readable API definition format in markdown.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a></strong>&nbsp;- The machine readable API definition format in JSON and YAML.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a></strong>&nbsp;- The machine readable API definition format in YAML.</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs.json is not looking to provide the solution for the same thing that sensibly designed hypermedia APIs would bring to the table, and only interested in bridging the indexing of the API resources that are currently available. In this context, think of APIs.json as a switchboard, allowing us to navigate each of the popular API definition formats available to use in 2015.
<p>The fourth machine readable property for APIs listed in an APIs.json is:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> - </strong>A machine readable format for associating licensing fo ran API interface (aka CC, Apache).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></a>
<p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org/format/apisjson_0.14.txt">APIs.json version .014</a>, we now have a glimpse of the surface area of APIs present within each APIs.json file, via the API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML properties, and a basic awarness of the licensing of this surface area using the API Commons property.
<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure what is next for APIs.json property types, but if I had my vote (which I probably do ;-), I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing machine readable references to:
<ul>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Monetization</span> Value - </strong>Units of measurement, allowing me to understand the value delivered by an API. I do not think monetization is an apt title for this area, as money is such a limiting constraint, and value is a more expansive headspace to approach this aspect of API integration.</li>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Terms of Service</span> Questions - </strong>I feel that questions about the terms of service from API providers gets a lot of airplay, but this conversation is much like the TOS themselves, and are heavily weighted in discussion through a provider lens, drowning in legaleze. I&rsquo;m confident that this area needs distillation from its current legaleze format, and be framed as simple questions that span TOS, Privacy Policies, SLA, Copyright, Deprecation, Branding, and other legal layers to API operations.</li>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Clients</span> Connectivity - </strong>Give me a machine readable list of connecitivty options that are available for an API. I want to know what languages area available, as well as links to licensing, code repositories, and Zapier integrations. This is a layer of the conversation that would be better served through a hypermedia conversation, but since we have the world we have, this is a layer of the APIs.json conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, APIs.json takes the <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> conversation beyond just the meta, which, don&rsquo;t get me wrong is super valuable, with titles, description, tags, and other characteristics of APIs are critical to discovery, but I want to also be able to go deeper than just a simple keyword search. I want to be able to dig in on the areas above, but in a machine readable, bottom up, organic way.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
<p>I want to be able to ask for:
<ul>
<li>All image APIs, that have a per MB storage, and bandwidth API Value model vs. free or advertising based approaches. I also want to make sure they allow me to set the licensing for my photos, delete my account when done, and have a PHP client, or even better a WordPress plugin.</li>
<li>All video APIs, that have a revenue share model for their own advertising network, as a API Value model. Same as my images I want to make sure they let me set the licensing for videos, and retain ownership over my model. In this case I don&rsquo;t care about specific language clients for integrations, I want to see connectivity for Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, and other distribution channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of conversation I have had around APIs.json with technologists almost always begins with a very technical API discovery discussion, something that quickly expands to the wider vision opened up by APIs.json around value generated by APIs, limitations imposed by the legal layer of platform operations, and into how we actually connect with valuable API resources. There are many more influences that prevent me from connecting to APIs, than just the technical aspects of integration&mdash;pricing, TOS, privacy, rate limits, and other business and political limitations often trump the tech when I select API platforms.
<p>I&rsquo;m still working through exactly how to best articulate Steve and mine&rsquo;s vision for APIs.json. I appreciate you listening to my thoughts, as I work through the details, and I would love to hear more of your thoughts around what APIs.json means to you.

Seems like a more one-to-one version of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, where you can get the answers you are looking for when it comes to development on the Google platform, but in a more direct, one-to-one way.
<p>Inversely, you can contribute your developer skills, and be one of the knowledgeable developers who are giving back to the developer community. The Google Helpouts page describes it as: <em>Give Back - Continue Learning - Build Your Reputation</em>. I signed up for an account, gave my profile, but the tags that I was able to connect with my profile really didn&rsquo;t match my skills. It seems very programming language, and platform focused at this point--not really for APIs.
<p><a href="https://helpouts.google.com/partner/landing/provider/googledevelopers"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/google-helpouts2.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p>At first glance I thought Google Helpouts was more about Google APIs, available as an exentsion of the Google Developer program, but it seems to be a more tech focused, skills matching service. I think the same concept would work well, if applied to APIs, but I don&rsquo;t see any reason for a new platform, just build it on top of <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/docs">Stack Overflow API</a>&mdash;why re-invent the wheel?

        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://dp.la/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/digital-public-library-of-america/DPLA_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>If I had to pick one API that I worship the ground they walk on, and yet for some insane reason I don&rsquo;t write about very often&mdash;it would be the <a href="http://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America</a>. I can go on for days about how important the work that DPLA does. If you aren&rsquo;t up to speed on DPLA, "The Digital Public Library of America brings together the riches of America&rsquo;s libraries, archives, and museums, and makes them freely available to the world&rdquo;&mdash;via APIs! ;-)
<p>I&rsquo;m a history lover, so DPLA is extremely interesting, but what they do is so much more important to society at-large, an area that very few APIs can achieve. I am making an extra effort to publish more DPLA stories on API Evangelist, not just because they need it, but also because their approach to APIs is extremely forward thinking and relevant.
<p>First DPLA story out of my writers notebook is about their use of <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>. First off, what is JSON-LD?
<blockquote><em><a href="http://json-ld.org/"> JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale.</a></em></blockquote>
<p>So why does DPLA uses JSON-LD? I like their explanation on the <a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/technologies/">DPLA technologies page</a>:
<blockquote><em><a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/technologies/"> Everyone likes JSON, but it&rsquo;s not great for every purpose.  Pointing from one JSON object to another is a good example (because we do that a lot).  So we use JSON-LD. No worries &ndash; it&rsquo;s still JSON.  It&rsquo;s just got a couple of standardized fields. </a></em></blockquote>
<p>When you are weaving together artifacts from &ldquo;america&rsquo;s libraries, archives, and museums&rdquo;, then providing access as linked data and via APIs, you need to get pretty organized about how you keep track of, and connect your objects. I think it is a testament to the DPLA vision, that they are using JSON-LD, a very structured, and forward leaning vision of how we connect, not just digital objects, but also digital representations of the very physical objects in our world.
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make sure I spend time each month, to at least looking through the <a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/">DPLA API ecosystem</a>, keeping an eye on what they are up to with their API platform, but I intend to also look through the collections and brainstorm on what is possible via the API&mdash;I encourage you to as well.

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-danger.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I have read several stories about security breaches in the past couple days, ranging from <a href="http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/tip/API-security-more-critical-as-componentization-grows">exploitation of APIs across the distributed systems we are increasingly depending on</a>, to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">no security at MoonPig for their mobile app</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/05/reverse-engineering-of-the-kayak-api-from-the-mobile-app/">the reverse engineering of a popular mobile app&mdash;this time it is the Kayak mobile app</a>.
<p>Maybe I am biased, but I can&rsquo;t help but think, in a world increasingly driven by mobile devices, we need to treat all applications like they are external, get to work seting up a proper API program, and secure all apps the same way, no matter whether they are used for internal, partner, or public usage. Treating internal apps differently, opens things up for a whole world of hurt when internal systems are compromised, and ignoring how public facing your API is, when embedded in a popular mobile  app, goes into the same category.
<p>If you have a single API stack, that ALL of your systems integrations, web, mobile, and device based-apps use, you have established a single surface area youneed to secure. Then, if you are using modern API infrastructure, a surface area that you can monitor, and have established relevant service composition, tailored for internal, partner, and public access of resources, you will be able to stay in tune with your API usage, and identify negatives situations much faster--across all devices.
<p>If you are operating your business on the Internet today (i hope you are), consider treating all your apps as external, no matter where they reside, or who uses them&mdash;your overall architecture will be much healthier, and resilient because off because of it.

<p>I was working in&nbsp;<a href="http://restlet.com/technical-resources/apispark/guide">APISpark</a>, playing around with different approaches to creating APIs for data stores i have in Amazon S3, Github, and in Google Spreadsheets. The cloud API deployment solution allows me to generate APIs from CSV, XML, JSON and spreadsheet stores in these locations, to a central API platform faster than I could even consider doing manually.
<p>As I&rsquo;m managing a simple data API I have, I see the option to generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; in the toolbar, something that is also available to me when working in the <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet Studio</a>. This is one of the benefits of creating machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API blueprint</a> of your APIs. Restlet doesn&rsquo;t generate server code for you from your file stores, it generates a machine readable definition of your file source, then lets you generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; from that.
<p>Server skeletons are not a fully functioning API for your file store, APISpark gives you that. These server skeletons are just scaffolding in Java or Node.js, that give you a starting framework for deploying an API beyond the Restlet / APISpark platform. You still have to wire things up to the file store, database, or other location of the data store&mdash;it is just the beginning.
<p>I guess my goals with this post is to educate people that it is possible to generate server skeletons from APISpark, using common data sources, but I also just like the name. I have used the term server-side scaffolding, but I like server skeletons better. I think I will keep using it to describe what you can generate server side when you employ API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="/admin/blog/API blueprint">API Blueprint</a>.

<p>I was taking another look at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/dev/api">Reddit API</a>&nbsp;over the weekend, and thought their listing of API endpoints was pretty interesting. They provide two ways of looking at the platform APIs:
<ul>
<li><strong>API Section</strong> - Listing of Reddit APIs by account, apps, links, listings, and other groupings.</li>
<li><strong>oAuth Scope -</strong> Listing of Reddit APIs by the endpoints oAuth scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure if it is something all APIs should follow, I just thought it was an interesting approach, something I haven&rsquo;t seen in any other API area. Reddit has a number of APIs, I can see if you have specific goals with the API, this might be useful to have API sorted in this way.

<p>In 2015, I will enter the 5th year of API Evangelist. To quote one of my favorite bands--&ldquo;What a Long Strange Trip Its Been&rdquo;.  I couldn&rsquo;t be more thankful for the career choice I made in 2010, and extremely grateful for the partners, and loyal readers I&rsquo;ve established along the way.
<p>This list is very long, but I have to <a href="https://3scale.net">specifically call out 3Scale</a>, and their support of what I do, without them API Evangelist wouldn&rsquo;t be happening, I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing my research, and open projects like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> wouldn&rsquo;t exist&mdash;additionally we wouldn&rsquo;t be having the <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a> conversation that 3Scale makes happen.
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big year end wrap-up or predictor type of guy, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean I do not spend a lot of time reflecting this time of year. I honestly don&rsquo;t feel like anything has changed for me, I&rsquo;m just as dedicated to my API Evangelist in 2015 as I ever have, and here is what I&rsquo;m focusing on:
<ul>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong> - Telling stories on my blogs about what the smartest people in the space are doing with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong> - Researching how APIs are impacting a variety of industries, government, and even our personal world.</li>
<li><strong>Universities</strong> - I am convinced that the next generation workforce needs to be digitally literate to be successful. </li>
<li><strong>APIStrat &amp; API Days</strong> - Helping facilitate the important tech, business, and political conversations that happen at <a href="http://apistrat.com/">APIStrat</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.apidays.io/">API Days</a>.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json</strong> - Encourage the use of APIs.json to assist in API discovery, and enable the assembling of the next generation API stacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there is a lot more going on, this is my primary focus, and what you will find me doing most of the time in 2015. I will be seriously cutting back my travel, to focus on my research and storytelling. You can find me at APIStrat and API Days events, and at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag</a> and <a href="http://www.gluecon.com/">Gluecon</a>, but beyond that I feel the biggest impact I make is keeping up with the space, telling stories, and publishing research that folks can use.
<p>When it comes to predictions, I&rsquo;m in alignment with 3Scale (once again). I think <a href="https://www.3scale.net/2015/01/api-predictions-2015/">their list of 2015 API predictions</a> is very pragmatic, and provides a healthy view of what 2015 will look, where the most important thing that happens this year, is the steady, healthy growth of the API sector.

<p>I saw a story of yet another security breach related to how mobile phones are using APIs today.&nbsp;<a href="http://ifc0nfig.com/moonpig-vulnerability/">This one is from Paul Price, on his blog </a><a href="http://ifc0nfig.com/">ifc0nfig.com</a>, about the <a href="https://moonpig.com/uk/">greeting card site MoonPig</a>.
<p>Paul highlights the not just lack of, but actual absence of security when making API calls to MoonPig, allowing you to impersonate any user, place orders, add/retrieve card information, and any other API driven feature of the mobile application.
<p>MoonPig is looking into it of course:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>We are aware of claims re customer data and can confirm that all password and payment information is and has always been safe.
&mdash; Moonpig (@MoonpigUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoonpigUK/status/552419988834111489">January 6, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>When those of us in the API industry talk about public APIs, many folks think we are talking about APIs like Twitter that have publicly available information, or public APIs that allow for anyone to sign up for the service, when in reality, most of the time we are talking about APIs that use the public Internet for transport.
<p>MoonPig&rsquo;s awareness regarding their API surface area, and complete lack of security is something we are going to see play out, in numerous very public, high profile security breaches in the coming years. There are hundreds if not thousands of companies out there right now who have the same setup, and rely on security through obscurity (nobody has discovered it yet).
<p>I personally <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">recommend treating all APIs used in mobile devices like they are public APIs</a>, with a well defined, very public API definition, bundled with a very public security layer, like oAuth. You can still control who has access to signup and use the API, but one beneficial side effect is you can also treat all internal apps like their are just another user on the API.
<p>This is the benefit of public API. Not the myths you often hear about becoming the next Twilio, but the reality that being public will force you to have a very much more well designed, and secure API, that you acknowledge operates on the open Internet. With this mindset you aren&rsquo;t operating in the shadows, you will begin treat your APIs traffic like is available on the open Internet&mdash;which, well, IT IS!!!
<p>Back to the MoonPig story, look at the <a href="http://ifc0nfig.com/moonpig-vulnerability/">timeline of disclosure at the bottom of Paul's post</a>--he has given them 17 months since he first reported, and they still haven't fixed. OUCH!!

<p>Your company's secret sauce doesn't involve keeping your APIs closed and proprietary&mdash;it is about making them as open and accessible as possible, to the point where even your competition can&rsquo;t help but uses them.
<p>I&rsquo;m am always amazed at the amount of effort some companies put into hiding their API interface away, making me register before I can see anything, and dig through the SDK to even understand an APIs surface area.
<p>If you have a public API, or a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">publicly available mobile app, you have a public API</a>&mdash;put it out there. Be loud and proud of your API designs (if you aren&rsquo;t, then we should have another discussion), make them front and center, within two clicks of your developer landing page.
<p>If you are worried about someone copying your interface, and re-using it in their own API designs, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you are in the wrong business</span>. In the API space, this is good. Think AWS EC2 and S3. Everyone under the sun has copied their interface, even their competition, and what has happened? Oh, they are the dominant player in an entirely new way of doing business--using APIs.
<p>If you think your API surface area, aka the naming, description, and order of your API endpoints, parameters, and data models, is your secret sauce, you are wrong. It is how you deliver within that framework, and the services, support, and other building blocks you provide in support of the interface.
<p>Please stop hiding your APIs, put them out there where everyone can find them.

        <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>As I travel around talking to folks about APIs, I spend as much time as I can, educating folks about <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. In the course of my evangelism, I&rsquo;m constantly reminded how little people, who have even heard, and read about APIs.json, really understand about what it actually is. With this in mind, I will be regularly publishing examples of what APis.json is, to help on-board everyone to Steve (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@ngynx</a>), and mine vision for <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.
<p>APIs.json is an open format, in partnership between <a href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, to help API providers make their APIs more discoverable, assist API brokers in aggregating multiple APIs deemed valuable within specific industries, and ultimately empowering API consumers in finding exactly the APIs they need to be successful. Our mission is to make the process of API discovery as portable as we can, enabling it to live on any website, and be found in open search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>.
<p>APIs.json is a machine-readable description of your company, and its associated API resources. For each API listed, you give it a name, description, and supporting properties, which may be as simple as providing a link to your documentation, or be as complex as providing a link to a machine readable API definition in the Swagger or API Blueprint format. One APIs.json detail, that I feel many technologists overlook, is that this isn&rsquo;t just discovery in a hypermedia context, this could only be about the discovery of your pricing or maybe just the terms of service page (I know, a hypermedia format can descibe this, but I think you are missing an intermediary step to get the space there!)
<p>If you need an example of APIs.json file, a good place to start is the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json for APIEvangelist.com</a>, this provides a good default example of APIs.json working within a single domain. If you want to better understand how an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a> may use to build API collections, take a look at the <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json for my utility stack</a>, which is a collection of APIs from various locations, brought together to serve a specific purpose. Beyond that, take a look at the <a href="http://theapistack.com">700+ APIs.json files I&rsquo;ve created for top APIs as part of my API Stack</a>&mdash;hopefully this will help you see it in action across hundreds of API resource.
<p>Our goal is to encourage <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EVERY</strong></span> API provider to publish an APIs.json in the root of their public domain(s), but it can also be used in the same way for private APIs, so don't get hung up on the public aspect of all of this. Beyond these early implementations, I want people to also build <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/11/exposing-dictionaries-from-my-api-collections/">API collections</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">virtual stacks of the APIs</a> for use in their own projects, beginning the process of building some valuable definitions of th emost used APIs in use today. Please join this evolution API discovery, and publish your own <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json file</a>&mdash;I appreciate the help.

<p>I am beginning to track on reverse engineering API story that I come across, so if you find any, feel free to share my way. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with this growing trend, I&rsquo;m talking about the reverse engineering of APIs from popular mobile apps, specifically in situation where the company doesn&rsquo;t have a public API or developer presence.
<p>APIs are driving the mobile applications tht we are increasingly depending on, but for some reason in 2015 not all companies expose, or share information about this API surface area with the public. The latest story I came across in this trend is <a href="http://www.shubhro.com/2014/12/18/reverse-engineering-kayak-mitmproxy/">the reverse engineering of the Kayak API using mitproxy</a>.
<p>Once upon a time, <a href="https://www.kayak.com/labs/api/search/">there was a public Kayak API,</a> but somewhere along the way it went away. There tends to be a lot of misconceptions around how to conduct a public API presence, and when coupled with the ignorance around the tech, business, and politics of APIs, you see a lot of failed public API attempts--that quietly go away.
<p>I&rsquo;m continuing to track on this because I think this is a security, and privacy conversation that will continue to unfold in the public sphere, whether we want it to or not. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">If your APIs are driving a publicly available mobile app, you have public APIs</a>. Period. You might as well treat these APIs like they are public. I&rsquo;m not saying you have to be the next Twitter--I&rsquo;m saying your company needs to get educated on modern technological, business, and legal approaches to making resources available over the open Internet.
<p>You do not have to open up your APIs to the general public, but your API surface area is public, and you should be transparent about how you operate them, how you onboard partners, how data flows publicly via your API pipes, and how you manage the security and privacy of your network. This is a theme you will hear more from me, alongside every reverse engineer story, security and break of a popular mobile app, until more companies possess a public API developer area that properly addresses the tech, business, and politics of their public digital footprint.

<p>I am spending a lot of time lately reviewing Internet of Things (IoT) providers, as I work on a white paper for Gigaom. There are some very interesting approaches to APIs out there in IoT-land, and I&rsquo;m starting to get a feel for some of the patterns, trends, and habits of how IoT providers are approaching their developer efforts.
<p>One pattern I see a lot, and can only assume it comes out of the hardware side of engineering, is a focus on programming language when you talk about your API--something I recommend shifting away from. In the world of web APIs, the focus on the interface, and what it does, and actual programming languages are abstracted away, and provided merely as samples, libraries, and SDKs.
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that in the mind of developers who are building APIs for devices, they are approaching APIs from their legacy SDK point of view, and there really isn&rsquo;t any decoupling of thought based upon web APIs. For these engineers, I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, the importance of separating your interface, from your SDKs, and when you craft language about your API, you generalize the API speak, and keep language specific elements strictly in the support areas for those specific SDKs.
<p>You never know, it might be that one Go developer who builds the perfect connector for your device, or some scientist wielding Python, who integrates a sensor into their work, and then things go viral. The chances that this will happen is less likely if you are just talking about the one or two programming languages that you (the platform) are familiar with.

        <span class="post-date">30 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-speed-limit-blank.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>After giving some recent attention to the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter API ecosystem</a>, a place where I always learn a lot, I&rsquo;m shifting up my API rate limit building block, in my list of <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management resources</a>. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with my concept of &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo;, in 2010 I started looking at the top APIs, and tracking on the common &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; these providers are using to successfully operate their API platform. As I go into 2015, I&rsquo;m still refining, and adding to this list, in hopes of establishing a <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common list of building blocks, that any API provider can consider as they are designing, and operating their own platforms</a>.
<p>Until now, I had a single building block, underneath a category I titled &ldquo;service levels&rdquo;, which I called the rate limit page. My intent with this building block is to help API providers understand the importance of sharing details on how they rate limit API access, and publish it to a single page for developers to use when on-boarding, and throughout their API integration life-cycle. After seeing how Twitter handles their rate limit, which includes this overview page on rate limiting, I&rsquo;m now adding two new building blocks, and putting all of them under new category titled &ldquo;Rate Limiting&rdquo;.
<p>I now have three rate limiting related API building blocks I recommend API providers consider when designing their platform:
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="125" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-speed-limit.jpeg" alt="" width="70" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Rate Limits Page</strong>&nbsp;- Developers need to understand what the limitations of API usage are upfront. Rate limiting an throttling of API access has become commonplace to manage security, and resource load. This building block is about providing a single page explaining how this process works, setting expectations with API consumers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="125" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-documentation-inline-rate-limits.png" alt="" width="100" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Rate Limit Information Inline In Docs</strong>&nbsp;- In addition to a rate limits page, explaining information about limitations on API usage, some API providers like Twitter are including rate limits within API documentation. With this approach, each API endpoint has its related rate limits published alongside other details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="125" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-rate-limit-api.png" alt="" width="100" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Account Rate Limit API</strong>&nbsp;- As API usage grows the need to be able to programmatically manage your account is increasing. Some API platforms also provide APIs for the management of platform operations. It makes sense that API providers should also offer an API for getting rate limit details for their respect account and apps.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As with all of my building block recommendations, it is up to you the API provider, to decide what you want to offer, but I recommend considering all three of these rate limit building blocks essential. Providing details on API rate limiting is critical in building trust with new, and existing API consumers, and as the API space continues to grow, the need for automated account management tools, like an API for rate limiting is only going to increase. If you adopt these practices of leading providers now, you have the competitive advantage over other APIs.
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">I don&rsquo;t always agree with Twitter&rsquo;s approach to managing their API</a>, but their ecosystem is always a great place to learn. I personally consider Twitter on of the most important APIs out there, and feel that API providers can learn a lot from the way Twitter approaches their operations. Rate limits are one of the most politically polarizing areas of API operations, and an area that can turn bad real fast, without the proper communication. Something that I think Twitter has worked very hard on addressing, and you can see it in their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting">rate limit page</a>, the rate limit information available <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/application/rate_limit_status">within the documentation for each endpoint, and via an API rate limit API</a>&mdash;deep. ;-)
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>As I'm linking up this story, I see Twitter also has a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limits">Rate Limit Chart</a> page. Maybe a fourth building block, or just go on the rate limit main page?</em>

<p>When you first land on any <a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/">API developer landing page</a>, the impression you get, can be one of the most important aspects of on-boarding with an API that I know of. More time than not, I'm pretty confused when I land on the landing page of APIs, being forced to look for what I need to get up and running with API what an API does, and how I will have to integrate with it.
<p>Anytime I come across an API landing page, where I'm immediately given the best possible first impression I can image, I have to showcase. This just happened while taking another look at the Etsy API, which I found refreshingly simple--yet complete.
<p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/etsy-first-impressions.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a>
<p>Everything on the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/">Etsy API developer landing page</a> has a purpose in assisting me during on-boarding with the Etsy API. To better understand this in action, let's look at the handful of essential API management building blocks available on the Etsy home page.
<p>When I land at etsy.com/developers/, immediately I&rsquo;m given a Flexible Messaging Area (FMA), telling me what is possible! It is not just one simple message, as I advocate for constantly, it is a slideshow of multiple, simple messages. #winning
<p><strong>What Does The API Do?</strong><br /> Beyond understand what the Etsy API does in 250 characters or less, I get a prominent link to the API documentation, discussion around the API, and the terms of use for the API&mdash;-BOOM, everything I need. Way to give me exactly what I need so far to get up and running, while also getting out of the way.
<p><strong>How Do I On-Board With An API?</strong><br /> Next, there is a pretty clear blue highlighted box, that helps me understand the connection between my Etsy seller account, and registering as a developer. I&rsquo;m given what I need to register as a developer, and also configure my Etsy shop for proper integration.
<p><strong>Do I Actually Need To Integrate Myself?</strong><br /> After than, I&rsquo;m asked if I am look for Etsy App? Maybe that is all I need. I don&rsquo;t actually need to integrate with Etsy myself, I&rsquo;m look to see if the integration I need has already been done. I just need an application to meet my needs&mdash;nice use of an application showcase Etsy.
<p><strong>Work At Etsy - See current openings!</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ll let you in on a little secret. API ecosystem are often used for talent acquisition. shhhhhh!!! So, Etsy having a section on the home page about working at Etsy, just makes sense. If you are finding yourself in the Etsy Developer area, you are probably a little more curious than the average visitor, and quite possibly someone that Etsy might consider hiring.
<p><strong>Storytelling: Code As Craft</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m a loyal fan of Etsy&rsquo;s Code As Craft blog, so I&rsquo;m not going to knock the fact that their home page blog widget isn&rsquo;t performing as expected. I&rsquo;m guessing normally I would see the last 3 posts from the blog, which in my opinion is essential operations for ANY API landing page. I&rsquo;m sure the Etsy one will be up and running as normal shortly. ;-)
<p><strong>Everything I Need To Keep Me Connected To The Entire Etsy Platform</strong><br /> Providing a complete picture of platform operations is essential for any online service provider. When I&rsquo;m on your main website, I shouldn&rsquo;t have to work to hard to find your API or developer area, and vice versa, I do not want to have to work to get back to the main website, and other sections of a site. Etsy provides what I need to search and browse Etsy, and register or sign into my primary account&mdash;directly from the API developer area.
<p>What started as a pretty straightforward review of an API--routine going back through my list of APis I monitor--ended up being surprisingly good first impression of an API, I've been to several times before.&nbsp;

<p>I&rsquo;m always working to help API providers understand the importance of designing their API developer portals, with a larger audience in mind. Not everyone who visits your portal, will be the one integrating with your API, and providing information for non-developers about the value delivered via API resources, can go a long ways to reach the media, and decision makers at companies who will be potentially be making decision around integrating with a service.
<p>I look at a lot of API portals, and always enjoy the ones that speak to the widest possible audience. I also enjoy when there are entire sections dedicated to providing tools and resources for non-developers. One example of this, that I found recently is available over at the<a href="https://www.rev.com/api"> transcription and translation platform from Rev</a>, on the <a href="https://www.rev.com/api/zapier">page they have dedicated to Zapier</a>. I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/24/showcasing-your-api-integrations-with-other-platforms/">written before about companies referencing their IFTTT and Zapier integration</a>, but I think Rev&rsquo;s approach needs highlight because they provide a full page, with actual links to specific types of integrations.
<p>Rev provides some valuable &nbsp;information on what Zapier is, what you can do with Rev and Zapier, and actually walks you through how to actually setup this up, on a page that is given the same prominence as the API documentation (important!).
<p><a href="https://www.rev.com/api/zapier"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/rev/rev-zapier.png" alt="" width="550" align="middle" /></a>
<p>Rev provides you with direct links to put Rev to work, by transcribing from YouTube and Vimeo, and workflows for putting these transcripts on Dropbox, Google Drive or Box.  You can click on links that take you to the detail page on Zapier, where you can get up and running with the recipe. I <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">added Zapier as a building block a while back</a>, but I really feel that it is quickly becoming an essential building block, something all providers should be considering in 2015.
<p>I think it is really important to provide ready-to-go reciprocity tools for any API platform. I also think it is important to show them alongside API documentation and the other tools meant specifically for developers. This is the power of web API over historic API approaches, in that APIs aren&rsquo;t just for developers. Web APIs exist to provide quick and dirty solutions to problems that anyone faces in their business or personal worlds, and I think Rev&rsquo;s use of Zapier represents this very well.

<p>I had someone ask me, if out of the 3<a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">0 API reciprocity providers I track on</a>, if I knew if one of them offered white or private label services. I couldn&rsquo;t confidently say whether or not any of them did, and as I do with my other questions, the best way to find out, is to put it out into the universe, and see whether or not one of the providers will let me know, or one of them will do it.
<p>It would make sense for companies like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> to offer a solution that would allow for any company to resell their services, and offer specialty versions of their API reciprocity, interoperability, and automation services. As more companies are operating online, spread across various cloud environments, the need for ETL in the cloud, or like I prefer to call them, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity services</a>, is only going to increase.
<p>Not all companies will want to use a Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, and would prefer operating on-premise, and like to offer the services to their partners, or possibly their customers--opening up the need to brand it themselves. If you know one of the API reciprocity providers that offer anything like this, or plan on doing it, let me know. I have some people who have been asking for it, and would be happy to tell more stories about it.

<p>I'm reviewing the business models of many of the top API platforms over the last couple of weeks, and I&rsquo;m seeing some pretty interesting approaches to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">API monetization</a>. As I look through each API, I see that some platforms don&rsquo;t have their API monetization strategy together at all, while others are following the pretty proven &ldquo;cloud utility&rdquo; model handed down from providers like AWS, and then I see some who are continuing to standardize how we pay for, and monetize APIs--which makes me happy.
<p>One <a href="http://www.convertapi.com/prices">interesting pricing page I reviewed over the holidays</a>, was from the <a href="http://www.convertapi.com">file conversion API, ConvertAPI</a>. They have a credit based API monetization approach, allowing you to buy a certain amount of credits on a monthly basis, or make one-time basis. Each area offers four tiers, allowing for the purchase of credits at a various rates. One thing I found curious though, is that your credits purchased monthly do not roll over, where your one time purchases do&mdash;I will have to think about the pros / cons of this more, before I comment.
<p>The ConvertAPI also has a "<a href="http://www.convertapi.com/prices#CreditsCostTable">credits cost table</a>", providing an overview of how credits actually translate into actual API calls. Many file conversion APIs use a one-to-one rate for making API calls, while others cost 2, 3, or even 5 credits per each API call. I like this approach to defining API costs, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">when your API developer account includes a API for monitoring</a> account levels, it <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/02/a-market-for-api-developer-credits/">starts getting us closer to the API pricing standardization</a>, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">automation we will need to continue the growth of the API economy</a>.
<p>I&rsquo;m finding a lot of individual API monetization stories as I go through this latest round of research. I&rsquo;m thinking I will have to spend a couple of weeks in February or March of 2015, step back and look at the monetization strategies of the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies I&rsquo;m tracking on</a>, and hopefully provide some better analysis of where we stand with this vital layer of the API industry. Along with the work I&rsquo;m doing to encourage companies to create machine readable API definitions for their APIs, accompanied with machine readable licensing using <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, I want to help encourage the standardization of API pricing&mdash;then who knows, maybe someday API pricing can be machine readable, allowing us to make real-time decisions on the APIs we use based upon cost.

A small addition that could prove critical, for any API provider, especially Twitter, who has some of the most complex rate limiting of any API I know of.
<p>At first glance, something small like including rate limit information within each API endpoint documentation may seem insignificant, but think of it like bobsledding or swimming in the olympics, where the slightest adjustment can reduce friction in just the right place&mdash;giving you the competitive advantage you need. Taking a fresh look at the building block(s) Twitter uses around API rate limiting, is expanding my own thoughts on how any API provider can approach their own rate limiting, and represents why I keep an eye on API pioneers like Twitter, even if I don&rsquo;t always agree with 100% of their decisions around platform operations.
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>Did you notice the picture is of the rate limiting information, within the rate limit API endpoint? That will be another story, as part of my expansion of thought in the area of rate limiting.</em>

        <span class="post-date">21 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-open.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>APIs are a really tough concept to help folks on-board with. I have come to realize that people see APIs very differently, and most of the time, I think this can be a good thing. In a perfect world it would be nice if everyone followed the same standards, and used only the best API patterns, when designing their APIs. This isn't the world we have, and to help better engge within the world we have, I am working to tell stories of this dysfunctional but beautiful API space we have accidently created for ourselves, develop visuals that help us better quantify things, and potentially give little nudges where I can to move things in a better direction.
<p>When I hear most technologists talk about APIs, I feel many are exclusively looking through a client / server lens. Your APIs is your backend server architecture, and then your client architecture that will be used to connect APIs to websites, mobile applications, devices, and other systems. When I try to talk about API copyright, projects like <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, or educate folks about modern approaches to API design, deployment, management and integration in this client / server mindset, it can be very difficult to articulate some very important concepts. Not all developers, software architects, and business leaders are familiar with this very important, and the rapidly evolving surface area being defined by API.
<p>To help convey some of my thoughts about this very important layer of the API space, I've created some new visuals that I can use in stories, slide decks, and my research reports. First I want to elevate the discussion beyond just client / server architecture, and highlight the importance of the API definition surface area that is present in the middle.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-one.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>When you are designing, developing, managing, and integrating with APIs, you use some very specific languages for developing your server architecture. We use programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby ,Node.js and other languages to develop the server side of our API. In most scenarios, companies choose the programming language they are already using across their business, developing all server side architecture in a common language.
<p>Inversely, when it comes to client side architecture, companies should work to provide as many possible programming languages possible, providing code samples, libraries, and SDKs for all popular platforms. This is the promise of simple web APIs, is that a well designed API will abstract away any language specific details present on the server, making it accessible in any programming language. Then the good API providers encourage integration, by providing a wide variety of client tooling as they possibly can, to make integration as frictionless as possible.
<p>In the middle, for the API definition layer, modern API developers are defining their interfaces, using machine readable formats like <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. Providing a machine readable definition of an API is proving to be critical for just about every aspect of the API life-cycle.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-two.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>If you have a public API, or publicly available mobile or Internet of Things apps, you have a public API interface. This layer exists on the open Internet, and as we go into 2015, this layer for all public APIs should be well defined. Developers are using this definition to integrate with their existing systems, generating client tools, and are powering testing, monitoring, and other critical aspects of API integration.
<p>Your server architecture is critical to API operations, and while I'm not in the business of telling pople how to license server side code, I will encourage anyone to make sure and at least apply a license, and I personally believe in using as liberal of license as you possibly can. When it comes to your client architecture, I will get a little more pushy about how things should be licensed--you are asking someone to integrate your API into their business, existing applications, and the code you provide should allow for as much flexibility as possible, not imposing restrictions.
<p>This approach also applies to the API definition layer. Your API definition should be as accessible, open, and flexible as possible. You are expecting users to bake your Application Programming Interface (API) into their worlds, and this surface area is the point at which your two business meet. You can keep your server side code as a "secret sauce", but your API definition, and client architecture should be as open as possible.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-three.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>I do not think that copyright should be able to be applied to API definitions, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/02/helping-eff-urge-the-courts-to-block-copyright-claims-in-oracle-v-google-api-fight/">my work with the EFF on the Oracle vs. Google Java API copyright case</a> reflects this. With that said, we don't live in a perfect world, and embracing the one we have, I encourage applying a Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a> or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a> license to your API definitions, regardless of whether or not you use Swagger, API Blueprint, or RAML. After you do, I encourage you to <a href="http://apicommons.org/index.html">add it to the API Commons</a>.
<p>I've had conversations with people who claim that their API surface area is their secret sauce. First if it supports a public mobile app, is used on websites, or provides integration of external systems, and devices over the open Internet--it ain't a secret! Second your sauce should be in the delivery of services behind your API surface area, the actual wording, order, and other aspects of your definition should be open for anyone to use!
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-four.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>It is incredibly important that this layer of the API space is well defined, front and center in our conversations, and remains as openly accessible as possible. If you need a real world analogy to better understand the openness of this layer, <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">read my API copyright -- restaurant menu story</a>. Your menu is not your business, it will be the service behind the menu that truly defines your company.
<p>The best example of this in action, within the API space, is around the Amazon S3 and EC2 APIs. If these API definitions were not openly available, and were protected under copyright, would cloud computing have ever happened? Would we have an ecosystem of tooling like Eucalyptus, to Chrome or Firefox extensions, that has helped us deploy global infrastructure, and build applications that have come to define cloud computing.
<p>Please work with me to make sure the most important layers of the API space stay as open, and accessible as possible.

<p>I&rsquo;m profiling all the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies I monitor across the space</a>, going through each one and defining their API program, evaluating the tech, business and politics of their operations. Part of this process is creating a Swagger definition for each API. I&rsquo;m not deeply concerned with getting each API definition 100%, unless I'm directly integrating with the aPI. For this round I&rsquo;m looking at defining just the surface area of the API, including each endpoint, headers, parameters, and body format, and leaving the underlying data model for another time.
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publishing all of my API definitions to the API Stack Github repository</a>. I&rsquo;m using this as a staging area before I publish them to <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Last month <a href="https://www.3scale.net/2014/11/apis-io-hit-front-page-of-hacker-news/">I create an APIs.son for 690 APIs</a>, and I&rsquo;m looking to generate as many Swagger definitions for these high value APIs as I can over the holidays. It would be much better if API providers generated, and maintained their own API definitions, but until that happens I&rsquo;m happy doing a little extra work to get us to a critical mass.
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-two.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>Feel free to use any of my Swagger specifications, all that I ask is if you update, or add to them, please commit back to the repository so everyone can benefit. Additionally if you have any Swagger definitions for your own APIs, or other public APIs that I do not have in my listings, please share. It is extremely important that all public API endpoints are defined in a machine readable format. I don&rsquo;t care if you use Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML, just make sure your APIs have a definition, and it is shared publicly. If it is one of your designs, make sure and also add to API Commons.
<p>When I reach a critical mass of <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">API definitions in the API Stack Github repo</a>, I will publish a story on apievangelist.com announcing they are there, and do incremental pushes to APIs.io, so that these value APIs are part of its open index, allowing you to build API collections, and even your open API search engine. Its important that we all <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/">work to define this layer of the API space, and work to keep it as open, and machine readable as possible</a>.

        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/docker-swagger.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m developing a common API for all the APIs I deploy via Docker containers, meaning that each API that I design as a Docker image, will have an API to control all aspects of deployment, and its operations. I will be keeping most of the surface area available in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/#v116">current version of the Docker API</a>, but I'm thinking I will add a handful of endpoints, and maybe alter a couple of the existing Docker defined endpoints to better meet my needs.
<p>To support my work, I need a Swagger 2.0 definition for the v1.16 of the Docker API. I wish everyone would create machine readable API definitions for their APIs by default, but until that is the norm, I will be creating myself. I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at writing scrape scripts for harvesting API documentation (if they are well formed).
<p>This Swagger definition not 100% complete, but <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json">here is what I have so far of a Swagger 2.0 representation of the Docker v1.16 API</a>. Its on Github, so if you use this definition, and fix anything, or add parts and pieces i didn't, please submit back, so everyone can benefit from it. I haven't completed the data model for the endpoints, but I'm storing the JSON responses for each endpoint, and just need to set aside some time to finish.
<p>You can find the <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json">Swagger 2.0 definition for the Docker v1.16 API on The API Stac</a>k, where <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">I publish all my Swagger definitions for the APIs</a> I integrate with, and monitor as part of my research. I&rsquo;m adding definitions all the time, so check back often, and if you have any API definitions I do not, feel free to fork the repo, and submit them via pull request. I&rsquo;m not just looking for Swagger, I'd love to have any format you generate machine readable API definitions in&mdash;it is important that all of this layer of the API space, is accessible, and machine readable, so please help make it so.

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-hackathon.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I recently had a conversation with one of my contacts at a federal agency about a hackathon tour they are planning. The federal government doesn&rsquo;t call these events hackathons, they call them data jams, but for sake of this story I&rsquo;m going to call them hackathons, and also omit the name of the agency until they are ready to talk about the event(s) publicly.
<p>This agency had many questions about putting on a hackathon, but one I found particularly interesting, and something that is in line with other concepts I&rsquo;m exploring in the API space, was the desire to assemble a stack of resources that developers could put to use at the event, along with their own agency APIs. They were concerned about hackathon teams coming to the event and having to spend a great deal of time looking for APIs, open data-sets, and tools to use in their projects.
<p>Building on top of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">other stories I've told about being an API broker</a>, I will be putting some thought into how I can possibly act as an API broker for this agency and their hackathon(s). I will set up a Github repository, where I will list agency APIs, as well as bring other relevant government agencies APIs and open data sets. I won&rsquo;t stop there, I will also consider what other private sector APIs, and open tooling that would help attendees be more successful, save time and ultimately rise to the occasion.
<p>These thoughts are building on earlier ideas from Cyril Gaillard in his medium post titled "<a href="https://medium.com/@cyrilgaillard/i-dont-need-a-business-co-founder-i-need-an-api-broker-c9be536cf8fa">I don&rsquo;t need a business co-founder, I need an API broker</a>". My motivations are all about defining a new breed of evangelists who really understand the API space, and know where to find the best APIs, tools, and other resources. Then these API brokers can use Github to aggregate all relevant APIs, data sources, and tools or services into a single location, saving developers real time and money when building applications.
<p>Maybe not for these hackathons, but in other API broker scenarios I can envision the API broker also signing up for developer accounts, organizing API keys, and finding other meaningful tasks that would save time, and increase efficiencies for developers. An API Broker would be in charge of managing all resources that a development team will need to achieve their objectives, as efficiently as possible.
<p>As the number of APIs increase, I envision the concept of a single developer or API evangelist, for a single API evolving to a world where there are many API brokers, who deeply understand many APIs. Then companies, organizations, and government agencies can lean on these API brokers to help them build the best aggregate backend stack possible for projects, hackathons, and any other scenario where APIs will be put to use, potentially solving problems that these groups and individuals face on a daily basis.

<p>I have been spending a lot more time in 2014 <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">learning, discussing, and telling stories about hypermedia</a>. Early this year <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/what-is-a-hypermedia-api/">I identified that hypermedia was moving beyond just academic discussion</a>, and entering the mainstream consciousness of the API community. I do not consider myself a hypermedia expert, and had a lot more to learn, and by moving hypermedia further into my regular research, over time this education would come.
<p>At the end of 2014, my deep technical knowledge of hypermedia, and the nuances between each of the formats isn&rsquo;t there yet&mdash;I just do not have the production experience with any of them to know what I&rsquo;m doing. I can provide an overview of the technology, the various formats, and the people behind each movement, as well as point to some real world hypermedia implementations, but when it comes to getting down to the details I&rsquo;m just not there yet.
<p>One of my readers, from a leading tech company recently emailed me asking for a <em>&ldquo;hypermedia pragmatist&rdquo;</em>&mdash;here is an excerpt:
<blockquote><em> We have a lot of opinions in our organization about how we should implement hypermedia APIs.  I&rsquo;d like someone to discuss pros/cons of different approaches in our monthly API discussion group but don&rsquo;t want someone who only promotes one view (i.e., JSON-LD, HAL, etc.) or is extreme in their hypermedia views.<br /><br /> Do you know of anyone whom you would consider a hypermedia pragmatist?  Someone who understands the competing specs but is pragmatic about how to implement.</em></blockquote>
<p>This describes what I&rsquo;ve set out to be for the API space in general, being a pragmatists in the tech, business, and politics of APIs, and I guess I can "almost" call myself a hypermedia pragmatists, except I just don&rsquo;t have the implementation experience. I&rsquo;m sharing this story, because I&rsquo;m getting this question at multiple companies,&nbsp;educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and government agencies I'm in talks with.
<p>Eventually I will get there, and obtain the experience in implementing each of the <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/tools.html">leading hypermedia formats</a>, but until then I need some help. Do you consider yourself knowledgeable across the leading formats? Are you a pragmatists when it comes to understanding what is possible when it comes to API design, and the implementation? Are you nice, professional, and informative when it comes to API education, strategy, and execution?
<p>If you are a hypermedia pragmatist and open to consulting, and telling stories from your engagement, please let me know.

<p>I spend a lot of time field questions from people about <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>. This is something I expect to be doing for the next 10 years, and happy to field questions about exactly what it is all about, and help educate folks about exactly where APIs.json it fits in to the overall API landscape.
<p>A regular comment I get from technologists, and API savvy folks is <em>&ldquo;you know that hypermedia is a better solution for discovery than APIs.json?&rdquo; </em>To which I reply <em>&ldquo;yes I know, but hypermedia is a solution for the API world we want, and APIs.json is a solution for the world we have&rdquo;.</em> I would love it if everyone understood hypermedia, and designed and deployed their APIs with this knowledge in mind&mdash;something I&rsquo;ve spending a lot more time on in 2014, and will continue the push in 2015.
<p>In the mean time, I intend to continue stitching apitogether thousands of APIs available out there, using APIs.json, allowing them to be discovered via open source public search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, private internal search engines, and IDE solutions like <a href="http://www.codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>. We don&rsquo;t just need discovery solutions to find new APIs, we need ways to build collections of high value APIs, something APIs.json excels at.
<p>Another thing that APIs.json does, that I don&rsquo;t feel that hypermedia provides a solution to, is the discovery of the other technical, business, and political building blocks like the documentation, code libraries, SDKs, terms of service, and other critical elements of API operations. This an area that APIs.json was specifically defined for, allowing the discovery of these vital areas, in addition to the actual API interfaces.
<p>As I do with many of my posts, this one is crafted to be a cookie cutter response to these comments I get regularly about hypermedia vs. APIs.json, allowing me to just reply with a link to this story on my blog. Hopefully we can shift the tide of API deployments in favor of hypermedia, but the APIs we can&rsquo;t do this with, APIs.json is a healthy alternative, and I even recommend using it alongside hypermedia to provide easy access to the other critical building blocks of API operations, that technologists often overlook.

        <span class="post-date">18 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a href="/admin/blog/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-email.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
<p>Most organization I&rsquo;ve worked with, the Excel spreadsheet is the central way of storing, managing and sharing data, with email being the number one way to share these data filled documents. When I was doing data inventory at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), as part of the White House open data initiative, almost every piece of high value data I found was housed in a spreadsheet, and the data stewards who were in charge of this data, would email it to me when I asked for it.
<p>To help data stewards go from spreadsheet to API, I<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/email-xlsx-to-csv-json-xml"> wrote an Excel to JSON converter</a>, that was available via a private email address. All you had to do to convert a spreadsheet, was create a new email, attach your spreadsheet to the email, then send it to the specific address, and when it was done processing, you&rsquo;d get an email in response, with links to a CSV, XML, and JSON version of the spreadsheet&mdash;unless it was a super complex spreadsheet of course, but this wasn&rsquo;t our target.
<p>Over the last year, this concept has simmered in my brain, and I can&rsquo;t help but think how important both Excel and email are to the onboarding the data that exists across small businesses, the enterprise, organizations, and government agencies. Imagine if you could monitor all the email that flowed within an organization, and look for spreadsheets being emailed back and forth. This would tell you a lot of about how data is stored, managed, and shared across groups. This intelligence could then be used to help direct API efforts, and open data initiatives like the one I participated in within the federal government.

<p>I put this idea in my Evernote a couple months back, and tried writing about it a few times, and during a recent flight I added to it. You could go beyond just identifying data usage patterns across a company, you could also generate APIs from this activity. Anytime an email with a spreadsheet attached was intercepted, a reply could be sent giving them a path to an API that was created, education about how to use that API, including a spreadsheet connector for the API, so that the person could continue working in the tools they are most comfortable, but now the data would be centralized, rather than fragmented across inboxes.
<p>This idea could easily be executed upon using the <a href="http://context.io/">popular email API Context.io</a>, which would allow you to store an organization's email, and provide the index you&rsquo;d need to discovery the spreadsheets you can use to develop APIs, and identify how data is shared across an organization, then develop educational strategies for evolving behavior. I&rsquo;m pretty confident that part of the next wave of APIs will involve this layer of data, across businesses, organizations, and government agencies. I&rsquo;d like to see services like this emerge, to help organizations understand how they use data, and provide the vital intelligence needed to help change behavior for the better, evolving everyone towards an API centric way of getting business done.

<p>I personally depend on over 40 APIs, all of which I have to manage my developer account, apps, and API key access for. This can be a lot of work, and as I continue to add APIs to my stack, this work is only going to grow. Putting on my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a> hat, and thinking about a future, where you will need to gather and organize potentially hundreds of APIs, across multiple companies, things are going to start breaking down if we don't do something to bridge these services.
<p><strong>Standard API Developer Accounts</strong><br /> First, API onboarding will have to always include a standard API developer account, providing a common data model, and approach to managing developer accounts. Luckily many API platforms use <a href="https://www.3scale.net/">API management providers like 3Scale</a>, so this shouldn't be too much work, but I still come across plenty of APIs who do not even have basic developer account building blocks like analytics, or billing management.  I wrote about this, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/06/05/google-accounts-as-blueprint-for-all-software-as-a-service-applications/">using Google as potential blueprint for how we could possibly standardize developer accounts</a>, and I know that <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2014/12/02/using-json-web-tokens-as-api-keys/">service providers like Auth0 are working to help provide plug and play services</a> that address this as well.
<p><strong>API For Developer Accounts</strong><br /> I recently wrote about the email API Mallet, a couple of weeks back, and how they <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">have an API for their API developer accounts</a>. This allows users to manage apps, their keys, as well as stay in tune with their API usage, and able to understand when they are hitting their limits, allowing them manage their access tier, and billing information programmatically. Imagine that, an API for accessing account resources?? API providers need to follow their own lead, and make sure all accounts have API by default--all aspects of your API platform should have an API in 2014, there really is no excuse.
<p><strong>Automated Account Registration And Key Provisioning.</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m always pushing API providers to offer single sign for the creation of API developer accounts, allowing developers to sign up for API access with a single click, using their Github or Twitter accounts. This helps alleviate onboarding friction, and prevents developers from having to create yet another username and password. We have to go beyond even this approach, and begin to allow single API call, registration for API developer accounts. I want a way to just POST to example.com/auth, with my Github credentials, or other means, and have my developer account instantly setup, and my first app and keys returned. Account setup can be finished later, but this type of API account automation would speed up onboarding and the integration of applications.
<p>These are just three of the ways that I feel we need to improve on the account creation, management, automation, and interoperability, for the APIs we are increasingly depending on. Since onboarding friction has been a stumbling block for many developers, and influencing their decision of which APIs they use in the past, I predict if API providers don't continue to improve on their API developer account workflow, developers will look elsewhere.
<p>If you are an API provider, it can be easy to miss this layer of API integration, but us API consumers, and the growing number of us who are using numerous APIs, feel the pain. With the rapid growth in the industry, API account management will continue to grow as an area that needs a more sophisticated approach, and is something that makes the argument for using API infrastructure platforms like 3Scale, over hand-rolling your own API management solution.

        <span class="post-date">04 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.respoke.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/respoke/respoke-web-communications-300x101.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>In the coming months I&rsquo;m doing some deep profiling of the API space, so you are going to see me reviewing the approach of more API providers in the space. My goal with API reviews is not just to showcase the company or service involved, but review the overall approach of the provider. You can <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/12/12/an-api-evangelist-review-of-your-api/">read more about my review process on API Evangelist</a>, to better understand my objectives.
<p>The review in the queue today is from <a href="https://www.respoke.io">Respoke, a web communications platform</a>. When you land on the Respoke website, you see all the signs of a modern platform, starting with the simple single page app style website, but more importantly, they immediately tell me what they do, in a simple, easy to understand way:
<blockquote><em>Add live voice, video, text, and data features to your website or app</em></blockquote>
<p>You wouldn't believe how hard this is for some of the APIs I review. If I have to spend more than 5 seconds trying to understand what you do, you've failed, and Respoke nails it, by both providing simple text, as well as visuals that help me understand that they are a web communications platform.
<p>To continue understanding what Respoke does, let&rsquo;s take a stroll through all of the areas I focus on during any API review.
<p><strong>Actual API Endpoints</strong><br /> I always start with the actual API endpoints when reviewing an platform. Respoke provides a basic set of endpoints, mostly for authentication of communications via the platform, but also managing roles, groups, etc. You can tell the API is new, and it doesn't have the telltale signs of a fully mature API that has been used for a while, but I know with Respoke, they are just getting going. I&rsquo;m not a fan of using POST, and relying on request data being passed through the body as JSON. I like simple parameter based design, with sensible usage of your verbs. I feel this approach makes an API more hackable by users, even non-developers who only know enough to be dangerous. It is not a show stopper, just a personal opinion of mine.
<p><a href="https://www.respoke.io"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/respoke/Respoke-Web-Communications.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p><strong>Developer On-Boarding</strong><br /> Respoke provides a simple, frictionless on-boarding experience, easing you in with a getting started that walks you through the platform, and the self-service registration flow you need to get started with the service. At first glance I&rsquo;d say they can do a little better job of explaining the authentication. I haven't actually hacked on it yet, but at first glance it seems overly complex, or maybe just could be explained better. Another thing I'd like to see is a simple FAQ that I can scan to be able to see many of the common questions that get asked, and educate myself about Respoke in one page.
<p><strong>Platform Documentation</strong><br /> Like the API endpoints themselves, the documentation is simple. I&rsquo;d like to see a <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> specs for the API, and some interactive documentation to go with it&mdash;in my opinion this is default for all platform documentation in 2014. I suspect as the API matures, so will the platform documentation.
<p><strong>Authentication &amp; Security</strong><br /> As I mentioned above, I think the authentication strategy is a little confusing when you are on-boarding. I&rsquo;m guessing I don&rsquo;t fully understand everything about the security and authentication of web communications via Respoke, but I also suspect they can put a little more work into help new users understand how it works, get started with basic authentication, and then when you are ready, learn more about the advanced security features around platform communications.
<p><strong>Code For Integration</strong><br /> Respoke integration is pretty focused on JavaScript, so my evaluation of code resources will be a little different than with other APIs. I&rsquo;d like to see other language libraries, but I&rsquo;m sure as the platform evolves, we'll see these emerge from the community. Respoke provides JavaScript and Node.js libraries to get going, but what I really like is the <a href="https://docs.respoke.io/tutorials/example-apps.html">example apps that they provide</a>, or as I call them starter kits . I think starter kits go well beyond just providing code, but also help spark the imagination of developers around what is possible. +1 in this area for the Respoke usage of Github&mdash;I consider Github an essential building block for any API provider. Beyond these areas, I would suggest that Respoke spends some time thinking about what Platform Development Kits (PDK) they could provide. Providing ready to go solutions for top platforms like SalesForce, WordPress, and other leading systems that would benefit from a seamless web communications integration from Respoke. Similar to the starter apps they provide, PDKs would seriously contribute to adoption.
<p><strong>Direct and Indirect Support</strong><br /> When it comes to support resources, Respoke has the minimum viable building blocks need, providing indirect support via a forum, and direct support via email. This is definitely the baseline for any provider, but I would encourage the addition of a support ticketing system as they pick up momentum, and definitely start keep an eye on Stack Overflow, and engaging developers on their own turf.
<p><strong>Communication With Community</strong><br /> The Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ social accounts are front and center for Respoke, and they appear to be active&mdash;nice. However the lack of a blog always makes me sad. I know that many providers don&rsquo;t feel they have the resources to publish a blog, and keep active, but for me this is one of the most important signals an API platform can provide. When it comes to communicating with your API community, I&rsquo;d say the blog is number one, and after that Twitter and Github are number two and three. Respoke has 2 out of 3 when it comes to the essential communication building blocks.
<p><strong>Platform Updates</strong><br /> As I made my way around the Respoke platform, I was happy to see there was a <a href="https://docs.respoke.io/reference/changelog.html">change log</a> keeping developers up to date with what has happened to the platform. I would also consider providing some sort of roadmap, providing the other end of the platform update coin. Since Respoke uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a> as core technology, it seems there should be some element of updates regarding browser support, and updates to the WebRTC format. I would also consider adding a status dashboard to keep Respoke users informed about the stability of the overall platform.
<p><strong>Business Model</strong><br /> One of things I judge APIs on is their pricing, and whether or not the pricing page is front and center, and Respokes is. They provide you with a free tier for playing around, and sensible pricing tiers for you to grow into, with unit based pricing per minute and connection. How a platform wears its business model tells a lot about the underlying services, and Respoke is straight up about all of it. Kudos!
<p><strong>Resources</strong><br /> When it came to supporting resources for the Respoke platform, there really were no case-studies, slides from events, how to guides, and other vital resources to help developers through all stages of development. This is one area I&rsquo;m pretty lenient in early on, because I understand that many APIs are just getting going, and it will take time for supporting resources to be developed properly.  My goal is to just make sure the platform is aware of the lack of general resources, and make sure it gets into the roadmap ASAP.
<p><a href="https://www.respoke.io/#pricing"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/respoke/Respoke-Pricing.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong><br /> I always like to see some sort of forward leaning research &amp; development areas of an API, such as an idea showcase, or labs environment. I think Respoke touches on this with their starter projects, that don&rsquo;t just provide valuable code, but also ideas for how the service can be integrated with, but I think they could take this further. Respoke needs to bring their experience with web communications, and WebRTC to the table and providing leading examples of what is next for web communications. There are many proven ways platforms demonstrate where their platform, and supporting technologies are headed, and I&rsquo;d like to see more of this within the Respoke community, I know the knowledge and talent exists, they just need to showcase on site.
<p><strong>Legal Department</strong><br /> Respoke provides the required terms of service (TOS), and privacy policy that outlines how the platform operates. I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, but after reading through their TOS and Privacy Policy I didn&rsquo;t see any red flags regarding data ownership, privacy, or the other hot button areas I usually see around the politics of API operations. My first take on the Respoke legal department is that they are operating a pretty straightforward technology platform, and are respecting the interests of both developers, as well as end user. The only area I would comment on, is the lack of branding guidelines and resources for developers to take advantage of. I expect that branding will play an important role in helping drive Respoke adoption.
<p><strong>Embeddable Tools</strong><br /> Respoke has a built in advantage in the area of embeddable, with the fact that many of their core integrations will be done via JavaScript. Respoke is meant to be embedded, and developers can do this pretty quickly using the default JavaScript library, but I think Respoke could go much further in this areas by providing embeddable platform development kits (PDK) as I mentioned above, as well as an assortment of other copy / paste goodies, and possibly even a communication widget builder. Properly branded, embeddable tools go a long way in acting as a marketing vehicle for the platform, educating users along the way of the platform behind the tools they are using.
<p><strong>Development Environment</strong><br /> After I signed up for my Respoke account, logged in, and setup my first application, I noticed that Respoke had a dev mode for developer to take advantage of when integrating into their applications. I&rsquo;m a big fan of sandbox or development environments, allowing developers to build in a safer, more comfortable environment, but then being able to easily flip the production switch in a self-service way, when they are ready. I&rsquo;d like to see more integration resources available to developers, that help with development, QA, and production issues, and even provide monitoring, testing, and other common integration building blocks we are seeing from providers like <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a> and <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>.
<p><strong>Developer Portal</strong><br /> A simple, robust developer portal is a must these days for any providers, and Respoke provide a pretty standard account management solution, giving you control over settings, the ability managing individual applications, as well as your pricing and payment history. I&rsquo;d like to see more analytics, and other integration resources as I mentioned above, here in my Respoke developer area, but overall it provides the minimum viable portal developers need to be successful when integrating with an API--anticipating it will only get better.
<p><strong>Balance and Consistency</strong><br /> Across the technical, business, and political building blocks of an API, I&rsquo;m always looking for balance and consistency. This might be in how they craft their actual API endpoints, but could also be in API documentation, code samples, or even storytelling on the blog. I&rsquo;d say that they are consistent in their API design, but as I mentioned above, I&rsquo;m not a fan of making requests a POST, using the body to pass values. While they are consistent in this use, I don&rsquo;t think its consistent with modern, web APIs developers are used to seeing. I think Respoke will achieve more balance, and consistency in their API design, as well as content and other resources available on the platform over time&mdash;they are just getting going, and it always takes a while to get firm footing in this area.
<p><strong>Is It An Open API?</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m always hesitant to truly call an API &ldquo;open&rdquo;, until I peel back the layers of the onion, and make an assessment myself&mdash;just because an API is publicly available, doesn&rsquo;t mean it is open. After doing this, I can confidently say that Respoke is an open API. It is publicly available, self-service, with a straightforward business model, including sensible TOS. Only time will tell if Respoke continues to deliver their services in an open way, but the way they've constructed their platform so far, tells me they will.
<p><strong>API Evangelism</strong><br /> Like the resources area, there is pretty much no sign of life to report on when it comes to evangelism of the Respoke platform. However, I do know they have hired an evangelist, I have a call scheduled with him, and I&rsquo;m confident this is another area we will start seeing activity. You can always tell when a platform as an active evangelist because the social networks are active, Stack Overflow and Quora are engaged, there are a steady stream of commits on Github, regular flow of stories on the blog, and lots of exhaust from conferences and hackathons they are at. I'm guessing the next time I take a look at the Respoke platform, this will be different.
<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong><br /> That concludes my review of the Respoke API, across these 18 areas. I&rsquo;d give them a solid B for their efforts. The platform has some maturing to do, in the overall design of the API, and the supporting building blocks, but this is standard operating procedure. Respoke is just getting going, and are kicking butt in most of the essential areas. My only red flag is the lack of blog, but this is just one of my pet peeves. I need the storytelling heartbeat of a blog to help me get to know providers in real time. I do not have time to speak to all providers on a regular basis, and an active blog provides an asynchronous way to track on thousands of companies, and their API resources.
<p>I think Respoke is notable because they are pushing forward not just an open technology like WebRTC, but all web communication in general. WebRTC is all about "Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple JavaScript APIs&rdquo;, and I just as I mentioned in my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/the-contextio-api-and-thinking-out-of-the-box-when-crafting-apis/">post about what Context.io is doing to push forward SMTP, POP, and IMAP with web APIs</a>, I think Respoke is working do the same with WebRTC. They seem to have a vision, derived from years of experience in the field, and they are looking to deliver on this vision using not just JavaScript APIs, but wider web APIs&mdash;something I can definitely get behind.
<p>Hopefully my review provides value for Respoke, but also the wider API space, and helps API providers understand how they can better craft their own API strategies. Respoke is something I&rsquo;d share as a blueprint for how you can deliver a communication platform using APIs, and I will be keeping an eye on them, updating my definition of what they do as they evolve. Look for more updates as I continue to weave Respoke into my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>, as well as any of my other <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">API research</a>.
<p><strong>Update: </strong>They do have a blog at&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.respoke.io/">blog.respoke.io</a>&nbsp;(happy dance), and <a href="https://github.com/respoke/respoke/issues">you can submit tickets via their Github issues</a> on the Respoke repo.

<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve written about before in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/05/api-sandbox-and-simulator-from-carvoyant/">API Sandbox And Simulator From Carvoyant</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/24/salesforce-adds-sandbox-templates/">Salesforce Adds Sandbox Templates</a>. However it is something I&rsquo;d like to formalize, and get some new API service providers helping out in this area, or encourage the development of open source solutions.
<p>API service providers like <a href="https://apiary.io/">Apiary</a> and <a href="https://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> are providing some very interesting solutions for mocking, and virtualizing APIs from API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML. What I would like to see is the emergence of standalone solutions, providing data sets templates, or whatever you want to call it for populating mock APIs for testing, and integration.
<p>Think of it as <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a>, but structured data meant specifically for APIs, and specific API definitions, as opposed to static mock content for websites. Seems like you could easily scan a machine readable definition for an API, and see if any existing templates exist that match the definition. If there was you could easily populate the mock or virtualized API, if there wasn't maybe you could provide tools for easily building a template, in a way that it could the data could now be reused.
<p>This idea for API sandbox and simulation templates, and for the<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/04/swagger-api-definition-mapper/"> Swagger API definition mapper</a>, both were ideas that came up in my conversation with John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser/">@johnmusser</a>). They are ideas I&rsquo;ve had in my Evernote for a while, but bringing them up today reminded me that both ideas needed to see the light of day, and hopefully I can move them forward at some point.

<p>I was having one of my long overdue check ins with API godfather John Musser today, and it reminded me of an idea I wanted to put out there, so while it was fresh in my mind, I wanted to share. I&rsquo;m applying this to my <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> driven world, but should be applied to all of the common API definition formats like API Blueprint, and RAML.
<p>I want a machine readable way to map APIs together across multiple Swagger API definitions, mapping a specific API path in one Swagger spec to another API path in an entirely different API definition. Once the paths are connected, you should also be able map specific parameters to each other. It also seems logical that for each mapping you'd want to provide some sort of meta data about the relationship, and maybe some sort of semantics involved also.
<p>Maybe something like this already exists? IDK. I&rsquo;m sure that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity providers </a>like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> probably have their own proprietary approach to handling this, but I&rsquo;m looking for a simple JSON, YAML, or Markdown version of this. If there isn&rsquo;t something like this already out there, I may play around with a prototype. I&rsquo;d like to <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">map similar APIs in my email API research</a>, allowing me to bundle together similar resources.
<p>Not sure how much time I will have for this in 2014, but figured I'd put out there, and see if I've missed something already existing in the space. Also, once something lives on my blog, it becomes a little more real, and the chances increase that I will actually move it forward at some point.

<p>I&rsquo;m playing with more data visualizations lately, trying to establish a dynamic set of tools that I can use in my storytelling across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>. I've been focusing on using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference">Google Visualizations</a>, and other JQuery plugins I've gathered over time, for now.
<p>During the Turkey Day weekend,&nbsp;<a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">I turned a subway map JQuery plugin I had found into an API</a>, and introduced some new ways I can easily use these visualizations in my <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/">Hacker Storytelling</a> format of publishing all of my research as Github repositories, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/11/16/public-frontend-and-private-backend-for-my-sites-on-github/">using the master branch as a private file and data store, and the Github Pages as the public face of the project</a>.
<p>During the proces, I&rsquo;ve added the subway map to my visualization toolbox of JSON driven components that I can use when publishing my stories and research to Github, adding to my already existing tools like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll posts &amp; data</a>, <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">mustache templates</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">reveal.js slideshows</a>. I've also identified a handful of other visualizations that I want to add to my toolbox, providing a set of tools I can use to publish research reports, that deliver an open, rich, interactive, visualization layer on top of my simple JSON data stores.
<p>In reality, this is just my own approach to lightweight application delivery, similar to what we all call <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">Single Page Apps or SPA</a>, except I don't always adhere to a single page, or use a single framework&mdash;I try to keep lightweight, and a decoupled set of tools that I can mix and match to accomplish different objectives. As of this weekend the API Evangelist network is now over a&nbsp;<a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">100 separate Github repositories</a> working in concert (or isolation), to help me achieve on my mission to better understand the API space, while hopefully helping others along the way.
<p>As I work to assemble my API driven visualization toolkit, I&rsquo;m thinking I will start calling deployments a Single Page Report (SPR). While it won't be entirely true, as some reports could span multiple pages, I think the term still applies. Essentially an SPR can act much like the PDF gets used today when publishing most business reports. In my scenario rather than flattening the data, and resulting report, you would publish all the rich data, and visualizations to a single Github repository.
<p>If you wanted to flatten an SPR, you could still publish as PDF, but it could also be interactive, forked, and have pull requests made to update data, correct any problems, and further enhance the visualizations. I just wanted to get this idea out there. I will work on generating a couple of "single page reports", to help better demonstrate my vision. And hopefully I won't actually end up calling it an SPR&mdash;I think I can do better.

<p>Here we go again. If you were in <a href="http://chicago2014.apistrat.com/">Chicago for APIStrat this September</a>, then you know we are planning to have the next edition of APIStrat in Berlin, this spring. This round 3Scale and API Evangelist are partnering with APIDays to deliver two days of API talks at the <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/venue/">Humboldt Carr&eacute;, the Conference And Event Centre on Gendarmenmarkt</a>, April 24th and 25th, 2015.
<p>I learned a lot attending APIDays Berlin earlier this year, and I am looking forward to continuing the conversation in 2015, APIStrat style. <span>Our speaker lineup includes&nbsp;</span><a title="Mandy Waite" href="https://twitter.com/tekgrrl">Mandy Waite</a><span>, Developer Advocate at&nbsp;</span><strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong><span>;&nbsp;</span><strong>Chris Taggart</strong><span>, CEO of&nbsp;</span><a title="OpenCorporates" href="https://twitter.com/countculture">OpenCorporates</a><span>; and&nbsp;</span><a title="Max Harlow" href="https://twitter.com/maxharlow">Max Harlow</a><span>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;</span><strong>Guardian Open Platform</strong><span>.</span>
<p>Of course we need sponsors to make the conversation happen. APIDays and APIDays can&rsquo;t make it all happen alone. We have some great sponsors who've stepped up early:

<p>Without the 3Scale team, APIStrat wouldn't happen. As we prepared for the launch of the <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">APIDays Berlin &amp; APIStrat Europe 2015</a> website, I was reminded that this is the 5th edition of APIStrat, and I think the 8th edition of APIDays, and I can feel that the API space is significantly picking up momentum going into 2015.
<p>I think Germany, and Europe has a very important role to play in helping stabilize, as well as grow the API industry in a sensible, secure way that respects the privacy of the people who are using the apps that are built on the of APIs we are seeing deployed. This is the conversation we will be having in Berlin this spring, and I hope to see you there.

<p>This story gets file into the &ldquo;way in future&rdquo; bucket, because the infrastructure needed to make happen doesn't even exist. Beyond research from API grandfather John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), and a few other blog posts or conference decks, there is no standardization of monetization strategies and pricing across APIs&mdash;making my idea impossible currently.
<p>I won&rsquo;t let that stop me! What I'd like to see is a developer credit system, that I can earn buy or earn credits for any single API, but I possess a credit account across all the APIs I depend on--as an API developer I want to buy credits for API usage, allowing me to buy in single, or bulk amounts, and apply against my regular API usage.
<p>As an API provider, I could provide developers with an incentive using credits, trying to drive the behavior I'm looking to get from developers. With a credit system I could even pay developer's credits for doing common API ecosystem tasks like creating code libraries, generating how-to-guides, or even supporting other developers on the forum.
<p>If there was a market for API credits, as a developer I could easily earn credits on one platform, and use them there, or possibly apply them to other platforms. I could also choose to just sell my credits on the open market to other API consumers, who might value the credits more than I do, or pay a rate that is lower than they'd get directly from a provider.
<p>This is just a random thought I wanted to put out into the universe, that came up as I was evaluating the business models of some APIs I&rsquo;m reviewing. We have a lot of work before something like this would be possible, but if someone stepped up to work on this problem across providers, I think there would be a pretty significant opportunity for them in coming years--think Amazon Web Service pricing, but across the board for the API space, applied to all business sectors. #huge

        <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-angry-mob.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>Almost every time an API shuts down, the tech blogosphere, and the social networks favored by the tech community erupts in comments resembling: That is what you get for depending on APIs, and APIs can go away at any time, you should know better by now, and you should not build a company on someone elses resources--just to name a few.
<p>Where did this line of thought begin? Why do developers feel so burned when a popular API like Netflix, ESPN, or Google Translate is deprecated? The main reason is lack of communication. Developers need a long runway that an API is going to be deprecated. Something that will mitigate much of the backlash, but still the comments are never, why didn't Netflix communicate with us (they did), it is highlighting that APIs can go away at any point.
<p>What other business in the world do you have vendors that do not go away? I cannot think of a single business, where you select a supplier of products or services you depend on for your business, without any chance of that company going bankrupt, shutting down, being sold, or possibly just discontinuing providing a particular products or services you depend  on.
<p>I find it particularly interesting that this is an argument that continues to hold weight, and while you will hear me push back on API providers to communicate better around the deprecation of their APIs, you will never hear me say an API should never shut down, or you shouldn't ever use an API to build applications. Just like any other business area, you should carefully research your vendors, make sensible choices about why you use one over another, and when possible have contingency plans for your operations.
<p>I would be curious to hear ideas about the possible origins of why developers feel like this. I can't think of any precedent that would have set this tone for the conversation, and after almost 14 years of the modern web AP industry, developers are still crying fowl, and the tech blogosphere still finds it relevant to stir up sentiment that APIs are not reliable because of these high profile deprecations.

        <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a title="Context.io" href="http://context.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/context-io/context-io-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>I recently finished looking through all of the email APIs available in the space, narrowing it down to just a handful of companies who I felt were worthy of showcasing as part of my <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">email API research</a>. Ultimately I felt seven were worthy of discussion, and after I laid them side by side all of them were very similar in the technology, business, and politics of their APIs&mdash;all except one, <a title="Context.io" href="http://context.io/">Context.io</a>.
<p>Context.io isn&rsquo;t about sending or receiving emails via APIs, or simply focusing on email standards like SMPT, POP, and IMAP. Context.io provides you with storage and indexing of your emails, and then opens up a new API driven world where things are possible you never imagined. Extending upon existing standards like SMTP, POP, and IMAP with APIs like SendGrid has done is cool, but what Context.io has done represents truly thinking out of the box with APIs--which I love to see..
<p>If you haven't noticed, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of evolving legacy standards and technologies using APIs, and I think there is plenty of room for this to occur across many business sectors, and layers of the technology world. I don&rsquo;t think every startup or existing company will have the imagination, or bravery for that matter, to do what Context.io has done, but I applaud their thinking, and would love to see others follow their lead when considering their entry into the API game.
<p>Mapping a new set of web APIs to some very legacy processes, in a simple, easy to use way, takes skill and consideration for not just the legacy tech, but also how modern web APis are designed, deployed, managed, and evangelized. Doing the technical, while also deeply considering how people are using this legacy technologies, how they are embedded in our lives and business like email is, and then developing API driven solutions that solve problems for users in these spaces, takes a serious amount of work.
<p>Ive known about Context.io and what they do for some time now, but the impact of what they do really became evident in my side by side evaluation of them with other email API providers before I had an epiphany about what they are up to. Then after spending time with their team at Defrag, over beers in the taproom, I was able to get a glimpse of the future they envision, building meaningful services on top of email, that truly make users lives easier.
<p>I will continue keeping a close eye on <a title="Context.io" href="http://context.io/">Context.io</a>, and will also be hacking on their API to see what I can do on top of my own email stores, and I encourage you to do the same. If nothing else, use them as a model for how you can possibly think out of the box when designing your next generation of API resources, that consumers won't just love, they will come to depend on.

        <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-metro-map-575.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>A long time ago I defined the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a> using a subway map format, plotting out the different routes you could take, and the locations all along this journey. As with anything I do, this is a work in progress, and I&rsquo;m needing to regularly update this map. Currently it is in an image, and I use an image mapping tool to generate the links&mdash;something that is very time consuming.
<p>I think the subway map is an important metaphor for understanding some potentially complex ideas, and provide a single map, complete with legends, supporting content, and links to more details. My problem is I have several maps I need to create, and maintain on a regular basis. Ideally my subway mapping tool would be dynamic, allowing me to make changes as I went along.
<p>While looking for a solution, I stumbled across <a href="http://kalyani.com/2010/10/subway-map-visualization-jquery-plugin/">Subway Map Visualization jQuery Plugin</a>, by Nik Kalyani. This plugin would work perfectly for what I wanted to do to visualize the API Evangelist network, but I had another project I wanted to do, in which it somewhat fell short in satsifying.
<p>There is a lot of talk about the API lifecycle, and I wanted a way to <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/lifecycle.html" target="_blank">map out the API lifecycle</a> as I saw it, but this concept isn&rsquo;t something there is a single answer for, and I wanted to hear other providers take on their own API lifecycle. I wanted others to potentially build their own API lifecycle subway maps, so I new that the Subway Map plugin needed to be dynamic&mdash;so I wrapped it in a web API.
<p>I&rsquo;m still playing with what is possible, but my new&nbsp;<a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">Subway Map API</a> allows you to generate maps, adding routes, and locations along the routes. The API just takes advantage of all the features that Nik Kalyani added into the plugin, I just provided web APis for them. This project will be changing fast, and I will be resetting the database regularly, so if you play with it, make sure and let me know, so I don't step on your toes.

<p>As I build out new APIs for use across my systems, as well as map out the landscape of valuable API resources available today, I'm <a href="http://apievangelist.com/templates/">working to define templates</a> that other API providers can follow when designing and deploying their own API infrastructure. I've accumulated 16 basic templates, prompting me to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/templates/">add a new section to the website called templates</a>.
<p>These projects represent the templates I've established through my existing research, and will add other templates as they come off the assembly line. These API designs aren't mean to be the perfect solution for production environements, but to be seeds for new conversation around APIs, as well as providing a basic pattern you can use to start your own development.
<p>Each API is functional, and has its own Github repository for storing of a Swagger definition, Swagger UI Interactive Documentation, as well as the server side code that I will open source with each template. As I move forward each template, I will publish changes to their repos, as well as maintain a roadmap via each projects Github milestones.&nbsp;

<p>Not all companies who have an API are Twilio, where the API is the product. With Twilio when you land on their website home page, you are in API developer area by default, this is what Twilio does. Many other API driven companies like Twitter, provide link to the API developer program as a link in the footer of the main site, something developers have become accustom to finding.
<p>Many companies I review, don&rsquo;t even have a link prominently listed on their site, forcing me to dig around looking for any evidence of an API. This story isn&rsquo;t about these companies, that is a whole separate post, this story is about the <a href="http://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)</a> and how they have brought their API front and center by having the API present in the top level navigation, and listing their application showcase on their home page. This demonstrates that the DPLA API is something that goes well beyond just being a footnote in operations, and at DPLA it is something that all site visitors should know about--not just developers.
<p>This may not seem like much at first glance, but when it comes to educating visitors of all types, that an API exists, it can be the difference between them knowing their is an API, or not. In 2014, APIs are moving closer to being a part of the mainstream consciousness and you shouldn&rsquo;t have to hide your API. Developers, and non-developers alike should know you have an API. If you want your visitors to potentially integrate with an API, use an application built on your API, or maybe even just spread the word about your API, consider moving it more front and center, giving your API more real estate on your home page, and make it a first class citizen in your site's global navigation.

<p>In the early days, there was just one API design tool to use, <a href="https://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a>. Now at the end of 2014, we have four separate API design tools to choose from. I credit Apiary.io for opening up this new era of API design, expanding the API life cycle, and emphasizing healthy API design practices over just API deployment and management.
<p>In my opinion the expansion of APIs design formats, and API design tooling is extremely important to the space, allowing API providers to have conversation around API design with developers, and key business stakeholders, before development actually begins. However, the benefits of healthy API design, using leading API definition formats, goes well beyond just design, and the rewards can be seen throughout the entire API lifecycle.
<p>There are three API design tools, from each of the providers of the modern API design formats:
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="100%">

<td><a href="http://editor.swagger.io">Swagger Editor</a> - Allows the designing APIs in the Swagger format in both YAML and JSON, allowing you to import, edit, preview, and export API design docs.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All three of these API design tools are developed by the creator of the leading API definition formats, <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. (aka. Apiary, Wordnik, and Mulesoft). Now, a significant evolution in the API design tooling space has occurred and a cross format API design tool has emerged from the popular Java API framework <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>.
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://studio.restlet.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/restlet-studio.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://studio.restlet.com">Restlet Studio</a> - Allows you to create, and load API designs in Swagger and RAML formats, save, and generate server side scaffolding, and client side SDKs in multiple languages.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The emergence of the Restlet Studio is significant because it represents the expansion API design tooling beyond the three leading API definition format providers, as well as being the first cross-format API design editor. There are other API service providers who deliver vital API services along the API lifecycle like <a href="https://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/overview/">Ready! API</a>, for mocking and testing your APIs, or <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> which generates SDKs, both of which support multiple API definition formats, but Restlet Studio is the first cross-format purely API design editor (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong).
<p>I&rsquo;ll be spending more time mapping out all of the tools that are emerging to deliver vital services throughout the API design life cycle, something that gives me hope for things standardizing when it comes to designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs. It is an exciting time to be in the API space, as the universe rapidly expands, and more companies emerge to help us make sense of this rapid expansion.

<p>I was reviewing an API over the last couple of weeks--I signed up for an account, came back several times, and made a handful of API calls in hopes of learning more about how the API works. This is something I do a lot, and it is always interesting to experience the on boarding process (or lack of) for APIs.
<p>I first signed up about two weeks ago for this particular API, and within 48 hours I received an email asking if I needed help with my integration--that was nice of them. I like getting an email from the provider, and the more human it is, the better. At this point I didn't need any help, I&rsquo;m just playing, learning, and depending on the self-service resources made available to me via the API ecosystem.
<p>About a week later I get another email, again asking if I need help. At this point I&rsquo;ve put down the API, but when I pick back up I might respond to the platform then, but I just have more learning to do before I have questions. Then about a week later, right before I was about to pick up the API again, I got another email asking me what my plans were, putting more pressure on me to share my plans for how I was going to be using an API, which I'm just not sure yet.
<p>I am not your usual API consumer. I know this. However this API, I was actually planning on integrating into my core API tracking system at some point, so in addition to being the API Evangelist who might write a story, there is a good chance I will become a customer. I really like, and believe in the self-service nature of APIs, and while I like getting an email letting me know someone is home, I tend to be turned off by each consecutive email--nothing reminds you are in someones sales funnel, like a series of emails.
<p>When you consider the touch points for your API on-boarding flow, make sure and think about the different types of users who will be registering, and the fact that not everyone will fit squarely in your perfect funnel definition. You want to make sure your API consumers know that someone home, and that you are there to help, but you really should rely on your self-service resources to get the bigger job done. Your initial email after I sign up should do this, then leave the next steps up to me, and be very thoughtful, and possibly dynamic with each engagement after that.

<p>When I landed on the <a href="http://dev.mailjet.com/email-api/v3/metadata/">version 3.0 landing page for the Mailjet API</a>, the first thing I noticed was their API configuration API. Providing a set of API endpoints for managing my own API usage is definitely something I can get behind, and think it is something worth showcasing.
<p>As part of the API Configuration portion of their email API, Mailjet provides five separate endpoints for users to manage their API developer account.
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>/apikey -</strong> Manage your Mailjet API Keys. API keys are used as credentials to access the API and SMTP server</li>
<li><strong>/apikeyaccess - </strong>Access rights description on API keys for subaccounts/users.</li>
<li><strong>/apikeytotal -</strong> Global counts for an API Key, since its creation</li>
<li><strong>/apitoken - </strong>Access token for API, used to give access to an API Key in conjunction with our IFrame API</li>
<li><strong>/metadata -</strong> Mailjet API metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>I like this approach to providing developers with API access to their developer account details. It is an approach I&rsquo;d like to <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">explore and standardize using the 3Scale API</a>. I think it is something I've written about before, but I couldn't find it.
<p>API access to a developer account is something I haven't seen anywhere else, but I'll definitely be using <a href="http://dev.mailjet.com">Mailjet</a> as a blueprint for demonstrating what is possible, and see if I can&rsquo;t convince other API providers that it is a feature they should consider.

<p>As the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_v._Google">Oracle v Google API copyright</a> case was on its way to the Federal Circuit Court in 2012, the <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/07/us-precedent-for-api-copyright-hinges-on-oracle-v-google/">EFF reached out to me for help in crafting stories of how important it is that APIs remain free of copyright</a>, ensuring they remain open and interoperable. I shared three stories, one on cloud computing and AWS APIs, the second on Delicious APIs, and the third on Instagram APIs, all reflecting three different scenarios that would never have happened if APIs were copyrightable.
<p>A couple weeks ago EFF reached out again, asking for my signature again, on <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/computer-scientists-ask-supreme-court-rule-apis-cant-be-copyrighted">another Amicus Brief to support Google&rsquo;s request of the Supreme Court to review the circuit courts decision</a>, and reverse it. As it stands right now, there is a precedent that copyright can be applied to APIs, and even though the case itself is moving onto the question of fair use, if we let the current decision stand, other companies can follow Oracle&rsquo;s damaging lead and sue for protection of their APIs--which is why we need to convince the Supreme Court to review, and overturn the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very damaging</span> decision.&nbsp;
<p>We expect that the Supreme Court will decide whether or not to grant Google&rsquo;s petition to review the Federal Circuit&rsquo;s decision sometime in January or February of 2015. So I need your help to stir up buzz around the issue, and post stories on your blog, call your congressman, and light up any other channel you can, to help educate people about the importance of the issue. When the Supreme Court takes on the case (which I feel strongly they will), we will need to regroup, and refile, a more expansive brief on the importance of APIs remaining free of copyright.&nbsp;
<p>I&rsquo;m working to expand my <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">restaurant menu analogy</a>, to help people understand the importance of APIs, but if you have other analogies that you think would help the Supreme Court understand the separation of API interfaces, and their supporting server side or client side code, please share with me so I can work with the EFF to potentially include in the next brief that is filed. APIs are touching every sector of business in 2014, and if we allow Oracle&rsquo;s copyright claim to stand, we are in danger of pouring glue into the gears of each of these business sectors, at a point in time where we need to introduce as much lubrication, and transparency as we possible can, to ensure that the web, mobile, and Internet of Things applications built on APIs remain open and interoperable--ensuring they serve not just their platform owners, but also developers, and end-users equally.
<p>Join me, in helping bring awareness to the issue, which right along with Net Neutrality, is one of the most important issues we currently face when it comes to deciding the future of technology, and how our society works, shares, collaborates and interoperates in this new online digital world we have created for our world.

<p>I've been crafting Swagger 2.0 definitions for many of the leading APIs i track on lately, and to help alleviate my pain and suffering, I&rsquo;m willing to write about your company if you write your own Swagger 2.0 spec. I&rsquo;m sorry, this is really important work, but it can be very grueling detail work, and I'd really like your help!
<p>If you send me a 80% complete <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger 2.0 specification</a>, or for that matter, an <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> or <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML specification</a>, I will review your API efforts on the API Evangelist blog. I'm pretty adamant that all APIs today should have a machine readable definition in a popular format like Swagger or API Blueprint, as well as each API developer program possessing an <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.son</a> index of all of their APIs, including a reference to the machine readable API definition.
<p>I&rsquo;m determined to hand craft machine readable Swagger specs for the best APIs out there, and in time I will do this, but I could really use the help of API providers as well. Send me a link to your Swagger spec, and I&rsquo;ll make sure a story gets into my story queue. I would add a disclaimer, that you need to make sure your API offers value, and your overall effort is thoughtful, otherwise I may call you out on some things. :-)
<p>Once we get to a point where all APIs have a machine readable definition, we will start seeing entirely new opportunities around API design, deployment, management, integration, and discovery. I'm determined to bootstrap the work that will help us get to this point, but damn, I sure need some help.

<p>It always makes me happy to see a pricing page, front and center when I visit an API, but I found an added bonus over at the email API, Inbox. At the bottom of their pricing page, they have a pretty simple question: <em><strong>Hey, why isn't this free?</strong></em>
<blockquote><em>
<p>It&rsquo;s become painfully clear in the past few years that if you&rsquo;re not paying for something, you&rsquo;re the product. In practice, this has resulted in &ldquo;free&rdquo; platforms that eventually were forced to show ads, sell user data, or fire-sale to a large company to only be unloved or shut-down.
<p>We&rsquo;re taking a different approach. The Inbox API isn&rsquo;t free. You pay us, and we run the service. That&rsquo;s it.
<p>We know our pricing might still be prohibitive to some apps getting started. If you&rsquo;re a startup building on the Inbox Platform, please get in touch by emailing <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="81f2f4f1f1eef3f5c1e8efe3eef9e0f1f1afe2eeecaf">[email&#160;protected]</a>
</em></blockquote>
<p>I like their style. I just don't understand the smoke &amp; mirrors when it comes to pricing in the API space, and fully support API providers who offer no B.S. pricing for their API resources.
<p>It is little things like this that keep me trolling through the developer areas, and back alleys of the API space each day.

<p>I&rsquo;m lost in API monetization land, evaluating the business models of common APIs, so you are just going to have to cope with it, until I get through this research. Honestly, I really don't care this much about making money off of APIs, it is just telling me a lot about the motivations behind many of the APIs I keep an eye on. This particular story is extracted from my research into the monetization strategies of multiple core business sectors in the API space, and one of my regular conversations that I have, with an API provider around how they can settle in on a sensible monetization strategy.
<p>In the same conversation around how these valuable resources even became APIs, we were immediately led to the topic of what we were going to charge for, and how we were going make money off these potentially resources. As I&rsquo;m discussing resources based API design, I&rsquo;m also having a resource based API monetization conversation&mdash;which tells me we are so lost in the infancy of all areas of API design, deployment, management, and ultimately monetization.
<p>How these resources are going to be used? How will these API resources actually be put to use by end-users within web, mobile, and IoT applications? Seems like we should be considering the perspectives on how people will experience these APIs as we design the interfaces, let alone before we attach prices to them.  If we don&rsquo;t know ho they will be used, how will we ever know what someone will pay for them?
<p>I just don't know the answer. I know that we have hard costs for crafting these API resources--the compute, storage, and bandwidth to serve them up. I do not know if anyone will even pay a dime for any of them, or even need them at all. Where do I focus? Do I concentrate on the resources that I have, and more about how to make them accessible, while also covering my overhead, and hopefully make some profit on top? Or do I focus how thinking about how they will be used, and the value they have with end-users? I can't decide on where I should focus: 1) resource based API monetization, or 2) experience based monetization. #help

<p>I spend my time gathering what I call b"uilding blocks",&nbsp;as I work my way through the API landscape. I&rsquo;ve been tracking on the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks of API management since 2011</a>, and have expanded that to include API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">deployment</a>, <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/">evangelism</a>, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">integration</a> and other areas of the API lifecycle in the last 3 years. I'm working my way through the <a href="http://theapistack.com">700 APIs in my API stack</a>, I am looking for industry focused building building blocks, as well as the ones associated with an APIs business model, or monetization strategy.
<p>I have almost twenty monetization building blocks I'm tracking on ranging from free access to the availability of partner programs. As I work my way through various business sectors being impacted by APIs, I'm starting to see interesting patterns, some of which can act as a red flag for me that there are potential problems within an API operations. To the uneducated API pundit, the illnesses around APIs arise from simplistic concepts like &ldquo;being public&rdquo;, when in reality there are deeper issues at play, usually around the business model, and these patterns for me begin to really get at the root of the problem, rather than just speculating on the cause.
<p>An example of this has to do with the existence of a handful of management and monetization building blocks, and the absence of others--such as when an API does not have a pricing page, service tiers, or any paid infrastructure, but offers free access to an API. This is amplified when a provider also doesn't provide any clear rate limiting available, resulting in a service you do not want to depend on, because I can guarantee buried in the terms of service is a clause that they can start charging at any moment. The most well known example of this in the wild is Twitter, who despite having Gnip and DataSift, still does not provide clear and scalable pricing options for its developer.
<p>As I continue studying the monetization strategies of APIs, I'll work to establish more patterns that are derived from the presence of, or absence of, specific combinations of monetization building blocks that may tell a larger story. Hopefully I can work to counter much of the BS in the space, and when you hear statements like &ldquo;public APIs are not viable&rdquo;, we can clarify with &ldquo;public APIs who don&rsquo;t have clear business model, and communicate their pricing and rate limits are not viable&rdquo;.

        <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/docker-spreadsheets.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>I wrote a story about a company I&rsquo;m advising for last week called <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/29/now-our-development-environment-is-now-containerized-and-scalable-like-our-production-environment/">Codenvy, who is delivering modular, scalable, cloud development environments using their web IDE and Docker</a>. I'm currently working my way through the spreadsheet to API, and API to spreadsheet solutions I track on, and it is making me think that someone should deliver a <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>-like containerized spreadsheet environment.
<p>With this type of environment you could forever end the emailing of spreadsheets, allowing people to craft spreadsheets, complete with all the data and visualization goodness they desire, and clone, fork, share, and collaborate around these containerized spreadsheets. You could have a library of master planned spreadsheets that your company depends on, and manage user permissions, analytics, and even scalability, performance, and distribution of vital spreadsheets.
<p>Using this platform you could easily spawn spreadsheet driven APis using services like <a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>, and you could come full circle and have spreadsheets that obtain their data directly from valuable API driven resources, to really blow your mind. Personally I'm not a big spreadsheet lover, but I do recognize that it is where a majority of the worlds data resides, and the user interface of choice for many business folk--making it a good candidate for the next generation of containerized API data sources, and clients.
<p>Just another one of my random ideas that accumulate in my Evernote, that I'll never have time to build myself, and hoping you will tackle for me. As I review all of the existing spreadsheet APi solutions available currently, I&rsquo;m sure I'll have more API centric, spreadsheet ideas bubble over t o share with you.

        <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://messente.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/messente-sms-api.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p>I found the DNS implementation over at the Messente SMS API interesting, and worth of sharing for deeper evaluation. I've been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/26/gathering-my-thoughts-around-common-patterns-for-base-urls-across-nearly-700-apis/">considering the various approaches by API providers when crafting their domains, or subdomains for API access</a> heavily over the last couple weeks.
<p>During some research time today I stumbled across the M<a href="https://messente.com/">essente SMS API</a> which opts to provide two domains for making HTTP(S) requests of their API:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>api2.messente.com</li>
<li>api3.messente.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Messente provides a little disclaimer to handle the developer side of manual load-balancing these API calls:
<blockquote><em>These two domains have the same final destination regarding the API functions. In order to ensure that your requests always reach Messente API services, please use one of them as primary and the second one as backup. Both API domains work as equal, but in case of any unexpected downtime with one of them (HTTP 5xx), the other one must be used on client side.</em></blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure this manual approach to providing API endpoints is the optimal path when delivering on the stability of your API, let alone the location of your resources, but it does provide an interesting contrast on the perspectives that are available out there in API-land.
<p>Sometimes I feel like I should rebrand as API Anthropologist, as I find the approach of my fellow API providers more interesting than what I'd expect to find in a mature API landscape. This reflects the importance of showcasing what is going on, to help bridge to where we should be, rather than focusing exclusively on where we should be. (deep shit, man)

<p>When we found this post, it had an informative title, but for the purposes of this guest post we changed the title a little bit, in an effort to make it more desirable, clickable, and shareable by our readers.&nbsp;
<p>This post also had a lot more context when we found it, but for the purposes of this guest post we are going to remove most of that context. We also want to make sure and not cite the author, and potentially provide any unnecessary background--well maybe a Twitter account so people can spew venom at them. All of this goes along way in making sure the article invokes the passion we are looking to generate, which will result in the volume of traffic we desire.

        <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.carvoyant.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/carvoyant/carvoyant-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m digging deeper into my Evernote lately, getting back to those half written stories I have laying around, and next up is about the Carvoyant API sandbox and simulator. I came across their <a href="https://www.carvoyant.com/2014/10/31/free-connectedcar-data-candy-in-the-sandbox/">Free #connectedcar data candy in the Sandbox blog post</a>, and was intrigued by the concept of a simulator, not just for IoT related APIs, but potentially for any API.
<p>Carvoyant provides a free API account which comes with a <a href="https://sandbox-driver.carvoyant.com/">sandbox API for playing with the platform</a>, and a <a href="https://sandbox-auth.carvoyant.com/login/auth">traffic simulator that allows you generate vehicle and trip data</a> for use in developing applications. I can see how a sandbox plus simulator is essential for developing automotive related applications, as you can&rsquo;t be expected to have real car connection and data in all scenarios, something clearly Carvoyant has put a lot of thought, and work into.
<p>Providing an API sandbox plus API simulator seems like it could also be two essential building blocks required for all device based API platforms, aka Internet of Things. This approach would be significant in on boarding new developers, providing them with immediate scenarios they can hack against, to learn about an API, as well as light the fire within their imagination regarding what is possible with the platform's API.
<p>I already have a sandbox as one potential <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building block</a> that API providers should consider. I think I will also add a simulator to the API management building blocks, and keep an eye out for other API simulators in the wild. I know I&rsquo;ve covered <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/24/salesforce-adds-sandbox-templates/">sandbox templates from SaleForce</a> in the past, but usually once I&rsquo;ve seen something in the wild a couple of times, and add it as a formal building block to track on, I immediately tend see more of it out in the space. Have you seen any cool API simulators?

<p>One pattern I'm seeing emerge on some of the API platforms I&rsquo;m watching from week to week are integration pages, showcasing the other 3rd party services than an API has integration with. An integration page is similar to an application showcase, but instead of showing apps build on an API, you are showcasing other platforms that are already integrated with.
<p>A recent one that I&rsquo;ve seen out in the wild is from web development annotation platform <a href="https://usersnap.com">Usersnap</a>, showing the platforms they connect to:
<p><a href="https://usersnap.com/connect"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/usersnap/usersnap-integrations.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>The second I came across was from <a href="http://www.opsgenie.com/">OpsGenie</a>, the alerts and notification platform, showcasing all of the common platform they work with:
<p><a href="http://www.opsgenie.com/integrations"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/opsgenie/opsgenie-integrations.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add an integrations page to my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks for API providers</a> to consider. An integration page can showcase a wide range of integrations that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">introduce reciprocity into platform operations</a>. Integrations could start with using Zapier, but could also be seamless, providing plug and play connectors for users. I would say integrations goes right up to what I call platform development kits (PDK), which would be open source code that developers could use to get up and running on 3rd party platforms.
<p>If you don't have any existing integrations to showcase, I recommend spending some time and figure out the top 5 platforms that would complement the value delivered by your API, and get to work integrating. Existing API integrations are great for stimulating the imagination of developers, as well as provide ready to go solutions for non-developers--either way an integrations page will help onboard new API consumers.

<p>As I write up a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/03/the-expanding-api-universe-more-api-sdk-focused-services-emerge/">story on Magnet</a>, another one of the API SDK service providers to emerge in the space, I can't help but evaluate what other building blocks have the potential to evovolve, and be offered as a specific service. Machine readable API definition formats like <a href="https://bitly.com/1tnYxV8">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a> make services like <a href="https://bit.ly/1qnXcI0">Apimatic</a> and Magnet possible, and I enjoy thinking about other potential services that could be easily generated from definitions in this way.
<p>One possiblity that comes to mind is server side scaffolding, and the possibilities of generating server side scaffolding for your APIs in a variety open source API frameworks, using machine readable definitions. It is difficult to generate 100% of the server side of an API using machine readable API definitions, but you sure can go a long way in auto generating a scaffolding that will get you most of the way there.
<p>I&rsquo;m picturing a whole library of every REST framework known to man (and woman), and the ability to select framework, and upload a machine readable Swagger specification, and the service generates a zip file, or publishes to Github for you. The service would save you the time of going out and finding the latest version of your favorite (or clients) REST framework, and do most of the heavy lifting in setting up, configuring, and crafting API endpoints. Eventually you might think about other ways to distribute, like docker containers on AWS, Google, and even PaaS services like Heroku.
<p>It would be easy to use <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files to find API design patterns, and make those available in a library alongside all of the available REST frameworks. I would build this myself, but I just don't have time, and it isn&rsquo;t an idea I think anyone is going to get rich off of, but I think you could make a good living charging a couple bucks to generate server side API scaffolding, and keep tabs on the latest REST API frameworks.
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep sharing these ideas that are generated from my monitoring of the API space, in hopes some of you take advantage of them, and bring them to life.

        <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/elasticsearch/elastic-search-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a>, the open source, distributed, real-time search and analytics engine just announced that it is introducing a security layer on top of their API driven search platform.  Historically you have to secure any APIs exposed via Elasticsearch through your own proxy or firewall solution, now with "<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/shield">Shield</a>" you can natively manage your APIs directly in Elasticsearch.
<blockquote><em>Shield, in the same spirit of Marvel, is built on top of Elasticsearch public extensions points, and is easily installed as a plugin to add security features to any existing Elasticsearch installation. It does not require a different distribution of Elasticsearch, and relies heavily on the open public APIs Elasticsearch already exposes.</em></blockquote>
<p>The security Elasticsearch is bringing to the table reflects the core features you see in the API space from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.3scale.net/">API infrastructure providers like 3Scale</a>--providing the basics of what you need to secure access to API endpoints:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Role-based Access Control - </strong>Set granular cluster, index, and alias-level permissions for each user of your Elasticsearch cluster. For example, allow the marketing department to freely search and analyze social media data with read-only permissions, while preventing access to sensitive financial data.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication System Support -</strong> Shield integrates with LDAP-based authentication systems as well as Active Directory, so your users don&rsquo;t need to remember yet another password. We also provide a native authentication system, for those who want to manage all access within Elasticsearch.</li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Communications -</strong> Node-to-node encryption protects your data from intruders. With certificate-based SSL/TLS encryption and secure client communications with HTTPS, Shield keeps data traveling over the wire protected.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Logging - </strong>Ensure compliance and keep a pulse on security-related activity happening in your Elasticsearch deployment; record login failures and attempts to access unauthorized information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've had Elasticsearch in the <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">API deployment research project</a> for some time now, but now I will add it to my&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management research as well.</a> If you can manage your API access, user roles, and generate log files for analytics from Elasticsearch API endpoints, the tool is moving squarely into the API management category.
<p>I makes me happy to see open source tools like Elasticsearch improving their security features. Elasticsearch is something I recommend to government agencies to use when looking to open up access to document stores, using APIs. I would like to see more of the API management players working together to allow for interoperability between management platforms, but I&rsquo;m guessing this is a wish I won&rsquo;t get anytime soon.

Magnet has chosen to focus exclusively on mobile SDKs, where Apimatic is focused on web and mobile SDKs.

<p>As the API universe continues its expansion we will see more API services like these emerge who are focused on helping API providers better deliver the building blocks of their API platforms.

        <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://readme.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/readme/readme-io-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
<p>It makes me happy to see new arrivals in the world of API management service providers, especially after all the consolidation we saw last year with many of the 1st and 2nd wave of providers like Mashery, Vordel, Layer7, and Apiphany. One of the new API management providers that have emerged is <a href="https://readme.io/">Readme</a>, who is looking to provide an attractive, simple, and intuitive way to launch developer portals for your APIs.
<p>Readme reminds me of some of the landing page tools designed for web marketers over the last decade, to provide informative gateways for site visitors, but ReadMe is all about providing meaningful doorways to our API resources. First, I like ReadMe's definition of what is a developer hub?
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Topical guides, tutorials and troubleshooting.</li>
<li><strong>API Reference </strong>- Low-level, deep-dive reference material.</li>
<li><strong>Community -</strong> Provide support and answer questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their definition of what is a developer hub is goes beyond just the technical documentation as what many developers see, and acknowledges that your portal should be about providing the resources necessary to educate API consumers, and potentially build community around their needs. ReadMe provides the essential building blocks I'd expect of any modern API portal builder:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Theme Builder </strong>- Easily create a beautiful dev community that matches your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Editor - </strong>Markdown-based drag-and-drop editor makes documentation almost fun.</li>
<li><strong>API Explorer - </strong>Let users play with your API right inside the documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Application Keys - </strong>Your users can view their application keys embedded right in the docs.</li>
<li><strong>Support - </strong>Let users ask questions and request features in the support forums.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then ReadMe goes a little further to include some concepts that I see in some of the leading API providers, features that go beyond just basic features, allowing you to better manage your API portal:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Collaboration -</strong> Crowdsource your docs! Users can keep docs current by suggesting changes.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Sync -</strong> Keep auto-generated reference docs synced with your actual code changes.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning - </strong>Maintaining old or testing beta versions of your docs is a breeze.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2014, emulating the social elements that Github has introduced into the world of coding, in your API program is essential. You cannot manage your entire API community by yourself, and including your developer in the process is essential. This adds relevant layers to the term "open" that everyone likes to use, providing the roots you will need to actually build trust with your developers, in something that goes both ways, and will also grow your own trust of developed within your own API community.

<p>I'm keeping an eye on what ReadMe is up to, alongside the other API management providers I've been tracking on. I haven't give a lot of attention to the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> space in the last year, as I've been focusing on the faster growing areas like API <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, but now that I see new players stepping up, I will make sure and give the area equal attention in my research and monitoring.

        <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2014</span>
        <p>I know. I&rsquo;m kind of a broken record this week, but I&rsquo;m trying to quantify the business model, and monetization strategies of APIs across various industries, and understanding what companies are charging for their services just makes me crazy sometimes. I don&rsquo;t know what people are thinking when they craft their approach to explaining what an API will cost to access.
<p>Here is an example of what I&rsquo;m talking about over at <a href="http://www.stocklytics.com/">Stocklytics</a>. When you land on Stocklytics home page, this is what you see:
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/stocklytics/stockyltics-completely-free.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>After spending some time looking for anything else about pricing, I signed up for the service, and after I logged in to my account I found this page, which then takes me directly to a Paypal page:
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/stocklytics/stocklytics-credit-account.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>Do companies even think about what this does to the on-boarding process? I&rsquo;m not evening focusing on the errors in my brand new developer account that I had to contend with before I discovered the add credits page. At this point, why would use this service? Even if the data is amazing? You just bullshitted me into signing up for your service. There was never a mention of cost until I signed up.
<p>This is one of the things I love about the API space--the dead simple lessons in the value of honesty and transparency. I really don&rsquo;t care how you structure the pricing for API, I&rsquo;ll let developers vote with their usage of your API decide that. What I do care about is how you communicate your pricing. There really isn&rsquo;t any reason to hide your pricing&mdash;just be straight up about it, and I bet you&rsquo;ll do a lot more business as a result.

<p>When you look through as many APIs as I do, you start to get a feeling for many of the subtle signals, that can result in a wealth of information about the actual viability of an API. One signal I'm starting to track on more is pricing, and I'm gathering more details about how an API provider articulates their pricing, or often times doesn&rsquo;t. The way an API provider discusses their business model can tell you so much about their motivations, the amount of resources they have available, and the experience they have in managing APIs and engaging developers.
<p>Pundits in the space love to talk about the viability of public vs private API, and that public APIs just aren't viable, and will be going away soon. When in reality the public vs. private discussion is not the issue, it is lack of business model, and monetization strategy that is the real tell in all of this. Public APIs like Twilio and Amazon do not have a problem, because they have put a lot of thought into their business models, and their pricing is well thought out, competitive, and front and center in their API developer areas--they aren't in danger because they are public?? DOH!
<p>The companies who will be shuttering their API programs often do not have clear pricing on their site, reducing pricing to be simply a question in the FAQ, and something you have to request more information on.  Many companies are trained in sales techniques and are just looking to apply this knowledge in the world of APIs, but I&rsquo;d say for many of the companies I evaluate, hiding or obfuscating your pricing is not about entrenched sales practices, it is more about exploitation at every turn.
<p>As I go through the <a href="http://theapistack.com">700 API companies in my API Stack</a>, I&rsquo;m tracking on the details of their business model, and will be judging APIs on how they showcase their pricing (or don't). I don't care if companies are still working to figure it out, or have top tiers that are &ldquo;enterprise pricing&rdquo;, and &ldquo;request more details&rdquo;. What I do care about is how communicative you are about your pricing, and enforcing that the pricing for API resources is one of the most important signals you can send as part of your API management strategy.
<p>Remember, when you use Twitter as and example of how public APIs aren&rsquo;t viable, you are actually referencing the lack of a coherent business model that fully includes the developer ecosystem, and has nothing to do with the viability of public APIs. Public APIs are here to stay, but the smoke and mirrors of &ldquo;enterprise pricing&rdquo; will have to evolve if you expect to play in this new game, and actually get the attention of developers.
<p><em>P.S. The magic wand is my new icon for "enterprise pricing", because I see the term being used as a magic wand for making up pricing, more than I see it used as viable sales cycles. I searched for images of pulling pricing out of your ass, but it didn't result in family friendly images I can show here, so I'm using a magic wand.</em>

<p>I'm just going to keep putting my ideas out there, so that y'all will build what is needed for the API space. In support of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">API design tool</a>, and my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/someone-please-build-my-open-interactive-portable-and-visual-api-documentation-toolkit/">interactive API documentation tool</a>, I want a <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> generated visualization layer for APIs, using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js.</a>
<p>I&rsquo;m envisioning a whole marketplace of visualizations I can choose from, driven from various popular APIs like Twitter, Crunchbase, OpenCorporates, and much more. There are number of proprietary data visualizations tools emerging out there (I&rsquo;m watching you), but what I'm looking for is specifically an open solution using D3.js.
<p>I don't have a problem if there are premium layers, and features that are driven by commercial APIs, or there being added charges for API consumption in general, but I want the visualization, and underlying JSON to be open and configurable&mdash;encouraging access and re-use.
<p>It can be tough to help people understand just exactly what an API is, and I feel like an open visualization layer using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, driven from <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> would be one of the quickest ways to help people understand exactly what value an API can deliver.

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-dictionary.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m going through each of the 100+ business sectors I track on as part of my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>. As I make my way through each sector, and generate <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files, the language of the resources used across a particular sector starts to come into focus. I&rsquo;m talking about the words used for crafting URLs, parameters, and the underlying data models for common APIs.
<p>In a perfect world everyone would come together and use something like <a href="https://schema.org">Schema.org</a>, and work to extend, in an organized, collaborative way across different industries&mdash;I would call this the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) approach. Unfortunately what we have is a shitload of dialects popping up, driven from the dark depths of our legacy IT infrastructure, only seeing the light of day when an API gets exposed, and the dialect used by an isolated IT tribe all of a sudden becomes part of the mainstream world.
<p>Some weeks my inbox seems to reflect where my research is going, and as I ponder the language used by popular news sites like NYTimes, USA Today, and NewsCred, I get an email from a reader in Europe, who works at the equivalent of BBC their country, who asks:
<blockquote><em>Currently I'm thinking about the API vocabulary and i wonder if there is some kind of standard out there when it comes to the verbs, parameters, etc. that are used for Media/Broadcaster API`s. I think there should be some kind of standard (used by netflix, bbc, espn, abc, etc..) Do you have any idea if there is such a standard?</em></blockquote>
<p>If there is a schema.org for the broadcasting industry I&rsquo;m unaware of it. As I generate a crude dictionary for each of my API Stack business sectors I will stop, and conduct some due diligence on what is already out there for each industry regarding standards, etc. I&rsquo;m assuming if there is, it won't always be Internet ready, let alone API ready, but hopefully there is already something that is driven by the industry that can provide a starting point.
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the need for a common dictionary, when it comes to API design, in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">my thoughts on a perfect API design editor</a>. I will work to publish any dictionaries that I aggregate, as they come into focus. As with much of the API space I suspect that dictionaries will be defined from bottom up, using common slang used in the space, as opposed to a top down from coordinated OED approach, but hopefully by aggregating and educating API designers we can make strides towards a more coherent API space in some of the business sectors currently being impacted by APIs.

<p>Throughout 2014, when I look at the top 10 posts in my Google Analytics dashboard each month, there has been a consistent theme of what stories are driving page views. The concept of a page is only one metric I look at when evaluating where the API space might be going, and while I don&rsquo;t write stories specifically to page views, they do provide me with a general barometer of what my readers are interested in.
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing give areas consistently generating the most views across the API Evangelist Network:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal APIs - </strong>This slot is pretty much dominated by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret To Amazons Success Is Internal</a> story getting thousands of page view each month, even with being written back in January of 2012.</li>
<li><strong>Single Page App Tooling - </strong>Simple, easy to use formable single page apps like my <a href="http://csv-converter.publicprivatesector.org/">CSV Converter</a>, and my <a href="http://data.ongithub.com/">Data.Ongithub.com</a> produce some really long lasting traffic, providing value to users.</li>
<li><strong>API Design - </strong>This is definitely the topic of 2014, with all of my stories talking about <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> tools like Swagger and API Blueprint dominating the top 10.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia - </strong>Its time has come in 2014, and hypermedia stories like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">What Are Some Examples of Hypermedia APIs</a> are popular with developers, and non-developers when it comes to understand what hypermedia is all about.</li>
<li><strong>API Roundups -</strong> A pretty proven formula of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/26/payment-apis-that-i-am-watching/">rounding up listings of APIs for a specific purpose</a>, the only difference is when I do it, I personally look at each API and make sure there is something there, defining what I consider to be <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com">API stacks or collections.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll revisit this at the end of the year and see if it still stands up. For me it provides some sort of map of where my readers heads are at, and by no means is any measurement of where the API space is going, but is at least a place to start thinking about what is on people&rsquo;s mind.
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t spend much time looking at metrics across my platform, but I see a lot of interesting trends, and I like being a transparent layer for the API space, so I think i will try to better track on some patterns I&rsquo;m seeing in my own network, as well as across the space, and share as stories here on the blog.

<p>I was taking a look through the <a href="http://www.newscred.com/developer/docs">NewsCred API</a> yesterday and there was a parameter I have seen before, but find interesting, and wanted to share with you. It was a field called query_fields, which you could include the fields you wished to have searched, using a keyword provided in the parameter &ldquo;q&rdquo;.
<p>You often see a parameter which determines which fields I get back with my response, but I like the concept of have a parameter to choose which fields I want searched in the first place. I think it is a simple, parameter based way to give developers more control over their API calls, in a way that will make sense to a wide audience.
<p>Now I need to figure out a way to aggregate these simple little <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> tricks and make them available to readers when they are designing their APIs. My goal is to help API designers make their APIs as powerful as possible, while keeping the surface area as simple as possible along the way.

<p>The production environment for delivering web and mobile applications has radically evolved in the last couple years, becoming more distributed, scalable, virtualized, and containerized. APIs, and new development frameworks are providing a smorgasbord of resources for developers to put to work, and devops is putting more power and control, throughout the development life cycle, directly into a developers hands. It is time that a developers environment evolves to keep pace with the environment developers are building applications for.
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">containerization in the API space</a>&nbsp;for a while now, something that is still a very manual process, so I have been looking out  for a potential development environment that matches my vision for orchestration with APIs for some time now. This is why I was stoked when I ran into Tyler Jewell (<a href="https://twitter.com/TylerJewell">@TylerJewell</a>) back in September, who introduced me to <a href="http://codenvy.co">Codenvy</a>&mdash;"a new SaaS developer environment that allows developers to create hosted environments optimized for creating, editing, compiling, testing and debugging applications authored in different programming languages&rdquo;.
<p><a href="http://codenvy.com"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/codenvy/codenvy-api-ide-screenshot.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>At first glance Codenvy appears to be just another web-based IDE, with autocomplete, data source management, and Github integration. As you play with more you begin to realize you can configure and share projects, allowing you to setup environments, share and even clone them. Then you realize the whole IDE is configurable, clone-able, shareable, and scalable using the ever popular Docker, complete with API or CLI access to all work spaces, projects and files. This is the environment I was looking for&mdash;this is the orchestration I envision for building applications using APIs.
<p>My head is swimming with ideas of how I can orchestrate application development environments now that both the development and production environments are containerized, scalable, bite-size goodness, complete with a Github layer in the middle. While many users of Codenvy will be using to manage their own devop workflow, I will be pursuing it to manage my own infrastructure, but more importantly using it as a platform to craft <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">custom API stacks</a>, share and publish publicly, and explore more opportunities around being an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a>.

<p>Another layer to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/29/now-our-development-environment-is-now-containerized-and-scalable-like-our-production-environment/">release of Codenvy this week</a>, was the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20141027_cloud_initiative.php">announcement of the Eclipse project Che</a>, an open source "project to create a platform for SAAS developer environment that contains all of the tools, infrastructure, and processes necessary for a developer to edit, build, test, and debug an application&rdquo;.  Che represents the next generation IDE that runs in the cloud, which coincides with other signs I've seen around <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> moving into the IDE with signals from API pioneers like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-with-the-developers-ide/">SalesForce&nbsp;and Google</a>, or from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-delivers-relevant-api-code/">Microsoft in Visual Studio</a>.
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning about Che, but I&rsquo;m beginning to see two distinct ways Che and APIs can be employed. First lets start with the environment:
<blockquote><em>You can build extensions for Che, and when those extensions are compiled into the kernel, Che creates server-side microservices, a RESTful API, and cross-browser optimized JavaScript, which is then pluggable into a browser IDE. With Che, developers are given the pluggable structure of Eclipse, but accessible through a cloud environment.</em></blockquote>
<p>This means you can orchestrate development workflows, with APIs. You can predefine, deploy, customize, maintain and orchestrate very modular development environment where everything can be controlled via API. What a perfect environment for orchestrating the next generation of application development.
<p>Next I see APIs leading the development lifecycle as well, not just defining the development environment and process. Earlier stories I&rsquo;ve done on API discovery via SDKs, showcase SaleForce and Google providing native discovery of their APIs directly in Eclipse. In an Eclipse Che driven development environment, you could define pre-built, or custom API stacks, bringing exactly the API resources developers will need and bake them directly into their IDE&mdash;meaning APIs find the developers, developers don&rsquo;t have to find their own APIs.
<p>This approach to API discovery via the IDE provides some various interesting opportunity for marrying with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">earlier thoughts I&rsquo;ve had around being an API broker</a>. I can envision a future where API evangelism evolves to a point where you don&rsquo;t just represent one API, you can represent many APIs, and configure API fueled developer environments for building any type of application. Think of what <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/companies.html">Backend as a Service (BaaS) providers like Parse and Kinvey</a> have been doing since 2011, but now think of pre-configured, or custom tailored IDE environments with exactly the resources you need.
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting started with <a href="http://docs.codenvy.com/che/">Che</a>, and <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>, so it will take me a while to work through my thoughts on using it as an API brokerage platform. The one thing you can count on me for, is that I will tell stories all along the way as I figure it out.

        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-experience-design.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>I really love the thought process around API design, and I am always looking for ways to push forward my craft. Telling stories is one way I do this, forcing me to make what I&rsquo;m doing understandable to a wider audience, which is also the exact thing I&rsquo;m trying to do with my API designs&mdash;mind blown!
<p>An example of this in action is with my link API, which I use in multiple places across my API monitoring system. The Link API has a pretty basic design, that reflect the resource, and its underlying database structure:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/link/ (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)</li>
<li>Title, Description, and URL</li>
</ul>
<p>I use this API in numerous ways, the original API design is very much based upon the resource that it is, a link. As a developer who understands REST, and very much comes from a world of databases, this works just fine. However much of the magic around my usage of links is defined in my code, and not in my API interface, something I&rsquo;d like to change.
<p>After having two separate conversations with folks about my link API, I experienced two very different motivations on using said link system, and came with very different perspectives on how to use mu ink API, that had nothing to do with the database or resource this API was born from.
<p><strong>Archival Motivations</strong> <br />One person I discussed my link API with wants to use it for archiving a link. When they pass the link to an API, if it isn't already recorded it logs the URL, and then grabs a screenshot of the page, as well as stores any HTML content present. This could be a one time archive, or they could also pass a parameter that would set up a daily, weekly or monthly archive to occur.
<p><strong>Harvesting Desires <br /></strong>The second person I discussed my link API with wants to use for harvesting of specific things from the page, and in this particular conversation it was to harvest all other links available on the page. You would pass the URL to the API, and get back a list of URLs available on the page. The only setting was to filter and return only URLs that contained the base URL of the URL being passed to the API (mouthful of URL).
<p><strong>Pushing My Resources To Deliver Experiences </strong><br />This story reflects why I feel that companies should hurry up and begin their API journey, so they can begin moving beyond just APIs designed based upon the resources as they exist, to more of an experience based focus, designing APIs that deliver &nbsp;the solutions that people desire. Both of these folks I talked to were not programmers, and only understand APIs enough to be dangerous. They understand the basic CRUD abilities I gave with my resource design, but it doesn't excite them or really mean anything. What really motivates them was satisfying a specific need that fits in with their experiences.
<p>I&rsquo;m still working on what this new set of APIs will look like based upon these thoughts, but I wanted to tell the story of this slight shift in my API design thinking. It is extremely difficult to see API design this way unless you are actively on your API journey, having discussions with people who want to use your APIs. It is easy for us developers to get caught up in perfectly defining our API resources from the technical perspective, when in reality the most important part of the journey seems to me is all about learning to craft APIs that deliver meaningful experiences, not serving up just services&mdash;experience oriented architecture over service oriented architecture.

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">benefits of APIs over download of data stores</a> in the government space, and I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for other interesting examples of making data available via an API, as well as a full data download. I&rsquo;m doing a lot of research right now on the financial API space, and <a href="http://blog.quandl.com/blog/quandls-first-premium-databases/">stumbled across Quandl</a>, a data provider who has free access financial data APIs, while also selling access to premium databases.
<p>Quandl has <a href="http://blog.quandl.com/blog/quandls-first-premium-databases/">aggregated 7 financial and economic databases into one database solution that you can pay to download</a>, or you can freely access via their unlimited use API--Quandl puts it like this:
<blockquote><em>All these new premium databases will of course automatically benefit from Quandl&rsquo;s free data-usage features: unrestricted API access, integration with 20+ libraries and tools, unlimited downloads in any format, multiple export and visualization options, and more. (Needless to say, the addition of these premium databases to Quandl will not change the &ldquo;free Quandl experience&rdquo; in any way. All data and all features that are currently available for free on Quandl, will remain free forever.)</em></blockquote>
<p>It is an interesting approach to monetizing database assets, while also making freely available via an API. I&rsquo;m not exactly clear on what you get in database vs. the API with Quandl, but now that I have the &ldquo;building block&rdquo; identified, I will keep an eye out for other API providers who are doing similar things. Right now I&rsquo;m just looking at financial, banking, payment, and other commerce APIs, but I&rsquo;m sure there are other data providers doing similar things.

        <p><a href="https://blog.snapchat.com/post/99998266095/third-party-applications-and-the-snapchat-api"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/snapchat/snapchat-logo-transparent.png" alt="" width="220" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had several browser tabs open around the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/14/us-snapchat-future-security-idUSKCN0I32UJ20141014">recent Snapchat security breach</a>, hoping to craft an API-centric story around the whole affair. I think <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/apis/readyapi/security-lessons-courtesy-of-snapchat/">SmartBear covers the security lesson around the Snapchat breach well</a>, my motivation in writing a story would be more about incentivizing popular mobile platforms like Snapchat to establish a robust approach to APIs, and provide a platform for everyone discuss the tech, business, and politics of application integration, rather than keeping it all in the dark.
<p><strong>Your Application Programming Interface Surface Is Publicly Available</strong><br /> As I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/07/mapping-the-world-of-internal-apis-via-rogue-api-registry/">play with tools like Charles</a>, <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>, <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">API tools</a>, and other proxy and application traffic management tools, I can easily map out the surface area of any iPhone application I have installed&mdash;providing me with a blueprint of an API, and potentially its underlying data model. If I can do this for your mobile app, you have a public API, regardless of how you view the world.
<p><strong>Bring More Awareness, Control, Security, And Stability To Platform</strong><br /> The benefits of have a public API approach to delivering a public mobile application gives you a new layer to understand how not just your mobile app is using resources, it gives you a central channel for al mobile, web, and Internet of Things apps to use. An API focus gives you a central point to log how resources are being access and put to use, introduce analytics, monitoring, and other vital security components into operations. There are a wealth of API management services available on the Internet, and having an API management strategy can open up a company to a wealth of vital resources across an application's lifecycle.
<p><strong>Legitimize 3rd Party Developers With A Modern API Platform</strong><br /> The 3rd party developer who was responsible for the latest Snapchat breach was not given official access to Snapchat APIs, because there is not formal API program. If there was a Snapchat API platform program, users could request access, and the platform could still deny acess to anyone they wished, and all applications would have to adhere to a standardized approach to dealing with identity, and access management for all resources. With a modern approach to API management, developers can be legitimized, while also providing a more secure perimeter to keep rogue applications from gaining access, and compromising privacy and security.
<p><strong>Empower End-Users With Identity And Access Control (oAuth)</strong><br /> If you have a public mobile app available today, you owe it to your end-users to provide them with the latest in account management, and tools for managing who has access to their data. If you need a model for where the bar should be set, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/06/05/google-accounts-as-blueprint-for-all-software-as-a-service-applications/">go look at what Google does</a>. Modern approaches to API management, along with a common approach to using oAuth, provides the tools all mobile application users should have, allowing them to help contribute to their own security.  End-users need to be aware that they should only use mobile applications that provide API access, and oAuth controls, allowing them to take control over their digital footprint, and play an active role.
<p>APIs are not a cure-all. I'm not prescribing APIs because they fix everything. I&rsquo;m prescribing APIs because it provides a layer where a platform, its users, 3rd party developers, and the public can come together and make sure any platform is seriously addressing security and privacy. APIs aren't just about innovation and all that bullshit you hear from us in Silicon Valley, they are about providing the access, and tools necessary to strike a balance in providing remote access (aka mobile) to wide variety of partners, 3rd party developers, all in support of end-users.
<p><a href="https://blog.snapchat.com/post/99998266095/third-party-applications-and-the-snapchat-api">Snapchat issued a response to all the API discussion on their blog</a>:
<blockquote><em>It takes time and a lot of resources to build an open and trustworthy third-party application ecosystem. That&rsquo;s why we haven&rsquo;t provided a public API to developers and why we prohibit access to the private API we use to provide our service. Don't get us wrong - we're excited by the interest in developing for the Snapchat platform - but we're going to take our time to get it right. Until then, that means any application that isn't ours but claims to offer Snapchat services violates our Terms of Use and can&rsquo;t be trusted.</em></blockquote>
<p>It does take time to build an open and trustworthy third-party application ecosystem, but with the proven blueprints already in existence, and a growing number of API service providers, it doesn't take a lot of resource. What Snapchat and other mobile providers lack is a healthy awareness of not just the tech of APIs, but also the critical business and political aspects of API operations, and just putting their head in the sand and pretending like these issues do not exist.
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/services/api-management.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>If you have a publicly available mobile application, you have a publicly available API, and you should possess a modern API management strategy to protect the privacy and security of your end-users. How open you make access to this API is up to you, but I encourage you to make it as open as possible, providing transparency into security, and platform operations.  I don't feel like this is something state or federal government should be enforcing, but is something that should be the acceptable approach to delivering public applications, something that is enforced by end-users be educated about avoiding web and mobile applications that do not have an API, and this transparent approach, demonstrating they have each users privacy and security in mind.
<p>What has happened to Snapchat will continue to happen to other companies, with an increased frequency. You can greatly mitigate the risks of having a public web or mobile application, with a formal API strategy, and <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/apis/readyapi/security-lessons-courtesy-of-snapchat/">listening to security advice from providers like SmartBear</a>, as well as protecting the interests of your end-users.  If you do not have the expertise on staff at your company or organization, let me know, I can help point you in the right direction to find the resources you will need.

        <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-stack/api-stack-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I just finished going through my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and recording some information about each of the providers in my API monitoring system. When I started looking through my stack a couple days ago there was 830 companies listed, and after this pass through I carved the stack down to 690--why?
<p><strong>APIs Go Away</strong><br /> It is a fact of life, APIs go away. I'm always amazed at how quickly an API will disappear or just fall into disrepair. I don&rsquo;t have time to assess what exactly has happened to all APIs, but if I get 404s, or can't find signs of an API program in 10 seconds, and a quick Google search, I pull them from the stack. I've noticed many start-ups seem to be coming out with a slick mobile app + API, and then a few months later the API seems to disappear. I'll start tracking on things better, and see if I can&rsquo;t produce some better examples to discuss this in the future.
<p><strong>Raising The Bar</strong><br /> As I look at hundreds of APIs, and try to get familiar with them, I can't help but get frustrated by certain things, something that inevitably raises the bar of what I include in my API stack, all along the way. Sometimes I'll notice an API is actually a SOAP web service, or after playing with I find it very difficult to navigate, on-board, and actually put to use. Whatever the reasons I will remove some companies from the stack, and while I will still be keeping an eye on what they are doing (or not doing), the API is not something I'm looking to shine a light on as part of my stack.
<p><strong>Hiding The Docs</strong><br /> One thing I feel like I keep coming across as I look through APIs, are companies pulling back their API documentation. As with APIs going away, I don't always have details about what types of documentation were available historically (something that is changing), so it is hard to tell if an API had docs, then moved them behind a password protected area. Regardless, if I can&rsquo;t learn about an API, without registering for yet another account, you aren't in the stack. I will not be requesting access, signing up for, or begging you for the opportunity to learn about, and showcase your API.
<p><strong>API Is A Priority</strong><br /> Your API is not a &ldquo;support entry&rdquo;, or &ldquo;advanced feature&rdquo;. Your API is the next step in the evolution of your companies online presence. While I may still showcase some seemingly dysfunctional APIs, usually there is other value present there, otherwise I wouldn't be highlighting a company's effort. If your API is buried deep within your CMS, or barely a footnote in your online presence, it is likely I won't be talking about it. You can tell sites where APIs are a priority, because they have portals available at http://developer.example.com, modern API documentation, simple sub-domains like http://api.example.com for their APIs, and a link to APIs in the header or footer navigation for a site.
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my API Stack will grow and shrink over time, and new APIs will come, and others will mature and be put back into the stack. Right now <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack is just a list of 690 companies doing interesting things with APIs</a>, and some basic details, with links to their efforts. I&rsquo;m working to better defining the over 100 business categories these companies exist in, as well as better define each API resource they possess, and I'm looking to continue providing a better defined API stack.
<p>In 2014 when it comes to APIs I&rdquo;m a little more focused on quality, than quantity.

        <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-puzzly-square.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I just finished going through <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a>, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and looking for one simple thing&mdash;the base URL for each of their APIs. Throughout the process I looked at almost 700 API developer areas, trying to find the base URL they are using to serve up some of the most valuable API resources publicly available on the web.
<p><strong>Accepting The Madness</strong><br /> When you look at 700 APIs, you have to wade through a lot of madness. When I'm looking at APIs, I&rsquo;m looking for more than just a perfectly designed API from a technical perspective, I&rsquo;m interested in value, presentation, and other more meaningful aspects. Often times I will overlook your base URL, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop me from taking note of some of the crazy domains, and subdomains people are using to provide access to their API resources.
<p><strong>Strong Patterns For Base URL</strong><br /> Once you wade through the madness, and start looking for the strongest patterns for base URLs applied across the API space, it is easy to see that two of the most common approaches are:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>api.example.com -</strong> Pretty simple, common, and current approach to pointing a subdomain to a company&rsquo;s API resources.</li>
<li><strong>example.com/api -</strong> When you don&rsquo;t have control over setting up subdomains, a simple API folder is next in line.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subdomain for a company&rsquo;s API effort says a lot. When you do not put much thought into the path for your API program, it demonstrates that you will probably not put a lot into your overall API effort. A subdomain may not seem like much on the surface, but it consistently provides a barometer for other things that are going on, as I wade through these APIs.
<p>Another thing I'm consistently seeing, is that many API providers assume that API consumers will understand the the API is available at the root domain, and referencing /api/v1/ as a root, without directly stating the base URL is http://example.com/api/v1/. It is not a punishable offense, but something that reflects the short-sighted, siloed world that many API providers operate within.
<p><strong>A Distributed, Programmable Web</strong><br /> After identifying the strongest patterns for base URLs, the next layer of domain usage, that I found interesting, was the use of account or user based, network, and geographic based subdomain API access:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>[user].example.com -</strong> A dynamic subdomain based upon a users account, allowing for API access centered around a user&rsquo;s platform account.</li>
<li><strong>[network].example.com -</strong> A select group of network, and CDN locations. Sometimes they were based upon AWS regions like east and west coast, and other times just providing DNS redundancy with know clear geographic intent.</li>
<li><strong>[geo].example.com -</strong> Other times you would clarity in assigning API domains based upon geographic regions like US, UK, and German specific locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have three motivations in telling this story, 1) for my own education, 2) encourage more consistent patterns amongst API providers, and 3) work to understand where things might be going. I think the use of a user account, network, and geographic centered URL for your API, tells something about where things might be headed. I think that your API access will be tailored just for you by delivering virtualized containers, just for your account (you can pay for more performance), that may run on specific networks, and in specific geographic regions, as the API world move forward.
<p>As I struggle to deal with the madness I'm finding across base URLs for APis, and enjoying it greatly when I come across more standard approaches, but what is really interesting me is trying to better understand how we are going to scale all of this to better meet the needs of developers, end-users, and keep pace with changes like we are seeing with the Internet of Things. How do we keep things up and running, stable, while also meeting the terms or service of online platforms, ensure security across numerous 3rd party developers, while also keeping the privacy and interests of end-users in mind?
<p>In the future I can see terms of service (TOS) negotiations at the API level for each user, support in their personal needs, and keep API traffic isolated in a particular region, or via a particular network base upon a countries laws, all the way to delivering on an individual citizens wishes. For now, all I can do is try to understand what is going on, and hope for a future where this type of scalability, regionalization, and interoperability is truly a reality.

<p>I am tracking on around 2500 companies who are doing interesting things in the API space. Out of these companies about 1000 of them have blogs, which for me is a pretty important signal. About 1/4 of these companies with blogs, do not have an RSS feed, which in 2014 seems a little odd to me, but maybe I'm an old timer.
<p>I believe that a blog is one of the most important signals, any API provider come put out, right alongside Twitter and Github. Historically I depend on the Twitter account for these RSS-less blogs, but now I'm taking a different path, and using <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com">Kimono Labs</a> to fill in the gap.
<p>Using the Kimono Labs Chrome extension, I just visit the main blog page for one of these companies, and select the title of the first blog post. Kimono gives me the ability to name this field, which I usually just call &ldquo;title&rdquo;. Since the title is a link, Kimono also associates the link to the blog post, along with each title. You could also highlight the summary text, but I don&rsquo;t need this, as I have secondary processes that runs and pulls the full content of a blog post, as well as the timestamp, author, and taking of a screenshot.
<p>Within a couple of seconds, using Kimono Labs, I now have an API for each companies blog, assuming the role RSS would normally play. When I have time each week, I will generate an API for the most important companies I'm tracking on. Maybe someday I will close the entire blog syndication gap for the companies I track on, but for now its nice to be able to tackle the most high value companies, and know that I have a viable solution to the problem with <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com">Kimono Labs</a>.

<p>I wrote about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">visual API documentation</a> a few months back, after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">I looked at the approach from OpenFDA</a>, and now after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/dwolla-using-slate-for-an-evolved-api-documentation-experience/">taking a look at the value Slate brings to API providers like Dwolla</a>, these feelings are re-surfacing in my mind. Since I have limited time, I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at putting my ideas out there, allowing anyone to step up and execute on opportunities I&rsquo;m seeing across the API space&mdash;I just do not need the extra work.
<p>I love me some <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>, as you can tell from the fact that all of my APIs use <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger as the API definition format</a>, as well Swagger UI for the interactive documentation. I&rsquo;m pretty convinced of the importance of documentation being a hands-on experience, but after looking at approaches like OpenFDA, and Dwolla with their Slate driven API docs, I&rsquo;m convinced they should also be more beautiful and functional.
<p>Let me explain what I would like to see developed for the API space:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Definition Core -</strong> As we are beginning to see across the space with current interactive API documentation practices, everything needs to be driven by a machine readable API definition, providing a set of instructions for how any user will engage with an API.</li>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/fda/open-fda-endpoint-visualization.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<li><strong>Interactive - </strong>In 2014 the bar is already set, and API documentation should be interactive, allowing users to make live calls to a demo, or production API, making learning about an API hands-on experience. </li>
<li><strong>Inline Code - </strong>The tools are available to generate code samples from Swagger and API Blueprint, and wherever we make an API call, we should also be able see the code for making the call inline, side-by-side with wherever I am engaging with the API&mdash;in my language of choice please!</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations -</strong> I don&rsquo;t want just to get back a response from the API, I want to be able to visualize the value returned from an API. I would like a suite of <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js visualizations</a> for each API endpoint I&rsquo;m interacting with, allowing me to immediately see the value generated by each API.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet - </strong>Allow me to export a CSV, or more robust Excel or Google Spreadsheet representation of an API. Sure, this would not be applicable to all APIs, but would bring a lot of value to many APIs out there. APIs aren&rsquo;t just for developers in 2014. Oh, and make me the D3.js code for any visualization too copy &amp; paste as well.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable - </strong>I enjoy being able to deploy my Swagger UI to any Github repository using Github Pages, and I think portability is essential for the success of API engagement. I want to be able to copy &amp; paste API expressions, visualizations, and other simple, easy to use widgets to any site, anywhere&mdash;no coding experience necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source -</strong> If you are building something like what I&rsquo;m describing, it really should be open source so that all aspects of it can be reused, by anyone, anywhere. It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to be a proprietary, closed solution, and you if are building something in this way you owe me <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$1 million dollars</span> for my ideas. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/slate/slate-tripit.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>API docs have become much more than just API documentation, they have become about API discovery, education, expression, collaborations, and interactions, going way beyond just our grandfathers way of documenting an API.  We have the language (Swagger &amp; API Blueprint) to describe our APIs, lets begin providing more meaningful ways to engage with them as well.
<p>If you would like to, or are already building any of these features I&rsquo;m laying out, feel free to connect with me, and I'm happy to provide feedback anywhere during the design, development, and implementation&mdash;just let me know what you need.
<p>I know I&rsquo;m a demanding bitch in the API space, expecting people to do this work for me, but the space needs it. Thanks for building it! ;-)

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://docs.dwolla.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/dwolla/dwolla-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm liking the new&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.dwolla.com">Dwolla's new API docs</a>&nbsp;that they just launched. They are using an <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">open source API documentation framework called Slate</a>, developed by <a href="https://www.tripit.com">Tripit</a>, for their own API documentation.&nbsp;
<p>I enjoy seeing the different directions that providers take with their API docs.  Slate's approach is a different path than we've been seeing with interactive docs using frameworks like <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, but provides a very intuitive, elegant documentation experience which includes code samples tailored to each API endpoint.
<p>Here are the features Slate lists on the Github repository for the project:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Clean, Intuitive Design - T</strong>he description of your API is on the left side of your documentation, and all the code examples are on the right side. Inspired by Stripe's and Paypal's API docs. Slate is responsive, so it looks great on tablets, phones, and even print.</li>
<li><strong>Everything On A Single Page - </strong>Gone are the days where your users had to search through a million pages to find what they wanted. Slate puts the entire documentation on a single page. We haven't sacrificed link-ability, though. As you scroll, your browser's hash will update to the nearest header, so linking to a particular point in the documentation is still natural and easy.</li>
<li><strong>Slate Is Just Markdown - </strong>When you write docs with Slate, you're just writing Markdown, which makes it simple to edit and understand. Everything is written in Markdown &mdash; even the code samples are just Markdown code blocks!</li>
<li><strong>Write Code Samples In Multiple Languages &mdash;</strong>&nbsp;If your API has bindings in multiple programming languages, you easily put in tabs to switch between them. In your document, you'll distinguish different languages by specifying the language name at the top of each code block, just like with Github Flavored Markdown!</li>
</ul>
<p>Slate provides some pretty interesting tools for any API documentation toolbox. I also really like that they are Github-centric, acknowledging that many API providers will use Github Pages when deploying their docs, adding that <em>"Not only does this mean you get free hosting for your docs with Github Pages, but it also makes it's simple for other developers to make pull requests to your docs if they find typos or other problems.&rdquo; - s</em>omething I thoroughly enjoy across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>.
<p><a href="https://docs.dwolla.com"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/dwolla/dwolla-api-docs.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>It looks like to me (maybe I&rsquo;m wrong) that the code samples are hand written? Something that could easily be remedied using Swagger. It would be way cool to see a Swagger and API Blueprint generated version of Slate emerge&mdash;merging the Slate experience, with the interactive documentation experience we&rsquo;ve seen evolve over the last couple years. This way your docs would be elegant, interactive, and very utilitarian with the inline code samples.&nbsp;
<p>Nice job <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>!

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/consistent-api-program-domains.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>I know that some of my readers are URI experts, URL ninjas, and masters of the domain, but most of my readers are not, and I wanted to share some of the 100K view of what I see across the world of domains, in the API space. I&rsquo;m going through my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a> over the last couple days (continuing this weekend), looking at 800+ companies who have APIs, and after going through roughly half, I&rsquo;m seeing some seriously crazy practices for crafting URIs for APIs programs.
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the general path to your developer program, I highly recommend providing a simple subdomain, providing access to your APIs &nbsp;in a simple, consistent path like http://developer.example.com--at the very least put it in a consistent folder like http://example.com/developers. When you put your API into your http://example.com/help/bullshit-cms-system/@$~!$(bullshit-guid$#(@)/developer/ location, it really just sends a signal that your API is just a support feature, and something that is&rsquo;t getting the resources it will need for success.
<p>When it comes to identity and access management for your APIs, I recommend working from your root using http://example.com/oauth for authentication and discovering of your APIs. After that I recommend taking a similar approach to the developer program, and use http://api.example.com or http://example.com/api. It really sucks to have to guess the baseURL for any API, and if I have to download your SDK to figure out the baseURL, I may skip using your API all together. I&rsquo;m stilling processing thoughts around the dynamic API subdomains like http://accountname.example.com, giving users a custom base URL for API access.
<p>Whatever you choose when configuring a domain for your API efforts, I probably don&rsquo;t need to see /rest/, /tcp/, or /http/ in the URL structure. I&rsquo;m hoping your API resources are these things, you should not have to declare it. When designing your API resources, work hard to think about the core resources, and how they will be used, not necessarily how they are being transported.
<p>I will get a lot of hate from my linked data friends, restafarian cool iya's, and hypermedia homies, about my simplicity and possible errors, but my goal is to just move things forward, and not necessarily convince everyone of exactly the right way of doing things. I find that taking a pragmatic tone, providing a 100K view of what others are doing across the space, is the most effective way to influence change at a macro level.
<p>If I was highlight an particular implementation I would point to Dwolla. The Dwolla developer program is pretty simple, and consistent. You can get at the developer program at <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">https://developers.dwolla.com/</a>, API documentation at <a href="https://docs.dwolla.com/">https://docs.dwolla.com/</a>, a blog at <a href="http://blog.dwolla.com/">http://blog.dwolla.com/</a>, and support at <a href="http://help.dwolla.com/">http://help.dwolla.com/</a>. You authenticate, and access the Dwolla API at <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/">https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/</a>, and can do the same for a sandbox environment at <a href="https://uat.dwolla.com/oauth/">https://uat.dwolla.com/oauth/</a>.
<p>If I had to emphasize anything, I would say that consistency is the most  important thing when crafting domains for your API program, and emphasis on the fact that your API effort is a priority, not just some sort of whacky side project ran by a single employee. (oh shit, maybe most are?) Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it is fine that your developer API program is run by one crazy person in a company (I fully support this), but you can at least put some work into looking like you are organized, and sane.
<p>This goal of this post is to focus on configuring a sensible base URL for your public API surface, and isn&rsquo;t about how you should craft the path to resources you are making available. In a perfect world every domain would allow /auth from the root, and employ hypermedia across all API design, but in the world we have I think just getting folks to use simple, and consistent base URLs for key areas of public API efforts, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">considerign of the usage of a APIs.json file in the root of your domain</a>,&nbsp;can be a healthy place to start when it comes to API discovery.

        <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-consuming.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>APIs came in to existence to satisfy a demand for access to valuable content, data and resources, and the more APis that are developed, the more the appetite for API consumption has grown. APIs enable website, web and mobile applications to build applications, using resources that were completely out of reach in even the recent past. Some API resources, like a simple city look-up by postal code, might be simple enough that a developer could recreate, but other resources such as global satellite imagery is something the average developer does not have the resources, or the time to create&mdash;the more API resources available, the cooler the apps we build,  and the more we hunger for valuable API resources grows.
<p><strong>Starts with a Need</strong><br /> API consumers rarely want to use an API, just to learn about APIs, they have a need, a problem they need to solve. They want to provide a feature in their website, or mobile application. Often times people just want two systems to talk to each other, or be able to analyze and visualize information in a particular way, to accomplish a business or personal objective.
<p><strong>Discovering The APIs You Need</strong><br /> The API savvy technologists are aware of the vast wealth of APis available today, and know to Google for the API they need, visit API directories like <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> or <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a>, and emerging API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>.
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br /> Before you can unlock the value of an API, you need to understand how common authentication patterns work for any API. Some API providers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">basic authentication</a>, which is baked into HTTP, while others use application or developer keys to be able to talk with APIs. <a href="https://oauth.net/">oAuth</a> is fast becoming default for API providers who serve up private users information, allowing platforms to manage identity and access in a way that gives control over to end-users of applications built on top of APIs. Many providers are also using SSL as default for all API communication, protecting API consumption.
<p><strong>Integration</strong><br /> Actual integration between applications and APIs, is ultimately up to API consumers, but API providers and a growing number of API tools and services, are making API integrations easier, and often automated. Most web API resources can be accessed via a simple URL, something anyone, with a basic amount of web knowledge, can integrate API resources into their world.
<p><strong>Monetization</strong><br /> There are plenty of API projects to be had for fun and hobby, but for any project to be sustainable it must generate revenue and be able to sustain itself. There several proven approaches to generating revenue around API integration including application sales, providing premium features, selling content or subscription to the content, advertising, in-app payments, affiliate links, data generation, and through partnership. Of course there is always the independently funded efforts, which make things easier.
<p><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong><br /> The primary motivation for API integration is to provide access to data, content, and other resources available in online Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms. Services like Evernote for notes, Pinboard for links, Flickr for photos, and Youtube for videos, all use APIs to enable integration with other applications, as well as basic data portability for software users.
<p><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong><br /> Like SaaS, its cousin Platform as a Service (PaaS) employ APIs to enable application providers, developers, and hackers with the ability for rapidly deploy applications ranging from Wordpress, to ElasticSearch. Usually if an application is running on PaaS platforms like Heroku, or Google Apps Engine, there is a set of APIs for configuring, monitoring and managing most aspects of the app.
<p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong><br /> The savviest of IT Operations have moved to the cloud, and run all of their infrastructure using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers like Amazon Web Services for everything from server capacity, and storage to DNS and content delivery networks (CDN). Every piece of IT infrastructure that runs in the cloud has an API or CLI interface for it, allowing the management of all IaaS infrastructure programmatically.
<p><strong>Backend as a Service (BaaS)</strong><br /> As if we needed another acronym, but here we go, <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> is an approach for providing web and mobile app developers with a way to connect their applications to backend cloud storage and processing while also providing common features such as user management, push notifications, social networking integration, and other features that mobile users demand from their apps these days. As approaches to API deployment evolve, we are seeing more API deployment platforms emerge that very much resemble earlier goals of BaaS, allowing for the agile deployment, and consumption of valuable resources, via BaaS platform APIs.
<p><strong>Embeddable Tools</strong><br /> The popularity of platforms like Twitter and Facebook owe a great deal of their buzz to the fact that there were embeddable buttons, badges, and widgets, allowing for the sharing, syndication, and engagement with their platform using API driven, embeddable tools. The ability to copy and paste a little bit of code, maybe configure a few settings, and be able to publish data, content, media, and other digital resources is the cornerstone of any API integration.
<p><strong>Web Hooks</strong><br /> Webhooks enable API platforms to push data, and notify any other URL of a change or event that has occurred via the platform. Webhooks are how API platforms become a two way street, allowing API consumers to make APIs work for them, and reduce the overhead of application usage when it comes to polling API resources. Webhooks are an API integrators best friend, and always look for them on platforms before considering which resource is best for your application or use case.
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong><br /> Everything on the Internet today is guided buy the terms of service of web and mobile applications, and their underlying API platforms. TOS dictate how developers can use APIs, and the end-users can take advantage of services on the platform. Nobody reads TOS before they sign up for online services, but if you are looking to build a business on top of any API, you should read the TOS to see if it is something that will support what you are looking to do.
<p><strong>In Perfect World Everyone Provides and Consumes API</strong><br /> There are over thousands of public APIs available on the open Internet, and if you are building applications, you are most likely consuming APIs, as well as designing, deploying, and managing your own APIs. The best API providers, consume their own APIs, as well as the APIs of other providers. To truly understand what makes a good API, you should be consuming, as well as providing APIs.
<p>In 2014 we are moving well beyond the old days of API mashups, or even applications using just a handful of APis. Applications are depending on entire stack of APIs, employing 10s or 100s of API resources to deliver applications across multiple web and mobile channels. Consuming APIs aren't just for developers, and about building applications, APIs are fueling many new trends that allow even non-developers to consume APIs and put them to use in documents, spreadsheets, and other common tools we depend on everyday for our personal and professional lives.

        <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/forest-service/department-of-agriculture-forest-service.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>I need your help with something. I&rsquo;m in the business of helping start-ups, all the way up to our federal government identify valuable assets, and make them more accessible for use in websites, and mobile devices. As part of this work I&rsquo;m always on the look out for valuable public assets across city, state, and the federal government, and help make sure the conversations around these assets always include APIs, so that we aren&rsquo;t just building websites, mobile applications in silos, and limiting the potential for public access, by individuals, and small businesses.&nbsp;
<p>Over the last couple years I have cultivated a small group of API evangelists in various sectors, who help keep me informed of important government projects, and one of my partners in crime Alyssa Ravasio (<a href="https://twitter.com/alyraz">@alyraz</a>) brought a <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">pre solicitation for an RFP to my attention from the Department of Agriculture, for a &ldquo;Recreation On Stop Support Services&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;to my attention&mdash;a service you can see in action at <a href="http://www.recreation.gov/">Recreation.gov</a>. In short this is an ongoing contract that our federal government engages in with a private sector contractor on, to provide access to our nations campgrounds and campsites at our federal parks.
<p>I would put our national parks and campgrounds at the top of treasured assets that this country possesses, and something that we need to make sure continue to be as accessible to individuals, and small businesses as possible. I want to take the time to respond to the pre-solicitation from the Department of Agriculture, in hopes of helping them craft a better RFP, before this goes out to bid. I also want to encourage others, who are also passionate about camping and our national parks, to submit their own feedback to the Department of Agricultures&rsquo;s solicitation number <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">AG3187S151000--Recreation One Stop Support Services</a>
<p>The current incarnation of the one stop service for recreation project has an API...well it has web services as part of the existing <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/RIDBWebSvcManual.pdf">Recreation Information Database (RIDB)</a>, but you also find mentions of API in the proposed RFP, under the&nbsp;<strong>5.3.9 Mapping and Geospatial Capability</strong>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A segment of the user community will not only be accessing and viewing the mapping data through the web interface at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.recreation.gov">www.recreation.gov</a>, but will also have a need to search, retrieve, and download the geospatial data via the RIDB data sharing interface(s), or APIs.&nbsp; The Contractor shall demonstrate utilization of programming languages, formats, data types/conventions/sources, etc. which maximize the portability and usability of maps and map related data by third-parties. This minimizes the need for third-party data consumers to procure expensive and/or proprietary software to utilize, edit or manipulate the mapping data. The contractor shall ensure that all available geospatial data within R1S is incorporated into the user interface to provide users with the most complete mapping solutions available.</em>
<p>There is another mention of APIs under&nbsp;<strong>5.3.6 Provide Travel Planning Tools wit</strong>h:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Non Federal reservable inventory may include state and local reservable and non-reservable recreation inventory which may be incorporated into the system or accessed via various application programming interfaces (APIs).&nbsp;</em>
<p>Then towards the end you see the following needs:
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Sharing and Data Management -</strong> Information originating from within RIDB and imported shall be presented in a manner such that the external origin of the data is transparent to users and consistent with presentation of information originating from within.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Information Sharing -</strong> The Contractor shall deliver automated and manual services for the sharing of the consolidated recreation information described herein. The sharing service shall utilize prevailing industry best practices and technologies to make the consolidated recreation information publicly available to data consumers.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Information Consolidation -</strong> The Contractor shall deliver automated and manual services for collecting of a wide variety of recreation information from a wide range of sources including Federal Government Agencies and Federal Partner organizations such as Historic Hotels of America.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, all of this infers that whoever wins the contract will need to at least maintain what is available via the RIDB, which is nice, but it is just a web service, not a modern web API, and only reflects providing access a small portion of the valuable resource that will need to be made available via Recreation.gov, to partners, and the public at large. We can do better. An API needs to be a first class citizen in this RFP, something that is not just an afterthought, and a connection to the database that just needs to be maintained&mdash;an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">API will be central to deliver the resources</span> needed for a "one stop services for recreation".
<p><strong>Camping Resources<br /></strong>When you look through the requirements for this project you see all the building blocks for allowing individuals to engage with campsites across our nation, inventory, ticketing, lotteries, permitting, day use and group facilities, special events and use, equipment rentals, recreational and pass sales. All of this keeps our national parks accessible to campers.
<p><strong>Mapping and Geospatial Resources<br /></strong>Camping resources are meaningful to us because of where they are located. Mapping and geospatial resources will be vital to enabling users to discover the parks and campsites where they wish to stay on their camping trips. The ability to search, and navigate campsites via modern mapping, providing geospatial resources is central to the one stop service for recreation.
<p><strong>Financial Resources<br /></strong>A third cornerstone of the recreation one stop support services platform are the financial resources. The ability to accept and process credit cards, cancellations, modifications, and refunds will play a role in every engagement on the platform. Access to to all aspects of commerce via the platform will make or break operations at every level for the one stop service for recreation.
<p><strong>User Resources<br /></strong>I&rsquo;d say the fourth corner of the one stop service for recreation platform is the user. Providing secure, seamless access to user profiles, and history throughout the Recreation.gov experience will be critical to it all working. User resources are central to any modern web or mobile application in 2014, and depends on camping, geo, and financial resources to bring it all together.
<p><strong>Recreation.gov Website<br /></strong>All of these resource need to be made available on at Recreation.gov, in the form of fully functioning web application providing a content management system (CMS) for managing the site, complete with a reservation system that allows users to discovery camping resources, via mapping geospatial resources, and pay for their reservations via financial resources&mdash;all via a secure, easy to access user profile.
<p><strong>Travel Planning Tools<br /></strong>Beyond the core public website, and its reservation system the requires call for travel planning tools including point-to-point itinerary planning, field sales and reservations sales, third party sales, and reservable inventory management. While these tools are likely to primarily be web-based, the requirements call for remote sales and management of inventory, which requires a central API solution.
<p><strong>Robust Reporting Solutions&nbsp;<br /></strong>Reporting is prominent through the requirements requiring web analytics, canned reports, customizable reports, monthly performance reporting, and enterprise reporting systems (ERS). In short, reporting will be essential to all aspects of the one stop service for recreation for both the contract winner and operator, as well as all of the agencies involved. I would add in that end-users will also need some views into their own Recreation.gov usage, adding another layer to the conversation.
<p><strong>Data Accessibility &amp; Portability<br /></strong>Another element that is present throughout the requirements is data access and portability, of the camping, reservation, customer (user) and resulting financial data. Pretty much everything in system should be accessible right? This definitely goes beyond just what is available va the RIDB, and requiring all aspects of the one stop service for recreation to be accessible for use in any other system, or just as download.&nbsp;
<p><strong>Minimum Required Applications &amp; Platforms<br /></strong>As part of the requirements, there is a minimum requirements for browsers, and mobile platforms that the one stop service for recreation should operate on:
<ul>
<li>Applications: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;"> 
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Apple Safari</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Platforms: &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;"> 
<ul>
<li>Android Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Apple iOS Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Apple Desktop OS</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows PC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For me this portion of the requirements are extremely vague. I agree that the Recreation.gov and travel planning tools should work in all these browsers, and be responsive on mobile browsing platforms, but these requirements seem to allude to more, without actually going there. In 2014-2016 you can&rsquo;t tell me that native mobile experiences won&rsquo;t be something end users of recreation.gov and the overall system will be demanding? Mobile wills be the gateway to the platforms mapping and geospatial resources, and APIs are how you deliver the resources needed for developing mobile applications on all of the platforms listed.&nbsp;
<p><strong>A One-Stop Service for Recreation Requires A Multi-Channel Approach<br /></strong>The one stop service for recreation requires a multi-channel approach to deliver the camping, mapping &amp; geo, financial and user resources to the main Recreation.gov website, supporting reservation system, travel planning tools, reporting solutions, and potentially any other web or mobile applications, and round it all off with needing to provide the data accessibility and portability that is demanded of a modern federal government platform.
<p><strong>Transform The RIDB Web Service Into A Modern API And Make The Center<br /></strong>The only way you will engage with users Recreation.gov on the web and mobile locations they will demand, as well as deliver the reservation, travel planning, and reporting solutions, while making sure everything is portable, the RIDB database and supporting web services needs to be brought up to date, and transformed into a modern web API. &nbsp;The&nbsp;RFP_-_Attachment_10_-_Notional_Future_RIDB_Data_Flow_-_Sep._22_2014.pptx even reflects this vision, but the actual RFP severely falls short of describing the role an API will play in the platform.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/forest-service/ridb-api.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p><strong>Making Security A Priority Across All Aspects Of Operations<br /></strong>With a single API layer being the access layer for all web, mobile, reporting, and data accessibility channels, security takes on a whole new meaning. APIs provide single access point for all access to platform resources, allowing security, and auditing to occur in real-time, using modern approaches to API management. APIs use existing web technology, and don&rsquo;t require any special technology, but do provide a single layer to enable, monitor, and deny access to all resources, across the one stop services for recreation.
<p><strong>A Centralized Metrics, Analytics, and Reporting Layer<br /></strong>Married with security, an API centric approach allows for a platform wide analytics layer, that can drive security, but also provide the data points required for the overall platform reporting system. With an API analytics layer this data can be delivered to platform, government, developer, and end-user reporting solutions. A comprehensive metrics, analytics, and reporting strategy is essential to a modern one stop services for recreation platform.
<p><strong>APIs Let In the Sunlight Enforcing Transparency &amp; Accountability<br /></strong>One critical aspects of a modern, API-centric approach is the transparency and accountability it can provides. All database connections, and web or mobile applications are brokered via an API layer, requiring all applications to rely on the same pipes for reading, writing, modifying, and removing data from the system. This approach provides a secure window into all aspects of platform operations, providing the accountability requirements set forth in the proposed RFP.
<p><strong>Some Constructive Criticism For Language in the Proposed RFP<br /></strong>There are some points in the proposed RFP that in my opinion move the conversation backwards rather than looking to the future, and fulfilling a vision of what the "one stop services for recreation platform" could be. One example is <strong>5.3.6.3 Third Party Sales</strong>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Government anticipates that during the potential 10-year period of performance after go-live there may be an interest by commercial travel and recreation planning companies (such as Travelocity, Expedia, etc.) to utilize R1S inventory and availability data to facilitate R1S transactions. The Government may be open to such Third Party Sales arrangements, provided the business, financial and legal terms of the arrangement are in the Government&rsquo;s best interests. At the Government&rsquo;s request, the Contractor shall lead exploratory meetings, including Government and applicable industry representatives, to determine commercial interest in such a service and also explore the technical and fiscal feasibility of such Third Party Sales arrangements. Upon the conclusion of all necessary exploratory meetings, and should the Government decide to implement Third Party Sales, the Government will issue a formal modification to the R1S Support Services contract to incorporate the service. There is no requirement for the contractor to provide Third Party Sales services until a post-award modification is issued requiring them.</em> &nbsp;
<p>&ldquo;There may be an interest by commercial travel and recreation planning companies (such as Travelocity, Expedia, etc.)?&rdquo; In the current online environment I am pretty sure that this shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;may&rdquo;, this should be &ldquo;will&rdquo;, and that the pace of business today moves quite a bit faster than this section describes. APIs enable a new approach to business development, that was coined 10 years ago by the co-founder of Flickr, the popular sharing platform. I understand that you will have to certify developers, but this should not get in the way of small business developers experimenting and innovating with the resources available via the platform. Business development via an API has been going on in the private sector for 10 years, and isn't something the Department of Agriculture should be putting off until the next procurement cycle for the platform.
<p>The proposed RFP states:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The current contract is a Variable Quantity contract with Fixed Price per-transaction pricing such that the Contractor earns a fixed fee for each transaction processed via the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.recreation.gov">www.recreation.gov</a>&nbsp;website, the telephone customer support line, or in-person at participating Federal recreation locations.&nbsp; The fixed fees under the current contract vary depending on the type of inventory being reserved, the sales channel, etc.<br /></em>
<p>In an era where we have over 10K API resources to use in applications, where cloud-based utility pricing is successfully being applied, and you pay for what you use across numerous industries, you can&rsquo;t have a business model like this for a public / private sector partnership, and not put APIs to use, and enabling trusted partners to build a business model around the commerce opportunities available via a platform. Right now this is exclusive to the current contract holder&nbsp;Active Network, d.b.a. ReserveAmerica, and for the next round should not be something that is exclusive to the contract winner--it should be open to the thousands of businesses that serve the parks &amp; recreation space.
<p>Another item I have an issue with is ownership over the source code of the platform:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Government owns all of the inventory, transaction and customer data associated with&nbsp;<a href="http://Recreation.Gov">Recreation.Gov</a>; however the reservation system remains the sole proprietary property of the current service provider.</em>
<p>I know this is the current situation, but I strongly urge that for the next relationship, this is not the case. The government should own all of the inventory, transaction, and customer data, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the reservation system should be open source</span>. Period. The chances that there will be innovation via the platform if it remains a proprietary solution is slim, and requiring that the core reservation system, and supporting API platform remain open source will stimulate innovation around Recreation.gov. Any business, including the winner of the contract, can still build proprietary solutions that use the API to deliver specific applications, or end-user solutions, and premium features, but the core software should be open this time.
<p><strong>Some Praise For What Is In The Proposed RFP<br /></strong>I am not one to just criticize, without providing at least some praise, acknowledging where the Department of Agriculture is looking towards the future. One area I have to note is their inclusion of the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a>, where&nbsp;#3 on the checklist for deploying in a flexible hosting environment is "resources are provisioned through an API&rdquo;, and #2 on the checklist for defaulting to open says that you should provide data sets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces). I think the&nbsp;<a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a>&nbsp;should be included with ALL federal government RFPs, and it makes me happy to see it in here.
<p>I also understand the number of agencies involved in the project include the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Department of the Interior (including at least the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service), the National Archives and Records Administration and other potential Federal partners to be determined at a later date.&nbsp; Agencies involved in the trip planning component include the agencies named above, as well as the Department of Transportation; Federal Highway Administration (FHA), the Department of Commerce; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and the Smithsonian Institution. &nbsp;This is a huge undertaking, and commend them on the effort, but can't also help myself in throwing in that this is all the more reason the one stop services for recreation has to have an API. ;-)
<p><strong>In Closing<br /></strong>I think I&rsquo;m finished with my response to the <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">Department of Agricultures&rsquo;s solicitation number AG3187S151000--Recreation One Stop Support Services</a>. I would like to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">request that they extend the deadline for response for another 30 days</span>, to allow me to drum up more feedback, as well as put some more thought into the RFP myself. Following your own lead of including the U.S. Digital Services Playbook, I would also recommend bringing in:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a></strong> - Building on the U.S. Digital Services Playbook, 18F has an amazing set of resources to help the Department of Agriculture move forward with this RFP in a way that is in line with other leading platform efforts in the federal government&mdash;please make sure 18F is involved.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Round 3 PIFs -</strong> This is probably already be in the works, but make sure there is someone from the recent round of Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIFs) are on board, helping make sure this project is headed in the right direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately I think all the right parts and pieces are present for this project, but when it comes to &nbsp;finding the right language, and vision for the RFP, it needs a lot of help, and I'm confident that 18F and PIFs can help bring it home. The most important element for me is that <a href="http://ridb.recreation.gov/RIDBWebSvcManual.pdf">web service from the RIDB</a> needs to be transformed into a modern web API, and brought front and center to fuel every aspect of the platform. I&rsquo;m confident that if the RFP speaks the right language, the winning contractor will be able to translate the RFP into the platform it needs to be, and serve the expectations of the modern consumers who will be using the platform in coming years.
<p>If this RFP goes out the door without an API vision, planning of the family camping trip will done in a silo, at Recreation.gov, and not on the mobile phones that are ubiquitous in our everyday life. User do not need a web experience that is translated to function in mobile browsers, they need a web experience when it makes sense, and a native mobile experience, and even offline when necessary.&nbsp;
<p>Planning the family vacation will not happen from just Recreation.gov, it needs to be part of a larger vacation planning experience, occurring via the online platforms we already use in our daily lives. If the Department of Agriculture focuses on an API-first vision for delivering the one stop service for recreation, it will live up to its name&mdash;truly being a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one stop service</span> that can be used for planning your recreation from any platform or device.

<p>I&rsquo;m spending more time reaching out directly to API providers, in an effort to better understand what they are up to. A couple weeks ago, I asked Sarfaraz Rydhan (<a href="https://twitter.com/safoo">@safoo</a>)&nbsp;from the <a href="https://siftscience.com/">Fraud Detection API platform SiftScience</a>, what is the biggest challenge you face in attracting developers to your system?
<blockquote><em>In many cases, the biggest challenge is developers needing context into the business and operations side of the companies they work for. We offer a machine learning powered fraud detection product to help internet companies in many verticals fight fraud. In an e-commerce integration, for example, a developer may need to know about how users interact with the store, when a customer's credit card is charged, how order information is sent to the warehouse for fulfillment, how operations analysts work within the e-commerce system.</em></blockquote>
<p>Context--something that is so important, and is often lost in translation, or forgotten entirely when APIs are purely an IT or developer led initiative. As a developer I can easily see the many uses of an API, but articulating to someone who is actually living within one of these use-case scenarios, is very difficult&mdash;something that takes a lot of practice.
<p>You can see SiftScience working to provide context to its users via its <a href="https://siftscience.com/">website</a>, <a href="http://blog.siftscience.com/">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/siftscience">twitter</a>, and other <a href="https://siftscience.com/resources/tutorials/integration.html">tutorials and resources</a>. As API providers, this is why we provide essential storytelling building blocks like a blog, tutorials, and other resources&mdash;to provide the critical context someone needs to understand the value that our APIs deliver.
<p>Are you providing enugh context for your users?

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-gift.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>The world of APIs starts with an individual, company or organization, with some sort of content, data, or other digital resource, wanting to make it available, on the Internet, in a machine readable way, so that others can build sites, and applications around it. Even though APIs use the Internet for communication, it doesn't mean that they are openly accessible to anyone. Providing APIs, is very similar to providing websites, you can control which users have access to it, where they can go, and what they can do&mdash;APIs are just meant for other websites, web applications, and mobile developers.&nbsp;
<p><strong>Solving a Problem</strong><br /> APIs are all about providing solutions, to everyday problems in our increasingly digit worlds, from sharing data with partners, developing mobile applications, to disrupting an entire legacy industry who refuses to change and evolve.
<p><strong>Access to Resources</strong><br /> Providing APIs is about open up access to content, data and other complex objects, or systems that exist within a company or organization, in a way that anyone can use the resulting resources in any programming language or external system.
<p><strong>Alternative Solutions</strong><br /> APIs are about the path of least resistance when making content, data, and other resources available, and in the world of APIs you see a lot of initiatives that are born in the shadows of existing company efforts, scraped from existing websites, and are often organized by rogue groups outside of normal business or even IT groups. APIs are about getting things done.
<p><strong>Design First</strong><br /> Providing APIs has evolved beyond just exposing an interface that exactly reflects the content, database or other resource being made available, and establishing a design first approach where you mock, share, and collaborate around the value an API delivers, before any code is even written.
<p><strong>Efficient Deployment</strong><br /> There are many roads an individual or company can take when providing APIs, from DIY approaches using open source API frameworks, to gateways provided by IT that access internal resources, and a new breed of cloud based solutions for deploying APIs from any existing systems. Whichever path a provider takes, deploying APIs is about finding the quickest, most efficient way to making API resources accessible, being used, and moving forward.
<p><strong>Managing Operations</strong><br /> Once the API is deployed, the work doesn't stop. Over the last decade, API pioneers have establish some pretty proven ways to manage API operations, by providing documentation, code resources, support, monitoring, communication and other resources that consumers of an API will need to be successful.
<p><strong>Flexible Service Composition</strong><br /> A single API, is an opportunity to provide multiple internal, external, and public consumers the ability to access resources in a variety of ways. Service composition provides a way that API providers can allow for a wide variety access to resources, to only the groups of consumers they want, charging for services in optimal ways that meet their business goals.
<p><strong>Sustainable Monetization</strong><br /> API providers have established some new, and innovative ways for monetizing APIs, ranging from API consumers paying for use in a utility style approach, paying API consumers for driving traffic, to other more indirect ways of generating value, while covering operational costs, and monetizing usage beyond.
<p><strong>Available For Discovery</strong><br /> As part of evangelism, there are emerging approaches to ensuring APIs are discoverable, by generating machine readable API definitions, and making sure APis are available to API search engines and directories. Discovery by design, is emerging as the way that API providers reach API consumers.
<p><strong>Meaningful Evangelism</strong><br /> There is no &ldquo;build it and they will come&rdquo; in the world of APIs. Even for internally focused APis, it will take a solid amount of evangelism to make consumers aware that an API exists, as well as achieve successful integration into any website, web application, or mobile apps.
<p><strong>Emmbeddable Everywhere</strong><br /> Some APIs lend themselves to driving data, content, and other functionality across web sites, applications, and spreadsheets. JavaScript, plus APIs, are a common way to provide embeddable, API driven functionality that any site owner, social media user, and other Internet user can find API driven solutions to their problems.
<p><strong>Security a Priority</strong><br /> Since APIs employ HTTP, the same communication protocol as the World Wide Web, security becomes a big priority in API operations. Most APIs are NOT publicly available, employing SSL, application keys, and other approaches to securing API access, including new standards like oAuth for handling both identification, and access to valuable API resources.
<p><strong>Web Hook Relationships</strong><br /> APis don&rsquo;t just receive information, they increasingly are making calls to outside URLs, allowing API consumers to receive real-time notifications, when any data, content or other event occurs around the API resources their applications and system deepened on&mdash;making APIs a two way street.
<p><strong>Balanced Terms of Service</strong><br /> In our online, digital worlds, terms of service dictate all relationships, and this is no exception in the world of APis. API terms of service make or break API operations, allowing for adjustments that protect API providers interest, but also enable API consumers to successfully integrate, and put API resources to use. Some API providers have found a balance to API terms of service, while others struggle finding the balance that will bring in API consumers, and keep them integrated.
<p><strong>Privacy Baked In</strong><br /> The privacy of everyone involved with providing APIs, consuming APIs, and ultimately the websites, applications, and systems that end-users are depending on is critical. Whether it is purely internal corporate systems, federal government applications, or a publicly available social network application like Facebook, privacy will set the tone for all platform operations.
<p><strong>Transparency As Part Of Your DNA</strong><br /> Finding success with APIs takes a different breed of business and organizations, requiring a certain amount of transparency in operations that some people just aren't ready for. However, many companies and organizations find that by becoming an API provider, they experience a transformation, that teaches them to be more transparent, open to external ideas&mdash;resulting in changing culture.
<p>Providing APIs will be something every company, non-profit organization, and government agency will be doing after 2015. APIs will be how content, data, and resources shared, and consumed in the future. In 1995 every company, organization, and government  agency was faced with the question of whether or not they should have a website, and by 2000 that question was yes. In 2010 every company, organization, and government agency was faced with the question of whether or not they should have an API, and by 2015 that question will be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YES</span></strong>.
<p>The concept of providing APIs is not something exclusive to organizational entities, it is something that is also a reality for the individual. In practice, the Twitter API, enables all Twitter users to have their own API, and platforms are emerging that take this to the next level, and allow users to have content and data storage lockers, and using their own personal APIs to share, and reclaim the content and data they generate across the web each day, both personally and professionally.
<p>Everyone has a website in 2014, everyone will have an API in coming years.

<p>As I track on the API space, the gender gap becomes increasingly obvious. As with many other guys, I&rsquo;m struggling with coming up with the most constructive way that I can contribute to closing the gender gap in technology. As I do with the rest of the API space, I figured I can work harder to tell more stories about women doing interesting things in the API space, while also working to understand the history of women in the space.
<p>With this in mind I took the opportunity on Ada Lovelace Day, to publish a project dedicated tracking on women doing interesting things in the world of APIs, and as with the other 75+ projects, I will spend time each month moving the project forward. My goal is to find more stories for my blog, more speakers and attendees for API industry events, and make sure women are better represented across my research.
<p>To kick things off, I wanted to showcase notable women in the history of compute, and by spending my day looking beyond just the Wikipedia entry, I was able compile a <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/noteable-women-in-history-of-tech.html">pretty impressive list of women who have made a significant impact on technology</a>. The list I compiled is not complete by any means, but it is far more complete than any one list I have found out there, and the big difference is my list is machine readable--meaning you can pull <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/noteable-women-in-history-of-tech.html">the JSON listing of notable women in compute history</a> and use on any other website, or in mobile applications.
<p>Next up, I want to make an functional web API so anyone can search the listing, as well as provide the ability to add, and update the list via API. I want to also take advantage of the fact that my <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/women-in-tech">women in tech research website is build on Github</a>, and encourage visitors to help me make the list more complete, and extend the reach of the information available here.
<p>If you know someone or something that should be represented here, feel free to reach out via the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/women-in-tech/issues/new">Github issues</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Twitter</a>, or feel free to fork the project and contribute in any way you see fit. Use the <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/updates/">updates</a> and <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> pages to find out what I&rsquo;m working on, and where I am planning to take my research next.

<p>I wrote a story a couple of weeks ago, about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/09/30/where-do-we-start-with-apis-at-the-university-of-oklahoma/">how to kickstart APIs at the University of Oklahoma (OU)</a>. I ended the post, saying I would find some easy targets for generating the initial APIs, and publish a basic developer portal using Github Pages. After some work I think I have enough done to initiate another conversation with my friends at OU.
<p>In any company, organization, government agency, or institution, where you are trying to decide where to start with APIs, the public website is the place to start. If data and content is already published to the website, it should also be available in a machine readable format via an API&mdash;this is the obvious place to start at OU.
<p>To help find the low hanging fruit, when it comes to data and content at OU, I wrote a simple script that would slowly spider every page of the ou.edu website, looking for the opportunities, providing some potential targets for deploying APIs. So far my script has identified 183,094 pages across university sub-domains, and processed 52,281 of these pages looking for any HTML tables on pages, with over 20 rows, as well as .xls spreadsheet files, and XML files.
<p>I&rsquo;m running the script slowly in the background, as I don&rsquo;t want to put any burden on OU sites, and just pulling pages every few seconds. To date I&rsquo;ve identified 252 pages that have large HTML tables, 330 spreadsheets, and 68 XML files. While the script will still be running and looking for more, I think this represents a pretty good start when it comes finding the low hanging fruit for open data and content at OU--resources that should be APIs.
<p>As I do with all my projects, <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/">I published my work for the OU API effort on Github, as an open repository</a>. Using this repository, I&rsquo;ve published the low hanging fruit as JSON, and HTML pages to allow for easy browsing:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Tables (252) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-tables.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-tables.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets (330) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-spreadsheets.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-spreadsheets.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>XML Files (68) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-xml.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-xml.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/discussion.html">created another page which is driven from the Github issues for the repository</a>, to help handle discussion around which tables, and files should be targeted. I will put some thought into how to improve the process, better using Github to move the conversation forward. I&rsquo;m not going to be able to do this alone, ultimately we need the students and factuality at OU to get interested in participating, but this will take time&mdash;something which Github is well suited to help manage asynchronously.
<p>The next steps for this project, is to have another conversation with Mark and Adam from OU, and look through some of the low hanging fruit I&rsquo;ve identified. After that I will put together a strategy for using <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a> to help us easily publish APIs from the targets I&rsquo;ve identified. I also suspect that as part of this process there will be a lot of de-duping, and other data janitorial work before we can publish some usable APIs, and move things forward.
<p>You can follow my work on this at the <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/">OU API project Github repository</a>, and when it makes sense I will publish stories on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.

        <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-dictionary.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with different ways to compose, and examine collections of APIs. I have a database of over 2500 API that I keep an eye on, and for some of them I&rsquo;ve been generating Swagger specs, and using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to compose them into collections. I did this with 1<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">0 APIs I'm calling my utility stack</a>, because they are some of the fundamental utility style resources I depend on to make the API Evangelist network function.
<p>I generated Swagger specs for the 10 following APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>bitly Data API Search</li>
<li>FullContact Name API</li>
<li>FullContact Location Normalization API</li>
<li>Pinboard All Posts API</li>
<li>AngelList Startup API</li>
<li>Wordnik WordList API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Keyword and Term Extraction</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Text Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Author Extraction API</li>
</ul>
<p>Then using these Swagger definitions, I outputted any parameters that are used for endpoints, as well as the fields for all of the APIs underlying data model. I grouped all of these fields together and created a sort of dictionary for my utility stack API collection. By doing this I&rsquo;m learning a lot about the vocabulary that each of these API providers are using, as well as beginning to see patterns across similar APIs, like text extraction APIs, and URL shortener APIs.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/utility-stack-dictionary.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>In a perfect world, APIs would use commonly established vocabularies like <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a>, but in the imperfect API world we are given, I&rsquo;m enjoying taking a look at the sort of API slang that has emerged across the various types of popular APIs we are adopting.  API definition formats like Swagger give me a great way to define the surface are of APIs, and these exercises allow me to push forwards tools and approaches to understanding this new landscape.
<p>The more APIs I generate Swagger definitions for, and the more tools I develop to analyze the landscape, the better I will get at communicating the interesting patterns I&rsquo;m seeing across the API space, and hopefully extract some blueprints that I can follow in my own API design work.

        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://poemofthetimes.laneworks.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/poem-of-the-times/poem-of-the-times.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I first started Poem of the Times back around 2003, and for about five years I harvested a poem each day, from the top headlines across the  top english speaking newspapers around the world.  Sometime in 2008 I stopped generating the poem, but in an effort to showcase the potential of APIs, I thought it would be a good time to revive the project.
<p>Version 1.0 of Poem of the Times used RSS to pull its headlines, and for version 2.0 I want to use APIs. Something that seems impossible when you are faced with the fact that most of the top newspapers do not have APIs, which is very sad. ;-( However in 2014 we can make APIs from any web page using Scraping to API tools like <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>.
<p>Using Kimono Labs I created an APIs for each of top 25 newspapers. I worked my way down a list of top newspapers around the globe, and using Kimono&rsquo;s Chrome add-on I was able to map my API to whatever part of the news homepage featured the latest stories. This was different for each news site, and some of them threw errors when I ran Kimono, but when this happened I quickly moved on until I had 25 successful APIs&mdash;something that took me about an hour and half.
<p>Now that I had 25 separate news APIs I <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/poem-of-the-times/tree/gh-pages/definitions">published a machine readable Swagger definition for each</a>, and then published an <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/poem-of-the-times/blob/gh-pages/apis.json">APIs.json listing all 25 APIs in a single Poem of the Times API collection</a>. Right now this is manual, but I know this is something that is on the Kimono roadmap, introducing the ability to automatically generate Swagger specs, and build APIs.json collections from your Kimono API catalog.
<p>Next I wrote a simple PHP script that pulled the APIs.json, spidered all 25 APIs, made a call to each one, and randomly grabbed a single headline, adding to an overall poem for the day. Once I had collected 25 news stories, I hit shuffle on them again, making sure the poem was in no particular order. After that I published the results to a single HTML, and JSON file, providing a single poem for each day.
<p>As I do with all of my projects, <a href="http://poemofthetimes.laneworks.net/">I published Poem of the Times as standalone Github repository</a>, and I am publishing each poem as a Jekyll blog post, and linking to each days poem JSON file. I have a job setup each day to pull the poem, but the publish to Github will be manual until I get it working 100%. My Poem of the Times projects was a great &nbsp;vehicle for learning more about <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>, while also get to play around with another way to tell stories using APIs.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">Exploring The Possibilities of Being An API Broker</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-broker.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with different ways of building API collections using <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, and building on a concept I saw introduced by <a href="https://medium.com/@cyrilgaillard/i-dont-need-a-business-co-founder-i-need-an-api-broker-c9be536cf8fa">Cyril Gaillard&rsquo;s story titled "I don&rsquo;t need a business co-founder, I need an API broker</a>", something which was expanded on by Patricio Robles (<a href="https://twitter.com/probles">@probles</a>) on <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/would-your-company-benefit-having-api-broker/analysis/2014/09/29">ProgrammableWeb with "would your company benefit from having an API broker</a>?"
<p>The concept of an API broker is interesting. If you had talked to me a year ago, I would have framed my thoughts on API brokering in a more algorithmic way, but after reading these posts, I am looking to merge in my thoughts around API evangelism, taking more of a human approach to API brokering. While I think API brokering in the future might look like more like high speed trading with algorithms doing the heavy lifting, I&rsquo;m thinking for right now it is something we need humans to bridge, bringing a more personal approach during the wild wild west days of APIs.
<p>To push forward my thoughts on API brokering, I&rsquo;m playing around with describing various APIs using <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger 2.0</a>, then building a collection of these APIs using APIs.json, and publishing it all to a Github project&mdash;which for now I&rsquo;m calling the <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">Utility Stack</a>. In this exercise I&rsquo;m organizing 10 separate APIs that provide me with a very useful stack of API resources. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I will be building with all of this, but the current stack reflects what I&rsquo;m already using to manage the API Evangelist network, so I know they are useful.
<p>Here are the 10 APIs I&rsquo;m working with:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>AlchemyAPI Author Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Keyword &amp; Term Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Text Extraction API</li>
<li>Angellist Startup API</li>
<li>Bitly URL Data API</li>
<li>FullContact Location Normalization API</li>
<li>FullContact Name Normalization API</li>
<li>Pinboard Bookmark API</li>
<li>Wordnik Word Lists API</li>
<li>Wordnik Words API</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all API resources that provide some very useful elements in my operations. I use them to pull details about blog posts, look-up start-ups, shorten URLs, organize bookmarks, and other very utilitarian functions that I perform across my platform. I use these APIs for my own purposes, but for this project I&rsquo;m looking to assemble them potentially as a collection that can be used in the development of a specific application, or for ongoing development within specific company or group.
<p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/swaggerLogo360.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Swagger version 2.0 to describe these APIs, and publishing all of it to Github, using APIs.json as an index of the collection. This allows me to generate interactive documentation for each API in the collection, which makes the entire stack accessible via a <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">single development portal</a>. I&rsquo;m still working on the authentication across all of these resources, some of which are basic API keys, and other are BasicAuth or oAuth. Its all doable though, and based upon work I&rsquo;ve done before I can easily store API keys, and oAuth credentials in the master branch of the Github repository which I keep as private.
<p>To summarize this exercise, as an API broker I could easily find the resources my clients will need to build a specific web or mobile application, or accomplish a specific system integration. I could setup all of the accounts for each of the resources in a central, private configuration file that can be used by the developer hub I&rsquo;ve setup so developers can explore using interactive documentation, as well as use directly within an application.
<p>Think of this applied to Cyri&rsquo;s vision of needing an API broker, or possibly something that every company would have as Patricio suggests in his ProgrammableWeb post. With this project, I&rsquo;m not deploying any APIs, I&rsquo;m merely aggregating and brokering a machine readable collection across numerous other API resources. This exercise has also shown me that I can easily identify gaps within any stack I&rsquo;m working on, and make suggestions for new APIs that help developers accomplish a specific project objective.
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p>Imagine if I needed to add an image stack, like my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, or my <a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulate API</a>? I could easily added in other features, and resources that developers are needing, allowing them to do what they do best, building applications, and delivering on system integrations. As a broker I can do the legwork of finding the resources they need, and aggregating into a single developer hub.
<p>The fun in all of this is that I have each of these API definitions in a central system, allowing me to orchestrate collections like this <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">utility stack</a>, or possibly <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/launching-25-apis-to-assemble-a-single-poem-for-each-day/">API stacks like my poem of the times</a> that all work towards a single objective, no matter whether its for developing a specific mobile application, single page application, or any other system integration you can imagine&mdash;even just writing a simple poem each day.

<p>I&rsquo;m doing my usual monitoring of the API space, and while looking at various developer areas, I stumbled across the <a href="https://developer.target.com/">Target Developer Portal</a>. I find the Target developer portal interesting because it is publicly available, but before you can get any information you have to register or login.
<p>When you land on the landing page for developer.target.com you simple get a page that says:
<blockquote><em>Please Note: Access to the developer portal is restricted to Target employees and trusted third parties that currently have a working relationship with Target Corporation. Registration requests that do not meet these guidelines will be rejected.</em></blockquote>
<p>I would like to see more information about Target&rsquo;s API efforts, which I think they could do without giving away business intelligence, but overall I support the line they are walking with their API efforts. To me, Target is making a statement that they have an API, and if you are <em>"Target employees and trusted third parties"</em>, you can get more access--it is a start, so I'm hopeful.
<p>I'm part of many private API discussions lately, where I&rsquo;m trying to educate companies about the benefits of being more public, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more companies take targets approach to publishing their developer API portal in coming years.
<p>My only hope is that more of them will also share a blog, and other details about what they are up to, and hopefully some day even some publicly available APIs providing access to information that is already available on their website.

<p>One of the <a href="http://api.report/2014/10/07/hacker-news-launches-official-api/">API news story of the day was the release of the Hacker News API</a>. I&rsquo;m only lightly interested in the fact that HN now has an API because, honestly I don't feel like an API at this point in the evolution of tech curation site is something to applaud, but their approach to making their API real-time I think does subtly reflect other currents in the API space.
<p>HN partnered with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> to make sure the tech news curation site doesn't just have an API, it has a real-time API. Meaning you can now get HN links in machine readable way, so that you can build the popular flow of tech information into other web, and mobile applications&mdash;in real-time! HN launching an API&hellip;yawn! HN launch an API with Firebase bkked in, reflects a growing trend from influential APIs. For me this is more about real-time and Firebase, than it is about HN.
<p>You see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/nest-provides-a-realtime-layer-by-default-for-api-consumers/">other API providers like Nest from Google baking in real-time frameworks into their APIs</a>. Real-time isn&rsquo;t something every type of API should be considering as a default feature, but there are definitely areas where the real-time flow of data is not just a nice to have, it is essential to demonstrating the value of APIs. In my experience, I would say that there are several sectors like news, financial, Internet of Things where I'm seeing real-time being present as a fundamental ingredient for the API platform--something I will be keeping an eye on.
<p>As I said before, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">some of the trends I&rsquo;m tracking on are quickly moving from trend to being baked into APIs</a>, going beyond just the release of web APis, and adding additional layers that developers are demanding to deliver the features their end-users are demanding.

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.trade.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/trade-gov/developer-trade-gov.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I've been a big proponent of APIs in the federal government, and it makes me really happy to see <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> using <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/api.json">APIs.json to provide an inventory of APIs available at the federal agency</a> dedicated to strengthening "the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promotes trade and investment, and ensures fair trade through the rigorous enforcement of our trade laws and agreements".
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, it is the open format that <a href="https://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist are working on to help make APIs discoverable. You can see APIs.json in action at the <a href="http://apis.io">open source API search engine APIs.io</a>, where the <a href="https://trade.gov/">International Trade Administration (ITA)</a> has submitted their APIs.json file for inclusion. ITA is the first of many federal agencies I will get to adopt the APIs.json format, and help make their valuable API resources much more discoverable, and ultimately more consumable.
<p>Can you imagine a future where <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all global trade</span> is machine readable by default, and there are millions of simple, discoverable APIs available to help stimulate, as well as regulate industry? A future where the Department of Commerce and other relevant agencies are at the center, with the highest quality APIs you can imagine, and the healthiest outreach to not just industry, but also individual business owners.
<p>Trade.gov&rsquo;s impressive entry into the world of APIs with <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.gov</a>, their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/the-speed-of-federal-government-when-it-runs-on-github/">quick responses to feedback</a>, and the publishing of an APIs.json file for the agency, makes me optimistic for this vision of the API economy. If our federal government can do it, then I think industries can follow the lead, ensure that the future of trade and commerce is more real-time, transparent, and accessible to everyone.
