{% include JB/setup %}<p>Have you ever tried to get data from a government agencies website? Often, when you find what your looking for, its in a PDF format. Not really a data friendly format. If your lucky, you will find a spreadsheet, but usually they are laid out in a report format and not meant for actual data portability.I have a personal obsession for finding, crunching and making sense out of local, state, and federal government data.</p>
