{% include JB/setup %}<p>One way to make sure your API has qualified and reputable developers from day one is to tap into an existing freelance developer community.Popular freelance sites like Elance provide existing communities of developers with the skills an API owner or partner is looking for.Elance provides access to their developer communities via a RESTful API.Using the Elance API, I have built a plug and play API developer community.My API Evangelist, API Developer Community prototype provides an example of what is possible when tapping into existing developer communities to satisfy the development needs of a new API community.</p>
