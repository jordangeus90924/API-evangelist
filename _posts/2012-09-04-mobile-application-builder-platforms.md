{% include JB/setup %}<p>In my quest to understand the possible future of Web APIs, I’m trying to understand the opportunities available for APIs when it comes to latest wave of mobile app builder platforms.I’m the most familiar with two leading platforms, Cabana and Tiggzi, but wanted to take a look at what else is out there.What I’m classifying as a mobile app builder platform, is a web-based platform (not something you have to download), that lets you build a mobile application and usually (but not always) without any development experienced.There are a lot of sites that claim the ability to build mobile apps in minutes, but many of them clearly are spammy crap.I tried to sort through as many as I could to come up with this short list of mobile app builder platforms: AppBotic - Mobile app builder supporting iPhone, iPad, Android and HTML5 with no visible support for APIs.</p>
