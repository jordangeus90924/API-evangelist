        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/06/07/api-office-hours-with-google-calendar/">API Office Hours with Google Calendar</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Jun 2011</span>
        Google Calendar has a <a title="new feature for managing appointment slots" href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=190998">new feature for managing "Appointment Slots"</a>. These appointment slots are a great way to let others know preferred times when you are available.<p></p>
Open office hours are becoming a common way for API providers to communicate times when developers can connect with someone in person or online via chat for support. Google Calendar appointment slots area great way to manage API office hours.<p></p>
<strong>Creating API Office Hours
</strong>To get started, set up blocks of time you'd like to offer as API hours. Simply click anywhere on your calendar and then on "appointment slots. From there, create a single block of time or automatically split a larger block of time into smaller appointment slots if applies.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-1.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
<strong>Publishing API Office Hours</strong>
Every Google Calendar has its own personal appointments sign up page; you can embed it on your website or give the URL directly to registered API developers. You can find the URL for your appointment page at the top of the set-up page, which you can access via the edit details link.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-4.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
<strong>Signing Up for API Hours</strong>
When someone visits your sign up page, their calendar is overlaid for convenience and they can sign up directly for any available appointment slot.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-2.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
When they sign up, Google Calendar conveniently creates a new shared event on both of your calendars.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-3.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
Making yourself available to developers is important.  API office hours can be used for premium support, limited time support, or just open time to share a pint with your developers and other people in the industry.

     <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/apple/apple-icloud.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />Lots of big news coming out of <a title="Apple's World Wide Developer Conference" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference</a> (WWDC2011) in San Francisco today.
</p>
<p>
     There were major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion. What really stood out was their new <a title="iCloud" href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>.
</p>
<p>
     iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for all music, photos, books, documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.
</p>
<p>
     Although this line of thought is nothing new, with Apple going all in…it means the cloud has gone mainstream.
</p>
<p>
     Get ready for some major growth in the cloud as Apple pushes it further, and other existing cloud providers try to compete.

Kandaswamy offered some practical advice for retail companies that are deciding how and where to start with their API deployments.  His suggestions included the following areas:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Product APIs</strong>- Make your product catalog available via your API is fundamental.</li>
	<li><strong>Store APIs </strong>- Give local store information including location and product availability is powerful.</li>
	<li><strong>Review APIs </strong>- Deliver practical product reviews in a usable way to help consumer make purchasing decisions.</li>
	<li><strong>Commerce APIs</strong> - Provide seamless purchasing and product fulfillment through at-home delivery, in-store pick-up, partner e-commerce sites, and web-based applications.</li>
</ul>
Those four areas just make sense, as they seamlessly bridge the physical retail and online retail consumer experience and extend the Best Buy brand in entirely new ways.  While there may be other innovative ways that retailers can utilize APIs, these are a great place to start.

        <div class="c1"></div>Providing some real-world examples, Mashery invited four leaders in the API space to speak:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Daniel Jacobsen" href="http://twitter.com/#!/daniel_jacobson">Daniel Jacobson</a>, Director of Engineering for <a title="Netflix API" href="http://developer.netflix.com/">Netflix API</a> who walked us through how APIs are allowing them to stream video to over 200 devices, resulting in Netflix dominating in their space.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Kumar Kandaswamy" href="http://twitter.com/#!/Kumar_K">Kumar Kandaswamy</a>, Director, <a title="Open API Platform Business for Best Buy" href="http://www.bbyopen.com/">Open API Platform Business for Best Buy</a> showed us how APIs have enabled them to extend their brand with the help of partners in ways they never could have done on their own.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Adam Kleinberg" href="http://twitter.com/#!/adamkleinberg">Adam Kleinberg</a>, CEO of <a title="Traction" href="http://www.tractionco.com/">Traction</a> and Mashable.com Tech Writer demonstrated why brands need to focus on having an open API for developers and not get lured into distractions like building apps for single devices.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Edwin Aoki" href="http://twitter.com/#!/edwinaoki">Edwin Aoki</a>, Chief Architect of PayPal/eBay explained how APIs enable you to be more agile, and accelerate new forms of business development, even when your building a global commerce platform where 18% of the worlds online transactions are conducted.
     </li>
</ul>I would say the one point I heard repeated over and over was the importance of understanding who the target audience of your API is. Designing and delivering your API in a way that caters to this audience will help keep development costs focused, network overhead as low as possible, and deliver exactly the tools and resources the most important segments of your audience will need.
<p></p>These were just some of the interesting insights given, into how some of the most successful brands in the space, are using APIs to enable better distribution to consumers, partners and expand their brands globally.

        <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/trojan-horse.gif" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I'm processing all my notes from the 2011 <a title="Glue Conference" href="http://gluecon.com/">Glue Conference</a>, which has been one of the most thought provoking events I've been to this year.<p></p>
The best part of events like Gluecon is you get to hang with some really smart and extremely experienced people.<p></p>
I'm working to understand a new perspective I was exposed to while listening to Mark Suster talk about the Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years.<p></p>
In his talk, he outlined three potential types of platforms:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Platform as a Service </strong>- Platform around core application or business as an API, allowing others to build businesses on top of, and make money.</li>
	<li><strong>Platform as an Extension</strong> - Platform around a core application that offers APIs as an extension for others to build on bringing value back to the core business.</li>
	<li><strong>Platform as a Trojan Horse</strong> - Platform that allows others to build on, taking the risk, and the core business benefits from any value created.</li>
</ul>
As I work my way through the hundreds of available APIS I will definitely be applying what I'm learning...<p></p>
What is the motivation of each of these API platforms?

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">Open vs. Closed APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/open-closed-sign.jpg" alt="" align="right" />With all the buzz around APIs these days, its easy to get swept up in all the hype around open APIs, and miss the mark with your own API deployment.
<p></p>So what do I mean by Open APIs? Open APIs are like Twitter, Twilio and many of Google APIs that are available for anyone to register for a key, and start programming against.
<p></p>Discussions around APIs tend to start here. People often hear about the popularity of these APIs and want to emulate that.
<p></p>If you don't directly have experience with API deployment, I recommend getting your feet wet with a more closed API deployment.
<p></p>Immediately, calling APIs closed sounds bad. Sounds like you are being selfish or exclusive and don't want anyone touching your APIs. Because of this closed APIs don't get the press coverage and discussion they deserve.
<p></p>In reality very few APIs find success in being open. Most API projects will get traction in sharing data and resources with business partners, and even internally between departments within a company.
<p></p>Closed APIs enable you to serve a very limited audience, maintaining control over your data and resources, which is a common concern with API deployment.
<p></p>Within this closed or controlled environment you can get your feet wet with API deployment, gain some experience, then maybe someday the right opportunity for an open API will come along.
<p></p>It's not about Open vs. Closed, its about doing what makes sense and possibly doing both in the long run. I would also like to see more open discussion around best practices with closed API deployment in the press an blogosphere.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/05/30/api-forums-using-get-satisfaction/">API Forums Using Get Satisfaction</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">30 May 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Get Satisfaction" href="http://getsatisfaction.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/get_satisfaction/get_satisfaction_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a title="Get Satisfaction" href="http://getsatisfaction.com/">Get Satisfaction</a> is one way to build API forums that enable productive conversations between an API owner and the developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>Simply engaging your customers in conversation won't earn you the respect of your community  and make your customers happy. Conversations are just a start, it's what you do with them that matter. Get Satisfaction was built on the idea of not simply creating conversations, but creating value from conversations.</p>
<p>Get Satisfaction focuses on outcomes in order to create value, as opposed to the confusing and ineffective taxonomy of traditional forums, it is focused on conversations around four simple, outcome-oriented topic types. This helps keep conversations focused and productive.</p>
<p>Working together with an API community to build a dynamic, social knowledge-base helps developers find answers to their questions on their own time, and often times much faster through traditional support channels. Every answer is publicly searchable, so there's never a need to answer the same question twice. This results in a dramatic reduction in the cost of API support, while greatly improving customer satisfaction at the same time.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/get_satisfaction/get-satisfaction-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Different topics inside of forums are full of opinions, wishes and wants. Opening a community conversation about your API roadmap can help you gather valuable market data you can quickly fold into your API development cycle, communications strategy or program schedule.</p>
<p>Another area often overlooked, is that opening an forum and inviting discussion about your API deepens user engagement, increases the amount of user generated content, and benefits your  search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. (Hopefully you have one?)</p>
<p>Direct interactiion with your developers through open and transparent forums increases satisfaction, loyalty and builds community. This community will give prospective customers a peek behind the curtain of how your API treats developers, make them feel like they belong, and creates a 2-way street of communication your entire ecosystem will benefit from.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Open Data Protocol" href="http://www.odata.org/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/OData_Protocol.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>There is an ever growing amount of data available today and much of this data is now being collected and stored across a wide variety of system, locked into specific applications or formats, making it difficult to access, integrate and share.
<p></p>The <a title="Open Data Protocol" href="http://www.odata.org/">Open Data Protocol (OData)</a> is a Web protocol for querying and updating data that provides a way to unlock data and free it from silos that exist in many applications.
<p></p>OData frees data by applying and building upon existing web technologies like <a title="HTTP" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>, <a title="Atom Publishing Protocoal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub)</a> and <a title="JSON" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/27/api-technology-json/">JSON</a> to provide access to information from a variety of applications, services, and stores.
<p></p>OData emerged from experiences implementing AtomPub clients and servers in a variety of products over the past several years. OData is currently used to expose and access data from relational databases, file systems, content management systems and custom websites.
<p></p>OData works to be consistent with the way the World Wide Web works, adhering to HTTP standards just like RESTful APIs. This reuse of core Web principles allows OData to provide data integration and interoperability across a broad range of clients, servers, services, and tools.
<p></p>OData is released under the <a title="Open Specification Promise" href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/default.mspx">Open Specification Promise</a> and allows anyone to be involved with OData implementations.

        <span class="post-date">28 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Evrythng" href="http://www.evrythng.net/index.html"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Evrythng-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>We are in the middle of an era of unprecedented growth in the number of available web APIs. In March 2011 <a title="ProgrammableWeb hit 3000 APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">ProgrammableWeb hit 3000 APIs</a> in its directory, and is already up to 3,287 APIs as of today.
<p></p>This is nothing. If you want a glimpse into the future of APIs, take a look at <a title="Evrythng" href="http://www.evrythng.net/index.html">Evrythng</a>.
<p></p>Evrythng allows you to create online presence for any sort of object - products, business assets, vehicles, trees, buildings, and beyond.
<p></p>Evrythng then gives you a management system to organise and operate an online presence forobjects, storing active profiles and updates, controlling access, and tracking usage. Evrythng creates a unique online identity for every object, providing a presence on the Web through a globally accessible URI.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Evrythng-Sensors.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Now this is where it really gets good. Evrythng also provides a RESTful API toolset and secure software �infrastructure' to share, manage and access real-time information about physical things.
<p></p>Using the Evrythng API, you can directly connect real world objects and databases to Evrythng, allowing developers to mashup object information, add and exchange information with other objects, then combine and coordinate information and interaction across multiple applications and interfaces.
<p></p>Evrythng wants to be the �Facebook for Things', giving physical things an individualdigital profile, and share real-time object information in a managed way.
<p></p>If you think there are a lot of web APIs now, wait until every object on earth can potentially be accessed through APIs.

     </li>
</ul>I don't feel the need to defend Google here, I wish to only defend APIs against people blaming them for what is the fault or responsibility of developers and API owners. I see this same line of attacks on APIs anytime an API company makes a change in their strategy, and developers freak out!
<p></p><strong>First</strong>, let's start with the claims that developers are having the rug pulled out from under them, and you can't build a business on APIs!
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/TweetDeck-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />This week I was fortunate enough to hear <a title="Mark Suster" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04AG3UHUIJE">Mark Suster of GRP Partners</a> talk at <a title="Glue Conference Mark Suster" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Gluecon on Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years</a>. One important point he made about business platforms and startups (ie. TweetDeck) is <strong><span class="c2">you need to have multiple data sources</span></strong>. Without expanding to LinkedIn, Buzz, and Facebook TweetDeck would have been left with only a single data source, and left completely vulnerable.
<p></p>This is a pretty basic concept when it comes to business. If I start a corner deli, and buy my food from a single food distribution company that delivers every Thursday by truck. Then one Thursday the truck doesn't come, and i'm left for the weekend without any food for my restaurant. Is it valid for me to claim that food distribution companies are no way to build a restaurant?
<p></p>Even in the case of TweetDeck, using a very unique API (ie. Twitter), they had to diversify with other services. If your building a business around Google Translate API, what sort of plan B and C do you have built into your code? Are you using any of the free or paid solutions out there like <a title="Translated.net" href="http://www.translated.net/en/translation-api">Translated.net</a>, <a title="Wordlingo" href="http://www.worldlingo.com/en/products/worldlingo_api.html">WordLingo</a>, <a title="Microsoft Translator" href="http://www.microsofttranslator.com/dev/">Microsoft Translator</a>, <a title="Apertium" href="http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Apertium_web_service">Apertium</a>, or <a title="ICanLocalize" href="http://www.icanlocalize.com/site/">ICanLocalize</a>?
<p></p>Please don't blame APIs because developers don't have a business strategy, or because bloggers are looking for a sensational headline.
<p></p><strong>Second</strong>, let's take a look at Google's approach to Google Translate API. The primary reason Google gave for depracting Google Translate API was:
<blockquote>
     <em>Due to the substantial economic burden caused by extensive abuse, the number of requests you may make per day will be limited and the API will be shut off completely on December 1, 2011.</em>
</blockquote>I can't help but think, this problem could have been curbed, by bringing Google Translate API under metered billing using the <a title="Google Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google Console</a>,as other APIs appear to be heading. This would give a low ceiling of free daily calls on the API, then make users pay for more access.
<p></p>Except I really don't think Google wants to make its money from translation services, they are focused on where translation supports their core business. World Domination! Wait, no maybe it is search.
<p></p>If you notice translation is still available in other areas like Google Docs API for translating documents on upload, and in Gmail for translating emails, and Chrome for translating web pages. And of course you can still use the <a title="web interface for Google Translate" href="http://translate.google.com/">web interface for Google Translate</a>.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-translate.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />So you will still see Google Translate in use where it supports Google's core business. I can see just about any other business making a similar decision.
<p></p>Also, Google did reach out to communicate the impending deprecation, they called my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>, and briefed her on the plan. I assume they reached out to others as well.
<p></p>I would add, that Google could do a better job of communicating their roadmap of various APIs and how they will work to support the core Google set of services, or be offered as a service by themselves. As I watch the Google API ecosystem being pulled together and organized, I still can't quite tell whether the vision is to purely serve the primary Google vision, or provide a wide set of APIs that developers can build businesses on, as recent moves with Google Console might suggest.

        <span class="post-date">27 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Seevl" href="seevl.net"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/seevl_logo1.png" alt="" align="right" /></a><a title="Seevl" href="seevl.net">Seevl</a>, a music discovery service that provides anew way to explore the cultural and musical universe of various artists, just launched an API with the assistance of <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>.
<p></p>When deploying the API, Seevl approached it a little differently than most. Instead of providing a separate API to access data, Seevl relies on content negotiation principles to deliver alternative representations of web pages.
<p></p>This means the entire Seevl website is the API and you can get JSON representations of almost every page in the site.
<p></p>Seevl relies on HTTP headers to let developers request data using a particular content-types, and authenticate using three parameters:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Accept</strong> - The content-type required
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>X_APP_ID</strong> - Developer application ID
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>X_APP_KEY</strong> - Developer application Key
     </li>
</ul>Here is an example search results for beatles using curl:
<p></p><script src="https://gist.github.com/996079.js?file=Seevl%20API%20Request" type="text/javascript">
</script>
<p></p>This approach is meant to make it easier for to developers focus on the development and let the Seevl client libraries handle the content-negotiation.
<p></p>The <a title="Seevl API" href="http://developers.seevl.net/">Seevl API</a> provides everal methods to search and pull specific data about individual bands and artists and related information.
<p></p>While this approach is nothing new, its an interesting way to provide users with HTML views and developers with the JSON representations of information stored in a database.

        <span class="post-date">27 May 2011</span>
        Google has had a busy year when it comes to APIs. So far this year they've launched 6 new APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Google Tasks API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/tasks/index.html">Tasks API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Books API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/books/">Books API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Pagespeed Online API" href="https://code.google.com/apis/pagespeedonline/index.html">Pagespeed Online API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Places API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/places/">Places API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Prediction API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/predict/">Prediction API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Fusion Tables API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/fusiontables/">Fusion Tables API</a>
     </li>
</ul>As they add APIs to their directory they have also provided <a title="Google Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google Discovery Service</a> to help developers find APIs, <a title="Google Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google Explorer</a> to start working with APIs, and <a title="Google Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google Console</a> for developers to manage the APIs they integrate with.
<p></p>With the addition of new APIs, some of the older APIs are rendered obsolete with new versions of the API, while others are just shutdown for not getting traction.
<p></p>The following APIs are now deprecated but have no scheduled shutdown date:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Code Search API
     </li>
     <li>Diacritize API
     </li>
     <li>Feedburner APIs
     </li>
     <li>Finance API
     </li>
     <li>Power Meter API
     </li>
     <li>Sidewiki API
     </li>
     <li>Wave API
     </li>
</ul>While these APIs will be shut down per the deprecation policies outlined in their documentation:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Blog Search API
     </li>
     <li>Books Data API
     </li>
     <li>Books JavaScript API
     </li>
     <li>Image Search API
     </li>
     <li>News Search API
     </li>
     <li>Patent Search API
     </li>
     <li>Safe Browsing API (v1 only)
     </li>
     <li>Translate API
     </li>
     <li>Transliterate API
     </li>
     <li>Video Search API
     </li>
     <li>Virtual Keyboard API
     </li>
</ul>Google provides lengthy deprecation periods as long as 3 years in some cases, along with alternative APIs in other situations. The move is part of a larger effort to free up resources for other projects and make the overall Google API ecosystem a much more organized world.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/05/26/loggly-introduces-user-defined-variable-pricing/">Loggly Introduces User Defined, Variable Pricing</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Loggly" href="http://www.loggly.com/">Loggly</a> recently changed the structure for their cloud-based logging service from a tiered pricing, to a <a title="user-defined variable pricing structure" href="https://www.loggly.com/pricing/">user-defined variable pricing structure</a>.
<p></p>Users can define their own pricing tier using two key variables:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Daily Log Volume - 200MB to 8 GB
     </li>
     <li>Log Retention Time - 1 Week to 180 Days
     </li>
</ul>The pricing change was in response to a growing user base, and demand for volumes greater than 2GB/day.
<p></p>Loggly still offers a free plan which supports 200MB/day and retention of 7 days. There is also a beginning paid plan that starts with 200MB/day, but has retention of 15 days, starting at $8/month.
<p></p>Loggly is also adding support for secure syslog (TLS), HTTPs on web inputs, and log archives on all account levels including the free plan.
<p></p>This is a great example of Software as a Service (SaaS) and API service providers innovating around monetization and trying to find the best approach that fits their customers needs and the services they offer.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Games.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Tomorrow I'm participating in a session at <a title="Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers</a>.
<p></p><a title="Justin Tormey" href="http://twitter.com/#!/justintormey">Justin Tormey</a> of Alcatel-Lucent will be talking some about segmentation of API developers to focus on the different types personalities wtihin an API ecosystem.
<p></p>Focusing outside of Gluecon for a moment, Facebook has been doing a good job of this type of platform segmentation. Yesterday they launched <a title="facebook + Games" href="http://www.facebook.com/fbandgames">Facebook + Games</a>, a page created for the the Facebook games partner and business community. The Facebook Page will focus on social gaming innovation, directly from the Facebook Games Partnerships Team.
<p></p>I wrote about the the <a title="Journalist on Facebook" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/17/beyond-partners-and-developers-with-your-api/">Journalist on Facebook</a> page last month, and how Facebook is targeting media and journalist with a similar Facebook Partner Platform page. This was another example of their API platform segmentation.
<p></p>This type of segmentation is key to success within a growing developer ecosystem, not all developers are created equal. Make sure you identify the differences within your community, and provide resources targeted to these gorups.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/gluecon.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I'm preparing for another talk tomorrow at the <a title="Glue Conference" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/">Glue conference</a> in Colorado. Glue is a conference that assists architects, developers, administrators and integrators in solving problems around web application integration.
<p></p>Glue is about all of bits and pieces, APIs and meta-data, standards and connectors that will help us to glue together the varying applications of the new platform.
<p></p>I'm on a panel at Glue called, <a title="Whats Next for APIs" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Whats Next for APIs</a>?. I'm stoked to be invited along with some major players in the API space:

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Querly's aggregation of social media profiles" href="http://qwerly.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Qwerly-A-Data-API-for-the-Social-Web.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>The modern Web API got its start in CRM with <a title="Salesforce" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, and in E-commerce with <a title="Ebay" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">Ebay</a> and <a title="Amazon" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a>, but it really found traction with social platforms like <a title="Flickr" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>, <a title="Twitter" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-twitter/">Twitter</a>, and <a title="Facebook" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-facebook-development-platform/">Facebook</a>.
<p></p>If we want a glimpse of whats next for APIs we need to look at the areas where web APIs have been applied for the longest. We need to look at examples like<a title="Amazon's integration of their affiliate program with their Product API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/06/amazon-affiliate-is-integrated-with-product-api/">Amazon's integration of their affiliate program with their Product API</a>, and <a title="Querly's aggregation of social media profiles" href="http://qwerly.com/">Qwerly's aggregation of social media profiles</a> into a single API.
<p></p>The social space is an area where the future of APIs is being played out right now. Since the social arena has reached a critical mass in the number of platforms, users, mobile apps, and available Web APIs, the sector has matured beyond other industries, and offers great insight into what the future holds.
<p></p>I've talked about <a title="unified APIs that allow you to work with multiple APIs through a single interface" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/02/unified-apis-or-api-standards-the-race-is-on/">unified APIs that allow you to work with multiple APIs through a single interface</a>, and the <a title="potential of API discovery services for industry or common API areas" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/discovery-services-for-common-apis/">potential of API discovery services for industry or common API areas</a>, but Qwerly's approach offers another view.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/qwerly.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><a title="Qwerly" href="http://qwerly.com/">Qwerly</a> aggregates social profiles across many networks into a single dead-simple data API for the social web.
<p></p>With Qwerly you can get data about a user by querying the API with an email address or a social identifier, like a Twitter handle, a Facebook username or a Facebook ID, and the Qwerly API returns:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>the person's name
     </li>
     <li>their location
     </li>
     <li>a short description, like a Twitter bio
     </li>
     <li>their social networking profiles and usernames across the web, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks
     </li>
     <li>a score of their online influence among their peers, like <a title="Kout" href="http://beta.klout.com/home">Klout</a>
     </li>
</ul>Qwerly API responses are delivered in JSON, and you only pay for what you use. The API combines information from web crawling, public web directories, other APIs with powerful heuristics and spam-detection algorithms, delivering high quality results.
<p></p>Other industries and sectors can benefit from such data and service discovery APIs, deployed in a RESTful way, using a pay for what you use API pricing model.

        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-1.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I was writing a story for <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> tonight on the enhancements Google made recently to its API console.<p></p>
I hadn't properly covered the <a title="API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">API Console</a>, <a title="API Explorer" href="http://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">API Explorer</a> here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, so I took the time, played with more, and wrote up overviews for each.<p></p>
I noticed something while reviewing Google's recent efforts to organize their family of <a title="88 APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?company=Google">88 APIs</a>, and make it easier to discover, integrate, and manage for developers.<p></p>
Google is taking a similar approach to managing their APIs, as <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, and <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3Scale.net">3Scale</a> does for other API providers.<p></p>
<a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, and <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a> provide a wealth of knowledge when it comes to API deployment that very few companies can touch.<p></p>
Beyond expertise, they provide a set of <a title="common building blocks every API should offer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks every API should offer</a>.  These are tools like forums and blogs you can find elsewhere, but these API service providers deliver in a neat bundle ready to go for your API.<p></p>
But the real value they bring to the table, that you can't really find anywhere else is:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API Billing</li>
	<li>API Traffic Controls</li>
	<li>API Metrics &amp; Analytics</li>
</ul>
And Apigee has one other piece that Mashery and 3Scale do not.  They have an <a title="API Explorer" href="http://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
<a title="Google provides an API explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google provides an API Explorer</a>, and they have open sourced the code, and <a title="made it available at Google Code" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-apis-explorer/">made it available at Google Code</a>.<p></p>
Next the <a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a> delivers billing and traffic controls, if this set of tools were made open source, this would be huge for the API community.<p></p>
I've been a big proponent of the need for <a title="open source building blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/">open source API building blocks</a>.  I say this not to devalue what Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale bring to the table.  Their stuff rocks.  However there are many other API owners out there who aren't ready for a service like theirs, or can't afford, and a set of open source building blocks is needed.<p></p>
That leaves metrics and analytics.  I think an open source set of API analytics would be the biggest benefit to the industry.   Some APIs don't need billing tools, but everyone needs to measure and control traffic.    I have talked about the need for an <a title="open source set of aPI metrics and analytics" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">open source set of API metrics and analytics</a> before.<p></p>
So I guess I'm saying to Google, Please open source your API Console, like you did the API explorer.  It will benefit the community a great deal, we will deal with API analytics next.

        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        The <a title="Google APIs Explorer" href="http://code.google.com/apis/explorer/" target="_blank">Google APIs Explorer</a> is is a tool that helps you explore various <a title="Google APIs" href="http://code.google.com/more/" target="_blank">Google APIs</a> in a web interface without writing any code.<p></p>
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Explorer.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Google APIs Explorer allows you to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Browse quickly through available APIs and versions</li>
	<li>See methods available for each API and available parameters</li>
	<li>Execute API requests for any method and see actual responses in real time.</li>
	<li>Make pubic or authenticated API calls</li>
</ul>
The GoogleAPIs Explorer currently supports only JSON for responses and request payloads, even though some APIs support other data formats like XML and AtomPub.<p></p>
The Google APIsExplorer provides an quick access tool for developers to discover what APIs Google offers, and enables users to immediately start using.<p></p>
This type of discovery and instant visualization can be the difference between API adoption or choosing to go with an alternative.<p></p>
Google APIs Explorer supports the following APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Google Buzz API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/" target="_blank">Buzz</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Custom Search API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/customsearch/" target="_blank">Custom Search</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Diacritize API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/language/diacritize/overview.html" target="_blank">Diacritize</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Moderator API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/moderator/" target="_blank">Moderator</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Search API for Shopping" href="http://code.google.com/apis/shopping/search/" target="_blank">Search API for Shopping</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Language API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/language/" target="_blank">Language API</a></li>

        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-apis-discovery-filing-cabinet.png" alt="" align="right" />The<a title="Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/index.html">Google APIs Discovery Service</a> provides a set of web APIs for discovering metadata across Google APIs.<p></p>
The discovery service delivers a JSON-based API that provides a directory of supported Google APIs, and a machine-readable discovery document"for each of the supported APIs that includes:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>List of API resource schemas based on JSON Schema</li>
	<li>List of API methods and available parameters for each method</li>
	<li>Available OAuth 2.0 scopes for each API</li>
	<li>Inline documentation of methods, parameters and available parameter values</li>
</ul>
Developers can use the Google APIs Discovery Service to build client libraries, IDE plugins and other tools that interact with supported Google APIs.<p></p>
The Google APIs Discovery Service delivers two things for each supported API:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>APIs Directory Resource</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Identification and description information, including name, version, title, and description.</li>
	<li>Documentation information, including icons and a documentation link.</li>
	<li>Status information, including status labels, and an indication as to whether or not this is the preferred version of the API.</li>
	<li>Discovery document link, the URI of the discovery document for this API</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Discovery Document Resource</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Schemas, which is a list of API resource schemas that describe the data you have access to in each API</li>
	<li>Methods, including a list of API methods and available parameters for each method.</li>
	<li>OAuth scopes, which identifies the list of OAuth scopes available for this API.</li>
	<li>Inline documentation, which provides brief descriptions of schemas, methods, parameters and available parameter values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The Google APIs Discovery Service is part of a larger effort by Google to get a handle on their growing number of APIs.  Developers find themselves potentially using multiple Google APIs across many application or client projects.<p></p>
The Google APIs Discovery Service allows developers to find new APIs available in the directory and programmatically discover how the API authenticates, what methods, and parameters are available.<p></p>
Not many companies have the number of APIs that Google has, and would need an API discovery service.  But with the recent growth in web APIs there will be more of a need for API discovery services within specific areas or industries.

        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google_apis_box_sdk.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />The <a title="Google APIs Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/#project:111046942866">Google APIs Console</a> is an interface for developers to manage and view traffic data, authentication, and billing information for up to 15 Google APIs, and more coming soon.<p></p>
Developers can bundle a collection of APIs into a project, and manage the following project information:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Activated APIs</strong> - APIs can be activated to enable traffic monitoring, filtering, and billing, and API-specific project pages.</li>
	<li><strong>Traffic information </strong>- Console reports show traffic information for each activated API, and allow for capping or filtering of usage for each API.</li>
	<li><strong>Billing information </strong>- APIs now can have billing activated, allowing them to exceed the courtesy usage quota. Usage fees are billed using Google Checkout and charges are invoiced monthly.</li>
	<li><strong>Project keys</strong> - Each project can be identified by either an API key or an OAuth 2.0 token. Using this key/token in API requests will identify the project, and enable the recording of usage data, filtering restrictions, and bill usage to the proper project. Within the Console developers can  generate or revoke API keys or OAuth 2.0 certificates for specific application.</li>
	<li><strong>Team members </strong>- Team members can be established with read, write, or ownership access to each project's Console page.</li>
</ul>
The Google APIs Console supports fifteen separate Google APIs:

</ul>
The Google APIs Console provides a pretty comprehensive set of tools for developers and companies to manage their projects that integrate with various Google APIs.<p></p>
The traffic control and billing tools provide a peek into the future of how billing and monetization will occur for APIs as they become more of a utility in our every day lives.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Discovery-Service.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />I just wrote about the potential of<a title="open source billing and traffic control" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">open source API billing and traffic control</a> building blocks, if Google would open source their <a title="API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a>, like they did with the <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
I started bundling in thoughts on <a title="Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/index.html">Google APIs Discovery Service</a> into that post, but then realized it is a separate issue, needing its own blog post.<p></p>
First, Google isn't about to open source Google API Discovery Service.  They issue developers of the Google APIs Discovery Service a <a title="patent license" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/patent-license.html">patent license</a>.  I couldn't find any more details tonight, but I'm assuming it puts this service in a different category than the rest.<p></p>
I wrote an <a title="overview of the Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">overview of Google APIs Discovery Service</a>, but essentially it is a way to discover and describe Google APIs using an API.  Think <a title="Web Application Discovery Language (WADL)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, with a API to access, and focused only on supported Google APIs.<p></p>
As the number of web APIs grow, the need for a discovery APIs and a standard description language will only grow.  We wil see services like Google APIs Discovery Service popup within specific industries and API areas.<p></p>
You see potential for this with <a title="Mashery's API Netowrk" href="http://developer.mashery.com/apis">Mashsery's API Network,</a> and even more evidence with <a title="Mashape's Marketplace" href="http://www.mashape.com/index">Mashape's Marketplace</a>.<p></p>
There aren't many companies with the number of APIs that Google has, so you won't see any single company building an API discovery service like that.<p></p>
However, I'd like to see API discovery services for cloud computing, social media, location-based, and telcommunication APIs appear making it easier for developers to discover, build code libraries, and integrate with common APIs.

<p>Of course this is virtual warehouse space, but it has a lot of the same characteristics of warehousing for physical products.</p>
<p>Google provides a <a title="3D Warehouse" href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/">3D Warehouse</a> for users of its <a title="SketchUp" href="http://sketchup.google.com/">SketchUp</a> softare, and <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> provides a marketplace and warehouse in the form a <a title="Gallery" href="http://www.shapeways.com/gallery">gallery</a> for its creators.</p>
<p>Cloud Storage will definitely have a role to play in warehousing the growing number of 3D modeling files using platforms like <a title="Google Docs" href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>, <a title="Box.net" href="http://Box.net">Box.net</a>, and <a title="Dropbox" href="/admin/blog/www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>3D Warehouses need to provide search-able, sharable and collaborative spaces that are affordable for designers to store and retrieve their work.</p>
<p>As 3D printing becomes a larger part of the global manufacturing supply chain, virtual warehousing across the globe will also become necessary to provide localized storage solutions.</p>
<p>3D printing offers significant advantages over traditional manufacturing when it comes to warehousing, but it still will be a critical part of the <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>

Someones idea to recreate an existing object, or a vision of an object they hold in their head.<p></p>
The evolution of 3D modeling software and 3D printers is creating a whole new generation of designers and creators.<p></p>
These 3D creators come from many walks of life; architects, product designers, graphic designers, artists. and beyond.<p></p>
Creators can build entire finished products, ranging from dinnerware to architectural components.<p></p>
Creators can also build parts and pieces of finished projects from nuts and bolts to replacement parts.<p></p>
3D designers and creators are often independent hobbyists and freelancers, but there are also a growing number of agencies and larger shops that are evolving along with 3D printing.<p></p>
Creators are just the first link in an evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.

<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</a></strong> - SLS is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired 3-dimensional shape.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography">Stereolithography (SLA)</a> </strong>- Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process using a vat of liquid UV-curable photopolymer resin and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling">Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)</a></strong> - FDM works on an additive principle by laying down material in layers. A plastic filament or metal wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which can turn on and off the flow.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_object_manufacturing">Laminate Object Manufacturing (LOM)</a></strong> - LOM is a rapid prototyping system that layers adhesive-coated paper, plastic, or metal laminates are successively glued together and cut to shape with a knife or laser cutter.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are four of the common 3D printing methodologies and since the introduction of metal, 3D printing has moved past prototyping and art and has become a viable manufacturing technology.</p>
<p>3D printing processes and materials are the link that  allows virtual to become physical in the <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>

<p>Marketplaces will also go beyond showcasing 3D models, and actually act as marketplaces where items can be bid upon, creating virtual economies around 3D manufacturing.</p>

<p>File formats often depend on the type of 3D modeling software used, but there are many common formats:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>.<strong>stl</strong> - STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems.</li>
<li>.<strong>iges</strong> - The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) (pronounced eye-jess) defines a neutral data format that allows the digital exchange of information among Computer-aided design (CAD) systems.</li>
<li>.<strong>obj</strong> - OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted by other 3D graphics application vendors. For the most part it is a universally accepted format.</li>
<li>.<strong>3ds</strong> - 3DS is one of the file formats used by the Autodesk 3ds Max 3D modeling, animation and rendering software.</li>

<p>A 3D scanner is a device that analyzes a real-world object to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance. The resulting data can then be used to construct 3D models.</p>
<p>3D scanning is no replacement for a human designer, but can offer a good start creating a 3D representation.</p>
<p>Each 3D scanner has its benefits and limitations, and resulting data will always need much work before it can be used in 3D printing.</p>
<p>3D scanners can offer a lot of benefit in rapid prototyping, and reverse engineering of existing objects.</p>
<p>Just like 3D printers you will find a wide range of 3D scanners, in both functionality and price.</p>

Facebook employee Simon Cross developed a <a title="Facebook Graph API Explorer" href="https://www.simoncross.com/fb/graph/">Facebook Graph API explorer</a> for developers to use when working with the <a title="Facebook Graph API" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Facebook Graph API</a>.<p></p>
The explorer lets developers specify and endpoint, and generate a JSON response, with or without an user login access token.<p></p>
Developers can also use the <a title="Facebook Graph API Explorer" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/16/the-semi-unofficial-facebook-graph-api-explorer/">Facebook Graph API explorer</a> for working FQL, which is the Facebook Query Language.<p></p>

        Canada's <a title="Yellow Pages Group" href="http://www.ypg.com/en/">Yellow Pages Group (YPG)</a> launched a new developer ecosystem to support their local search and location based services (LBS) API, <a title="YellowAPI.com" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/">YellowAPI.com</a>.
<p></p><a title="YellowAPI.com" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/yellowAPI/yellow-api.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>YPG sees their developer ecosystem much differently than many other companies, they view the YellowAPI as a direct extension of its core business model, and the API dramatically extends the reach of its business network.
<p></p>Within many API communities, the API owners can often seem distant from developers, or even view the development community as a problem.
<p></p>As a developer I've experienced the limitations imposed by Twitter and Facebook, and I often feel ignored by Google when using their APIs.
<p></p>I see YellowAPI's strategy as the future of API ecosystem management.
<p></p>Developers can <a title="apply to be part of the YPG developer community" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/member/register">apply to be part of the YellowAPI.com developer community</a>, once approved they gain access to a wealth of resources, including consultation on application design, quality assurance, legal guidance, technical assistance and can receive funding assistance to take their applications live.
<p></p>In addition to these resources, YellowAPI.com provides opportunities for developers to monetize applications in the following ways:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Paid Search</strong> - Paying for volumes of high quality traffic from applications
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Wigets</strong> - Group buying solutions in Canada and "Deal of the Day" widgets
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Advertising</strong> - Platform specific digital ad network provided by Mediative
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Placement</strong> - Premium paid search using mobile placement products
     </li>
</ul>These aren't side opportunities invented just for the API, they represent YPG's core business.
<p></p><a title="Yellow Pages Group" href="http://www.ypg.com/en/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/yellowAPI/yellow-pages-group.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>Since YPG sees the API and its ecosystem as an extension of their core business, they are opening up revenue sharing opportunities for approved developers within its community.
<p></p>If the YellowAPI community is successful in building sustainable business applications, YPG benefits. And because of the forward thinking API ecosystem strategy, when YPG makes money, the API developer community shares in this revenue.
<p></p>How do you monetize your API, and where do your developers fit in?

Pearson's Plug &amp; Play Platform claims to unlock the company's large content bank which ranges from <a title="Dorling Kindersley (DK) Publishing" href="http://us.dk.com/">Dorling Kindersley (DK) Publishing's</a> illustrated guides to Pearson Education textbooks.<p></p>
The new API platform will allow developers to mash up Pearson content with other content and data to derive entirely to types of web, mobile and tablet products.<p></p>
Pearson's Future Technologies Group Product Manager, <a title="Diane Stepner" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dianas">Diana Stepner</a>, says:
<blockquote><em>We recognise the world has changed and our content needs to be available for innovative uses outside Pearson. Plug &amp; Play opens up opportunities for DK and Pearson to connect with developers who are seeking the rich content we can share.</em></blockquote>
Pearson will be running initial platform tests using DK's Eyewitness Travel Guide material, then moving on to a wider range of subjects from science and natural history to gardening, parenting and early learning.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/publishing/dk-publishing.gif" alt="" width="175" align="right" /><p></p>
While it sounds promising that the world's largest education technology company is opening up its content via an API platform, Pearson doesn't reveal much information about just what this will entail.  What sorts of content will developers have access to?  What will access cost?  How will developers be able to monetize and license their projects that are based on the API?<p></p>
More details will be forthcoming, as Pearson says the Plug &amp; Play Platform is slated for launch in early 2012.

Affiliate members can earn up to 15% in commission for referrals to the site that result in a purchase.<p></p>
Amazon also provides a <a title="Product Advertising API" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html?ie=UTF8&amp;pf_rd_t=501&amp;ref_=amb_link_84018271_9&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=&amp;pf_rd_s=assoc-right-1&amp;pf_rd_r=&amp;pf_rd_i=assoc_join_menu">Product Advertising API</a> for its more tech savvy affiliates to take advantage of.<p></p>

In addition to having access to the millions of products in its catalog, the Product Advertising API lets developers leverage Amazon's other features such as customer reviews, similar products, accessories, and listmania lists.<p></p>
The most important aspect of Amazons approach to its affiliate and API offerings is that it automatically formats the URLs returned by the API to include the associate tag, which is the piece that links a referral and purchase to a developers affiliate account.<p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/05/05/hazards-of-developers-evangelist-for-an-api/">Hazards of Developers Evangelist for an API.</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/mimeo_connect_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I'm working to make it easier to get up and running using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
One concept that is tough to understand at first, is that all printing starts with a Mimeo document.<p></p>
Then using the API you can either order that document as is, or merge one or many PDF documents with it, generate a dynamic document, then order this new document.<p></p>
As part of our API, we have a Document Listing Service, except it only pulls documents from a central account I have control of.<p></p>
So if you want to pull one of the documents you created, you have to actually pull the Document ID from your My Mimeo account.<p></p>
Sounds easy right?  Well its available in the URL, and in a properties screen for the document.<p></p>
The Document ID is a GUID, for those of you who don't know what a GUID is:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A globally unique identifier or GUID (pronounced /??u??d/ or /??w?d/) is a unique reference number used as an identifier in computer software</em>
<em>So a Document ID looks like this:</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301</em>
Except for some reason the one that shows in My Mimeo is missing the dashes, and doesn't work when you pass through the API.<p></p>
So I ask my API developer, where is the easiest place to get the Document ID?<p></p>
He says, "In the URL or as property of document".<p></p>
I explain it doesn't work without dashes.<p></p>
His response is, Developers will understand, and know to put dashes back in.<p></p>
And that is a hazard of putting developers as the public face of your API.<p></p>
They make a lot of assumptions based upon what they know.<p></p>
API Evangelists and developer advocates should definitely have programming skills, but ideally they should have a balance of proramming, business and marketing skills.

As an API Evangelist I look for other APIs that enhance the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>, and try to figure out how I can leverage this, or at least tell the story.<p></p>
<a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a> and the <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a> API have been two of my favorites so far. I also just finished a blog post about <a title="creating classroom and training materials with Crocodoc and Mimeo Connect" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=99">creating classroom training materials with Crocodoc and Mimeo Connect</a>.<p></p>

APIs enable new types of partnerships, and even allow API providers to work together and offer a more collective value.<p></p>
What other APIs do you think compliment each other, and should consider partnering?

        <span class="post-date">03 May 2011</span>
        In 2006, Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase <a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Biz Dev 2.0</a> in a blog post explaining how several small companies had approached Flickr wanting to provide services that the photo-sharing site didn't feature.<p></p>
She noted that Flickr executives had little time in their schedules to arrange meetings to hash out these partnerships, and instead encouraged companies to feel free to apply for a Commercial API key and build something off the API.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /><p></p>
<a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://caterina.net/archive/000996.html">Biz Dev 2.0</a>, she called it.<p></p>
Fast forward to 2011, APIs are a common part of the technology and business landscape.<p></p>
Some API providers have evolved their API offerings into platforms, and introduced self-service application development environments.<p></p>
From the pubic side, these are seen as service or application marketplaces where users can find add-ons they can use as part of the core web application.<p></p>
Think <a title="Google Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Marketplace</a>, <a title="Facebook App Directory" href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/directory.php">Facebook App Directory</a>, and <a title="Box.net OpenBox" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net OpenBox</a>.<p></p>
From the developers point of view these offer environments where they can easily build applications that integrate with an existing platform and user base.<p></p>
From the business perspective this is <a title="Biz Dev 2.5" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/bizdev-2-5-with-apis-and-self-service-platforms/">Biz Dev 2.5</a>.  Let me give you an example.<p></p>
When I started as API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> a project that was already in the works was commercial print integration with <a title="Scribd.com" href="http://www.scribd.com">Scribd.com</a>.   After serveral months of negotiations Mimeo was able to get a button within Scribd, Print to Mimeo.<p></p>
This happened before I was around, but right before I was hired Scribd updated their application to HTML5 and the Print to Mimeo disappeared.<p></p>
To get back on Scribd's development radar would take another round of outreach, discussion and integration into their development schedule.<p></p>
Next on my list of cloud storage provider integration after Scribd, was Box.net.<p></p>
Box.net has an API and a self-service application development environment called <a title="OpenBox" href="http://www.box.net/developers/actions">OpenBox</a>.  I can add my application and integrate it into Box.net without coordinating with Box.net staff.<p></p>
Once ready I can submit for approval in the OpenBox directory, or keep private and just send invites out to users with a link directly to my OpenBox application.<p></p>
I have someone I can email at Box.net and discuss business development opportunities, but I don't have to.  I can do all the work myself.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/box-net-250x161.jpg" alt="" align="right" /><p></p>
I'm able to build an application that uses the APIs of a leading web application provider, launch that application integrated into the platform, and access the existing user-base.   When users choose to use my application it adds actions or navigation options for them that are linked to my service.<p></p>
<a title="APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/api-listing.php">APIs</a> + <a title="self-service application development environments" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application development environments</a> allow for entirely new business opportunities without the overhead of traditional business development, and with deeper integration into partner platforms.

It recognizes that APIs drive much of the Internet from social media and cloud computing to mobile applications.</p>
<p>But while there is plenty of information to get the developer community up and running with APIs, there is a shortage of information that can serve to educate the <em>business</em> community about the business of APIs.</p>
<p>The necessity of having that sort of outreach is one reason why I use the term API Evangelist instead of Developer Advocate.  While yes, developers do still need advocates, I also feel that there needs to be more evangelism to the business community about APIs and their benefits as well.</p>
<p>So I've partnered with my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a> to develop a series of guides targeting the business community.  These aim to educate businesspeople about the coming <a title="API economy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>.</p>
<p>We have just published our first guide:  <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business-of-apis.php">The Business of APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the table of contents:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>What is an API?</li>
<li>Who uses APIs?</li>
<li>What type of technologies go into an API?</li>

<li>Building blocks for a successful API</li>
<li>Fostering an API ecosystem</li>
<li>BizDev 2.5</li>
</ol>
<p>An introduction to APIs, the book is aimed at a business audience, not the developer audience.  I believe that there are a lot of business owners, executives and decision makers out there considering APIs -- they've heard that it's "the thing to do" -- who need to be educated about how APIs work.&nbsp;<a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">The Business of APIs</a> is a primer for just that sort of person.</p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-storage/Box-logo-new.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /> As the <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> API Evangelist one of my jobs is to find other platforms, services and technology that goes well with the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="../../">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
One such platform that I've identified as a Mimeo.com partner platform is <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a>.<p></p>
Box.net provides a complete cloud storage platform, with a powerful developer platform and application directory called OpenBox.<p></p>
Mimeo.com provides commercial web to print services, and with Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API you can integrate print file management from Box.net<p></p>
<em>*** Heads up!! This requires basic understanding of box.net and programming with PHP ***</em><p></p>
To do this I sign up for a <a title="Box.net Developer Account" href="http://www.box.net/developers">Box.net developers account</a> and add new OpenBox application:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Name and Description</li>
	<li>Assign a description page for the application that tells about my printer.</li>
</ul>
An important part of this application is a callback URL for when users first add the Box.net application. This has to be a page you host that handles the Box.net oAuth, which gives this print file manager access to a users account.<p></p>
Another important part of each application are whats called <em>service actions</em>.  Service actions which will show up for any user who adds this application to their Box.net account from OpenBox.<p></p>
For my Open Box Application I create a new service action:  <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/Open-Box.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Service Action a title like, <strong><em>Send Print File toMimeo</em></strong></li>
	<li>Choose which document extensions my print file manager supports, PDF for now</li>
	<li>Enter a callback function which Box.net will send user when printing document</li>
	<li>Enter callback parameters such as URL, Title, Extension of Box.net file to be printed.</li>
</ul>
Save your service action, fill out any other relevant parts of your application and hit save as well.<p></p>
This creates your application at Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need put together the code that integrates Box.net with your Mimeo.com account using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
First you need the OAuth piece of code described above, you can <a title="download at Github" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Box.net">download this at Github</a>.  It requires the following files:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>box_config.php</li>
	<li>boxlibphp5.php</li>
	<li>class.curl.php</li>
	<li>index.php</li>
</ul>
This will allow your print file manager to OAuth with Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need the actual code that lets you pull the file being passed by Box.net and print uses Mimeo.com.<p></p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-storage/Box-logo-new.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />As the <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> API Evangelist one of my jobs is to find other platforms, services and technology that goes well with the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="../../">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
One such platform that I've identified as a Mimeo.com partner platform is <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a>.<p></p>
Box.net provides a complete cloud storage platform, with a powerful developer platform and application directory called OpenBox.<p></p>
Mimeo.com provides commercial printing of many types of bound documents including spiral bound, magazine style, and perfect bound, and with Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API you can integrate printing of these using Box.net<p></p>
<em>*** Heads up!! This requires basic understanding of box.net and programming with PHP ***</em><p></p>
To do this I sign up for a <a title="Box.net Developer Account" href="http://www.box.net/developers">Box.net developers account</a> and add new OpenBox application:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Name and Description</li>
	<li>Assign a description page for the application that tells about the printer.</li>
</ul>
An important part of this application is a callback URL for when users first add the Box.net application. This has to be a page you host that handles the Box.net oAuth, which gives this bound document printer access to a users account.<p></p>
Another important part of each application are whats called <em>service actions</em>.  Service actions which will show up for any user who adds this application to their Box.net account from OpenBox.<p></p>
For my Open Box Application I create a new service action:  <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/Open-Box.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Service Action a title like, <strong><em>Bound Document Printer @ Mimeo</em></strong></li>
	<li>Choose which document extensions my printer supports, PDF for now</li>
	<li>Enter a callback function which Box.net will send user when printing document</li>
	<li>Enter callback parameters such as URL, Title, Extension of Box.net file to be printed.</li>
</ul>
Save your service action, fill out any other relevant parts of your application and hit save as well.<p></p>
This creates your application at Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need put together the code that integrates Box.net with your Mimeo.com account using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
First you need the OAuth piece of code described above, you can <a title="download at Github" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Box.net">download this at Github</a>.  It requires the following files:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>box_config.php</li>
	<li>boxlibphp5.php</li>
	<li>class.curl.php</li>
	<li>index.php</li>
</ul>
This will allow your bound document printer to OAuth with Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need the actual code that lets you pull the file being passed by Box.net and print uses Mimeo.com.<p></p>
Here is a sample code file for doing this:<p></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/950054.js?file=Box.net%20-%20Mimeo%20Connect%20Bound%20Document%20Printer"></script><p></p>
The above code sample demonstrates how to build a <a title="bound" href="../../blog/blog_detail.php?ID=90">bound document printer using Box.net cloud storage and Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
With this bound document printer you can public books, magazines, newsletters, reports and many other types of bound documents.<p></p>
You can build any custom bound document with your Mimeo.com account, with specific binding, paper, folds, covers, and much more.  Then merge this document with any multi-page document from Box..net<p></p>
Any company can build a Box.net Cloud Printer and publish to the OpenBox directory, to allow commercial printing using<p></p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/internal-business-users.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />When it comes to APIs, and who uses them, we often think about partners. Sharing data and resources with partners has long been the number one reason for deploying APIs.
<p></p>With the increased popularity of web APIs, many companies are opening up their APIs to the general public and freelance developers as well.
<p></p>In addition to partner and public developers, there has been a recent trend in APIs being adopted internally, within a company. Many companies are finding success in eating their own dog food and building web and mobile applications using the same API infrastructure offered externally.
<p></p>As an API evangelist, there can be a lot of value in encouraging API adoption by internal users.
<p></p>Internal usage of APIs can increase efficiencies by sharing data and resources between departments and separate company locations.
<p></p>However you can also increase overall company support and resources available to API efforts through internal adoption.
<p></p>With increased internal usage, decision makers within a company see the value first hand and are more willing to approve budgets needed to develop more APIs, tools and resources that can be used by partners, public developers, as well as within the company.
<p></p>Lack of budget and business resources are the number one reason API efforts fail or find limited success.
<p></p>Remember to evangelize internally within your company, not just to partners and the public.

Even with <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/">RESTful</a> approaches to delivering APIs they can be quite different.
<p></p>As APIs grow and as we want to be able to connect apps to multiple inputs and endpoints, there's an increasing need to make the process easier, more streamlined, and interoperable.
<p></p>One example of this is within the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/">cloud computing</a> industry. When using AmazonEC2 and Rackspace, developers have to write separate code to integrate with each platform.
<p></p>Another example is with social networks, when pulling social streams from <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/twitter/">Twitter</a>, developers have to develop separate code for each provider as well.
<p></p>An new approach to solving differences between APIs that deliver similar functionality, but use different approaches, is to build a unified API.
<p></p>Unified APIs bring together multiple APIs into a single interface. Two examples of this are:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DeltaCloud API" href="http://incubator.apache.org/deltacloud/">DeltaCloud API</a> - With the Deltacloud API you can start an instance on an internal cloud, then with the same code start another on <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> or Rackspace.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Windsoc" href="http://www.windsoc.co/">Windsoc API</a></strong> - Using Windsoc API developers can access Facebook, Twitter, GoogleBuzz and other social APIs using a single interface.
     </li>
</ul>Unified APIs do a lot of the work for developers, by providing a single interface to build against, as well as compensating for changes between APIs, and different versions of an API.<a title="Windsoc" href="http://www.windsoc.co/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/windsoc.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a>
<p></p>Cloud computing APIs and social network APIs have been around for a few years now, it makes sense that there is a need for a unified interface.
<p></p>What other industries or types of APIs are in need of an unified API?

<p></p>API contestsand hackathons.
<p></p>API providers like <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> and <a title="Netflix" href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> are using them to attract new users, and to generate buzz and innovation around their API.
<p></p>When I'm out at events, educating business users about APIs, I often get asked about the viability of contests and hackathons to generate free code and applications for an API community.
<p></p>I think there is a common misconception amongst the business community that API owners can get away with not paying developers to build code and applications, by just framing what they want in the form of a contest or hackathon, and developers will all rally, and work for free.
<p></p>While you can potentially develop usable code and applications in this environment, its not always the case, and definitely should not be the focus of an event.
<p></p>API contests and hackathons are purely a marketing vehicle for generating attention around an API. Sure there are some secondary effects, like innovative code, apps, ideas, and developer talent, but these aren't a given.
<p></p>Focus on a healthy, innovative reason for your API contest or hackathon. Apply the resources to make the sure event gets heard about across all relevant developer circles, and when the event happens, make sure it is all about the developers.
<p></p>Envision your API contest or hackathon as the marketing vehicle it is, and the rest take care of itself.

        <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2011</span>
        <p>I'm doing a lot of researching and thinking about the future of commercial printing, 3D printing, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was brainstorming on <a title="3D printing and manufacturing with Google" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/04/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-with-google/">3D printing and manufacturing with Google</a>.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-sketchup/Google-SketchUp.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Tonight I'm learning more about <a title="Google SketchUp" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/">Google SketchUp</a>,which <a title="Google added to Google Apps" href="http://googlesmb.blogspot.com/2010/12/now-available-with-google-apps-google_03.html">Google added toGoogle Apps</a> in December of 2010.</p>
<p>Google SketchUp allows anyone to build 3D models to the <a title="STL file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">STL file format</a>, a standard for the 3D print industry.</p>
<p>3D printers like <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> lets you upload your STL files, print and order them in their physical form..</p>
<p>Google SketchUp provides a free and professional version of the modeling software.</p>
<p>They also provide a <a title="3D Warehouse" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/product/3dwh.html">3D Warehouse</a> where you can find a collection of 3D models that are free to use.</p>
<p>There is a <a title="community of resources" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/community/">community of resources</a> as well as <a title="training" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/training/">training</a> and <a title="education" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/industries/education.html">education</a> materials to learn about the platform.</p>
<p>Everything is there to build models to be used in 3D printing and manufacturing.  The only missing link right now is integration with Google Cloud Print.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/shapeways_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Maybe Google will support STL file printing in the <a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-cloud-print-services-interface/">Google Cloud Print  (GCP) Services Interface</a> soon.</p>
<p>3D printers like Shapeways could register their 3-D printers with GCP like I'm doing with <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a> for commercial printing.</p>

At the same time I'm involved with the rollout of <a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a>, an API for managing printing to any printer over the Internet.<p></p>
I'm using <a title="Google Docs as a Publishing Platform" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-docs-as-a-publishing-platform/">Google Docs as a publishing platform</a>, integrating Google Cloud Print with the <a title="Mimeo Connect API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect API</a> and evolving whats possible with commercial cloud printing.<p></p>
Google has added <a title="Support for many more native file formats in Google Docs" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-docs-file-formats-viewer-web-and-api/">support for many more native file formats in Google Docs</a>.  Now all they need to do is add support for common 3D printing file formats:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>.<a title=".stl file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">stl</a> - STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems.</li>
	<li>.<a title=".iges file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGES">iges</a> - The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) (pronounced eye-jess) defines a neutral data format that allows the digital exchange of information among Computer-aided design (CAD) systems.</li>
	<li>.<a title=".obj file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">obj</a> - OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted by other 3D graphics application vendors. For the most part it is a universally accepted format.</li>
	<li>.<a title=".3ds file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.3ds">3ds</a> - 3DS is one of the file formats used by the Autodesk 3ds Max 3D modeling, animation and rendering software.</li>
</ul>
To support 3D printing file formats I'm sure they will have to introduce a new app to the Google Apps suite or evolve Google Drawings.<p></p>
Google Drawings only supports importing of .wmf files and exporting of .jpg, .pdf, .png, and .svg formats.<p></p>
I'm working on some modifications to the Google Cloud Print capabilities definition via .ppd or .xps for commericial cloud printing, I think we could also bend this definition to support 3D printing and mnufacturing.<p></p>
We have a ways to go, but I see the future of cloud 3D printing and manufacturing unfold in front of us with 3-D printing and cloud printing.

<p></p>One such purpose is harvesting and scraping. I have an extensive library of PHP code I've used in the last 5 years to pull web pages, parse tables, submit forms, and what not.
<p></p>As I'm organizing these snippets of code into <a title="Snippely" href="http://code.google.com/p/snippely/">Snippely</a>, I'm thinking about all the effort I've put into getting content.
<p></p>I've harvested government data, craigslist posting, real estate listings, and a wide variety of news, products, and geo-data.
<p></p>If I need some data, I much prefer using an API, but if I have a need and there is data available on a web page...I just harvest it.
<p></p>If a content provider does not have an open API, I view them much differently than if they do. I see them as a source of content, there is no real relationship. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/harvesting.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> When a content provider has an open API, I will use their API. If the API offers enough value, I will pay to use it, and establish a relationship with the content provider.
<p></p>Content providers will have far more control over their content by providing an open API, even if the content is also available on their site. This control will allow owners to track usage and even monetize it.
<p></p>I would much prefer to pull data and other content from an API rather than scrape or harvest it.

<a title="Phaxio" href="http://www.phaxio.com/">Phaxio</a>, an API that allows developers to <a title="integrating faxing capabilities into application" href="http://www.phaxio.com/">integrate faxing capabilities into their applications</a>, has  email invitation as a main menu option in its API area.<p></p>
The Phaxio API is in private beta, but existing users can send off a Phaxio invitation code that allows other developers to discover and sign up for the faxing service.<p></p>
Application email invites are clearly not something new.  And with the growth of social media, it may be that sharing via Twitter or Facebook has become more associated with the steps necessary to make things "go viral."  Nevertheless, having the ability to send out invitations via email can still provide essential word-of-mouth marketing for your API and shouldn't be overlooked.

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-popularity.png" alt="" width="375" align="right" />How do you measure the popularity of your API, or someone else's API?<p></p>
If its your API, hopefully you have metrics established for every part of your API and supporting API area.<p></p>
But how can we measure the API space as a whole?  I get asked a lot about, what are the top APIs out there.<p></p>
<a title="ProgrammableWeb Measures Popularity" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?sort=mashups">ProgrammableWeb measures popularity</a> by the number of mashups that are built on an API.  Using this metric, Google Maps, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube rise to the top.<p></p>
Not all APIs are suited for mashups, and we definitely need more ideas of how to measure popularity and usage of Open APIs.<p></p>
I would start by using <a title="Alexa" href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a>, <a title="Compete" href="http://www.compete.com/">Compete</a>, and <a title="Quantcast" href="http://www.quantcast.com/">Quantcast</a> who provide SEO related analytics and ranking for web sites.<p></p>
Next I would look at the number of partners an API has showcased in their developers area or web site.<p></p>
After partners I would look for the number of developers showcased as part of an API ecosystem.  Not all APIs provide tools for developers to have a public profile, but if they do, this can be an important measurement.<p></p>
After the number of partner and public users, I would take a close look at how many applications are developed on a platform.  Both internally and community developed applications.  These represent completed projects where developers have successfully integrated with an API.<p></p>
Then I think overall API community activity and resources would be a good thing to measure.  How many code samples, language kits, FAQ, forum posts, and other resources are provided. This reflects the amount of resources a company and community has put into an API.<p></p>
There is no perfect way to measure the success and popularity of an API on the open Internet, but these are a few ideas for variables the industry might consider when developing an algorithm for tracking the popularity of APIs in this fast growing space.

</ul>When I first started working with APIs, I generally focused on API access for partners.
<p></p>With the introduction of Open APIs, I began paying attention to a wider audience of developers from different countries, industries, programming languages and platforms.
<p></p>Recently APIs are also being recognized for their use internally. API owners often target other departments or business locations when deploying or consuming APIs.
<p></p>As the API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a>, I'm seeing a new target emerge, platform partners.
<p></p>Platform partners are tend to be other complimentary APIs and / or <a title="self-service application platforms" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application platforms</a> like <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> and <a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a>.
<p></p>Just like with my partners, public, and internal developers I'm developing specific strategies, code samples, documentation and other tools targeting my designated partner platforms.
<p></p>Partner platforms are quickly becoming an important part of my API ecosystem, we'll see where this trend goes.

        <span class="post-date">20 Apr 2011</span>
        Presentation assets are the user interface or visual front-end to an application.  Logic assets are the algorithms, analytics or services which take data inputs, do some processing and provide a response.  Data is the raw content but can also include simple transformations of the content.  Different services can be linked together to provide a complete application system.<p></p>
It is important to break out of the mind-set that your company has to deliver all three assets.  It is true that traditionally the only way to deliver applications was for a company to own responsibility of all three.  However the World Wide Web and APIs liberate companies from the need to deliver all three.  Now more and more companies benefit if they focus on their unique value-add.  Once you identify your core assets, it becomes clear which complementary assets will be provided by your partners.  Thus to reach a strategy you are satisfied with, follow the simple steps:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>Identify your own core asset(s)</li>
	<li>Choose the complementary asset which will deliver most value</li>
	<li>Define the strategy to capture the value most effectively</li>
</ol>
For example for <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> the core asset that they distribute via their API is data, in the form of the immense stream of 140 character tweets.  They made a decision early in the company history to focus all their resources on this core asset - notwithstanding recent strategy changes where they are trying to re-assert control of more of the Presentation and Logic assets.  This means that with the original strategy the complementary assets were Presentation and Logic assets.  In these two areas the company would build partnerships to deliver enhanced solutions to meet the diverse needs of Twitter users - a far greater variety that Twitter alone could ever deliver.<p></p>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-38112" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/?attachment_id=38112"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38112" src="http://www.3scale.net/wp-content/uploads/Biz-Model-Complementary-and-Core-Assets.png" alt="API Business Model: Core and Complementary Assets" width="542" height="275" /></a><p></p>
Let us say that of the two complementary assets, Twitter decided to focus on Presentation, because they realised that it is critical to get mobile client coverage.  Then the strategy definition was to power mobile apps.  The company defined the specific APIs and a business model that would attract developers to create new mobile front-ends for Twitter.  An example of a Twitter partner that leverages the API to deliver a mobile client and fulfil this strategy is <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a>:<p></p>

<em>Note that the highlighted boxes are not the only assets that the company provides, but rather they indicate the most important, or core asset.  The remaining two are candidates for complementary partners, even if there may be some level of co-opetition.</em>
<h3>Business Model options with an API</h3>
Once the strategy is agreed, you will find that the use of an API opens up new options in the choice of business model.  For each potential business strategy you need to evaluate which is an appropriate business model to execute. The options related to APIs include:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Product / Service</strong>: if the main way for the company to deliver value is through its API e.g. Twilio from the table above.</li>
	<li><strong>Distribution</strong>: to extend the company's reach, the API allows the company's content or services to be accessed from other applications or devices (such as smartphones).  This could be in the form of a channel business model, but it may simply be to broaden access via partnerships.  There are several options for monetizing the channel option including product resale, whitelabel licensing, or affiliate commissions.   An example of this is Wolfram Alpha's partnership agreement with Microsoft's Bing search engine.</li>
	<li><strong>Promotion</strong>: if an important role is to raise awareness for the company's products or brand, and generate additional traffic.  This is the business model used by Netflix and The Guardian for movies and news content respectively.</li>
	<li><strong>Content Acquisition</strong>: to make it easy to gather content which will then form a strong base for the value of a company.  An example of this when job posting websites cross-post job openings to Indeed via their APIs.</li>
</ul>
These business model options are not exclusive.  In fact the presence of an API will usually mean that several of these are achieved.  A good way to think about it is to choose one focus area for the business model, and additionally one or two supporting areas.  We will elaborate on some detailed examples later.  A related choice to the business model is to identify how directly the value of the API will be monetized.  This is typically not a black-and-white decision, but rather there is a spectrum of possibilities.  The following table gives examples at several points along the spectrum from very direct pricing based on API calls, to completely indirect value capture.

We have now seen a framework to evaluate the best business model options for your API.  It began with an assessment of your core asset to determine what strategy will guide your API.  Then you explore four different directions for business models to find which is the best fit for your strategy.  In parallel with the business model evaluation, you can optionally define some high-level pricing approaches.  In the next post in the series we will look at each of the four business model options in more detail, before applying this framework to a number of existing companies to show how these business models look in the real world.

        <span class="post-date">18 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/journalism/nieman-journalism-labs-icon.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="right" />There is an excellent analysis of Open API usage in news organizations at the Nieman Journalism Lab, called <a title="Wisdom of the crowd: Key lessons from news organizations using open APIs to ramp up R&amp;D" href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/04/wisdom-of-the-developer-crowd-key-lessons-from-news-organizations-using-open-apis-to-ramp-up-rd/">Wisdom of the (developer) crowd: Key lessons from news organizations using open APIs to ramp up R&amp;D</a>.<p></p>
This analysis is a summary of a paper by<a title="Seth Lewis" href="http://sethlewis.org/">Seth Lewis</a>, professor at University of Minnesota, and <a title="Tanja Altamurto" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tanja-aitamurto">Tanja Aitamurto</a>, a Finish PH.D student at Stanford, that was presented at the International Symposium on Online Journalism earlier this month.<p></p>
After studying the approaches of the four biggest players with open APIs are <a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">NPR</a>, <a title="The New York Times" href="http://developer.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>, <a title="The Guardian" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform">The Guardian</a>, and <a title="USA Today" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a>, Lewis and Aitamurto came away with five key lessons:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Open APIs can serve as external R&amp;D labs</li>
	<li>Open APIs present a revenue opportunity</li>
	<li>Open APIs help weave news organizations into the fabric of the web</li>
	<li>Open APIs create an ecosystem effect</li>
	<li>Open APIs can be a challenge, especially within the news organization</li>
</ul>
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/journalism/the_guardian.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /> Lewis and Aitamurto conclude that Open APIs are not the solution to all of the news industries problems, but they are significant step toward a form of online publishing that is in sync with the web, and also allow publishers to take advantage of thewisdomof the (developer) crowd for research &amp; development.<p></p>
These new approaches offer a first glimpse of what <a title="Open Innovation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation">open innovation</a> using APIs could bring to the news business when it comes to revenue and partnerships.<p></p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hackeducation.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I've been watching my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>, evolve her online presence as a freelance writer working for <a title="ReadWriteWeb" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/author/audrey-watters.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>, <a title="O'Reilly" href="http://radar.oreilly.com/audreyw/">O'Reilly</a>, <a title="NPR Mindshift" href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/">NPR Mindshift</a>, and other high profile blogs.
<p></p><a title="@AudreyWatters" href="http://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters">@AudreyWatters</a> has large Twitter following, however she keeps her Facebook very private.
<p></p>A growing portion of her user base are sending her Facebook friend requests, because she keeps her profile private, she doesn't accept. So naturally she created a <a title="Facebook page" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Audrey-Watters/100999103321790">Facebook page</a>.
<p></p>I watched her install the Facebook <a title="like social-plugin" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/">like social plug-in</a> to the single.php file, which will display it on each blog post, and added an <a title="activity feed social plug-in" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/activity/">activity feed social plug-in</a> to the sidebar of her blog. She runs her blog on Wordpress, and was able to do this easily.
<p></p>Facebook social plug-ins make your site social, but by using the <a title="Open Graph Protocol" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/">Open Graph Protocol</a> she was able to offer a deeper integration with Facebook. By having her blog integrated with the Open Graph API she is able to push content to her "fans" Facebook wall, increasing the reach of her blog to their social streams.
<p></p>Audrey got her inspiration to do this from the <a title="Journalist on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/journalist">Journalist on Facebook</a> fan page, a page created by Facebook to educate journalists about best practices using Facebook to disseminate information.
<p></p>I see Facebook doing two things to encourage this kind of API usage:<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook_logo-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>API User Targetin</strong>g - Going beyond the current definition of partner and (internal and external)l developer focus, and identifying other target groups of users beyond the developer community, and providing a Facebook page and other information for a target group.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>API Embed Strategy</strong> - Facebook has a great API embed strategy, providing a suite of embeddable tools that any user can use to make their sites social -- extending their sites reach to Facebook, while also expanding Facebook's presence on to other sites.
     </li>
</ul>I'm seeing shifts in many APIs lately to a more embeddable approach, such as <a title="Twitter Web Intents" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/simpler-twitter-api-integration-with-web-intents/">Twitter's Web Intents</a>, and <a title="LinkedIn Evolution of its Developer Platform" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/13/linkedin-api-platform-and-the-evolution-of-the-api/">LinkedIn's evolution of its developer platform</a>.
<p></p>In addition to an embed strategy, Facebook is creating pages and other resources targeting specific user groups. This is a potentially powerful combination for attracting new users and extending the reach of Facebook across the web.

        <span class="post-date">15 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Freshbooks_610x564.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a title="Sample Code Libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">Sample code libraries</a> are an essential part of an API ecosystem. They give developers a head start when integrating their applications with an API.<p></p>
I've explored the concept of <a title="letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/01/use-your-community-to-build-api-code-libraries/">letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries</a>. Doing this may create a more engaged community and give developers a sense of ownership and attachment to the API.<p></p>
As I <a title="reviewed the Freshbooks API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/13/freshbooks-api-review/">reviewed the Freshbooks API</a>, I noticed they have a very community-driven API code samples area.<p></p>
The Freshbooks API provides client libraries in Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl, JavaScript, ActionScript, Java, .NET, and C++, as well as plug-ins for popular frameworks like Zend, Drupal and Symphony.<p></p>
Many of the <a title="client libraries and plug-ins" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/sample-code/">client libraries and plug-ins</a> are built by the Freshbooks API community, such as:
<blockquote><img style="padding-bottom: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developers/ryan-szrama.jpg" alt="" width="50" align="right" /><em>Drupal plugin by <a title="Ryan Szrama" href="http://drupal.org/user/49344">Ryan Szrama</a>.  Szrama is an active member of the Drupal community.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><img style="padding-bottom: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developers/matt-culbreth.jpg" alt="" width="50" align="right" /><em>Python client libraries by <a title="Matt Culbreth" href="http://mattculbreth.com/index.html">Matt Culbreth</a>, a software developer in Marietta, Georgia USA.</em></blockquote>
By encouraging your API developers to build code samples, plug-ins, and code libraries, you can get necessary tools built for an API.  But just as importantly, you're building community and providing a much needed spotlight for your developers.  This in turn helps them be successful in their careers.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/washington-crossing-the-delaware-cropped.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />We are witnessing some <a title="tremendous growth in the number of new web APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">tremendous growth in the number of new Web APIs</a>.  <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, for example, added 1000 new APIs to its directory over the last year.<p></p>
Many of these APIs are brand new and have very few code samples or libraries to go with them.<p></p>
These new APIs represent a huge opportunity for developers to stake a claim within these communities -- to build their portfolios and their resumes.<p></p>
Recently Google released their <a title="Google Cloud Print Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a>.   The only thing available was some documentation describing the handful of API endpoints for managing printers and print jobs.<p></p>
I went to work trying to understand Google's vision of cloud printing, and I wrote a simple PHP class for working with Google Cloud Print.   I published on <a title="Github - Google Cloud Print" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Google-Cloud-Print-Proxy">Github</a> and <a title="Google Code - Google Cloud Print" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-print-proxy/">Google Code</a> and blogged about my work.<p></p>
By creating a PHP class for Google Cloud Print I established myself as an early mover in the space, and I attracted attention to my work. Even Google noticed and someone from Google contacted me.<p></p>
Since Google Cloud Print was so new, and they are actively encouraging community participation, there was an opportunity for me establish a presence.<p></p>
Many API providers are taking a similiar <a title="community-driven approach to building their API code samples and libraries" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/15/community-driven-api-code-samples-and-libraries/">community-driven approach to building their API code samples and libraries</a>.  Within these communities, there are windows of opportunities for developers to claim their territory, get a little of the spotlight, while building their portfolios and resumes along the way.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/linkedin/LinkedIn-Developer-Network.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a title="LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> refreshed its <a title="LinkedIn Developer Platform" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/">developer platform</a> recently, updating its <a title="RESTful API" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/community/apis">RESTful API</a> and <a title="JavaScript API" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/community/jsapi">JavaScript API</a>.<p></p>
A noticeable change, was its continued evolution towards a more plug and play API environment.<p></p>
When you visit the <a title="LinkedIn Developer Area" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/index.jspa">LinkedIn developers area</a>, the first option on the menu is plug-ins, and the main page is totally dominated by embeddable profile tools.<p></p>
The RESTful API and Javascript API are only accessible off a single menu option, the community has a clear focus on courting non-developer LinkedIn users.<p></p>
With the rise in popularity of RESTful APIs and JavaScript, we are seeing a explosion in <a title="Widget, Embeds, Plug-In" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/06/allow-api-users-to-embed-content-with-oembed/">widgets, embeds, plug-ins</a> and other copy / paste code that any tech savvy user can deploy.<p></p>
Attracting the developer community to new APIs can be tough.  Programmers tend to be drawn to exciting, new, and shiny APIs that provide challenges and new opportunities.   The business and professional focus of LinkedIn doesn't quite put the "shiny" in API.<p></p>
LinkedIn shows an understanding of its user base, and the best way to provide API tools that these tech savvy users can copy and paste on their web site, social networks, and other applications.

Being the forward thinkers they are, they say:
<blockquote><em>If there's an app there's an API, so we've made ours available to everyone...</em></blockquote>
The <a title="GitHub Jobs API" href="http://jobs.github.com/api">GitHub Jobs API</a> allows you to search, view, and create jobs with JSON over HTTP.<p></p>
The APIalso provides support for JSONP, by appending ?callback=myFunction to any API request, it will wrap the response in a function call to myFunction. This is useful when making requests to the GitHub Jobs API using JavaScript.<p></p>
Nothing to revolutionary, or noteworthy about the API, except Github is just way cool, and I love their perspective that, if there is an app there is an API.

        <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2011</span>
        <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Freshbooks_610x564.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I am slowly working my way through <a title="hundreds of APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">hundreds of APIs</a> and doing business reviews of their approach to delivering their APIs.<p></p>
At API Evangelist I'm focused on the business of APIs, with a minor focus on the technology behind those APIs.  So when I publish a business review of an API, I will add it to my API database, then move on.<p></p>
That is, unless I identify a story -- an innovative approach, monetization strategy, or anything that I feel needs to be talked about in more detail.<p></p>
While reviewing the <a title="Freshbooks API" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks API</a> I found three notable building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong><a title="Application Billing" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/billing/">Application Billing</a></strong> - A built in billing and payment framework for Freshbook applications and beyond</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Webhooks" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/webhooks/">Webhooks</a></strong> - Framework for enabling application callbacks, URLs where the Freshbook system can send notifications to third party applications</li>
	<li><a title="Freshbooks Add-On Store" href="http://community.freshbooks.com/addons/"><strong>FreshBooks Add-on Stor</strong>e</a> - Application store and development platform for developers to build custom apps, showcase,  and sell to Freshbook customers.</li>
</ul>
<a title="Self-Service Application Frameworks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">Self-Service Application Frameworks</a> like the Freshbooks Add-On Store are growing more common.  I've talked about similar systems from <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> and <a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a>.  The Freshbooks Add-On store is not 100% self-service, but it is close.
<a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/freshbooks-leaf.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
Webhooks are nothing new, but Freshbook offers a standardized approach to deploying web-hooks that makes them easy for developer to use.<p></p>
A built in payment system is definitely a notable <a title="API Building Block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">API building block</a>.  Providing developers with a baked-in payment system for handling application monetization is very innovative.<p></p>
Where do these three building blocks fit into the big picture?   I try to build profiles for common API building blocks, I don't have profiles for self-service application frameworks, webhooks, and payment systems, but as I evaluate more I will define these as more innovative building blocks for API owners to use.<p></p>
I will definitely be keeping an eye on the <a title="Freshbook" href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">Freshbook</a> approach to their API.

        <img src="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/buddies.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />There are many  approaches to building an API ecosystem.  Some approach it more like building an API community, and others as growing an API ecosystem.<p></p>
<a title="Howard Liptzin" href="http://twitter.com/howardliptzin#">Howard Liptzin</a>, at Avatar Industries prefers a more <a title="organic approach to growing an API community" href="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/2011/02/28/developer-communities/">organic approach growing an API community</a>.  In his own words:
<blockquote><em>What you'll want to do is to create the conditions for a community to form, thrive, produce and grow.</em></blockquote>
Liptzin emphasises gardening over engineering, not managing your community, more facilitate. Before you even start, Liptzin offers a little advice:
<blockquote><em>Make sure your API actually solves a problem that merits solving!</em></blockquote>
Then Liptzin identifies five areas to address when growing your API ecosystem:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Creation</li>
	<li>Activation</li>
	<li>Retention</li>
	<li>Productivity</li>
	<li>Growth</li>
</ul>
It is great to see other API owners and evangelists share their philosophies and approach to growing their community.<p></p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I keep stumbling across innovative approaches to using Web APIs, for non-developers.
<p></p>The other day I wrote about <a title="Quantifying your social media impact, using Google Docs and social media" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/apis-are-not-just-for-developers/">quantifying your social media impact,</a> using Google Docs and social media APIs, by<a title="Tom Critchlow" href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/30546">Tom Critchlow</a>.

<p></p><a title="Richard Orelup" href="http://twitter.com/#!/ripsup">Richard Orelup</a> came up with this little hack in response to this tweet:
<blockquote>
     <em>So in all of Twitter-dom, there is seriously no tool that archives a day's tweets in a sortable fashion?</em>
</blockquote>Using the <a title="importXML() function" href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=75507">importXML() function</a> he pulls Twitter updates from the <a title="Twitter API" href="http://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter API</a> and stores in this <a title="Google Spreadsheet" href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AncshzELR0ZHdDdoSWJKc0JtWjBYT0NpX0V6dlhzUUE&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CJr2ztYJ#gid=0">Google Spreadsheet</a>.

Through the <a title="Rdio Affiliate Program" href="https://cli.linksynergy.com/cli/publisher/registration/registration.php?mid=36727">Rdio Affiliate Program</a> developers can earn from between 2% and 7% for purchases made within a 30-day cookie window.<p></p>
Having an API affiliate program seems like a logical way to incentivize developers to build applications.<p></p>
An API owner should have an established monetization strategy for their API, and it should outline how revenue will be generated.<p></p>
Having a way to track and attribute sales to your API developers makes a lot of sense, and sharing revenue with developers will ensure they will keep building new ways to attract users to a service via the API.

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/blueprints.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />In my quest to fully understand the underlying principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), i'm re-reading Roy Thomas Fielding original dissertation, <a title="Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architecture" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>, where he first introduced the REST architectural style.
<p></p>His dissertation explored the junction of two disciplines in computer science: <em>software and networking</em>.
<p></p>He identifies that software research:
<blockquote>
     <em>...has long been concerned with the categorization of software designs and the development of design methodologies, but has rarely been able to objectively evaluate the impact of various design choices on system behavior.</em>
</blockquote>While networking research:
<blockquote>
     <em>...is focused on the details of generic communication behavior between systems and improving the performance of particular communication techniques, often ignoring the fact that changing the interaction style of an application can have more impact on performance than the communication protocols used for that interaction.</em>
</blockquote><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/parthenon.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Fieldings work was motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software. He wanted to rethink software design in the context of the World Wide Web.
<p></p>The World Wide Web is intended to be an Internet-scale, distributed system, interconnecting information networks across organizational boundaries, and cope with the demands of scalability and independent deployment of software.
<p></p>As Fielding states:
<blockquote>
     <em>REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.</em>
</blockquote>As I'm reading his abstract and introduction I can't help but think about where I stand as an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/api-evangelism-vs-developer-evangelism/">API Evangelist</a>, at the convergence of business and RESTful APIs.
<p></p>When RESTful APIs are applied to business, what does this look like? Is business currently restricted in the same ways as software? When business is operating on the World Wide Web do we need to consider the network more?
<p></p>Lots to consider at the intersection of business and RESTful APIs.

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/social-impact-graph.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />One of the reasons I believe <a title="APIs Are Growing so Popular" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">APIs are growing so popular</a> is they are getting easier, and easier to use.<p></p>
The main reason they are getting easier to use is due to the adoption of RESTful approaches when delivering APIs.<p></p>
Many APIs that use REST can be easily hacked by just changing values in the URL query string, instantly making APIs accessible by a wider audience<p></p>
Once users get past the confusing acronyms and jargon us programmers use, and realize whats going on, they can start accessing the data and functionality that's behind the curtain.<p></p>
RESTful APIs open up data and functionality to anyone, and we are starting to see a new breed of hackers from many disciplines including journalism, social media marketing, and government, to name a few.<p></p>
As technology becomes increasingly important in our every day lives, people can't wait for IT or programmers to deliver, savvy users start hacking on their own.<p></p>
A very innovative example of this I saw lately was by Social Media Strategist, <a title="Tom Critchlow" href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/30546">Tom Critchlow</a>.  Tom wrote a great post called, <a title="Using Tools &amp; APIs to Track Your Social Media Strategy" href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-to-track-your-social-media-strategy">Using Tools &amp; APIs To Track Your Social Media Strategy.</a>
<img src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/users/30546.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
Through a need to understand the impact of his social media efforts, he learned that he can query top social sites using their API to quantify the impact of his site(s).<p></p>
Then using Google Docs, along with with the power of <a title="Google App Scripts" href="http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/">Google App Scripts</a> he pulls counts for shares, likes, etc for his site using Social Media APIs.<p></p>
Using RESTful Social Media APIs, and Google Docs, he is able to hack these APIs, get the data he is looking for, store it in a spreadsheet, and then visualize it.<p></p>
His efforts truly represent the power of APIs, and how important it is that we deliver simple, RESTful interfaces that developers and non-developers can use in our every day business.

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-business.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I have found a voice through my blog, API Evangelism.<p></p>
I get asked why "API Evangelism" instead of "Developer Evangelism"?<p></p>
I see a significant difference:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Developer Evangelists</strong> spread awareness, and understanding of an API, or APIs, amongst the developer community.</li>
	<li><strong>API Evangelists</strong> spreads awareness, and understanding of an API, or APIs, amongst the developer and business community.</li>
</ul>
Developer evangelists are generally focused outwards, staying within the developer community and often times are, or have been developers themselves.  They understand the problems their developers face and provide resources, so they are successful using an API.<p></p>
As an API Evangelist I focus on everything a developer evangelist focuses on, but I also find myself selling the API and its benefits both externally and internally.<p></p>
If I see a potential use for an API, one that enhances the core business, I will build a prototype and get to work selling the appropriate department(s) on the benefits.<p></p>
In addition to selling internal business leaders on benefits of a specific API, I spend a lot of time educating external business leaders on the benefits of APIs in general.  Using a specific API (hopefully my own) for building the business case.<p></p>
We need more developer evangelists, but we also need armies of API evangelists who will teach the business masses of the benefits of APIs, and prepare them for the coming <a title="API Economy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-Apps-Marketplace.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />APIs have been influential in ushering in a new era of business development, dubbed <a title="BizDev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">BizDev 2.0</a>.   APIs empower new types of relationship to be built between a business and its partners or openly by public developers.<p></p>
Self-Service application platforms move this business development forward and introduces a third player into the game, platform partners.<p></p>
Platforms like <a title="Google Apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps</a>, and <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> not only deliver APIs, they provide a <a title="Self-Service Application Development Environment" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application development environment</a>, a place where third party businesses can access their users, and add value to their platform.<p></p>
Forward thinking businesses can bring their own APIs, and communities development power to these environments and create applications tailored specifically for Box.net or Google Apps Business, Government, Education and Non-Profit users.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/box-net-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
In some cases businesses can even create white label applications that other service providers quickly deploy their own branded applications on Box.net OpenBox, or Google Apps Marketplace.   Adding a potentially new wholesale layer to these API communities.<p></p>
APIs with a<a title="Self-Service Application Platforms" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">Self-Service Application Platform</a> introduces new forms of business development where businesses can leverage their own APIs, the APIs of others, even bundle them together to build applications that can reach entirely new audiences via platform partners.

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Tag-Cloud-API-PDF.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I'm spending time evaluating different types of APIs in various categories.
<p></p>I want to see how each provider delivers their API in similar categories, and potentially look for opportunities within those categories for new API services.
<p></p>I'm starting with PDF APIs.
<p></p>There are quite a few web APIs providing services to generate and work with PDFs.
<p></p>The first main group of APIs I notice are HTML to PDF conversion APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocRaptor" href="http://docraptor.com/documentation" target="_blank">DocRaptor</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Doculicious" href="http://docs.doculicious.com/api" target="_blank">Doculicious</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="html2PDF" href="http://webservice.htm2pdf.co.uk/htm2pdf.asm" target="_blank">htm2pdf</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Joliprint" href="http://joliprint.com/api/" target="_blank">Joliprint</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="HTM2PDF" href="http://www.html2pdf.biz/api.php" target="_blank">HTML2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Web2PDF" href="http://www.web2pdfconvert.com/pdf-api.aspx" target="_blank">Web2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF My URL" href="http://pdfmyurl.com/support/support.jsp" target="_blank">PDF My URL</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Crowd" href="http://pdfcrowd.com/html-to-pdf-api/" target="_blank">PDF Crowd</a>
     </li>
</ul>Next there are a couple of other PDF conversion tools:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/PDF_red.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Anything to PDF" href="http://api.danielprocter.com/" target="_blank">Anything to PDF</a> - Convert base 64 encoded data to PDF
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Alchemy" href="http://www.pdfalchemy.com/" target="_blank">PDF Alchemy</a> - Word to PDF
     </li>
</ul>Beyond document conversion I found two APIs for commenting and annotating PDFs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Crocodoc" href="http://crocodoc.com/api/" target="_blank">Crocodoc</a> - PDF commenting and collaboration
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Annotate" href="http://a.nnotate.com/api-reference.html" target="_blank">A.nnotate</a> - PDF annotation
     </li>
</ul>Then there was a single provider of PDF document signatures:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocuSign" href="http://www.docusign.com/developers-center/developers-center-overview" target="_blank">DocuSign</a>
     </li>
</ul>There are two clear leaders that provide more advanced PDF document management services:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Doxument" href="http://doxument.com/en/developer" target="_blank">Doxument</a> - HTML to PDF, OCR, Split PDF pages in separate images
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Docs " href="http://code.google.com/apis/documents/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> - File Conversion to PDF, OCR, translation
     </li>
</ul>With the ubiquitous nature of PDFs, and a wide range of desktop and web based PDF tools, I think there is a huge opportunity for new types of APIs in this area. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf-ocr.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> There are dozens of code libraries in various languages for manipulating PDFs. I would suggest some savvy developer:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Identify the most viable business uses for PDF APis
     </li>
     <li>Select the strong set of PDF language libraries
     </li>
     <li>Wrap in a RESTful wrapper
     </li>
     <li>Deploy on Amazon EC2 with PDF storage on Amazon S3
     </li>
</ul>PDF APis is one category of APIs that has huge opportunity for growth in the next couple of years.

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2011</span>
        When deploying an API, the interface is just the beginning. You need tools and resources to support the API. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/building_blocks.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> There are <a title="Common Building Blocks Used by APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks that are used by many existing APIs</a>, such as documentation, forums, code samples and other tools developers have come to expect from APIs.
<p></p>When selecting which <a title="Building Blocks to Use for an API Area" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks to use for an API area</a>, there are many things to consider. There are many opinions on which are essential, and this can vary from industry to industry.
<p></p>One thing everyone agrees is that <a title="Metrics and Analytics for an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">metrics and analytics for an API</a> are a must have.
<p></p>Beyond the common building blocks, many API owners are providing new innovative tools such as:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Application Showcase" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=180">Application Showcases</a>
     </li>

     </li>

          <a title="API Explorers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/24/explorers-open-api-access-beyond-developers/">API Explorers</a>
     </li>
</ul>If you are planning an API and do not have much experience with API technology, or what building blocks you will need, you should talk to experienced API service providers such as <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, or <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>. These providers have a lot of experience, tools and services you can access to plan, develop, deploy, and manage your API.
<p></p>Even with the growth in the number of available APIs, and the number of service providers I do not see much in the way of open-source API building blocks available on the market yet. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/open.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> We need more innovation around development of open API building blocks. Think what <a title="Wordpress" href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> has done for blogging, and <a title="Heroku" href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> has done for cloud computing.
<p></p>The availablility of open API building blocks delivering the common, innovative and essential tools needed for APIs, would give a much needed boost to the entire industry.
<p></p>There is a lot of learning, exploration and trial and error to occur within the API space. Leaving this to occur within the hands of a few API service provider, or following the lead of major API players like Twitter and Google limits the opportunities for everybody involved.
<p></p>I would like to see more discussion and collaboration around building a community of open source API build blocks this year.

        All of us programmers have a preferred programming language. It is the language that we identify with and prefer to build projects in.
<p></p>When it comes to delivering an API area, one of the most important <a title="building blocks" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks</a> for getting programmers up and running are <a title="code language libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">language libraries</a>.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-social-coding-words.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /><a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that uses the Git revision control system.
<p></p>The site also provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and a network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.
<p></p>Github provides two main tools that can be used in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Github Repositories" href="http://help.github.com/create-a-repo/">Github Repositories</a></strong> - Git code repositories for various supporting areas of an API
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Gists" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a></strong> - Gist are a simple way to share snippets of code
     </li>
</ul>There are several ways to use Github repositories and Gists in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Documentation</strong> - Display example calls, requests, and responses using Gists
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Samples</strong> - Display code samples using Gists, and package up entire sets of code samples using Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Libraries</strong> - Package up official and community generated API code libraries as Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Prototypes</strong> - Publish API prototypes as Github repositories
     </li>
</ul><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-round.png" alt="" width="160" align="right" /> Github provides a way for API owners to manage a large number of code samples, libraries and prototypes, in a way that allows developers to fork and contribute code as part of the community.
<p></p>The social spects of Github extends a API community to the existing, vibrant developer community that exists at Github.
<p></p>Its easier for an API to participate within the existing Github developer community, rather then expect developers to come and participate in a community built around the API.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/php.gif" alt="" width="125" align="right" />An important tone of my blog is not to ever say any API owner should, or developers have to do anything. My role as API evangelist is to observe, discuss and explore the business of APIs.
<p></p>I was discussing best practices around API ecosystems with a prominent developer the other night an a O'Reilly Web 2.0 event. He had an interesting perspective on how to build community around an API. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/ruby-logo.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> Building your API community can start with your code libraries.
<p></p>His recommendation was that API owners should focus on building a simple and standardized API that provides true value, and do not build your own API code libraries.
<p></p>Let your community build, and contribute code libraries in their preferred programming language.
<p></p>His argument was that if an API owner releases an official set of libraries, the innovation stops there. Nobody will build any further code libraries and possibly improve on them. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/python.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> By allowing the community to build API libraries it gives you a chance to put the spotlight on developers, increases the chance for competition, spurs innovation and developers will rise to the occasion.
<p></p>In some cases an API owner may even contract with a developer to build the API code libraries, but do not endorse them as official. This way developers see opportunity to build upon them and improve them, if they feel so inclined.
<p></p>I found this a very innovative approach to empowering your developer community, encouraging innovation, and building community within your API ecosystem.

        NPR announced their new <a title="NPR News Application for Android 2.0" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/04/01/134951191/android-2-0-rebuilt-redesigned?ft=1&amp;f=91000411">NPR News application for Android 2.0</a> today.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/npr/npr-android-20-mobile-app.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
Normally I wouldn't cover just any new app or feature release, but there is more of a story here than just a new mobile app.  I am interested in the way they went about designing it.<p></p>
Last summer they submitted designs for the new Android application to the <a title="NPR open source community" href="http://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">open source community</a> to discuss how to best move forward with designing the mobile app.<p></p>
They gathered feedback from users and built in what the community said was most important, such as new player, universal navigation, as well as adding programs with live streams and the ability to favorite stations.<p></p>
They are working to <a title="publishing the source code back to the community repository" href="http://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">publishing the source code back to the community repository</a>, keeping the project open source.<p></p>
Of course this is NPR, a public entity, but their approach to mobile application design using their API is  a model that can be used by other API providers.
