<p>When I play with <a href="https://www.hitchhq.com">my Hitch service</a> I am always left thinking about the many dimensions of API monitoring. When you talk about API monitoring in the tech sector conversations almost always start with the API providers and the technical details monitoring of individual APIs. Hopefully, these discussions also focus on API monitoring from the API consumers point of view, but I wanted to also shine a light on companies like Hitch who are adding an additional dimension from the API service provider view of things–which is closer to my vantage point as an analyst.

<p>I am an advisor to Hitch because they are a different breed of API monitoring service, that isn’t just focused on the APIs. Hitch brings in the wider view of monitoring the entire operations of an API–if documentation changes, an SDK on Github, or update via Twitter, or a pricing change, you get alerted. As a developer I enjoy being made aware of what is going on across operations, keeping me in tune with not just the technical, but also the business and politics of API platform operations.

<p>Another reason I like Hitch, and really the reason behind me writing this post, is that they are helping API providers think about the bigger picture of API monitoring. Helping them think deeply, as well as getting their shit together when it comes to regularly sending out the critical signals us API consumers are tuning into. When you are down in the trenches of operating an API at a large company, it is easy to get caught up in the internal vacuum, forgetting to properly communicate and support your community–Hitch helps keep this bubble from forming, assisting you in keeping an external focus on your community.

<p>If you are just embarking on your API journey I recommend tuning into API Evangelist first. ;-) However, <a href="https://www.hitchhq.com">if you are unsure of how to properly communicate and support your community I recommend you talk to the Hitch team</a>. They’ll help get you up to speed on the best practices when it comes to API operations, and understand how to send the right signals to your community–something that will make or break your API efforts, so please don’t ignore it.

<p>Disclosure: I am an advisor for Hitch, and they are my friends.
