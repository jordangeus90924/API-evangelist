<p>We just added <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/picking-up-momentum-in-2015-for-apistrat-berlin-with-3-new-speakers/">three new speakers to the lineup for @APIStrat Berlin this April 24th and 25th</a>. I get pretty excited about this part of the event planning lifecycle, which is all about reviewing talks that being submitted, and working with the rest of the APIStrat, and now the API Days team, to develop the best lineup possible.</p>
<p>Here are the three that we added today:</p>

<p>An open project for me this month, is about better understanding how API keys are provisioned, and how developers are given access to valuable resources. As the number of APIs grows, so do the number of APIs that we depend on in any single application, forcing developer to have to manage many API keys, potentially from many different platforms.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take an API expert to see that many <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">current practices by API providers requiring consumers to manually register for an account, will not scale</a>. We need more automated ways for not just discovering, but also on-boarding with APIs, allowing API consumers to begin using an API, without the current overhead required.</p>
<p>One idea I&rsquo;m bouncing around in my own APIs, is allowing for instant account creation via an API, allowing you to programmatically generate new account, a new app, and API keys. Of course I do not want these new accounts to have full access to everything, and using my 3Scale API management I will create a specific service tier for these accounts, limiting what they can do.</p>
<p>I want to take this another step further though, I do not want just any spammy, Johnny come-along to be able to create new accounts, without any sort of validation. To help filter, I&rsquo;m developing a Github account ranking layer, requiring you to pass along your Github user with the generation of new account, app, and keys. I will pull the profile for the Github user, and some statistics on their overall profile, and make some assumptions on the developers trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Immediately this approach will limit API access for a number of people, which in some scenarios may not be ideal, but for my APIs, I&rsquo;m willing to allow instant account creation, and API access to people who have an active, verifiable Github presence. I&rsquo;ve been a proponent of API providers providing Github login for developer accounts for some time now, and this seems like a logical next step.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see where I go with this. It is more an exercise than it is a real thing, but who knows, in addition to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/14/storing-api-keys-in-the-private-master-github-repository-for-use-in-github-pages/">using Github to manage my API keys securely</a>, maybe I can actually use it to instantly access new APIs, without having the current overhead I face with each new API on-boarding experience.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/02/all-side-projects-are-now-hosted-on-github/">public websites have been running on Github Pages for almost two years now</a>, and slowly the private management tools for my platform are moving there as well. Alongside my public websites, I&rsquo;m adding administrative functions for each projects. Most of the content is API driven already, so it makes sense to put some of the management tools side by side with the content or data that I&rsquo;m publishing.</p>
<p>These management tools are simple JavaScript, that use the Github API to manage HTML, and JSON files that I have stored either publicly or privately within repositories. I use Github oAuth to work with the Github API, but to work with other APIs I need a multitude of other API keys, including <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale generated API keys</a> I use to access my own API infrastructure.</p>
<p>My solution is to store a simple api-keys.json file in the root of my private master repository, and then again using Github oAuth, and the Github API, I access this file, read the content of the JSON file into a temporary array I can use wthin my management tools. If you do not have access to the Github repository, you won&rsquo;t be able to read the contents of api-keys.json, rendering the management tools useless.</p>
<p>I will develop a centralized solution to helping manage API keys across all my projects, allowing me to re-use keys for different projects, and easily update, or remove outdated API keys. This approach to storing API keys in my private Github repository is allowing me to easily access keys in client-side apps I run on Github Pages, as well as via server-side applications and APIs&mdash;something that I&rsquo;m hoping will give me more flexibility in how I put multiple APIs across my infrastructure.</p>

<p>When I discuss what is possible when it comes to generating both server and client side code using machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, I almost always get push-back, making sure I understand there are limitations of what can be auto-generated.</p>
<p>Machine readable API definitions like Swagger provide a great set of rules for describing the surface area of an API, but is often missing many other elements necessary to define what server side code should actually be doing. The closest I&rsquo;ve gotten to fully generating server side APIs, is when it came to very CRUD-based APIs, that possess a very simple data models--beyond that it is difficult to make "ends meet".</p>
<p>Personally, I do not think my Swagger specs should contain everything needed to define server implementations, this would make for a very bloated, and unusable Swagger specification. For me, Swagger is my central truth, that I use in generating <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/server-skeletons-in-restlet-studio-and-apispark/">server side skeletons</a>, client side samples and libraries, and to define testing, monitoring, and interactive documentation for developers.</p>
<p>Working to push this approach forward, I&rsquo;m also now using Swagger as a central truth for my Docker containers, allowing me to use virtualization as a bridge between what my Swagger definitions cannot define for each micro-service or API deployed within a specific container.  This approach is leaving Swagger as purely a definition of the micro-service surface area, and leaving my Docker image to deliver on the back-end vision of this surface area.</p>
<p>These Docker images are using Swagger as a definition for its container surface area, but also as a fingerprint for the value it delivers. As an example, I have a notes API definition in Swagger, for which I have two separate Docker images that support this interface. Each Docker image knows it only serves this particular Swagger specification, using it as a kind of fingerprint or truth for its own existence, but ultimately each Docker image will be delivering its own back-end experience derived from this notes API spec.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting going with this new approach to using Swagger as a central truth for each Docker container, but as I&rsquo;m rolling out each of my API templates with this approach, I will blog more about it here. Eventually I am hoping to standardize my thoughts on using machine readable API definition formats like Swagger to guide the API functionality I'm delivering in virtualized containers.</p>

<p>I continuing to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/using-containers-to-bridge-what-swagger-cannot-define-on-the-serverside-for-my-apis/">evolve my use of Swagger as a kind of central truth in my API design, deployment, and management lifecycle</a>. This time I&rsquo;m using it as a fingerprint for defining how APIs or micro-services that run in Docker containers function. Along the way I&rsquo;m also using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as a framework for organizing these Swagger driven containers, into coherent API stacks or collections, that work together to accomplish a specific objective.</p>
<p>For the project I&rsquo;m currently working on, I&rsquo;m deploying multiple Swagger defined APIs, each as separate Docker containers, providing some essential components I need to operate API Evangelist, like blog, links, images, and notes. Each of these components have its own Swagger definition, and corresponding Docker image, and specific instance of that Docker image deployed within a container.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using APIs.json to daisy chain all of these APIs or micro-services together. I have about 15 APIs deployed, each are standalone services, with their own APIs.json, and supporting Swagger definition, but the overall project has a centralized APIs.json, which using the includes properties, provides linkage to each individual micro-services APIs.json--loosely coupling all of these container driven micro-services under single umbrella.</p>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m just using APIs.json as a harness to define, and bring together the technical aspects of my new API stack. As I pull together other business elements like on-boarding, documentation, and code samples, I will add these as properties to my parent APIs.json. My goal is to demonstrate the value&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> brings to the table when it comes to API and micro-service discovery, specifically when you deploy distributed API stacks or collections using Docker container deployed micro-services.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-anonymous-person.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I find it more valuable to scrub the names of the APIs from about 75% of my stories, which I feel helps them be received by a widest possible audience as possible. If I say &ldquo;API Provider X&rdquo;, other providers just think I&rsquo;m talking about that company, but when I make it generic, I find API providers think I&rsquo;m talking about them.</p>
<p>There are many reasons I would scrub individual or company names from a story, most often this is because they&rsquo;ve asked me not to reference them public, but are fine with me telling the story in an anonymous fashion. However, it occurred to me over time that there are other more powerful storytelling influences potentially behind leaving out specific characters.</p>
<p>Early on I identified that there are a lot of API lessons to be learned across business sectors, but if you reference the specific company, or business sector, many business leaders or developers will put there blinders on, feeling this doesn&rsquo;t apply to them. Ideally companies would identify the potential of hearing stories from other ways of doing business, but unfortunately many lack the imagination to make the transition&mdash;lucky I have enough imagination to go around! ;-)</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy storytelling in the API space. Over the last four years I&rsquo;ve developed a voice I enjoy speaking in, and have slowly built an entire toolbox of approaches like scrubbing people or company names, to make my storytelling more impactful, and potentially reach a wider audience. I feel strongly that I would never have been able to do this if API Evangelist was purely a marketing blog for a company, but because I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be able to focus exclusively on entire API space, spanning multiple business sectors, and left to my own devices when it comes to the editorial choices--I&rsquo;ve been able to grow my storytelling in ways I never imagined in 2010 when I first started.</p>

<p>I talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/29/adding-rate-limits-for-apis-in-the-documentation-for-each-endpoint/">Twitter's inclusion of rate limits inline with documentation the other day, which is something I added as a new building block</a>, that API providers can consider when crafting their own strategy. Another building block I found while spending time in the Twitter ecosystem, was an oAuth signature generator inline within the documentation.</p>
<p>While browsing the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter documentation</a>, right before you get to the example request, you get a little dropdown that lets you select from one of your own applications, and generate an oAuth signature without leaving the page.</p>

<p>I am seeing oAuth signature generators emerge in a number of API platforms, but this is the first inline version I&rsquo;m seeing. I&rsquo;ve added this to my tentative list of oAuth and security building blocks I recommend, but will give some time before I add. I like to see more than one provider do something before I put it in there, but sometimes when it is just Twitter, that can be enough.</p>

<p>As I read and listen to all of the Internet of Things stories coming out of CES, I&rsquo;m happy to be <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/01/08/375923229/privacy-security-focal-points-at-ces">hearing discussions around privacy and security</a>, come out of the event. I feel better about IoT security and privacy when I hear things like this, but ultimately I am left with overwhelming concern about of the quantity of IoT devices.</p>
<p>There are many layers to securing IoT devices, and protecting the privacy of IoT users, but I can't help but the think that Internet of Things security and privacy will always begin by asking ourselves if we should be doing this at all. Do we need this object connected to the Internet? Are we truly benefiting from having this item enabled with cloud connectivity?</p>
<p>I'm going to try and keep up with tracking on the API layer being rolled out in support of IoT devices, but not sure I will be able to keep up with the number of devices, and the massive amount of hype around products and services. At some point I may have to tap out, and focus on specific aspects of IoT connectivity ,around what I consider the politics of APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm about 1/3 of the way into <a href="http://theapistack.com/">generating Swagger specifications for the APIs at the 700+ companies that I monitor.</a> I have the Swagger specs for almost 250 APIs so far, and have no idea how many I&rsquo;ll have when I'm done (ha, will I ever be done), as the target is kind of ever moving. The only way to get to know an API better than having to create a Swagger spec for it, is to actually integrate with it.</p>
<p>Thankfully I&rsquo;m not integrating with ALL of the APIs I monitor, but I do want to get more intimate with their API surface area, right up to actually having to integrate. There are four ways that I obtain a machine readable API definition for an API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manually</strong> - Good ol fashioned elbow grease because there is nothing standard about an APIs documentation, or even the API itself, forcing me to hand craft a Swagger definition that works.</li>
<li><strong>Scraping</strong> - Some APIs documentation is pretty standardized, making it very easy to write a scrape script that harvests, and generates a Swagger skeleton of endpoints, headers, parameters, and other aspects of the interface.</li>
<li><strong><a title="APITools" href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a></strong> - Some APIs that I&rsquo;m actually integrating with, going beyond just a review of their API, I use APITools as a proxy, and make all my API calls via this proxy, and after I hit all the endpoints, I can grab the auto-generated Swagger definition from the APITools interface.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - There is already a Swagger definition available for an API, created by the platform owner&mdash;this is when I&rsquo;m in heaven. I love it when APIs create their own API definition, and even better when they create their own <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> file. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to also add to the list, that I use API Blueprint, RAML, I/O Docs, and Apigee Explorer formats as well, but I do not. While these formats are out there, it is an understatement to say they are tucked away, and hidden. I&rsquo;d venture to say the providers are actively assisting API providers in keeping buried, and hard to access&mdash;in my opinion each format should be front and center, accessible with a single click.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I use <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>. If you look at Swagger UI docs, for each endpoint there is a RAW link which takes you directly to the machine readable API definition that drives it. Show me the equivalent on API Blueprint, RAML, Mashery, and Apigee API explorers, and interactive documentation and I&rsquo;ll eat my words. I'm creating my own API stack for converting between all of these formats, but alas this doesn't help me in my API discovery process, because these formats aren't easy to find.</p>
<p>This disconnect, is one of the reasons there is so much fragmentation in API designs, and ultimately a lack of open tooling and services that support the entire API life-cycle&mdash;nobody wants to share their design patterns. Please help me document all the APIs in <a href="http://theapistack.com">my API Stack</a>, and if you know of an existing Swagger spec I don&rsquo;t have, send my way, or <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publish to the Github repo</a>. Also, if you are actively using an API, can you switch to using an <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools proxy and generate a Swagger spec</a> that way, and also send my way, or <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publish to the Github repo</a>.</p>
<p>I wish I could convince all y'all of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/">importance of this layer of the API space being not just machine readable, but also accessible</a>. This is one reason why I&rsquo;m hand rolling all of these API definitions myself, is because I&rsquo;m just going to show you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.windley.com/">A blog post that caught my attention recently was </a><a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2014/12/fuse_kynetx_and_carvoyant.shtml">Fuse, Kynetx, and Carvoyant</a>, by Phil Windley (<a href="https://twitter.com/windley">@windley</a>). Phil is pushing the boundaries of connecting devices to the Internet, and is very vocal about his thoughts on the subject&mdash;something I support 100%. If you want a taste of what Phil is thinking, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZtz93hdc7I">his keynote from APIStrat Chicago 2014</a>.</p>
<p>His blog post is a worthy read, but what really caught my attention was in the last paragraph&mdash;the simple statement that he is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;using Fuse as a means to explore how a larger, more owner-controlled Internet of Things experience could be support</em>ed&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by this concept, and feel it reflects my mission with API Evangelist, where I&rsquo;m looking to create not just a more educated and informed API providers and consumers, but also a more knowledgable, and empowered end-user.</p>
<p>The concept of a owner-controlled Internet of Things experience is something I will be keeping an eye on as I continue to be inundated with Internet of Things API stories. My goal is to better understand how IoT devices are being designed, and deployed, then provide some assistance in how we can ensure platforms lean towards a more &ldquo;owner-controlled experience&rdquo;.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/13esk6Q"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As I am designing my APIs, one of the first things I decide is whether or not I will be making this public. If its a simple enough resource, and doesn't put too much load on my servers, I will usually make it publicly available. However if an API has write capabilities, could potentially put a heavy load on my servers, or just posses some private resource that I want to keep private, I will secure the API.</p>
<p>I use <a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale for my API management infrastructure</a>--I have since 2011, long before I ever started working with them on projects, and organizing <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a>. When it comes time to secure any of my APIs, I have a default snippet of code that I wrap each API, validating the application keys, and recording their activity--which 3Scale calls the plugin integration approach.</p>
<p>This time around, I logged into my 3Scale admin area, went to my API integration area, and saw the setup for the 3Scale Cloud API proxy that they are calling <a href="http://www.3scale.net/apicast/">APICast</a>. I can't help but notice the simple setup of the proxy--I give it a private base URL for my API, it gives me a public base URL back, and then I can configure the proxy rules, setting the rate limits for each of my API resources.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/3scale-apicast.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is it. I can set up my APIs in a sandbox environment, then take it live when I am ready. It is the quickest way to secure my APIs I've seen, allowing me to instantly lock down my APIs, and require anyone who uses it to register for a key, and then I am able to track on how it is being put to use&mdash;no server configuration or setup needed.</p>
<p>This easy setup, bundled with the fact you can setup 3Scale for free, and get up to 50K a day in API calls, makes it the perfect environment for figuring out your API surface area. Then when ready, you can pay for heavier volume, and take advantage of the other advanced features available via 3Scale. I'm still using the plugin feature for 90% of my endpoints, but some I will be using APICast to quickly stand-up, secure, and monitor some of my APIs. I will publish a how-to after I finish setting this one up.</p>

<p>When you use a well designed, and I hate saying it, but a RESTful API, you know it. I&rsquo;m not a <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/whatisarestafarian/">restafarian</a>, who is super strict about API design, but I do know an easy-to-use, intuitive interface when I hack on one. Having API resources defined as intuitive URIs, with a handful of sensible header or query parameters, that allows me to excercise my HTTP Verbs, just makes me happy.</p>
<p>I do not expect all API providers to be API design experts, but one design pattern that always frustrates me is when you  pack all of your API resources into a single parameter. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr calls it &ldquo;method&rdquo;</a>, and <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/media/references/reference.html#Video_Read">Brightcove calls it &ldquo;command&rdquo;</a>, and while both of these media API providers then offer a rich number of &ldquo;methods&rdquo; or &ldquo;commands&rdquo;, I just can&rsquo;t help feel this single design decision always detours API integrationa &nbsp;down bumpier, darker side street or alley.</p>
<p>Ultimately I can still get what I need done with APIs who choose to craft their resources in this way, but it takes more work, and requires me to create a special bucket of APIs, that don&rsquo;t quite fit in with the rest of the APIs I&rsquo;m profiling, and integrating with. I&rsquo;m often tempted, with the high profile APIs like Flickr and Brightcove, to craft a new API, and stand it up as a facade that you can use as a proxy, instead of directly connecting to Flickr and Brightcove APIs, but alas not enough time in the day.</p>
<p>You will almost never catch me giving API design advice on API Evangelist, but in this scenario, I have urge you not to follow the design patterns of Flickr and Brightcove when planning your APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stacks.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>The properties of each API that is listed in an<a href="http://apisjson.org/"> APIs.json file</a> can be called anything, as long as you preface it with X-, and the URL can point to anything you wish--to me<a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/"> this is one of the most flexibile aspects of APIs.json</a>. The majority of APIs.json API properties are going to be to URLs designed for human consumption, but the ultimate goal of the project is to establish a core set of machine readable URIs that will help move the API discovery conversation forward.</p>
<p>The first three machine readable properties for APIs listed in an APIs.json are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="API Blueprint" href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a></strong> - The machine readable API definition format in markdown.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a></strong>&nbsp;- The machine readable API definition format in JSON and YAML.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a></strong>&nbsp;- The machine readable API definition format in YAML.</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs.json is not looking to provide the solution for the same thing that sensibly designed hypermedia APIs would bring to the table, and only interested in bridging the indexing of the API resources that are currently available. In this context, think of APIs.json as a switchboard, allowing us to navigate each of the popular API definition formats available to use in 2015.</p>
<p>The fourth machine readable property for APIs listed in an APIs.json is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> - </strong>A machine readable format for associating licensing fo ran API interface (aka CC, Apache).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org/format/apisjson_0.14.txt">APIs.json version .014</a>, we now have a glimpse of the surface area of APIs present within each APIs.json file, via the API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML properties, and a basic awarness of the licensing of this surface area using the API Commons property.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure what is next for APIs.json property types, but if I had my vote (which I probably do ;-), I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing machine readable references to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Monetization</span> Value - </strong>Units of measurement, allowing me to understand the value delivered by an API. I do not think monetization is an apt title for this area, as money is such a limiting constraint, and value is a more expansive headspace to approach this aspect of API integration.</li>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Terms of Service</span> Questions - </strong>I feel that questions about the terms of service from API providers gets a lot of airplay, but this conversation is much like the TOS themselves, and are heavily weighted in discussion through a provider lens, drowning in legaleze. I&rsquo;m confident that this area needs distillation from its current legaleze format, and be framed as simple questions that span TOS, Privacy Policies, SLA, Copyright, Deprecation, Branding, and other legal layers to API operations.</li>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Clients</span> Connectivity - </strong>Give me a machine readable list of connecitivty options that are available for an API. I want to know what languages area available, as well as links to licensing, code repositories, and Zapier integrations. This is a layer of the conversation that would be better served through a hypermedia conversation, but since we have the world we have, this is a layer of the APIs.json conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, APIs.json takes the <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> conversation beyond just the meta, which, don&rsquo;t get me wrong is super valuable, with titles, description, tags, and other characteristics of APIs are critical to discovery, but I want to also be able to go deeper than just a simple keyword search. I want to be able to dig in on the areas above, but in a machine readable, bottom up, organic way.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I want to be able to ask for:</p>
<ul>
<li>All image APIs, that have a per MB storage, and bandwidth API Value model vs. free or advertising based approaches. I also want to make sure they allow me to set the licensing for my photos, delete my account when done, and have a PHP client, or even better a WordPress plugin.</li>
<li>All video APIs, that have a revenue share model for their own advertising network, as a API Value model. Same as my images I want to make sure they let me set the licensing for videos, and retain ownership over my model. In this case I don&rsquo;t care about specific language clients for integrations, I want to see connectivity for Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, and other distribution channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of conversation I have had around APIs.json with technologists almost always begins with a very technical API discovery discussion, something that quickly expands to the wider vision opened up by APIs.json around value generated by APIs, limitations imposed by the legal layer of platform operations, and into how we actually connect with valuable API resources. There are many more influences that prevent me from connecting to APIs, than just the technical aspects of integration&mdash;pricing, TOS, privacy, rate limits, and other business and political limitations often trump the tech when I select API platforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working through exactly how to best articulate Steve and mine&rsquo;s vision for APIs.json. I appreciate you listening to my thoughts, as I work through the details, and I would love to hear more of your thoughts around what APIs.json means to you.</p>

Seems like a more one-to-one version of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, where you can get the answers you are looking for when it comes to development on the Google platform, but in a more direct, one-to-one way.</p>
<p>Inversely, you can contribute your developer skills, and be one of the knowledgeable developers who are giving back to the developer community. The Google Helpouts page describes it as: <em>Give Back - Continue Learning - Build Your Reputation</em>. I signed up for an account, gave my profile, but the tags that I was able to connect with my profile really didn&rsquo;t match my skills. It seems very programming language, and platform focused at this point--not really for APIs.</p>

<p>At first glance I thought Google Helpouts was more about Google APIs, available as an exentsion of the Google Developer program, but it seems to be a more tech focused, skills matching service. I think the same concept would work well, if applied to APIs, but I don&rsquo;t see any reason for a new platform, just build it on top of <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/docs">Stack Overflow API</a>&mdash;why re-invent the wheel?</p>

<p>If I had to pick one API that I worship the ground they walk on, and yet for some insane reason I don&rsquo;t write about very often&mdash;it would be the <a href="http://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America</a>. I can go on for days about how important the work that DPLA does. If you aren&rsquo;t up to speed on DPLA, "The Digital Public Library of America brings together the riches of America&rsquo;s libraries, archives, and museums, and makes them freely available to the world&rdquo;&mdash;via APIs! ;-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a history lover, so DPLA is extremely interesting, but what they do is so much more important to society at-large, an area that very few APIs can achieve. I am making an extra effort to publish more DPLA stories on API Evangelist, not just because they need it, but also because their approach to APIs is extremely forward thinking and relevant.</p>
<p>First DPLA story out of my writers notebook is about their use of <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>. First off, what is JSON-LD?</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="http://json-ld.org/"> JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale.</a></em></blockquote>
<p>So why does DPLA uses JSON-LD? I like their explanation on the <a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/technologies/">DPLA technologies page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/technologies/"> Everyone likes JSON, but it&rsquo;s not great for every purpose.  Pointing from one JSON object to another is a good example (because we do that a lot).  So we use JSON-LD. No worries &ndash; it&rsquo;s still JSON.  It&rsquo;s just got a couple of standardized fields. </a></em></blockquote>
<p>When you are weaving together artifacts from &ldquo;america&rsquo;s libraries, archives, and museums&rdquo;, then providing access as linked data and via APIs, you need to get pretty organized about how you keep track of, and connect your objects. I think it is a testament to the DPLA vision, that they are using JSON-LD, a very structured, and forward leaning vision of how we connect, not just digital objects, but also digital representations of the very physical objects in our world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make sure I spend time each month, to at least looking through the <a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/">DPLA API ecosystem</a>, keeping an eye on what they are up to with their API platform, but I intend to also look through the collections and brainstorm on what is possible via the API&mdash;I encourage you to as well.</p>

<p>I have read several stories about security breaches in the past couple days, ranging from <a href="http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/tip/API-security-more-critical-as-componentization-grows">exploitation of APIs across the distributed systems we are increasingly depending on</a>, to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">no security at MoonPig for their mobile app</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/05/reverse-engineering-of-the-kayak-api-from-the-mobile-app/">the reverse engineering of a popular mobile app&mdash;this time it is the Kayak mobile app</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I am biased, but I can&rsquo;t help but think, in a world increasingly driven by mobile devices, we need to treat all applications like they are external, get to work seting up a proper API program, and secure all apps the same way, no matter whether they are used for internal, partner, or public usage. Treating internal apps differently, opens things up for a whole world of hurt when internal systems are compromised, and ignoring how public facing your API is, when embedded in a popular mobile  app, goes into the same category.</p>
<p>If you have a single API stack, that ALL of your systems integrations, web, mobile, and device based-apps use, you have established a single surface area youneed to secure. Then, if you are using modern API infrastructure, a surface area that you can monitor, and have established relevant service composition, tailored for internal, partner, and public access of resources, you will be able to stay in tune with your API usage, and identify negatives situations much faster--across all devices.</p>
<p>If you are operating your business on the Internet today (i hope you are), consider treating all your apps as external, no matter where they reside, or who uses them&mdash;your overall architecture will be much healthier, and resilient because off because of it.</p>

<p>I was working in&nbsp;<a href="http://restlet.com/technical-resources/apispark/guide">APISpark</a>, playing around with different approaches to creating APIs for data stores i have in Amazon S3, Github, and in Google Spreadsheets. The cloud API deployment solution allows me to generate APIs from CSV, XML, JSON and spreadsheet stores in these locations, to a central API platform faster than I could even consider doing manually.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m managing a simple data API I have, I see the option to generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; in the toolbar, something that is also available to me when working in the <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet Studio</a>. This is one of the benefits of creating machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API blueprint</a> of your APIs. Restlet doesn&rsquo;t generate server code for you from your file stores, it generates a machine readable definition of your file source, then lets you generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; from that.</p>
<p>Server skeletons are not a fully functioning API for your file store, APISpark gives you that. These server skeletons are just scaffolding in Java or Node.js, that give you a starting framework for deploying an API beyond the Restlet / APISpark platform. You still have to wire things up to the file store, database, or other location of the data store&mdash;it is just the beginning.</p>
<p>I guess my goals with this post is to educate people that it is possible to generate server skeletons from APISpark, using common data sources, but I also just like the name. I have used the term server-side scaffolding, but I like server skeletons better. I think I will keep using it to describe what you can generate server side when you employ API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="/admin/blog/API blueprint">API Blueprint</a>.</p>

<p>I was taking another look at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/dev/api">Reddit API</a>&nbsp;over the weekend, and thought their listing of API endpoints was pretty interesting. They provide two ways of looking at the platform APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Section</strong> - Listing of Reddit APIs by account, apps, links, listings, and other groupings.</li>
<li><strong>oAuth Scope -</strong> Listing of Reddit APIs by the endpoints oAuth scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure if it is something all APIs should follow, I just thought it was an interesting approach, something I haven&rsquo;t seen in any other API area. Reddit has a number of APIs, I can see if you have specific goals with the API, this might be useful to have API sorted in this way.</p>

<p>In 2015, I will enter the 5th year of API Evangelist. To quote one of my favorite bands--&ldquo;What a Long Strange Trip Its Been&rdquo;.  I couldn&rsquo;t be more thankful for the career choice I made in 2010, and extremely grateful for the partners, and loyal readers I&rsquo;ve established along the way.</p>
<p>This list is very long, but I have to <a href="http://3scale.net">specifically call out 3Scale</a>, and their support of what I do, without them API Evangelist wouldn&rsquo;t be happening, I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing my research, and open projects like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> wouldn&rsquo;t exist&mdash;additionally we wouldn&rsquo;t be having the <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a> conversation that 3Scale makes happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big year end wrap-up or predictor type of guy, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean I do not spend a lot of time reflecting this time of year. I honestly don&rsquo;t feel like anything has changed for me, I&rsquo;m just as dedicated to my API Evangelist in 2015 as I ever have, and here is what I&rsquo;m focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong> - Telling stories on my blogs about what the smartest people in the space are doing with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong> - Researching how APIs are impacting a variety of industries, government, and even our personal world.</li>
<li><strong>Universities</strong> - I am convinced that the next generation workforce needs to be digitally literate to be successful. </li>
<li><strong>APIStrat &amp; API Days</strong> - Helping facilitate the important tech, business, and political conversations that happen at <a href="http://apistrat.com/">APIStrat</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.apidays.io/">API Days</a>.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json</strong> - Encourage the use of APIs.json to assist in API discovery, and enable the assembling of the next generation API stacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there is a lot more going on, this is my primary focus, and what you will find me doing most of the time in 2015. I will be seriously cutting back my travel, to focus on my research and storytelling. You can find me at APIStrat and API Days events, and at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag</a> and <a href="http://www.gluecon.com/">Gluecon</a>, but beyond that I feel the biggest impact I make is keeping up with the space, telling stories, and publishing research that folks can use.</p>
<p>When it comes to predictions, I&rsquo;m in alignment with 3Scale (once again). I think <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2015/01/api-predictions-2015/">their list of 2015 API predictions</a> is very pragmatic, and provides a healthy view of what 2015 will look, where the most important thing that happens this year, is the steady, healthy growth of the API sector.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.moonpig.com/uk/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/logo_moonpig.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I saw a story of yet another security breach related to how mobile phones are using APIs today.&nbsp;<a href="http://ifc0nfig.com/moonpig-vulnerability/">This one is from Paul Price, on his blog </a><a href="http://ifc0nfig.com/">ifc0nfig.com</a>, about the <a href="http://www.moonpig.com/uk/">greeting card site MoonPig</a>.</p>
<p>Paul highlights the not just lack of, but actual absence of security when making API calls to MoonPig, allowing you to impersonate any user, place orders, add/retrieve card information, and any other API driven feature of the mobile application.</p>
<p>MoonPig is looking into it of course:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>We are aware of claims re customer data and can confirm that all password and payment information is and has always been safe.</p>
&mdash; Moonpig (@MoonpigUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoonpigUK/status/552419988834111489">January 6, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>When those of us in the API industry talk about public APIs, many folks think we are talking about APIs like Twitter that have publicly available information, or public APIs that allow for anyone to sign up for the service, when in reality, most of the time we are talking about APIs that use the public Internet for transport.</p>
<p>MoonPig&rsquo;s awareness regarding their API surface area, and complete lack of security is something we are going to see play out, in numerous very public, high profile security breaches in the coming years. There are hundreds if not thousands of companies out there right now who have the same setup, and rely on security through obscurity (nobody has discovered it yet).</p>
<p>I personally <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">recommend treating all APIs used in mobile devices like they are public APIs</a>, with a well defined, very public API definition, bundled with a very public security layer, like oAuth. You can still control who has access to signup and use the API, but one beneficial side effect is you can also treat all internal apps like their are just another user on the API.</p>
<p>This is the benefit of public API. Not the myths you often hear about becoming the next Twilio, but the reality that being public will force you to have a very much more well designed, and secure API, that you acknowledge operates on the open Internet. With this mindset you aren&rsquo;t operating in the shadows, you will begin treat your APIs traffic like is available on the open Internet&mdash;which, well, IT IS!!!</p>
<p>Back to the MoonPig story, look at the <a href="http://ifc0nfig.com/moonpig-vulnerability/">timeline of disclosure at the bottom of Paul's post</a>--he has given them 17 months since he first reported, and they still haven't fixed. OUCH!!</p>

<p>Your company's secret sauce doesn't involve keeping your APIs closed and proprietary&mdash;it is about making them as open and accessible as possible, to the point where even your competition can&rsquo;t help but uses them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m am always amazed at the amount of effort some companies put into hiding their API interface away, making me register before I can see anything, and dig through the SDK to even understand an APIs surface area.</p>
<p>If you have a public API, or a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">publicly available mobile app, you have a public API</a>&mdash;put it out there. Be loud and proud of your API designs (if you aren&rsquo;t, then we should have another discussion), make them front and center, within two clicks of your developer landing page.</p>
<p>If you are worried about someone copying your interface, and re-using it in their own API designs, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you are in the wrong business</span>. In the API space, this is good. Think AWS EC2 and S3. Everyone under the sun has copied their interface, even their competition, and what has happened? Oh, they are the dominant player in an entirely new way of doing business--using APIs.</p>
<p>If you think your API surface area, aka the naming, description, and order of your API endpoints, parameters, and data models, is your secret sauce, you are wrong. It is how you deliver within that framework, and the services, support, and other building blocks you provide in support of the interface.</p>
<p>Please stop hiding your APIs, put them out there where everyone can find them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As I travel around talking to folks about APIs, I spend as much time as I can, educating folks about <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. In the course of my evangelism, I&rsquo;m constantly reminded how little people, who have even heard, and read about APIs.json, really understand about what it actually is. With this in mind, I will be regularly publishing examples of what APis.json is, to help on-board everyone to Steve (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@ngynx</a>), and mine vision for <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.</p>
<p>APIs.json is an open format, in partnership between <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, to help API providers make their APIs more discoverable, assist API brokers in aggregating multiple APIs deemed valuable within specific industries, and ultimately empowering API consumers in finding exactly the APIs they need to be successful. Our mission is to make the process of API discovery as portable as we can, enabling it to live on any website, and be found in open search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>.</p>
<p>APIs.json is a machine-readable description of your company, and its associated API resources. For each API listed, you give it a name, description, and supporting properties, which may be as simple as providing a link to your documentation, or be as complex as providing a link to a machine readable API definition in the Swagger or API Blueprint format. One APIs.json detail, that I feel many technologists overlook, is that this isn&rsquo;t just discovery in a hypermedia context, this could only be about the discovery of your pricing or maybe just the terms of service page (I know, a hypermedia format can descibe this, but I think you are missing an intermediary step to get the space there!)</p>
<p>If you need an example of APIs.json file, a good place to start is the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json for APIEvangelist.com</a>, this provides a good default example of APIs.json working within a single domain. If you want to better understand how an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a> may use to build API collections, take a look at the <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json for my utility stack</a>, which is a collection of APIs from various locations, brought together to serve a specific purpose. Beyond that, take a look at the <a href="http://theapistack.com">700+ APIs.json files I&rsquo;ve created for top APIs as part of my API Stack</a>&mdash;hopefully this will help you see it in action across hundreds of API resource.</p>
<p>Our goal is to encourage <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EVERY</strong></span> API provider to publish an APIs.json in the root of their public domain(s), but it can also be used in the same way for private APIs, so don't get hung up on the public aspect of all of this. Beyond these early implementations, I want people to also build <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/11/exposing-dictionaries-from-my-api-collections/">API collections</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">virtual stacks of the APIs</a> for use in their own projects, beginning the process of building some valuable definitions of th emost used APIs in use today. Please join this evolution API discovery, and publish your own <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json file</a>&mdash;I appreciate the help.</p>

<p>I am beginning to track on reverse engineering API story that I come across, so if you find any, feel free to share my way. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with this growing trend, I&rsquo;m talking about the reverse engineering of APIs from popular mobile apps, specifically in situation where the company doesn&rsquo;t have a public API or developer presence.</p>
<p>APIs are driving the mobile applications tht we are increasingly depending on, but for some reason in 2015 not all companies expose, or share information about this API surface area with the public. The latest story I came across in this trend is <a href="http://www.shubhro.com/2014/12/18/reverse-engineering-kayak-mitmproxy/">the reverse engineering of the Kayak API using mitproxy</a>.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, <a href="https://www.kayak.com/labs/api/search/">there was a public Kayak API,</a> but somewhere along the way it went away. There tends to be a lot of misconceptions around how to conduct a public API presence, and when coupled with the ignorance around the tech, business, and politics of APIs, you see a lot of failed public API attempts--that quietly go away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m continuing to track on this because I think this is a security, and privacy conversation that will continue to unfold in the public sphere, whether we want it to or not. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">If your APIs are driving a publicly available mobile app, you have public APIs</a>. Period. You might as well treat these APIs like they are public. I&rsquo;m not saying you have to be the next Twitter--I&rsquo;m saying your company needs to get educated on modern technological, business, and legal approaches to making resources available over the open Internet.</p>
<p>You do not have to open up your APIs to the general public, but your API surface area is public, and you should be transparent about how you operate them, how you onboard partners, how data flows publicly via your API pipes, and how you manage the security and privacy of your network. This is a theme you will hear more from me, alongside every reverse engineer story, security and break of a popular mobile app, until more companies possess a public API developer area that properly addresses the tech, business, and politics of their public digital footprint.</p>

<p>I am spending a lot of time lately reviewing Internet of Things (IoT) providers, as I work on a white paper for Gigaom. There are some very interesting approaches to APIs out there in IoT-land, and I&rsquo;m starting to get a feel for some of the patterns, trends, and habits of how IoT providers are approaching their developer efforts.</p>
<p>One pattern I see a lot, and can only assume it comes out of the hardware side of engineering, is a focus on programming language when you talk about your API--something I recommend shifting away from. In the world of web APIs, the focus on the interface, and what it does, and actual programming languages are abstracted away, and provided merely as samples, libraries, and SDKs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that in the mind of developers who are building APIs for devices, they are approaching APIs from their legacy SDK point of view, and there really isn&rsquo;t any decoupling of thought based upon web APIs. For these engineers, I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, the importance of separating your interface, from your SDKs, and when you craft language about your API, you generalize the API speak, and keep language specific elements strictly in the support areas for those specific SDKs.</p>
<p>You never know, it might be that one Go developer who builds the perfect connector for your device, or some scientist wielding Python, who integrates a sensor into their work, and then things go viral. The chances that this will happen is less likely if you are just talking about the one or two programming languages that you (the platform) are familiar with.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-speed-limit-blank.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>After giving some recent attention to the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter API ecosystem</a>, a place where I always learn a lot, I&rsquo;m shifting up my API rate limit building block, in my list of <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management resources</a>. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with my concept of &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo;, in 2010 I started looking at the top APIs, and tracking on the common &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; these providers are using to successfully operate their API platform. As I go into 2015, I&rsquo;m still refining, and adding to this list, in hopes of establishing a <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common list of building blocks, that any API provider can consider as they are designing, and operating their own platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Until now, I had a single building block, underneath a category I titled &ldquo;service levels&rdquo;, which I called the rate limit page. My intent with this building block is to help API providers understand the importance of sharing details on how they rate limit API access, and publish it to a single page for developers to use when on-boarding, and throughout their API integration life-cycle. After seeing how Twitter handles their rate limit, which includes this overview page on rate limiting, I&rsquo;m now adding two new building blocks, and putting all of them under new category titled &ldquo;Rate Limiting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I now have three rate limiting related API building blocks I recommend API providers consider when designing their platform:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="125" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-speed-limit.jpeg" alt="" width="70" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Rate Limits Page</strong>&nbsp;- Developers need to understand what the limitations of API usage are upfront. Rate limiting an throttling of API access has become commonplace to manage security, and resource load. This building block is about providing a single page explaining how this process works, setting expectations with API consumers.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Rate Limit Information Inline In Docs</strong>&nbsp;- In addition to a rate limits page, explaining information about limitations on API usage, some API providers like Twitter are including rate limits within API documentation. With this approach, each API endpoint has its related rate limits published alongside other details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="125" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-rate-limit-api.png" alt="" width="100" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Account Rate Limit API</strong>&nbsp;- As API usage grows the need to be able to programmatically manage your account is increasing. Some API platforms also provide APIs for the management of platform operations. It makes sense that API providers should also offer an API for getting rate limit details for their respect account and apps.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As with all of my building block recommendations, it is up to you the API provider, to decide what you want to offer, but I recommend considering all three of these rate limit building blocks essential. Providing details on API rate limiting is critical in building trust with new, and existing API consumers, and as the API space continues to grow, the need for automated account management tools, like an API for rate limiting is only going to increase. If you adopt these practices of leading providers now, you have the competitive advantage over other APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">I don&rsquo;t always agree with Twitter&rsquo;s approach to managing their API</a>, but their ecosystem is always a great place to learn. I personally consider Twitter on of the most important APIs out there, and feel that API providers can learn a lot from the way Twitter approaches their operations. Rate limits are one of the most politically polarizing areas of API operations, and an area that can turn bad real fast, without the proper communication. Something that I think Twitter has worked very hard on addressing, and you can see it in their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting">rate limit page</a>, the rate limit information available <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/application/rate_limit_status">within the documentation for each endpoint, and via an API rate limit API</a>&mdash;deep. ;-)</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>As I'm linking up this story, I see Twitter also has a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limits">Rate Limit Chart</a> page. Maybe a fourth building block, or just go on the rate limit main page?</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Dec 2014</span>

<p>When you first land on any <a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/">API developer landing page</a>, the impression you get, can be one of the most important aspects of on-boarding with an API that I know of. More time than not, I'm pretty confused when I land on the landing page of APIs, being forced to look for what I need to get up and running with API what an API does, and how I will have to integrate with it.</p>
<p>Anytime I come across an API landing page, where I'm immediately given the best possible first impression I can image, I have to showcase. This just happened while taking another look at the Etsy API, which I found refreshingly simple--yet complete.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/etsy-first-impressions.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Everything on the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/">Etsy API developer landing page</a> has a purpose in assisting me during on-boarding with the Etsy API. To better understand this in action, let's look at the handful of essential API management building blocks available on the Etsy home page.</p>
<p>When I land at etsy.com/developers/, immediately I&rsquo;m given a Flexible Messaging Area (FMA), telling me what is possible! It is not just one simple message, as I advocate for constantly, it is a slideshow of multiple, simple messages. #winning</p>
<p><strong>What Does The API Do?</strong><br /> Beyond understand what the Etsy API does in 250 characters or less, I get a prominent link to the API documentation, discussion around the API, and the terms of use for the API&mdash;-BOOM, everything I need. Way to give me exactly what I need so far to get up and running, while also getting out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I On-Board With An API?</strong><br /> Next, there is a pretty clear blue highlighted box, that helps me understand the connection between my Etsy seller account, and registering as a developer. I&rsquo;m given what I need to register as a developer, and also configure my Etsy shop for proper integration.</p>
<p><strong>Do I Actually Need To Integrate Myself?</strong><br /> After than, I&rsquo;m asked if I am look for Etsy App? Maybe that is all I need. I don&rsquo;t actually need to integrate with Etsy myself, I&rsquo;m look to see if the integration I need has already been done. I just need an application to meet my needs&mdash;nice use of an application showcase Etsy.</p>
<p><strong>Work At Etsy - See current openings!</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ll let you in on a little secret. API ecosystem are often used for talent acquisition. shhhhhh!!! So, Etsy having a section on the home page about working at Etsy, just makes sense. If you are finding yourself in the Etsy Developer area, you are probably a little more curious than the average visitor, and quite possibly someone that Etsy might consider hiring.</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling: Code As Craft</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m a loyal fan of Etsy&rsquo;s Code As Craft blog, so I&rsquo;m not going to knock the fact that their home page blog widget isn&rsquo;t performing as expected. I&rsquo;m guessing normally I would see the last 3 posts from the blog, which in my opinion is essential operations for ANY API landing page. I&rsquo;m sure the Etsy one will be up and running as normal shortly. ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Everything I Need To Keep Me Connected To The Entire Etsy Platform</strong><br /> Providing a complete picture of platform operations is essential for any online service provider. When I&rsquo;m on your main website, I shouldn&rsquo;t have to work to hard to find your API or developer area, and vice versa, I do not want to have to work to get back to the main website, and other sections of a site. Etsy provides what I need to search and browse Etsy, and register or sign into my primary account&mdash;directly from the API developer area.</p>
<p>What started as a pretty straightforward review of an API--routine going back through my list of APis I monitor--ended up being surprisingly good first impression of an API, I've been to several times before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always working to help API providers understand the importance of designing their API developer portals, with a larger audience in mind. Not everyone who visits your portal, will be the one integrating with your API, and providing information for non-developers about the value delivered via API resources, can go a long ways to reach the media, and decision makers at companies who will be potentially be making decision around integrating with a service.</p>
<p>I look at a lot of API portals, and always enjoy the ones that speak to the widest possible audience. I also enjoy when there are entire sections dedicated to providing tools and resources for non-developers. One example of this, that I found recently is available over at the<a href="https://www.rev.com/api"> transcription and translation platform from Rev</a>, on the <a href="https://www.rev.com/api/zapier">page they have dedicated to Zapier</a>. I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/24/showcasing-your-api-integrations-with-other-platforms/">written before about companies referencing their IFTTT and Zapier integration</a>, but I think Rev&rsquo;s approach needs highlight because they provide a full page, with actual links to specific types of integrations.</p>
<p>Rev provides some valuable &nbsp;information on what Zapier is, what you can do with Rev and Zapier, and actually walks you through how to actually setup this up, on a page that is given the same prominence as the API documentation (important!).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rev.com/api/zapier"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/rev/rev-zapier.png" alt="" width="550" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>Rev provides you with direct links to put Rev to work, by transcribing from YouTube and Vimeo, and workflows for putting these transcripts on Dropbox, Google Drive or Box.  You can click on links that take you to the detail page on Zapier, where you can get up and running with the recipe. I <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">added Zapier as a building block a while back</a>, but I really feel that it is quickly becoming an essential building block, something all providers should be considering in 2015.</p>
<p>I think it is really important to provide ready-to-go reciprocity tools for any API platform. I also think it is important to show them alongside API documentation and the other tools meant specifically for developers. This is the power of web API over historic API approaches, in that APIs aren&rsquo;t just for developers. Web APIs exist to provide quick and dirty solutions to problems that anyone faces in their business or personal worlds, and I think Rev&rsquo;s use of Zapier represents this very well.</p>

<p>I had someone ask me, if out of the 3<a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">0 API reciprocity providers I track on</a>, if I knew if one of them offered white or private label services. I couldn&rsquo;t confidently say whether or not any of them did, and as I do with my other questions, the best way to find out, is to put it out into the universe, and see whether or not one of the providers will let me know, or one of them will do it.</p>
<p>It would make sense for companies like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> to offer a solution that would allow for any company to resell their services, and offer specialty versions of their API reciprocity, interoperability, and automation services. As more companies are operating online, spread across various cloud environments, the need for ETL in the cloud, or like I prefer to call them, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity services</a>, is only going to increase.</p>
<p>Not all companies will want to use a Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, and would prefer operating on-premise, and like to offer the services to their partners, or possibly their customers--opening up the need to brand it themselves. If you know one of the API reciprocity providers that offer anything like this, or plan on doing it, let me know. I have some people who have been asking for it, and would be happy to tell more stories about it.</p>

<p>I'm reviewing the business models of many of the top API platforms over the last couple of weeks, and I&rsquo;m seeing some pretty interesting approaches to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">API monetization</a>. As I look through each API, I see that some platforms don&rsquo;t have their API monetization strategy together at all, while others are following the pretty proven &ldquo;cloud utility&rdquo; model handed down from providers like AWS, and then I see some who are continuing to standardize how we pay for, and monetize APIs--which makes me happy.</p>
<p>One <a href="http://www.convertapi.com/prices">interesting pricing page I reviewed over the holidays</a>, was from the <a href="http://www.convertapi.com">file conversion API, ConvertAPI</a>. They have a credit based API monetization approach, allowing you to buy a certain amount of credits on a monthly basis, or make one-time basis. Each area offers four tiers, allowing for the purchase of credits at a various rates. One thing I found curious though, is that your credits purchased monthly do not roll over, where your one time purchases do&mdash;I will have to think about the pros / cons of this more, before I comment.</p>
<p>The ConvertAPI also has a "<a href="http://www.convertapi.com/prices#CreditsCostTable">credits cost table</a>", providing an overview of how credits actually translate into actual API calls. Many file conversion APIs use a one-to-one rate for making API calls, while others cost 2, 3, or even 5 credits per each API call. I like this approach to defining API costs, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">when your API developer account includes a API for monitoring</a> account levels, it <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/02/a-market-for-api-developer-credits/">starts getting us closer to the API pricing standardization</a>, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">automation we will need to continue the growth of the API economy</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding a lot of individual API monetization stories as I go through this latest round of research. I&rsquo;m thinking I will have to spend a couple of weeks in February or March of 2015, step back and look at the monetization strategies of the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies I&rsquo;m tracking on</a>, and hopefully provide some better analysis of where we stand with this vital layer of the API industry. Along with the work I&rsquo;m doing to encourage companies to create machine readable API definitions for their APIs, accompanied with machine readable licensing using <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, I want to help encourage the standardization of API pricing&mdash;then who knows, maybe someday API pricing can be machine readable, allowing us to make real-time decisions on the APIs we use based upon cost.</p>

<p>As I look through the API efforts of various providers, I&rsquo;m always looking for the little things that can make on-boarding, and sustained integration with an API as frictionless as possible. One of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that I recommend API providers employ</a> in their operations, is a page that explains API rate limits&mdash;providing vital information on how API resources are throttled (or not).</p>
<p>An improvement on the standard rate limit building block, can be seen at Twitter. <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/application/rate_limit_status">Inline in the Twitter API documentation</a>, there are details about rate limiting for that specific endpoint. This way, as you are learning about each endpoint, you can also understand what limitations are in place. A small addition that could prove critical, for any API provider, especially Twitter, who has some of the most complex rate limiting of any API I know of.</p>
<p>At first glance, something small like including rate limit information within each API endpoint documentation may seem insignificant, but think of it like bobsledding or swimming in the olympics, where the slightest adjustment can reduce friction in just the right place&mdash;giving you the competitive advantage you need. Taking a fresh look at the building block(s) Twitter uses around API rate limiting, is expanding my own thoughts on how any API provider can approach their own rate limiting, and represents why I keep an eye on API pioneers like Twitter, even if I don&rsquo;t always agree with 100% of their decisions around platform operations.</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>Did you notice the picture is of the rate limiting information, within the rate limit API endpoint? That will be another story, as part of my expansion of thought in the area of rate limiting.</em></p>

<p>APIs are a really tough concept to help folks on-board with. I have come to realize that people see APIs very differently, and most of the time, I think this can be a good thing. In a perfect world it would be nice if everyone followed the same standards, and used only the best API patterns, when designing their APIs. This isn't the world we have, and to help better engge within the world we have, I am working to tell stories of this dysfunctional but beautiful API space we have accidently created for ourselves, develop visuals that help us better quantify things, and potentially give little nudges where I can to move things in a better direction.</p>
<p>When I hear most technologists talk about APIs, I feel many are exclusively looking through a client / server lens. Your APIs is your backend server architecture, and then your client architecture that will be used to connect APIs to websites, mobile applications, devices, and other systems. When I try to talk about API copyright, projects like <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, or educate folks about modern approaches to API design, deployment, management and integration in this client / server mindset, it can be very difficult to articulate some very important concepts. Not all developers, software architects, and business leaders are familiar with this very important, and the rapidly evolving surface area being defined by API.</p>
<p>To help convey some of my thoughts about this very important layer of the API space, I've created some new visuals that I can use in stories, slide decks, and my research reports. First I want to elevate the discussion beyond just client / server architecture, and highlight the importance of the API definition surface area that is present in the middle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-one.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>When you are designing, developing, managing, and integrating with APIs, you use some very specific languages for developing your server architecture. We use programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby ,Node.js and other languages to develop the server side of our API. In most scenarios, companies choose the programming language they are already using across their business, developing all server side architecture in a common language.</p>
<p>Inversely, when it comes to client side architecture, companies should work to provide as many possible programming languages possible, providing code samples, libraries, and SDKs for all popular platforms. This is the promise of simple web APIs, is that a well designed API will abstract away any language specific details present on the server, making it accessible in any programming language. Then the good API providers encourage integration, by providing a wide variety of client tooling as they possibly can, to make integration as frictionless as possible.</p>
<p>In the middle, for the API definition layer, modern API developers are defining their interfaces, using machine readable formats like <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. Providing a machine readable definition of an API is proving to be critical for just about every aspect of the API life-cycle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-two.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>If you have a public API, or publicly available mobile or Internet of Things apps, you have a public API interface. This layer exists on the open Internet, and as we go into 2015, this layer for all public APIs should be well defined. Developers are using this definition to integrate with their existing systems, generating client tools, and are powering testing, monitoring, and other critical aspects of API integration.</p>
<p>Your server architecture is critical to API operations, and while I'm not in the business of telling pople how to license server side code, I will encourage anyone to make sure and at least apply a license, and I personally believe in using as liberal of license as you possibly can. When it comes to your client architecture, I will get a little more pushy about how things should be licensed--you are asking someone to integrate your API into their business, existing applications, and the code you provide should allow for as much flexibility as possible, not imposing restrictions.</p>
<p>This approach also applies to the API definition layer. Your API definition should be as accessible, open, and flexible as possible. You are expecting users to bake your Application Programming Interface (API) into their worlds, and this surface area is the point at which your two business meet. You can keep your server side code as a "secret sauce", but your API definition, and client architecture should be as open as possible.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-three.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>I do not think that copyright should be able to be applied to API definitions, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/02/helping-eff-urge-the-courts-to-block-copyright-claims-in-oracle-v-google-api-fight/">my work with the EFF on the Oracle vs. Google Java API copyright case</a> reflects this. With that said, we don't live in a perfect world, and embracing the one we have, I encourage applying a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a> or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a> license to your API definitions, regardless of whether or not you use Swagger, API Blueprint, or RAML. After you do, I encourage you to <a href="http://apicommons.org/index.html">add it to the API Commons</a>.</p>
<p>I've had conversations with people who claim that their API surface area is their secret sauce. First if it supports a public mobile app, is used on websites, or provides integration of external systems, and devices over the open Internet--it ain't a secret! Second your sauce should be in the delivery of services behind your API surface area, the actual wording, order, and other aspects of your definition should be open for anyone to use!</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-four.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>It is incredibly important that this layer of the API space is well defined, front and center in our conversations, and remains as openly accessible as possible. If you need a real world analogy to better understand the openness of this layer, <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">read my API copyright -- restaurant menu story</a>. Your menu is not your business, it will be the service behind the menu that truly defines your company.</p>
<p>The best example of this in action, within the API space, is around the Amazon S3 and EC2 APIs. If these API definitions were not openly available, and were protected under copyright, would cloud computing have ever happened? Would we have an ecosystem of tooling like Eucalyptus, to Chrome or Firefox extensions, that has helped us deploy global infrastructure, and build applications that have come to define cloud computing.</p>
<p>Please work with me to make sure the most important layers of the API space stay as open, and accessible as possible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m profiling all the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies I monitor across the space</a>, going through each one and defining their API program, evaluating the tech, business and politics of their operations. Part of this process is creating a Swagger definition for each API. I&rsquo;m not deeply concerned with getting each API definition 100%, unless I'm directly integrating with the aPI. For this round I&rsquo;m looking at defining just the surface area of the API, including each endpoint, headers, parameters, and body format, and leaving the underlying data model for another time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publishing all of my API definitions to the API Stack Github repository</a>. I&rsquo;m using this as a staging area before I publish them to <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Last month <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2014/11/apis-io-hit-front-page-of-hacker-news/">I create an APIs.son for 690 APIs</a>, and I&rsquo;m looking to generate as many Swagger definitions for these high value APIs as I can over the holidays. It would be much better if API providers generated, and maintained their own API definitions, but until that happens I&rsquo;m happy doing a little extra work to get us to a critical mass.</p>

<p>Feel free to use any of my Swagger specifications, all that I ask is if you update, or add to them, please commit back to the repository so everyone can benefit. Additionally if you have any Swagger definitions for your own APIs, or other public APIs that I do not have in my listings, please share. It is extremely important that all public API endpoints are defined in a machine readable format. I don&rsquo;t care if you use Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML, just make sure your APIs have a definition, and it is shared publicly. If it is one of your designs, make sure and also add to API Commons.</p>
<p>When I reach a critical mass of <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">API definitions in the API Stack Github repo</a>, I will publish a story on apievangelist.com announcing they are there, and do incremental pushes to APIs.io, so that these value APIs are part of its open index, allowing you to build API collections, and even your open API search engine. Its important that we all <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/">work to define this layer of the API space, and work to keep it as open, and machine readable as possible</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/docker-swagger.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m developing a common API for all the APIs I deploy via Docker containers, meaning that each API that I design as a Docker image, will have an API to control all aspects of deployment, and its operations. I will be keeping most of the surface area available in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/#v116">current version of the Docker API</a>, but I'm thinking I will add a handful of endpoints, and maybe alter a couple of the existing Docker defined endpoints to better meet my needs.</p>
<p>To support my work, I need a Swagger 2.0 definition for the v1.16 of the Docker API. I wish everyone would create machine readable API definitions for their APIs by default, but until that is the norm, I will be creating myself. I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at writing scrape scripts for harvesting API documentation (if they are well formed).</p>
<p>This Swagger definition not 100% complete, but <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json">here is what I have so far of a Swagger 2.0 representation of the Docker v1.16 API</a>. Its on Github, so if you use this definition, and fix anything, or add parts and pieces i didn't, please submit back, so everyone can benefit from it. I haven't completed the data model for the endpoints, but I'm storing the JSON responses for each endpoint, and just need to set aside some time to finish.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json">Swagger 2.0 definition for the Docker v1.16 API on The API Stac</a>k, where <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">I publish all my Swagger definitions for the APIs</a> I integrate with, and monitor as part of my research. I&rsquo;m adding definitions all the time, so check back often, and if you have any API definitions I do not, feel free to fork the repo, and submit them via pull request. I&rsquo;m not just looking for Swagger, I'd love to have any format you generate machine readable API definitions in&mdash;it is important that all of this layer of the API space, is accessible, and machine readable, so please help make it so.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/12/19/on-being-an-api-broker-for-hackathons/">On Being An API Broker For Hackathons</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hackathon.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I recently had a conversation with one of my contacts at a federal agency about a hackathon tour they are planning. The federal government doesn&rsquo;t call these events hackathons, they call them data jams, but for sake of this story I&rsquo;m going to call them hackathons, and also omit the name of the agency until they are ready to talk about the event(s) publicly.</p>
<p>This agency had many questions about putting on a hackathon, but one I found particularly interesting, and something that is in line with other concepts I&rsquo;m exploring in the API space, was the desire to assemble a stack of resources that developers could put to use at the event, along with their own agency APIs. They were concerned about hackathon teams coming to the event and having to spend a great deal of time looking for APIs, open data-sets, and tools to use in their projects.</p>
<p>Building on top of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">other stories I've told about being an API broker</a>, I will be putting some thought into how I can possibly act as an API broker for this agency and their hackathon(s). I will set up a Github repository, where I will list agency APIs, as well as bring other relevant government agencies APIs and open data sets. I won&rsquo;t stop there, I will also consider what other private sector APIs, and open tooling that would help attendees be more successful, save time and ultimately rise to the occasion.</p>
<p>These thoughts are building on earlier ideas from Cyril Gaillard in his medium post titled "<a href="https://medium.com/@cyrilgaillard/i-dont-need-a-business-co-founder-i-need-an-api-broker-c9be536cf8fa">I don&rsquo;t need a business co-founder, I need an API broker</a>". My motivations are all about defining a new breed of evangelists who really understand the API space, and know where to find the best APIs, tools, and other resources. Then these API brokers can use Github to aggregate all relevant APIs, data sources, and tools or services into a single location, saving developers real time and money when building applications.</p>
<p>Maybe not for these hackathons, but in other API broker scenarios I can envision the API broker also signing up for developer accounts, organizing API keys, and finding other meaningful tasks that would save time, and increase efficiencies for developers. An API Broker would be in charge of managing all resources that a development team will need to achieve their objectives, as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>As the number of APIs increase, I envision the concept of a single developer or API evangelist, for a single API evolving to a world where there are many API brokers, who deeply understand many APIs. Then companies, organizations, and government agencies can lean on these API brokers to help them build the best aggregate backend stack possible for projects, hackathons, and any other scenario where APIs will be put to use, potentially solving problems that these groups and individuals face on a daily basis.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2014</span>

<p>I have been spending a lot more time in 2014 <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">learning, discussing, and telling stories about hypermedia</a>. Early this year <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/what-is-a-hypermedia-api/">I identified that hypermedia was moving beyond just academic discussion</a>, and entering the mainstream consciousness of the API community. I do not consider myself a hypermedia expert, and had a lot more to learn, and by moving hypermedia further into my regular research, over time this education would come.</p>
<p>At the end of 2014, my deep technical knowledge of hypermedia, and the nuances between each of the formats isn&rsquo;t there yet&mdash;I just do not have the production experience with any of them to know what I&rsquo;m doing. I can provide an overview of the technology, the various formats, and the people behind each movement, as well as point to some real world hypermedia implementations, but when it comes to getting down to the details I&rsquo;m just not there yet.</p>
<p>One of my readers, from a leading tech company recently emailed me asking for a <em>&ldquo;hypermedia pragmatist&rdquo;</em>&mdash;here is an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><em> We have a lot of opinions in our organization about how we should implement hypermedia APIs.  I&rsquo;d like someone to discuss pros/cons of different approaches in our monthly API discussion group but don&rsquo;t want someone who only promotes one view (i.e., JSON-LD, HAL, etc.) or is extreme in their hypermedia views.<br /><br /> Do you know of anyone whom you would consider a hypermedia pragmatist?  Someone who understands the competing specs but is pragmatic about how to implement.</em></blockquote>
<p>This describes what I&rsquo;ve set out to be for the API space in general, being a pragmatists in the tech, business, and politics of APIs, and I guess I can "almost" call myself a hypermedia pragmatists, except I just don&rsquo;t have the implementation experience. I&rsquo;m sharing this story, because I&rsquo;m getting this question at multiple companies,&nbsp;educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and government agencies I'm in talks with.</p>
<p>Eventually I will get there, and obtain the experience in implementing each of the <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/tools.html">leading hypermedia formats</a>, but until then I need some help. Do you consider yourself knowledgeable across the leading formats? Are you a pragmatists when it comes to understanding what is possible when it comes to API design, and the implementation? Are you nice, professional, and informative when it comes to API education, strategy, and execution?</p>
<p>If you are a hypermedia pragmatist and open to consulting, and telling stories from your engagement, please let me know.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time field questions from people about <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>. This is something I expect to be doing for the next 10 years, and happy to field questions about exactly what it is all about, and help educate folks about exactly where APIs.json it fits in to the overall API landscape.</p>
<p>A regular comment I get from technologists, and API savvy folks is <em>&ldquo;you know that hypermedia is a better solution for discovery than APIs.json?&rdquo; </em>To which I reply <em>&ldquo;yes I know, but hypermedia is a solution for the API world we want, and APIs.json is a solution for the world we have&rdquo;.</em> I would love it if everyone understood hypermedia, and designed and deployed their APIs with this knowledge in mind&mdash;something I&rsquo;ve spending a lot more time on in 2014, and will continue the push in 2015.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I intend to continue stitching apitogether thousands of APIs available out there, using APIs.json, allowing them to be discovered via open source public search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, private internal search engines, and IDE solutions like <a href="http://www.codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>. We don&rsquo;t just need discovery solutions to find new APIs, we need ways to build collections of high value APIs, something APIs.json excels at.</p>
<p>Another thing that APIs.json does, that I don&rsquo;t feel that hypermedia provides a solution to, is the discovery of the other technical, business, and political building blocks like the documentation, code libraries, SDKs, terms of service, and other critical elements of API operations. This an area that APIs.json was specifically defined for, allowing the discovery of these vital areas, in addition to the actual API interfaces.</p>
<p>As I do with many of my posts, this one is crafted to be a cookie cutter response to these comments I get regularly about hypermedia vs. APIs.json, allowing me to just reply with a link to this story on my blog. Hopefully we can shift the tide of API deployments in favor of hypermedia, but the APIs we can&rsquo;t do this with, APIs.json is a healthy alternative, and I even recommend using it alongside hypermedia to provide easy access to the other critical building blocks of API operations, that technologists often overlook.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a href="/admin/blog/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-email.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Most organization I&rsquo;ve worked with, the Excel spreadsheet is the central way of storing, managing and sharing data, with email being the number one way to share these data filled documents. When I was doing data inventory at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), as part of the White House open data initiative, almost every piece of high value data I found was housed in a spreadsheet, and the data stewards who were in charge of this data, would email it to me when I asked for it.</p>
<p>To help data stewards go from spreadsheet to API, I<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/email-xlsx-to-csv-json-xml"> wrote an Excel to JSON converter</a>, that was available via a private email address. All you had to do to convert a spreadsheet, was create a new email, attach your spreadsheet to the email, then send it to the specific address, and when it was done processing, you&rsquo;d get an email in response, with links to a CSV, XML, and JSON version of the spreadsheet&mdash;unless it was a super complex spreadsheet of course, but this wasn&rsquo;t our target.</p>
<p>Over the last year, this concept has simmered in my brain, and I can&rsquo;t help but think how important both Excel and email are to the onboarding the data that exists across small businesses, the enterprise, organizations, and government agencies. Imagine if you could monitor all the email that flowed within an organization, and look for spreadsheets being emailed back and forth. This would tell you a lot of about how data is stored, managed, and shared across groups. This intelligence could then be used to help direct API efforts, and open data initiatives like the one I participated in within the federal government.</p>
<p><a href="/admin/blog/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-excel-icon.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I put this idea in my Evernote a couple months back, and tried writing about it a few times, and during a recent flight I added to it. You could go beyond just identifying data usage patterns across a company, you could also generate APIs from this activity. Anytime an email with a spreadsheet attached was intercepted, a reply could be sent giving them a path to an API that was created, education about how to use that API, including a spreadsheet connector for the API, so that the person could continue working in the tools they are most comfortable, but now the data would be centralized, rather than fragmented across inboxes.</p>
<p>This idea could easily be executed upon using the <a href="http://context.io/">popular email API Context.io</a>, which would allow you to store an organization's email, and provide the index you&rsquo;d need to discovery the spreadsheets you can use to develop APIs, and identify how data is shared across an organization, then develop educational strategies for evolving behavior. I&rsquo;m pretty confident that part of the next wave of APIs will involve this layer of data, across businesses, organizations, and government agencies. I&rsquo;d like to see services like this emerge, to help organizations understand how they use data, and provide the vital intelligence needed to help change behavior for the better, evolving everyone towards an API centric way of getting business done.</p>

<p>I personally depend on over 40 APIs, all of which I have to manage my developer account, apps, and API key access for. This can be a lot of work, and as I continue to add APIs to my stack, this work is only going to grow. Putting on my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a> hat, and thinking about a future, where you will need to gather and organize potentially hundreds of APIs, across multiple companies, things are going to start breaking down if we don't do something to bridge these services.</p>
<p><strong>Standard API Developer Accounts</strong><br /> First, API onboarding will have to always include a standard API developer account, providing a common data model, and approach to managing developer accounts. Luckily many API platforms use <a href="http://www.3scale.net/">API management providers like 3Scale</a>, so this shouldn't be too much work, but I still come across plenty of APIs who do not even have basic developer account building blocks like analytics, or billing management.  I wrote about this, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/06/05/google-accounts-as-blueprint-for-all-software-as-a-service-applications/">using Google as potential blueprint for how we could possibly standardize developer accounts</a>, and I know that <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2014/12/02/using-json-web-tokens-as-api-keys/">service providers like Auth0 are working to help provide plug and play services</a> that address this as well.</p>
<p><strong>API For Developer Accounts</strong><br /> I recently wrote about the email API Mallet, a couple of weeks back, and how they <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">have an API for their API developer accounts</a>. This allows users to manage apps, their keys, as well as stay in tune with their API usage, and able to understand when they are hitting their limits, allowing them manage their access tier, and billing information programmatically. Imagine that, an API for accessing account resources?? API providers need to follow their own lead, and make sure all accounts have API by default--all aspects of your API platform should have an API in 2014, there really is no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Account Registration And Key Provisioning.</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m always pushing API providers to offer single sign for the creation of API developer accounts, allowing developers to sign up for API access with a single click, using their Github or Twitter accounts. This helps alleviate onboarding friction, and prevents developers from having to create yet another username and password. We have to go beyond even this approach, and begin to allow single API call, registration for API developer accounts. I want a way to just POST to example.com/auth, with my Github credentials, or other means, and have my developer account instantly setup, and my first app and keys returned. Account setup can be finished later, but this type of API account automation would speed up onboarding and the integration of applications.</p>
<p>These are just three of the ways that I feel we need to improve on the account creation, management, automation, and interoperability, for the APIs we are increasingly depending on. Since onboarding friction has been a stumbling block for many developers, and influencing their decision of which APIs they use in the past, I predict if API providers don't continue to improve on their API developer account workflow, developers will look elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you are an API provider, it can be easy to miss this layer of API integration, but us API consumers, and the growing number of us who are using numerous APIs, feel the pain. With the rapid growth in the industry, API account management will continue to grow as an area that needs a more sophisticated approach, and is something that makes the argument for using API infrastructure platforms like 3Scale, over hand-rolling your own API management solution.</p>

<hr />
<p><a href="http://www.noaa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/images/logos/noaa.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>...a group in the oceanography community was one of the pioneers of web accessible APIs. The original Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS) was created in the early 1990's, before the WWW! It defined the dods: protocol for requesting data and getting a response. When the WWW came along, it was revised to use HTTP and renamed to be the Data Access Protocol (DAP), partly because they realized its usefulness in a wide variety of scientific and other disciplines, not just oceanography. DAP is an open source project stewarded by a group called OPeNDAP. DAP was IMHO brilliant and amazingly far-sighted:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is RESTful (since before the WWW!).</li>
<li>Like JSON and relational databases, it defines a few data structures (e.g., scalars, multi-dimensional arrays, and database-like tables called "sequences") which can be used for an amazingly wide variety of data.</li>
<li>It includes a system for dataset-level and variable-level metadata (stored as a set of key=value). This is essential for the sciences, so, for example, the datasets can include a description of the dataset, and so that the units of individual variables can be specified (e.g., temperature units=degrees_Celsius) to avoid misunderstandings.</li>
<li>It defines a way for a user to request the structure of the dataset (.dds).</li>
<li>It defines a way for a user to request the attributes of the dataset (.das).</li>
<li>It defines a RESTful way for users to request a subset of the dataset (which is essential, since the datasets are often many TB each (the original Big Data!)). The method for requesting data from database-like tables is essentially SQL's SELECT FROM WHERE reformatted as a URL query.</li>
<li>It specifies the system used to return the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>So instead of having a thousand APIs for a thousand datasets, there is one API. (If I were to find fault with the current wave of Internet dataset APIs, it is the idea that every dataset should have its own API. That's a mistake. The DAP approach is far superior.)</p>
<p>There are several reusable data servers that support DAP (HYRAX, THREDDS, ERDDAP, GRADS, PYDAP, etc.) and numerous client software (including from within R, Matlab, ArcGIS). There are 100's of DAP servers in the world serving &gt;10,000 datasets. The same client software can work with any dataset from any of those servers. The next time you read about the IPCC and their climate models with voluminous output, know that the IPCC scientists use DAP to access and work with that data.</p>
<p>My reusable data server program, ERDDAP, uses DAP (and other protocols) and adds some additional features. Notably, you can also request a specific file type for the response (e.g., csv, htmlTable, xhtml, json, mat, kml, NetCDF). ERDDAP will generate that file on-the-fly. Thus, clients don't need client software; they can just get the data in their preferred file format. You can read about ERDDAP and try it at <a href="/admin/blog/ERDDAP">ERDDAP</a> can also make graphs and maps on-the-fly. A beautiful sample dataset is at <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplMURSST.graph">GRIDDAP</a>.</p>
<p>My division within NOAA also hosts an ERDDAP instance that works with the NOAA Unified Access Program (UAF) which seeks to make all of NOAA's data accessible via DAP servers. (We're far from the goal, but we're making progress.) It currently has &gt;5000 datasets. See&nbsp;<a href="http://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html">NOAA GEO-IDE UAF ERDDAP</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.respoke.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/respoke/respoke-web-communications-300x101.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the coming months I&rsquo;m doing some deep profiling of the API space, so you are going to see me reviewing the approach of more API providers in the space. My goal with API reviews is not just to showcase the company or service involved, but review the overall approach of the provider. You can <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/12/12/an-api-evangelist-review-of-your-api/">read more about my review process on API Evangelist</a>, to better understand my objectives.</p>
<p>The review in the queue today is from <a href="https://www.respoke.io">Respoke, a web communications platform</a>. When you land on the Respoke website, you see all the signs of a modern platform, starting with the simple single page app style website, but more importantly, they immediately tell me what they do, in a simple, easy to understand way:</p>
<blockquote><em>Add live voice, video, text, and data features to your website or app</em></blockquote>
<p>You wouldn't believe how hard this is for some of the APIs I review. If I have to spend more than 5 seconds trying to understand what you do, you've failed, and Respoke nails it, by both providing simple text, as well as visuals that help me understand that they are a web communications platform.</p>
<p>To continue understanding what Respoke does, let&rsquo;s take a stroll through all of the areas I focus on during any API review.</p>
<p><strong>Actual API Endpoints</strong><br /> I always start with the actual API endpoints when reviewing an platform. Respoke provides a basic set of endpoints, mostly for authentication of communications via the platform, but also managing roles, groups, etc. You can tell the API is new, and it doesn't have the telltale signs of a fully mature API that has been used for a while, but I know with Respoke, they are just getting going. I&rsquo;m not a fan of using POST, and relying on request data being passed through the body as JSON. I like simple parameter based design, with sensible usage of your verbs. I feel this approach makes an API more hackable by users, even non-developers who only know enough to be dangerous. It is not a show stopper, just a personal opinion of mine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.respoke.io"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/respoke/Respoke-Web-Communications.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Developer On-Boarding</strong><br /> Respoke provides a simple, frictionless on-boarding experience, easing you in with a getting started that walks you through the platform, and the self-service registration flow you need to get started with the service. At first glance I&rsquo;d say they can do a little better job of explaining the authentication. I haven't actually hacked on it yet, but at first glance it seems overly complex, or maybe just could be explained better. Another thing I'd like to see is a simple FAQ that I can scan to be able to see many of the common questions that get asked, and educate myself about Respoke in one page.</p>
<p><strong>Platform Documentation</strong><br /> Like the API endpoints themselves, the documentation is simple. I&rsquo;d like to see a <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> specs for the API, and some interactive documentation to go with it&mdash;in my opinion this is default for all platform documentation in 2014. I suspect as the API matures, so will the platform documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication &amp; Security</strong><br /> As I mentioned above, I think the authentication strategy is a little confusing when you are on-boarding. I&rsquo;m guessing I don&rsquo;t fully understand everything about the security and authentication of web communications via Respoke, but I also suspect they can put a little more work into help new users understand how it works, get started with basic authentication, and then when you are ready, learn more about the advanced security features around platform communications.</p>
<p><strong>Code For Integration</strong><br /> Respoke integration is pretty focused on JavaScript, so my evaluation of code resources will be a little different than with other APIs. I&rsquo;d like to see other language libraries, but I&rsquo;m sure as the platform evolves, we'll see these emerge from the community. Respoke provides JavaScript and Node.js libraries to get going, but what I really like is the <a href="https://docs.respoke.io/tutorials/example-apps.html">example apps that they provide</a>, or as I call them starter kits . I think starter kits go well beyond just providing code, but also help spark the imagination of developers around what is possible. +1 in this area for the Respoke usage of Github&mdash;I consider Github an essential building block for any API provider. Beyond these areas, I would suggest that Respoke spends some time thinking about what Platform Development Kits (PDK) they could provide. Providing ready to go solutions for top platforms like SalesForce, WordPress, and other leading systems that would benefit from a seamless web communications integration from Respoke. Similar to the starter apps they provide, PDKs would seriously contribute to adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Direct and Indirect Support</strong><br /> When it comes to support resources, Respoke has the minimum viable building blocks need, providing indirect support via a forum, and direct support via email. This is definitely the baseline for any provider, but I would encourage the addition of a support ticketing system as they pick up momentum, and definitely start keep an eye on Stack Overflow, and engaging developers on their own turf.</p>
<p><strong>Communication With Community</strong><br /> The Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ social accounts are front and center for Respoke, and they appear to be active&mdash;nice. However the lack of a blog always makes me sad. I know that many providers don&rsquo;t feel they have the resources to publish a blog, and keep active, but for me this is one of the most important signals an API platform can provide. When it comes to communicating with your API community, I&rsquo;d say the blog is number one, and after that Twitter and Github are number two and three. Respoke has 2 out of 3 when it comes to the essential communication building blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Platform Updates</strong><br /> As I made my way around the Respoke platform, I was happy to see there was a <a href="https://docs.respoke.io/reference/changelog.html">change log</a> keeping developers up to date with what has happened to the platform. I would also consider providing some sort of roadmap, providing the other end of the platform update coin. Since Respoke uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a> as core technology, it seems there should be some element of updates regarding browser support, and updates to the WebRTC format. I would also consider adding a status dashboard to keep Respoke users informed about the stability of the overall platform.</p>
<p><strong>Business Model</strong><br /> One of things I judge APIs on is their pricing, and whether or not the pricing page is front and center, and Respokes is. They provide you with a free tier for playing around, and sensible pricing tiers for you to grow into, with unit based pricing per minute and connection. How a platform wears its business model tells a lot about the underlying services, and Respoke is straight up about all of it. Kudos!</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong><br /> When it came to supporting resources for the Respoke platform, there really were no case-studies, slides from events, how to guides, and other vital resources to help developers through all stages of development. This is one area I&rsquo;m pretty lenient in early on, because I understand that many APIs are just getting going, and it will take time for supporting resources to be developed properly.  My goal is to just make sure the platform is aware of the lack of general resources, and make sure it gets into the roadmap ASAP.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.respoke.io/#pricing"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/respoke/Respoke-Pricing.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong><br /> I always like to see some sort of forward leaning research &amp; development areas of an API, such as an idea showcase, or labs environment. I think Respoke touches on this with their starter projects, that don&rsquo;t just provide valuable code, but also ideas for how the service can be integrated with, but I think they could take this further. Respoke needs to bring their experience with web communications, and WebRTC to the table and providing leading examples of what is next for web communications. There are many proven ways platforms demonstrate where their platform, and supporting technologies are headed, and I&rsquo;d like to see more of this within the Respoke community, I know the knowledge and talent exists, they just need to showcase on site.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Department</strong><br /> Respoke provides the required terms of service (TOS), and privacy policy that outlines how the platform operates. I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, but after reading through their TOS and Privacy Policy I didn&rsquo;t see any red flags regarding data ownership, privacy, or the other hot button areas I usually see around the politics of API operations. My first take on the Respoke legal department is that they are operating a pretty straightforward technology platform, and are respecting the interests of both developers, as well as end user. The only area I would comment on, is the lack of branding guidelines and resources for developers to take advantage of. I expect that branding will play an important role in helping drive Respoke adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable Tools</strong><br /> Respoke has a built in advantage in the area of embeddable, with the fact that many of their core integrations will be done via JavaScript. Respoke is meant to be embedded, and developers can do this pretty quickly using the default JavaScript library, but I think Respoke could go much further in this areas by providing embeddable platform development kits (PDK) as I mentioned above, as well as an assortment of other copy / paste goodies, and possibly even a communication widget builder. Properly branded, embeddable tools go a long way in acting as a marketing vehicle for the platform, educating users along the way of the platform behind the tools they are using.</p>
<p><strong>Development Environment</strong><br /> After I signed up for my Respoke account, logged in, and setup my first application, I noticed that Respoke had a dev mode for developer to take advantage of when integrating into their applications. I&rsquo;m a big fan of sandbox or development environments, allowing developers to build in a safer, more comfortable environment, but then being able to easily flip the production switch in a self-service way, when they are ready. I&rsquo;d like to see more integration resources available to developers, that help with development, QA, and production issues, and even provide monitoring, testing, and other common integration building blocks we are seeing from providers like <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a> and <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Portal</strong><br /> A simple, robust developer portal is a must these days for any providers, and Respoke provide a pretty standard account management solution, giving you control over settings, the ability managing individual applications, as well as your pricing and payment history. I&rsquo;d like to see more analytics, and other integration resources as I mentioned above, here in my Respoke developer area, but overall it provides the minimum viable portal developers need to be successful when integrating with an API--anticipating it will only get better.</p>
<p><strong>Balance and Consistency</strong><br /> Across the technical, business, and political building blocks of an API, I&rsquo;m always looking for balance and consistency. This might be in how they craft their actual API endpoints, but could also be in API documentation, code samples, or even storytelling on the blog. I&rsquo;d say that they are consistent in their API design, but as I mentioned above, I&rsquo;m not a fan of making requests a POST, using the body to pass values. While they are consistent in this use, I don&rsquo;t think its consistent with modern, web APIs developers are used to seeing. I think Respoke will achieve more balance, and consistency in their API design, as well as content and other resources available on the platform over time&mdash;they are just getting going, and it always takes a while to get firm footing in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Is It An Open API?</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m always hesitant to truly call an API &ldquo;open&rdquo;, until I peel back the layers of the onion, and make an assessment myself&mdash;just because an API is publicly available, doesn&rsquo;t mean it is open. After doing this, I can confidently say that Respoke is an open API. It is publicly available, self-service, with a straightforward business model, including sensible TOS. Only time will tell if Respoke continues to deliver their services in an open way, but the way they've constructed their platform so far, tells me they will.</p>
<p><strong>API Evangelism</strong><br /> Like the resources area, there is pretty much no sign of life to report on when it comes to evangelism of the Respoke platform. However, I do know they have hired an evangelist, I have a call scheduled with him, and I&rsquo;m confident this is another area we will start seeing activity. You can always tell when a platform as an active evangelist because the social networks are active, Stack Overflow and Quora are engaged, there are a steady stream of commits on Github, regular flow of stories on the blog, and lots of exhaust from conferences and hackathons they are at. I'm guessing the next time I take a look at the Respoke platform, this will be different.</p>
<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong><br /> That concludes my review of the Respoke API, across these 18 areas. I&rsquo;d give them a solid B for their efforts. The platform has some maturing to do, in the overall design of the API, and the supporting building blocks, but this is standard operating procedure. Respoke is just getting going, and are kicking butt in most of the essential areas. My only red flag is the lack of blog, but this is just one of my pet peeves. I need the storytelling heartbeat of a blog to help me get to know providers in real time. I do not have time to speak to all providers on a regular basis, and an active blog provides an asynchronous way to track on thousands of companies, and their API resources.</p>
<p>I think Respoke is notable because they are pushing forward not just an open technology like WebRTC, but all web communication in general. WebRTC is all about "Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple JavaScript APIs&rdquo;, and I just as I mentioned in my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/the-contextio-api-and-thinking-out-of-the-box-when-crafting-apis/">post about what Context.io is doing to push forward SMTP, POP, and IMAP with web APIs</a>, I think Respoke is working do the same with WebRTC. They seem to have a vision, derived from years of experience in the field, and they are looking to deliver on this vision using not just JavaScript APIs, but wider web APIs&mdash;something I can definitely get behind.</p>
<p>Hopefully my review provides value for Respoke, but also the wider API space, and helps API providers understand how they can better craft their own API strategies. Respoke is something I&rsquo;d share as a blueprint for how you can deliver a communication platform using APIs, and I will be keeping an eye on them, updating my definition of what they do as they evolve. Look for more updates as I continue to weave Respoke into my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>, as well as any of my other <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">API research</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>They do have a blog at&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.respoke.io/">blog.respoke.io</a>&nbsp;(happy dance), and <a href="https://github.com/respoke/respoke/issues">you can submit tickets via their Github issues</a> on the Respoke repo.

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-sandbox.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve written about before in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/05/api-sandbox-and-simulator-from-carvoyant/">API Sandbox And Simulator From Carvoyant</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/24/salesforce-adds-sandbox-templates/">Salesforce Adds Sandbox Templates</a>. However it is something I&rsquo;d like to formalize, and get some new API service providers helping out in this area, or encourage the development of open source solutions.</p>
<p>API service providers like <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a> and <a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> are providing some very interesting solutions for mocking, and virtualizing APIs from API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML. What I would like to see is the emergence of standalone solutions, providing data sets templates, or whatever you want to call it for populating mock APIs for testing, and integration.</p>
<p>Think of it as <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a>, but structured data meant specifically for APIs, and specific API definitions, as opposed to static mock content for websites. Seems like you could easily scan a machine readable definition for an API, and see if any existing templates exist that match the definition. If there was you could easily populate the mock or virtualized API, if there wasn't maybe you could provide tools for easily building a template, in a way that it could the data could now be reused.</p>
<p>This idea for API sandbox and simulation templates, and for the<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/04/swagger-api-definition-mapper/"> Swagger API definition mapper</a>, both were ideas that came up in my conversation with John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser/">@johnmusser</a>). They are ideas I&rsquo;ve had in my Evernote for a while, but bringing them up today reminded me that both ideas needed to see the light of day, and hopefully I can move them forward at some point.</p>

<p>I was having one of my long overdue check ins with API godfather John Musser today, and it reminded me of an idea I wanted to put out there, so while it was fresh in my mind, I wanted to share. I&rsquo;m applying this to my <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> driven world, but should be applied to all of the common API definition formats like API Blueprint, and RAML.</p>
<p>I want a machine readable way to map APIs together across multiple Swagger API definitions, mapping a specific API path in one Swagger spec to another API path in an entirely different API definition. Once the paths are connected, you should also be able map specific parameters to each other. It also seems logical that for each mapping you'd want to provide some sort of meta data about the relationship, and maybe some sort of semantics involved also.</p>
<p>Maybe something like this already exists? IDK. I&rsquo;m sure that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity providers </a>like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> probably have their own proprietary approach to handling this, but I&rsquo;m looking for a simple JSON, YAML, or Markdown version of this. If there isn&rsquo;t something like this already out there, I may play around with a prototype. I&rsquo;d like to <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">map similar APIs in my email API research</a>, allowing me to bundle together similar resources.</p>
<p>Not sure how much time I will have for this in 2014, but figured I'd put out there, and see if I've missed something already existing in the space. Also, once something lives on my blog, it becomes a little more real, and the chances increase that I will actually move it forward at some point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m playing with more data visualizations lately, trying to establish a dynamic set of tools that I can use in my storytelling across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>. I've been focusing on using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference">Google Visualizations</a>, and other JQuery plugins I've gathered over time, for now.</p>
<p>During the Turkey Day weekend,&nbsp;<a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">I turned a subway map JQuery plugin I had found into an API</a>, and introduced some new ways I can easily use these visualizations in my <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/">Hacker Storytelling</a> format of publishing all of my research as Github repositories, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/11/16/public-frontend-and-private-backend-for-my-sites-on-github/">using the master branch as a private file and data store, and the Github Pages as the public face of the project</a>.</p>
<p>During the proces, I&rsquo;ve added the subway map to my visualization toolbox of JSON driven components that I can use when publishing my stories and research to Github, adding to my already existing tools like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll posts &amp; data</a>, <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">mustache templates</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">reveal.js slideshows</a>. I've also identified a handful of other visualizations that I want to add to my toolbox, providing a set of tools I can use to publish research reports, that deliver an open, rich, interactive, visualization layer on top of my simple JSON data stores.</p>
<p>In reality, this is just my own approach to lightweight application delivery, similar to what we all call <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">Single Page Apps or SPA</a>, except I don't always adhere to a single page, or use a single framework&mdash;I try to keep lightweight, and a decoupled set of tools that I can mix and match to accomplish different objectives. As of this weekend the API Evangelist network is now over a&nbsp;<a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">100 separate Github repositories</a> working in concert (or isolation), to help me achieve on my mission to better understand the API space, while hopefully helping others along the way.</p>
<p>As I work to assemble my API driven visualization toolkit, I&rsquo;m thinking I will start calling deployments a Single Page Report (SPR). While it won't be entirely true, as some reports could span multiple pages, I think the term still applies. Essentially an SPR can act much like the PDF gets used today when publishing most business reports. In my scenario rather than flattening the data, and resulting report, you would publish all the rich data, and visualizations to a single Github repository.</p>
<p>If you wanted to flatten an SPR, you could still publish as PDF, but it could also be interactive, forked, and have pull requests made to update data, correct any problems, and further enhance the visualizations. I just wanted to get this idea out there. I will work on generating a couple of "single page reports", to help better demonstrate my vision. And hopefully I won't actually end up calling it an SPR&mdash;I think I can do better.</p>

<p>Here we go again. If you were in <a href="http://chicago2014.apistrat.com/">Chicago for APIStrat this September</a>, then you know we are planning to have the next edition of APIStrat in Berlin, this spring. This round 3Scale and API Evangelist are partnering with APIDays to deliver two days of API talks at the <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/venue/">Humboldt Carr&eacute;, the Conference And Event Centre on Gendarmenmarkt</a>, April 24th and 25th, 2015.</p>
<p>I learned a lot attending APIDays Berlin earlier this year, and I am looking forward to continuing the conversation in 2015, APIStrat style. <span>Our speaker lineup includes&nbsp;</span><a title="Mandy Waite" href="https://twitter.com/tekgrrl">Mandy Waite</a><span>, Developer Advocate at&nbsp;</span><strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong><span>;&nbsp;</span><strong>Chris Taggart</strong><span>, CEO of&nbsp;</span><a title="OpenCorporates" href="https://twitter.com/countculture">OpenCorporates</a><span>; and&nbsp;</span><a title="Max Harlow" href="https://twitter.com/maxharlow">Max Harlow</a><span>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;</span><strong>Guardian Open Platform</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>Of course we need sponsors to make the conversation happen. APIDays and APIDays can&rsquo;t make it all happen alone. We have some great sponsors who've stepped up early:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.axway.com/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-254" src="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/axway-logo.png" alt="Axway" width="150" height="94" /></a><a href="https://www.mailjet.com/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-241" src="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mailjet-logo.png" alt="Mailjet" width="200" height="58" /></a><a href="http://apiary.io/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-245" src="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/apiary-logo.png" alt="Apiary" width="200" height="58" /></a><a href="https://www.paymill.com/"><img class="wp-image-243" src="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/paymill-logo.png" alt="Paymill" width="200" height="58" /></a><a href="http://www.commercetools.com/"><img class="wp-image-239" src="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sphere-io-logo.png" alt="commertools SPHERE.IO" width="200" height="58" /></a><a href="https://oauth.io/"><img class="wp-image-173" src="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/oauth-io-logo1.png" alt="OAuth.io" width="200" height="58" /></a></p>
<p>Make sure and contact us at contact@apistrat.com to help support the conversation, in Berlin. And like our APIs, APIStrat is powered by 3Scale.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-logo.png" alt="" width="275" /></a></p>
<p>Without the 3Scale team, APIStrat wouldn't happen. As we prepared for the launch of the <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">APIDays Berlin &amp; APIStrat Europe 2015</a> website, I was reminded that this is the 5th edition of APIStrat, and I think the 8th edition of APIDays, and I can feel that the API space is significantly picking up momentum going into 2015.</p>
<p>I think Germany, and Europe has a very important role to play in helping stabilize, as well as grow the API industry in a sensible, secure way that respects the privacy of the people who are using the apps that are built on the of APIs we are seeing deployed. This is the conversation we will be having in Berlin this spring, and I hope to see you there.</p>

<p>This story gets file into the &ldquo;way in future&rdquo; bucket, because the infrastructure needed to make happen doesn't even exist. Beyond research from API grandfather John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), and a few other blog posts or conference decks, there is no standardization of monetization strategies and pricing across APIs&mdash;making my idea impossible currently.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t let that stop me! What I'd like to see is a developer credit system, that I can earn buy or earn credits for any single API, but I possess a credit account across all the APIs I depend on--as an API developer I want to buy credits for API usage, allowing me to buy in single, or bulk amounts, and apply against my regular API usage.</p>
<p>As an API provider, I could provide developers with an incentive using credits, trying to drive the behavior I'm looking to get from developers. With a credit system I could even pay developer's credits for doing common API ecosystem tasks like creating code libraries, generating how-to-guides, or even supporting other developers on the forum.</p>
<p>If there was a market for API credits, as a developer I could easily earn credits on one platform, and use them there, or possibly apply them to other platforms. I could also choose to just sell my credits on the open market to other API consumers, who might value the credits more than I do, or pay a rate that is lower than they'd get directly from a provider.</p>
<p>This is just a random thought I wanted to put out into the universe, that came up as I was evaluating the business models of some APIs I&rsquo;m reviewing. We have a lot of work before something like this would be possible, but if someone stepped up to work on this problem across providers, I think there would be a pretty significant opportunity for them in coming years--think Amazon Web Service pricing, but across the board for the API space, applied to all business sectors. #huge</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-angry-mob.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Almost every time an API shuts down, the tech blogosphere, and the social networks favored by the tech community erupts in comments resembling: That is what you get for depending on APIs, and APIs can go away at any time, you should know better by now, and you should not build a company on someone elses resources--just to name a few.</p>
<p>Where did this line of thought begin? Why do developers feel so burned when a popular API like Netflix, ESPN, or Google Translate is deprecated? The main reason is lack of communication. Developers need a long runway that an API is going to be deprecated. Something that will mitigate much of the backlash, but still the comments are never, why didn't Netflix communicate with us (they did), it is highlighting that APIs can go away at any point.</p>
<p>What other business in the world do you have vendors that do not go away? I cannot think of a single business, where you select a supplier of products or services you depend on for your business, without any chance of that company going bankrupt, shutting down, being sold, or possibly just discontinuing providing a particular products or services you depend  on.</p>
<p>I find it particularly interesting that this is an argument that continues to hold weight, and while you will hear me push back on API providers to communicate better around the deprecation of their APIs, you will never hear me say an API should never shut down, or you shouldn't ever use an API to build applications. Just like any other business area, you should carefully research your vendors, make sensible choices about why you use one over another, and when possible have contingency plans for your operations.</p>
<p>I would be curious to hear ideas about the possible origins of why developers feel like this. I can't think of any precedent that would have set this tone for the conversation, and after almost 14 years of the modern web AP industry, developers are still crying fowl, and the tech blogosphere still finds it relevant to stir up sentiment that APIs are not reliable because of these high profile deprecations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a title="Context.io" href="http://context.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/context-io/context-io-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently finished looking through all of the email APIs available in the space, narrowing it down to just a handful of companies who I felt were worthy of showcasing as part of my <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">email API research</a>. Ultimately I felt seven were worthy of discussion, and after I laid them side by side all of them were very similar in the technology, business, and politics of their APIs&mdash;all except one, <a title="Context.io" href="http://context.io/">Context.io</a>.</p>
<p>Context.io isn&rsquo;t about sending or receiving emails via APIs, or simply focusing on email standards like SMPT, POP, and IMAP. Context.io provides you with storage and indexing of your emails, and then opens up a new API driven world where things are possible you never imagined. Extending upon existing standards like SMTP, POP, and IMAP with APIs like SendGrid has done is cool, but what Context.io has done represents truly thinking out of the box with APIs--which I love to see..</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of evolving legacy standards and technologies using APIs, and I think there is plenty of room for this to occur across many business sectors, and layers of the technology world. I don&rsquo;t think every startup or existing company will have the imagination, or bravery for that matter, to do what Context.io has done, but I applaud their thinking, and would love to see others follow their lead when considering their entry into the API game.</p>
<p>Mapping a new set of web APIs to some very legacy processes, in a simple, easy to use way, takes skill and consideration for not just the legacy tech, but also how modern web APis are designed, deployed, managed, and evangelized. Doing the technical, while also deeply considering how people are using this legacy technologies, how they are embedded in our lives and business like email is, and then developing API driven solutions that solve problems for users in these spaces, takes a serious amount of work.</p>
<p>Ive known about Context.io and what they do for some time now, but the impact of what they do really became evident in my side by side evaluation of them with other email API providers before I had an epiphany about what they are up to. Then after spending time with their team at Defrag, over beers in the taproom, I was able to get a glimpse of the future they envision, building meaningful services on top of email, that truly make users lives easier.</p>
<p>I will continue keeping a close eye on <a title="Context.io" href="http://context.io/">Context.io</a>, and will also be hacking on their API to see what I can do on top of my own email stores, and I encourage you to do the same. If nothing else, use them as a model for how you can possibly think out of the box when designing your next generation of API resources, that consumers won't just love, they will come to depend on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-metro-map-575.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A long time ago I defined the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a> using a subway map format, plotting out the different routes you could take, and the locations all along this journey. As with anything I do, this is a work in progress, and I&rsquo;m needing to regularly update this map. Currently it is in an image, and I use an image mapping tool to generate the links&mdash;something that is very time consuming.</p>
<p>I think the subway map is an important metaphor for understanding some potentially complex ideas, and provide a single map, complete with legends, supporting content, and links to more details. My problem is I have several maps I need to create, and maintain on a regular basis. Ideally my subway mapping tool would be dynamic, allowing me to make changes as I went along.</p>
<p>While looking for a solution, I stumbled across <a href="http://kalyani.com/2010/10/subway-map-visualization-jquery-plugin/">Subway Map Visualization jQuery Plugin</a>, by Nik Kalyani. This plugin would work perfectly for what I wanted to do to visualize the API Evangelist network, but I had another project I wanted to do, in which it somewhat fell short in satsifying.</p>
<p>There is a lot of talk about the API lifecycle, and I wanted a way to <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/lifecycle.html" target="_blank">map out the API lifecycle</a> as I saw it, but this concept isn&rsquo;t something there is a single answer for, and I wanted to hear other providers take on their own API lifecycle. I wanted others to potentially build their own API lifecycle subway maps, so I new that the Subway Map plugin needed to be dynamic&mdash;so I wrapped it in a web API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still playing with what is possible, but my new&nbsp;<a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">Subway Map API</a> allows you to generate maps, adding routes, and locations along the routes. The API just takes advantage of all the features that Nik Kalyani added into the plugin, I just provided web APis for them. This project will be changing fast, and I will be resetting the database regularly, so if you play with it, make sure and let me know, so I don't step on your toes.</p>

<p>As I build out new APIs for use across my systems, as well as map out the landscape of valuable API resources available today, I'm <a href="http://apievangelist.com/templates/">working to define templates</a> that other API providers can follow when designing and deploying their own API infrastructure. I've accumulated 16 basic templates, prompting me to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/templates/">add a new section to the website called templates</a>.</p>
<p>These projects represent the templates I've established through my existing research, and will add other templates as they come off the assembly line. These API designs aren't mean to be the perfect solution for production environements, but to be seeds for new conversation around APIs, as well as providing a basic pattern you can use to start your own development.</p>
<p>Each API is functional, and has its own Github repository for storing of a Swagger definition, Swagger UI Interactive Documentation, as well as the server side code that I will open source with each template. As I move forward each template, I will publish changes to their repos, as well as maintain a roadmap via each projects Github milestones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My APIs are currently developed in PHP, but for me the real value is the Swagger API definitions, and eventually I will also generate Python, Ruby, and Node.js versions of these same APIs. The code is disposable in my mind, and my goal will be to evolve each of the template definitions.</p>
<p>I intend to create cloud container images &nbsp;for all my API templates, providing blueprints others can use deploying on AWS, Heroku, Google App Engine, and othe popular cloud image formats, including Docker.</p>
<p>As I add features to my production versions of these APIs, I will carve these features off and add to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/templates/">each templates</a>. If you've taken one and added to it, feel free to share your patterns back with the community, and I'd be happy to showcase. I would also entertain the addition of any templates you would like to share with the community as well.&nbsp;</p>
