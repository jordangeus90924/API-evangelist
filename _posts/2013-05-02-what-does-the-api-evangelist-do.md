{% include JB/setup %}<p>I sent three emails this morning to people, explaining what it is that I do and how they can get involved.This process reminded me that I need to do the same here via the blog on a regular basis, to help people understand what API Evangelist is, and my vision for it.Â  Despite popular belief I do not evangelize any single API to developers, my role (self-appointed) is to evangelize all APIs to the masses, most importantly beyond the developer community--penetrating business, marketing and other key groups.At API Evangelist I monitor the entire API space.To do this I track on 2000 of the best of the APIs out there.</p>
