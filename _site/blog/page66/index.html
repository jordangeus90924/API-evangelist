        <span class="post-date">15 Apr 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/washington-crossing-the-delaware-cropped.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />We are witnessing some <a title="tremendous growth in the number of new web APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">tremendous growth in the number of new Web APIs</a>.  <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, for example, added 1000 new APIs to its directory over the last year.<p></p>
Many of these APIs are brand new and have very few code samples or libraries to go with them.<p></p>
These new APIs represent a huge opportunity for developers to stake a claim within these communities -- to build their portfolios and their resumes.<p></p>
Recently Google released their <a title="Google Cloud Print Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a>.   The only thing available was some documentation describing the handful of API endpoints for managing printers and print jobs.<p></p>
I went to work trying to understand Google's vision of cloud printing, and I wrote a simple PHP class for working with Google Cloud Print.   I published on <a title="Github - Google Cloud Print" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Google-Cloud-Print-Proxy">Github</a> and <a title="Google Code - Google Cloud Print" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-print-proxy/">Google Code</a> and blogged about my work.<p></p>
By creating a PHP class for Google Cloud Print I established myself as an early mover in the space, and I attracted attention to my work. Even Google noticed and someone from Google contacted me.<p></p>
Since Google Cloud Print was so new, and they are actively encouraging community participation, there was an opportunity for me establish a presence.<p></p>
Many API providers are taking a similiar <a title="community-driven approach to building their API code samples and libraries" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/15/community-driven-api-code-samples-and-libraries/">community-driven approach to building their API code samples and libraries</a>.  Within these communities, there are windows of opportunities for developers to claim their territory, get a little of the spotlight, while building their portfolios and resumes along the way.

        <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/linkedin/LinkedIn-Developer-Network.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a title="LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> refreshed its <a title="LinkedIn Developer Platform" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/">developer platform</a> recently, updating its <a title="RESTful API" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/community/apis">RESTful API</a> and <a title="JavaScript API" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/community/jsapi">JavaScript API</a>.<p></p>
A noticeable change, was its continued evolution towards a more plug and play API environment.<p></p>
When you visit the <a title="LinkedIn Developer Area" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/index.jspa">LinkedIn developers area</a>, the first option on the menu is plug-ins, and the main page is totally dominated by embeddable profile tools.<p></p>
The RESTful API and Javascript API are only accessible off a single menu option, the community has a clear focus on courting non-developer LinkedIn users.<p></p>
With the rise in popularity of RESTful APIs and JavaScript, we are seeing a explosion in <a title="Widget, Embeds, Plug-In" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/06/allow-api-users-to-embed-content-with-oembed/">widgets, embeds, plug-ins</a> and other copy / paste code that any tech savvy user can deploy.<p></p>
Attracting the developer community to new APIs can be tough.  Programmers tend to be drawn to exciting, new, and shiny APIs that provide challenges and new opportunities.   The business and professional focus of LinkedIn doesn't quite put the "shiny" in API.<p></p>
LinkedIn shows an understanding of its user base, and the best way to provide API tools that these tech savvy users can copy and paste on their web site, social networks, and other applications.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-jobs.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />Github launched some<a title="enhancements to its Github Jobs homepage" href="https://github.com/blog/836-github-jobs-update">enhancements to its GitHub Jobs homepage</a>, and IPhone application.<p></p>
Being the forward thinkers they are, they say:
<blockquote><em>If there's an app there's an API, so we've made ours available to everyone...</em></blockquote>
The <a title="GitHub Jobs API" href="http://jobs.github.com/api">GitHub Jobs API</a> allows you to search, view, and create jobs with JSON over HTTP.<p></p>
The APIalso provides support for JSONP, by appending ?callback=myFunction to any API request, it will wrap the response in a function call to myFunction. This is useful when making requests to the GitHub Jobs API using JavaScript.<p></p>
Nothing to revolutionary, or noteworthy about the API, except Github is just way cool, and I love their perspective that, if there is an app there is an API.

        <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2011</span>
        <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Freshbooks_610x564.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I am slowly working my way through <a title="hundreds of APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">hundreds of APIs</a> and doing business reviews of their approach to delivering their APIs.<p></p>
At API Evangelist I'm focused on the business of APIs, with a minor focus on the technology behind those APIs.  So when I publish a business review of an API, I will add it to my API database, then move on.<p></p>
That is, unless I identify a story -- an innovative approach, monetization strategy, or anything that I feel needs to be talked about in more detail.<p></p>
While reviewing the <a title="Freshbooks API" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks API</a> I found three notable building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong><a title="Application Billing" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/billing/">Application Billing</a></strong> - A built in billing and payment framework for Freshbook applications and beyond</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Webhooks" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/webhooks/">Webhooks</a></strong> - Framework for enabling application callbacks, URLs where the Freshbook system can send notifications to third party applications</li>
	<li><a title="Freshbooks Add-On Store" href="http://community.freshbooks.com/addons/"><strong>FreshBooks Add-on Stor</strong>e</a> - Application store and development platform for developers to build custom apps, showcase,  and sell to Freshbook customers.</li>
</ul>
<a title="Self-Service Application Frameworks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">Self-Service Application Frameworks</a> like the Freshbooks Add-On Store are growing more common.  I've talked about similar systems from <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> and <a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a>.  The Freshbooks Add-On store is not 100% self-service, but it is close.
<a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/freshbooks-leaf.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
Webhooks are nothing new, but Freshbook offers a standardized approach to deploying web-hooks that makes them easy for developer to use.<p></p>
A built in payment system is definitely a notable <a title="API Building Block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">API building block</a>.  Providing developers with a baked-in payment system for handling application monetization is very innovative.<p></p>
Where do these three building blocks fit into the big picture?   I try to build profiles for common API building blocks, I don't have profiles for self-service application frameworks, webhooks, and payment systems, but as I evaluate more I will define these as more innovative building blocks for API owners to use.<p></p>
I will definitely be keeping an eye on the <a title="Freshbook" href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">Freshbook</a> approach to their API.

        <img src="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/buddies.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />There are many  approaches to building an API ecosystem.  Some approach it more like building an API community, and others as growing an API ecosystem.<p></p>
<a title="Howard Liptzin" href="http://twitter.com/howardliptzin#">Howard Liptzin</a>, at Avatar Industries prefers a more <a title="organic approach to growing an API community" href="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/2011/02/28/developer-communities/">organic approach growing an API community</a>.  In his own words:
<blockquote><em>What you'll want to do is to create the conditions for a community to form, thrive, produce and grow.</em></blockquote>
Liptzin emphasises gardening over engineering, not managing your community, more facilitate. Before you even start, Liptzin offers a little advice:
<blockquote><em>Make sure your API actually solves a problem that merits solving!</em></blockquote>
Then Liptzin identifies five areas to address when growing your API ecosystem:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Creation</li>
	<li>Activation</li>
	<li>Retention</li>
	<li>Productivity</li>
	<li>Growth</li>
</ul>
It is great to see other API owners and evangelists share their philosophies and approach to growing their community.<p></p>
I recommend reading Liptzin's full post, <a title="Rainmaking via Developer Communities" href="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/2011/02/28/developer-communities/">Rainmaking via Developer Communities</a>.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I keep stumbling across innovative approaches to using Web APIs, for non-developers.
<p></p>The other day I wrote about <a title="Quantifying your social media impact, using Google Docs and social media" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/apis-are-not-just-for-developers/">quantifying your social media impact,</a> using Google Docs and social media APIs, by<a title="Tom Critchlow" href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/30546">Tom Critchlow</a>.
<p></p>Tonight I came across a example of <a title="archiving your daily tweets into a Google spreadsheet and the Twitter API" href="http://blogofmu.com/2011/04/05/bring-twitter-api-data-in-google-docs-to-quickly-viewmanipulate/">archiving your daily tweets</a> into a Google spreadsheet using the Twitter API.
<p></p><a title="Richard Orelup" href="http://twitter.com/#!/ripsup">Richard Orelup</a> came up with this little hack in response to this tweet:
<blockquote>
     <em>So in all of Twitter-dom, there is seriously no tool that archives a day's tweets in a sortable fashion?</em>

<p>I also had a link to an <a title="open source manufacturing" href="http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Manufacturing_Tools">open source manufacturing</a> site bookmarked from a couple months ago.</p>
<p>And of course I live and breathe <a title="Web APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/">Web APIs</a> on a daily basis.</p>
<p>So after reading all this, my mind starts thinking about open source manufacturing processes bundled with open web APIs, and the future of 3-D printing and / or manufacturing.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Open Source Manufacturing" href="http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Manufacturing_Tools">Open Source Manufacturing</a></strong> - Open source manufacturing lets you download hardware, blue-prints, and instructions for any potential manufacturing process.</li>

<p>When you start thinking of this in terms of local, cottage style manufacturing, I can see lots ofpossibilities.</p>
<p>Imagine, a group of people in a small town, research a need for a component or product. Buy a 3-D Printer, register it with a open API manufacturing network (say based on <a title="Google Cloud Print" href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html">Google Cloud Print</a>). Now they can take orders in real-time over the Internet.</p>

Using <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, Rdio provides a RESTful API where you can do just about anything you can trough the web interface.<p></p>
Rdio provides a pretty significant incentive for their developers, in the form of revenue sharing.<p></p>
Developers of the <a title="Rdio API" href="http://developer.rdio.com/">Rdio API</a> can earn recurring revenue each month for every new subscriber recruited through their application.<p></p>
Also developers can earn revenue each time someone purchases and downloads an MP3 file from the service.<p></p>
Through the <a title="Rdio Affiliate Program" href="https://cli.linksynergy.com/cli/publisher/registration/registration.php?mid=36727">Rdio Affiliate Program</a> developers can earn from between 2% and 7% for purchases made within a 30-day cookie window.<p></p>
Having an API affiliate program seems like a logical way to incentivize developers to build applications.<p></p>
An API owner should have an established monetization strategy for their API, and it should outline how revenue will be generated.<p></p>
Having a way to track and attribute sales to your API developers makes a lot of sense, and sharing revenue with developers will ensure they will keep building new ways to attract users to a service via the API.

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/blueprints.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />In my quest to fully understand the underlying principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), i'm re-reading Roy Thomas Fielding original dissertation, <a title="Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architecture" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>, where he first introduced the REST architectural style.
<p></p>His dissertation explored the junction of two disciplines in computer science: <em>software and networking</em>.
<p></p>He identifies that software research:
<blockquote>
     <em>...has long been concerned with the categorization of software designs and the development of design methodologies, but has rarely been able to objectively evaluate the impact of various design choices on system behavior.</em>
</blockquote>While networking research:
<blockquote>
     <em>...is focused on the details of generic communication behavior between systems and improving the performance of particular communication techniques, often ignoring the fact that changing the interaction style of an application can have more impact on performance than the communication protocols used for that interaction.</em>
</blockquote><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/parthenon.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Fieldings work was motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software. He wanted to rethink software design in the context of the World Wide Web.
<p></p>The World Wide Web is intended to be an Internet-scale, distributed system, interconnecting information networks across organizational boundaries, and cope with the demands of scalability and independent deployment of software.
<p></p>As Fielding states:
<blockquote>
     <em>REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.</em>
</blockquote>As I'm reading his abstract and introduction I can't help but think about where I stand as an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/api-evangelism-vs-developer-evangelism/">API Evangelist</a>, at the convergence of business and RESTful APIs.
<p></p>When RESTful APIs are applied to business, what does this look like? Is business currently restricted in the same ways as software? When business is operating on the World Wide Web do we need to consider the network more?
<p></p>Lots to consider at the intersection of business and RESTful APIs.

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/social-impact-graph.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />One of the reasons I believe <a title="APIs Are Growing so Popular" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">APIs are growing so popular</a> is they are getting easier, and easier to use.<p></p>
The main reason they are getting easier to use is due to the adoption of RESTful approaches when delivering APIs.<p></p>
Many APIs that use REST can be easily hacked by just changing values in the URL query string, instantly making APIs accessible by a wider audience<p></p>
Once users get past the confusing acronyms and jargon us programmers use, and realize whats going on, they can start accessing the data and functionality that's behind the curtain.<p></p>
RESTful APIs open up data and functionality to anyone, and we are starting to see a new breed of hackers from many disciplines including journalism, social media marketing, and government, to name a few.<p></p>
As technology becomes increasingly important in our every day lives, people can't wait for IT or programmers to deliver, savvy users start hacking on their own.<p></p>
A very innovative example of this I saw lately was by Social Media Strategist, <a title="Tom Critchlow" href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/30546">Tom Critchlow</a>.  Tom wrote a great post called, <a title="Using Tools &amp; APIs to Track Your Social Media Strategy" href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-to-track-your-social-media-strategy">Using Tools &amp; APIs To Track Your Social Media Strategy.</a>
<img src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/users/30546.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
Through a need to understand the impact of his social media efforts, he learned that he can query top social sites using their API to quantify the impact of his site(s).<p></p>
Then using Google Docs, along with with the power of <a title="Google App Scripts" href="http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/">Google App Scripts</a> he pulls counts for shares, likes, etc for his site using Social Media APIs.<p></p>
Using RESTful Social Media APIs, and Google Docs, he is able to hack these APIs, get the data he is looking for, store it in a spreadsheet, and then visualize it.<p></p>
His efforts truly represent the power of APIs, and how important it is that we deliver simple, RESTful interfaces that developers and non-developers can use in our every day business.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-business.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I have found a voice through my blog, API Evangelism.<p></p>
I get asked why "API Evangelism" instead of "Developer Evangelism"?<p></p>
I see a significant difference:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Developer Evangelists</strong> spread awareness, and understanding of an API, or APIs, amongst the developer community.</li>
	<li><strong>API Evangelists</strong> spreads awareness, and understanding of an API, or APIs, amongst the developer and business community.</li>
</ul>
Developer evangelists are generally focused outwards, staying within the developer community and often times are, or have been developers themselves.  They understand the problems their developers face and provide resources, so they are successful using an API.<p></p>
As an API Evangelist I focus on everything a developer evangelist focuses on, but I also find myself selling the API and its benefits both externally and internally.<p></p>
If I see a potential use for an API, one that enhances the core business, I will build a prototype and get to work selling the appropriate department(s) on the benefits.<p></p>
In addition to selling internal business leaders on benefits of a specific API, I spend a lot of time educating external business leaders on the benefits of APIs in general.  Using a specific API (hopefully my own) for building the business case.<p></p>
We need more developer evangelists, but we also need armies of API evangelists who will teach the business masses of the benefits of APIs, and prepare them for the coming <a title="API Economy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>.

APIs empower new types of relationship to be built between a business and its partners or openly by public developers.<p></p>
Self-Service application platforms move this business development forward and introduces a third player into the game, platform partners.<p></p>
Platforms like <a title="Google Apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps</a>, and <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> not only deliver APIs, they provide a <a title="Self-Service Application Development Environment" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application development environment</a>, a place where third party businesses can access their users, and add value to their platform.<p></p>
Forward thinking businesses can bring their own APIs, and communities development power to these environments and create applications tailored specifically for Box.net or Google Apps Business, Government, Education and Non-Profit users.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/box-net-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2011</span>
        In addition to the <a title="Growth in Number of APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">growth in number of APIs</a>, and the evolution of<a title="BizDev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">BizDev 2.0</a>, there is a rise in self-service application platforms accompanying APIs, within many cloud platforms.<p></p>
Platforms such as <a title="Google Apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps</a> and <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> are adding these self-service application development environments within their API ecosystem.<p></p>
Each platform has its own approach to this type of self-service architecture, but there are many similar characteristics:<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/self-service.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Interface for defining new application characteristics.</li>
	<li><strong>OpenID / OAuth / User Resource Access</strong> - Secure and granular access to users profile and resources.</li>
	<li><strong>Development Environment</strong> - Controlled, secure environment for developers to build applications in.</li>
	<li><strong>Application Branding</strong> - Branding of application and its profile on a platform.</li>
	<li><strong>Application Approval Process</strong> - Approval process for bringing applications live.</li>
	<li><strong>Marketplace Environment </strong>- Public or private marketplaces for developers to publish applications and platform users to browse / add applications.</li>
</ul>
<a title="Salesforce" href="http://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> is building in-roads into the enterprise using this model, and <a title="Facebook" href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/">Facebook</a> has found success with social gaming using a similar approach.<p></p>
APis have opened up new business development opportunities, self-service application platforms takes this development to a new level.

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Tag-Cloud-API-PDF.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I'm spending time evaluating different types of APIs in various categories.
<p></p>I want to see how each provider delivers their API in similar categories, and potentially look for opportunities within those categories for new API services.
<p></p>I'm starting with PDF APIs.
<p></p>There are quite a few web APIs providing services to generate and work with PDFs.
<p></p>The first main group of APIs I notice are HTML to PDF conversion APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocRaptor" href="http://docraptor.com/documentation" target="_blank">DocRaptor</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Doculicious" href="http://docs.doculicious.com/api" target="_blank">Doculicious</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="html2PDF" href="http://webservice.htm2pdf.co.uk/htm2pdf.asm" target="_blank">htm2pdf</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Joliprint" href="http://joliprint.com/api/" target="_blank">Joliprint</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="HTM2PDF" href="http://www.html2pdf.biz/api.php" target="_blank">HTML2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Web2PDF" href="http://www.web2pdfconvert.com/pdf-api.aspx" target="_blank">Web2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF My URL" href="http://pdfmyurl.com/support/support.jsp" target="_blank">PDF My URL</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Crowd" href="http://pdfcrowd.com/html-to-pdf-api/" target="_blank">PDF Crowd</a>
     </li>
</ul>Next there are a couple of other PDF conversion tools:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/PDF_red.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Anything to PDF" href="http://api.danielprocter.com/" target="_blank">Anything to PDF</a> - Convert base 64 encoded data to PDF
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Alchemy" href="http://www.pdfalchemy.com/" target="_blank">PDF Alchemy</a> - Word to PDF
     </li>
</ul>Beyond document conversion I found two APIs for commenting and annotating PDFs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Crocodoc" href="http://crocodoc.com/api/" target="_blank">Crocodoc</a> - PDF commenting and collaboration
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Annotate" href="http://a.nnotate.com/api-reference.html" target="_blank">A.nnotate</a> - PDF annotation
     </li>
</ul>Then there was a single provider of PDF document signatures:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocuSign" href="http://www.docusign.com/developers-center/developers-center-overview" target="_blank">DocuSign</a>
     </li>
</ul>There are two clear leaders that provide more advanced PDF document management services:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Doxument" href="http://doxument.com/en/developer" target="_blank">Doxument</a> - HTML to PDF, OCR, Split PDF pages in separate images
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Docs " href="http://code.google.com/apis/documents/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> - File Conversion to PDF, OCR, translation
     </li>
</ul>With the ubiquitous nature of PDFs, and a wide range of desktop and web based PDF tools, I think there is a huge opportunity for new types of APIs in this area. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf-ocr.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> There are dozens of code libraries in various languages for manipulating PDFs. I would suggest some savvy developer:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Identify the most viable business uses for PDF APis
     </li>
     <li>Select the strong set of PDF language libraries
     </li>
     <li>Wrap in a RESTful wrapper
     </li>
     <li>Deploy on Amazon EC2 with PDF storage on Amazon S3
     </li>
</ul>PDF APis is one category of APIs that has huge opportunity for growth in the next couple of years.

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2011</span>
        When deploying an API, the interface is just the beginning. You need tools and resources to support the API. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/building_blocks.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> There are <a title="Common Building Blocks Used by APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks that are used by many existing APIs</a>, such as documentation, forums, code samples and other tools developers have come to expect from APIs.
<p></p>When selecting which <a title="Building Blocks to Use for an API Area" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks to use for an API area</a>, there are many things to consider. There are many opinions on which are essential, and this can vary from industry to industry.
<p></p>One thing everyone agrees is that <a title="Metrics and Analytics for an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">metrics and analytics for an API</a> are a must have.
<p></p>Beyond the common building blocks, many API owners are providing new innovative tools such as:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Application Showcase" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=180">Application Showcases</a>
     </li>

          <a title="API Explorers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/24/explorers-open-api-access-beyond-developers/">API Explorers</a>
     </li>
</ul>If you are planning an API and do not have much experience with API technology, or what building blocks you will need, you should talk to experienced API service providers such as <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, or <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>. These providers have a lot of experience, tools and services you can access to plan, develop, deploy, and manage your API.
<p></p>Even with the growth in the number of available APIs, and the number of service providers I do not see much in the way of open-source API building blocks available on the market yet. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/open.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> We need more innovation around development of open API building blocks. Think what <a title="Wordpress" href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> has done for blogging, and <a title="Heroku" href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> has done for cloud computing.
<p></p>The availablility of open API building blocks delivering the common, innovative and essential tools needed for APIs, would give a much needed boost to the entire industry.
<p></p>There is a lot of learning, exploration and trial and error to occur within the API space. Leaving this to occur within the hands of a few API service provider, or following the lead of major API players like Twitter and Google limits the opportunities for everybody involved.
<p></p>I would like to see more discussion and collaboration around building a community of open source API build blocks this year.

</ul><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-round.png" alt="" width="160" align="right" /> Github provides a way for API owners to manage a large number of code samples, libraries and prototypes, in a way that allows developers to fork and contribute code as part of the community.
<p></p>The social spects of Github extends a API community to the existing, vibrant developer community that exists at Github.
<p></p>Its easier for an API to participate within the existing Github developer community, rather then expect developers to come and participate in a community built around the API.

        <span class="post-date">01 Apr 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/php.gif" alt="" width="125" align="right" />An important tone of my blog is not to ever say any API owner should, or developers have to do anything. My role as API evangelist is to observe, discuss and explore the business of APIs.
<p></p>I was discussing best practices around API ecosystems with a prominent developer the other night an a O'Reilly Web 2.0 event. He had an interesting perspective on how to build community around an API. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/ruby-logo.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> Building your API community can start with your code libraries.
<p></p>His recommendation was that API owners should focus on building a simple and standardized API that provides true value, and do not build your own API code libraries.
<p></p>Let your community build, and contribute code libraries in their preferred programming language.
<p></p>His argument was that if an API owner releases an official set of libraries, the innovation stops there. Nobody will build any further code libraries and possibly improve on them. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/python.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> By allowing the community to build API libraries it gives you a chance to put the spotlight on developers, increases the chance for competition, spurs innovation and developers will rise to the occasion.
<p></p>In some cases an API owner may even contract with a developer to build the API code libraries, but do not endorse them as official. This way developers see opportunity to build upon them and improve them, if they feel so inclined.
<p></p>I found this a very innovative approach to empowering your developer community, encouraging innovation, and building community within your API ecosystem.

        NPR announced their new <a title="NPR News Application for Android 2.0" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/04/01/134951191/android-2-0-rebuilt-redesigned?ft=1&amp;f=91000411">NPR News application for Android 2.0</a> today.

Normally I wouldn't cover just any new app or feature release, but there is more of a story here than just a new mobile app.  I am interested in the way they went about designing it.<p></p>
Last summer they submitted designs for the new Android application to the <a title="NPR open source community" href="http://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">open source community</a> to discuss how to best move forward with designing the mobile app.<p></p>
They gathered feedback from users and built in what the community said was most important, such as new player, universal navigation, as well as adding programs with live streams and the ability to favorite stations.<p></p>
They are working to <a title="publishing the source code back to the community repository" href="http://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">publishing the source code back to the community repository</a>, keeping the project open source.<p></p>
Of course this is NPR, a public entity, but their approach to mobile application design using their API is  a model that can be used by other API providers.

<p></p>Twitter just released a new <a title="Simpler API Called Web Intents" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/intents">simpler API called Web Intents</a> that makes Tweets more interactive when you display on the web.
<p></p>The Twitter Web Intents API provides a JavaScript interface for adding Reply, Retweet, and Favorite links to a specific Tweet:

<p></p>Twitter Web Intents API is an example of a growing trend of simpler tools that make APIs accessible beyond the developer community.
<p></p>REST has simplified APIs making them hackable by journalists, data scientists, and any other tech savvy users that may not be able to program but can understand manipulating a URL query string to get the data they are looking for.
<p></p>More API providers are considering development of simpler APIs, snippets, widgets, and embeddable code that expand their API ecosystem to a wider audience.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-analytics.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I document a lot of the <a title="Common Building Blocks Used By API Providers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks used by API providers</a>. These are common tools used across many industries and types of APIs to build their ecosystem.
<p></p>I hesitate to ever say any of these common building blocks are essential, because every API potentially has different requirements.
<p></p>However, one building block that is essential for <span class="c1">every</span> API, is metrics and analytics.
<p></p>API owners should me measuring every aspect of their API and its community, and be constantly reassessing their strategy based upon what is going on in real-time.
<p></p>API analytics is what service providers like <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a> and <a href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a> bring to the table. Mashery and Apigee proxy your API to deliver analytics, while 3Scale provides a plug to gather data for reporting on.
<p></p>All three of these providers charge you per transaction for this service. <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Google-Analytics-Charts-Stack.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> To my knowledge there is no provider of an API analytics tool that is free, and plug and play.
<p></p>With the current explosion of APIs being deployed, there is a huge opportunity for someone to provide a free API analytics service that gathers and measures API usage.
<p></p>Think Google Analytics for APIs. A single line of server side code, with a variety of language kits, that will measure all requests on an API, its community, and provide a rich set of reports for API owners.
<p></p>This could probably be done with the <a title="Google Analytics API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/home.html">Google Analytics API</a>, I will have to play with more.

        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I just finished reading two more posts on the recent changes to the <a title="Twitter API Terms of Service" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">Twitter API terms of service</a>.  There are a lot of opinions on whether Twitter was right or wrong in their approach to reign in their developer community.<p></p>
I understand Twitter wanting to take back some control over its ecosystem and monetize its world.<p></p>
I do not understand why people are demonizing Open APIs or the developer community.  Both made Twitter what it is today.<p></p>
I wanted to put some thoughts down on how I'd engineer a more sensible approach to the Twitter API ecosystem.<p></p>
<strong>Brand Control:</strong> Twitter needs to keep expanding its <a title="branding resource area" href="http://twitter.com/about/resources/logos">branding resource area</a> where users can come to get CSS, HTML, images, widgets, borders and many other higher quality assets that can be used by the community and maintain a quality level of brand control for Twitter.<p></p>
API access and usage.  Let's create some free and paid access levels:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Developer</strong> - A free low volume access level that allows developers to play with the API, but only allows a minimum number of API calls per day.</li>
	<li><strong>Professional</strong> - A slightly higher level of access meant for API consumer that may be building an application, but probably used just for professional purposes.</li>
	<li><strong>Business</strong> - API access for businesses that use Twitter for their own brand, and require a higher level of API requests, but are willing to pay for it.</li>
	<li><strong>Commercial</strong> - A pay-for-what-you-use model, in true cloud computing fashion, with the possibility of volume discounts.</li>
	<li><strong>Academic</strong> - A free research-based access account for scholars to use in their academic projects.</li>
</ul>
With clearly defined Twitter API access levels, Twitter can start making money and controlling usage of their API.<p></p>
<strong>Ad Network</strong>:  The next approach to monetization and control over the Twitter ecoystem could be a Twitter advertising network modeled after Google Adsense and Adwords.<p></p>
Let's call it the Dickbar Advertising Network.  Require all client and web interfaces to have some sort of advertising network deployment.  You could have Dickbars, Dickboxes, and Dickheaders in all shapes and sizes for developers to deploy.<p></p>
Twitter can still advertise, make money, and control their network.  Developers could make money too.  There would be added incentive for developers to build quality applications, and be able to be sustain their work through advertising revenue.<p></p>
With a sensible terms of service, branding guidelines, tiered API access levels, and an advertising network, Twitter could retain control over its network, protect its brand, monetize and ensure a higher quality user experience.<p></p>
This could all be done while still respecting and harnessing the passionate developer community of the Twitter ecosystem that made Twitter what it is today.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/apigee-api-console.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I am seeing more API owners and service providers launching REST API explorers lately:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee Console</a></li>
	<li><a title="Salesforce" href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003IjwLEAS">Salesforce</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google API Explorer" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">Google</a></li>
	<li><a title="Windows Live" href="http://rex.mslivelabs.com/">Windows Live</a></li>
	<li><a title="Infochimps Data Explorer" href="http://www.infochimps.com/">Infochimps</a></li>
</ul>
These REST API explorers allow users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a web interface.<p></p>
<a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee Console</a> even allows you to Authenticate with APIs using Basic Auth or OAuth.<p></p>
The simplicity of REST has contributed to the extreme growth in the number of Web APIs in the last year, and API explorers are going to fuel this growth in 2011 and beyond.<p></p>
API explorers put the power of Web APIs in the hands of non-developers, allowing journalists, students, politicians, and any tech savvy Internet user to access the data and functionality available via APIs.<p></p>
Once a couple of these providers adds an export JSON to Google Docs or download to Excel, its a whole new ballgame.<p></p>
With an API explorer any user will be able to pull data from one or many APIs, export to a Google Spreadsheet and build visualizations to extract their own meaning from the data they've gathered via any REST API.

<p></p>Infochimps is taking large data sets in areas like<a title="Census Data" href="http://www.infochimps.com/tags/Census">census</a>, <a title="Housing" href="http://www.infochimps.com/tags/Housing">housing</a>, and <a title="Education" href="http://www.infochimps.com/search?query=education">education</a> and making them available via an API.
<p></p>Also Infochimps is bundling these data sets and RESTful APIs with their API Explorer. This allows even non-developers to play with large data sets.
<p></p>Some new API calls they've built are:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Qwerly" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/qwerly-profile-search">Qwerly</a> -</strong> You know when you Google someone's name and through some SEO magic, you can find all of that person's social media profiles? Imagine being able to easily integrate these presences into your applications. Query a person's Twitter handle and the Qwerly API call will return any of his or her social media presences (Facebook, Friendfeed, Flickr, etc) that it can find.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Twitter People Search" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/twpeoplesearch">Twitter People Search</a> -</strong> Let's face it. Finding new cool people on Twitter can be a bit taxing. Query any word using Twitter People Search and find any user who uses that word in their bio. Looking for other data lovers? Check. Looking for people who like the Green Bay Packers? Check. Looking for Bieber lovers on Twitter? You'll have no problem there. ;-)
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="British National Corpus" rel="wikipedia" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-frequencies-from-the-british-national-corpus">British National Corpus</a> -</strong> Word lists are very popular on our site and we couldn't pass this one up. This API call allows you to access the British National Corpus, a 100-million-word text corpus of samples of written and spoken English from a wide range of sources. The corpus covers British English the late twentieth century from a wide variety of genres with the intention that it be a representative sample of spoken and written British English of that time.
     </li>
</ul>Infochimps is not just liberating data via APIs, they are making it more accessible through their API explorer and data marketplace.
<p></p>You can search for data that is free or paid, available for download or through their API, alphabetically, or by upload date.
<p></p>Infochimps is also looking for suggestions for new APIs and datasets, you can submit ideas using the <a title="Infochimps UserVoice" href="http://infochimps.uservoice.com/forums/55516-infochimps-api-data-sets">Infochimps UserVoice</a> page.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/03/22/twitter-lendle-and-the-state-of-the-open-api-ecosystem/">Twitter, Lendle and the State of the Open API Ecosystem</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />As such, there has been much discussion recently about Open APIs and whether or not third party developers are wise or foolish to build their businesses on someone else's platform. The concern stems from a number of reasons, least of which being Twitter's pronouncements about the <a title="&quot;Rules of the Road&quot; for Its Ecosystem" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">"rules of the road" for its ecosystem</a>, and now <a title="Lendles announcement that Amazon has revoked its access to the Amazon API" href="http://lendle.me/">Lendle's announcement that Amazon has revoked its access to the Amazon API</a>.
<p></p>The reactions to both Twitter and Amazon have been pretty strong. And while I do think Twitter is making some serious mistakes with its approach to its API and developer ecosystem, we might be making some mistakes of our own if we lump the Lendle/Amazon issue in to concerns about Twitter. Is Amazon shutting down apps that are poaching on its ecosystem? That's not clear.
<p></p>As it stands, everyone seems to be stirring the pot and feeding the hysteria around the perils of using Open APIs, or rather, the dangers of relying on them for your businesses..
<p></p>But it seems to me that there is much more going on here. While APIs may be the focus -- the way in which apps and websites are connecting to a larger platform -- we're also looking at larger conflicts with new business models, whether those are publishing and DRM in the case of Amazon and Lendle or whether those conflicts are around a startup still struggling to monetize its core business. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> This isn't to say that there aren't precautions that people should take when building on an Open API. But when I hear some of the FUD lately, much of this echoes what we were hearing (and still hear, I suppose) about cloud computing.
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>Your server or storage could disappear at any moment, because its virtualized!</strong> Sure, as would any server or storage, that's why I have plan A and B, and in the clouds I have C &amp; D as well. I plan for failure no matter where my infrastructure is located.</em>
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <strong><em><strong>Your data is not secure in the clouds!</strong></em></strong> <em>Security is a concern everywhere, make sure and have thorough security plan that is revisited regularly.</em>
</p>
<p></p>The naysayers are now making their arguments about APIs
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>Your API access could be shut off at any time!</strong> I don't think this is any secret about APIs. This is why there are terms of service that you must read and follow. Your application needs to take this into consideration with ALL the APIs it uses -- whether they're from developer-friendly companies or not, and then operate accordingly.</em>
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>An API owner could decide to poach business from its community at any time!</strong> Again I don't think its a secret. APIs are a form of R&amp;D for companies, this is open territory for everyone to innovate. In perfect world an API owner communicates openly with developers and partners about opportunities in the ecosystem, plans to monetize, and where partner opportunities exist.</em> I'm not saying these dangers aren't real. They are. What I'm saying is that none of this should come as a shock. You build and plan around these potential issues just as you would with any other technologies you invest in. What if Google Apps goes down? What if your supplier goes out of business? What if FedEx doesn't arrive on time?
</p>
<p></p>Open APIs aren't really the problem here. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/lendle-logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /> If a company is built entirely around a single API ecosystem, maybe the owners should consider diversification into other areas, expanding their business. The fault is with the business strategy; it's not the fault of the API.
<p></p>If an API ecosystem grows large enough where business opportunities develop that are ripe for picking by companies or poaching by the APIs owners, then the responsibility is on the API owner to establish a partner strategy that considers and includes ecosystem developers. It's not the fault of the API.
<p></p>Technology is transforming a lot of industries right now. Open APIs are at the heart of this. <em>This is a good thing</em>.
<p></p>Open APIs drive developer and business innovation, and as this occurs there are going to challenges with monetization, business strategies, licensing, ownership, security, and privacy.
<p></p>Let's not blame the API or scare people off from using APIs by freaking out about the dangers. Let's identify the pitfalls, understand their value and establish healthy ways to integrate with APIs, to build healthy business and vibrant ecosystems around them.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/terms-legal.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I wanted to establish a base <a title="Terms of Service" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=150">Terms of Service</a> for my API area.
<p></p>So I went and read the API terms of service from 15 top APIs
<p></p>I found the opening paragraph says a lot about how a company approaches their API.
<p></p>Here are the opening paragraphs for the top 15 API terms of service I came across:
<p></p><strong><a title="Twitter Terms of Service" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">Twitter</a></strong> Twitter maintains an open platform that supports the millions of people around the world who are sharing and discovering what's happening now.

At the same time, we aim to strike a balance between encouraging interesting development and protecting both Twitter's and users' rights.
<p></p>So, we've come up with a set of Developer Rules of the Road ("Rules") that describe the policies and philosophy around what type of innovation is permitted with the content and information shared on Twitter.

APIs provide the data and functionality that many of these ideas are built on.<p></p>
If you have an API, hopefully you have lots of ideas on what developers can do with it -- ideas that you can share with your API community in order to inspire them to create.<p></p>
Many innovative APIs are building tools for managing ideas within their communities.<p></p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/npr-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Twitter has been working hard lately to <a title="define the rules of the road for the Twitter API" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">define the rules of the road for the Twitter API</a> ecosystem.<p></p>
When it comes to monetizing content and media, there are many differing opinions and by extension there are many approaches to managing an API ecosystem.<p></p>
NPR's approach is innovative, <a title="making incremental changes in technology and business rules" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/03/17/134259537/the-npr-api-an-engine-rebuild?ft=1&amp;f=91000411">making incremental changes in technology and business rules</a>.<p></p>
<a title="National Public Radio" href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> is improving its API technology to be easier to use, run faster, and deliver all types of content better.<p></p>
NPR is also innovating around digital rights management, to support their <a title="Ingest System" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2010/04/22/126205655/building-the-ingest-system">Ingest System</a> which allows partners to publish content into the NPR system.<p></p>
Managing digital rights and content has its own challenges, but you throw in APIs -- the ability for partners to publish and developers to access this content -- it can't be easy.<p></p>
It's good to see NPR openly talking about the challenges they face, and their ideas on how they are going to keep improving the <a title="NPR API" href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">NPR API</a> ecosystem.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-ssl.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Google will <a title="start supporting use of SSL in APIs" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/03/improving-security-of-google-apis-with.html">start supporting the use of SSL in many of their APIs</a>.<p></p>
SSL will improve API security by encrypting all data communications between 3rd party applications and Google, protecting data from interception by a malicious third party.<p></p>
Google Web Search, Google Maps, Gmail and Google docs all currently support SSL for API access.<p></p>
They are working to introduce SSL support in other APis as well as update existing client libraries and code samples to support SSL.<p></p>
Beginning September 15, 2011, Google will require that all users of Google Documents List API, Google Spreadsheets API, and Google Sites API use SSL connections for all API requests.<p></p>
SSL will further legitimize the integration of Google APIs into third party applications.<p></p>
As applications become more distributed, SSL will become a must have layer to all APIs.

Even though the <a title="OAuth 2.0 Specification" href="http://wiki.oauth.net/w/page/25236487/OAuth-2">OAuth 2.0 specification</a> isn't 100% finalized, Google has overhauled all of their APIs in Google Code to support it.<p></p>
OAuth 2.0 is much easier for developers to implement, and simplifies OAuth consent for application users.<p></p>
Google's support for OAuth 2.0 is a big boost for developers integrating with their API, as well as big vote of support for the future of OAuth 2.0 as the standard for API authentication.<p></p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />In March, 2006&nbsp;<a title="Amazon Launched New Web Service" href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/03/13/announcing-amazon-s3---simple-storage-service/">Amazon launched a new web service</a>, something completely different from the&nbsp;<a title="Amazon Bookseller and E-Commerce" href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon bookseller and e-commerce</a>&nbsp;site we've come to know. This was a new endeavor for Amazon: a storage web service called&nbsp;<a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>&nbsp;provides a simple interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives developers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites.</p>
<p>Amazon S3 or Simple Storage Service was initially just an API. There was no Web interface or mobile app. It was just a RESTful API allowing PUT and GET requests with objects or files.</p>
<p>Developers using the Amazon S3 API were charged $0.15 a gigabyte per month for storing files in the cloud.</p>
<p>With this new type of API and billing model, Amazon ushered in a new type of computing we now know as cloud computing.</p>
<p>This also meant that APIs were no longer just for data or simple functionality. Now they could be used to deliver computing infrastructure.</p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/instagram.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />On October 6, 2010&nbsp;<a title="Instagram launched its photo-sharing IPhone application." href="http://instagr.am/blog/1/welcome-instagram">Instagram launched its photo-sharing iPhone application</a>.</p>
<p>Less than three months later, it had one million users.</p>
<p>Kevin Systrom the founder of&nbsp;<a title="Instagram" href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a>&nbsp;focused on delivering a powerful, but simple iPhone app that solved common problems with the quality of mobile photos and users' frustrations with sharing.</p>
<p>Immediately many users complained about the lack of central Instagram web site or an API, with Instragram remaining firm on focusing its energy on the core iPhone application.</p>
<p>In December a developer name Mislav Marohni? took it upon himself to reverse engineer how the iPhone app worked, and built his own&nbsp;<a title="Unofficial Instagram API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/">unofficial Instagram API.</a></p>
<p>By January&nbsp;<a title="Instagram shut down the rogue API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/12/instagram-shuts-down-third-party-developers-plans-official-api/">Instagram shut down the rogue API</a>&nbsp;and announced it was building one of its own.</p>
<p>Then in February of 2011,&nbsp;<a title="Instagram released the official API" href="http://instagr.am/blog/40/instagram-api">Instagram released the official API</a>&nbsp;for the photo platform.</p>
<p>Within days many&nbsp;<a title="Instagram Photo Applications" href="http://instagre.at/#/by/knorrstein/35938336">photo applications</a>, photo -sharing sites, and mashups built around the API started showing up.</p>
<p>Instagram became a viral iPhone app sensation, but quickly needed an API to realize its full potential.</p>
