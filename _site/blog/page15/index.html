        <span class="post-date">13 Jul 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/documentation/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-referral/hsda-organizations-documentation.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I am preparing for the recurring governance meeting for the Open Referral Human Services Data API standard–which I’m the technical lead for. I need to load up every detail of my Human Services Data API work into my brain, and writing stories is how I do this. I need to understand where the definition is with v1.1, and encourage discussion around a variety of topics when it comes to version 1.2.</p>

<h3 id="constraints-from-version-10-to-v11">Constraints From Version 1.0 To v1.1</h3>
<p>I wasn’t able to move as fast as I’d like from 1.0 to 1.1, resulting in me leaving out a number of features. The primary motivation to make sure as much of the version 1.1 of Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) was covered as possible–something I ended up doing horizontally with new API paths, over loading up the core paths of /organizations, /locations, and /services. There were too many discussion on the table regarding the scope and filtering of data, and schema for these core paths. Something which led to a discussion, about /search–resulting in me pushing off API design discussions on how to expand vertically at the core API path level to future versions.</p>

<p>There were just too many decisions to make at the API request and response level for me to make a decision in all the areas–warranting more discussion. Additionally, there were other API design discussion regarding operational, validation, and more utility APIs to discuss for inclusion in future versions expanding the scope and filtering discussions to the API path, and now API project level. In preparation for our regular governance meeting I wanted to run through all of the open API design issues, as well as additional projects the community needs to be thinking about.</p>

<h2 id="api-design">API Design</h2>
<p>As part of my Human Services Data API (HSDA) work we have opened up a pretty wide API design conversation regarding where the API definition could (should) be going. I’ve tried to capture the conversations going on across the Slack, and Google Group using GitHub issues for the HSDA GitHub repository. I will be focusing in on 16 of these issues for the current community discussions.</p>

<h3 id="versioning"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/8">Versioning</a></h3>
<p>We are moving forward the version of the API specification from 1.0 to 1.1. This version describes the API definition, to help quantify the compliance of any single API implementation. This is not guidance regarding how API providers should version their API–each implementation can articulate their compliance using an OpenAPI definition, or just in operation by being compliant. I purposely dodged providing versioning guidance of specific API implementations–until I could open up discussion around this subject.</p>

<p>If you need a primer on API versioning I recommend <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/your-api-versioning-is-wrong-which-is/">Troy Hunt’s piece</a> which helps highlight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>URL: We put the API version into the URL: https://example.com/api/v1.1/organizations/</li>
  <li>Custom request header: Using a header such as “api-version: 1.1”</li>
  <li>Accept header: Using the accept header to specify the version “Accept: application/vnd.hsda.v1.1+json - which relates to content negotiation discussions.</li>
  <li>No Versioning - We do not offer any versioning guidance and let each API implementation decide for themselves with no version being a perfectly acceptable answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>API versioning discussions are always hot topics, and there is no perfect answer. If we are to offer API versioning guidance for HSDA compliant API providers I recommend putting it in the URL, not because it is the right answer, but it is the right answer for this community. It is easy to implement, and easy to understand. Although I’m not 100% convinced we should be offering guidance at all.</p>

<p>I would like to open it up to the community, and get more feedback from vendors, and implementors. I’m curious what folks prefer when they are building applications. This decision was one that was wrapped up with potential content negotiation, hypermedia, and schema scope discussions to make without more discussion.</p>

<h3 id="paths"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/27">Paths</a></h3>
<p>The API definition provides some basic guidance for HSDA implementations when it comes to naming API paths, providing a core set or resources, as well as sub-resources. There are a number of other API designs waiting in the wings to be hammered out, making more discussion around this relevant. How do we name additional API paths? Do we keep evolving a single stack of resources (expanding horizontally), or do we start grouping them and evolve using more sub-resources (expanding vertically)?</p>

<p>Right now, we are just sticking with a core set of paths for /contacts, /locations, /organizations, and /services, with /search somewhat of an outlier, or I guess wrapper. We have moved forward with sub-resource guidance, but should standard API design guidance when it comes to crafting new paths, as well as sub-paths, including the actions discussion below. This will be an ongoing discussion when it comes to API design across future versions, making it an evergreen thread that will just keep growing as the HSDA definition matures.</p>

<h3 id="verbs"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/26">Verbs</a></h3>
<p>HTTP verbs usage was another aspect of the evolution of the HSDA specification from v1.0 to v1.1–the new specification uses its verbs. Making sure POST, PUT, and DELETE were used across all core resources, as well as sub-resources, making the entire schema open for reading and writing at all levels. This further expanded the surface of the API definition, making it manageable at all levels.</p>

<p>Beyond this expansion we need to open up the discussion regarding OPTIONS, and PATCH. Is there a need to provide partial updates using PATCH, and providing guidance on using OPTION for providing requirements associated with a resource, and the capabilities of the server behind the API. Also we should be having honest conversations about which verbs are available for sub-resources, especially when it comes to taking specific actions using HSDA paths. There is a lot more to discuss when it comes to HTTP verb usage across the HSDA specification.</p>

<h3 id="actions"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/24">Actions</a></h3>
<p>I want to prepare for the future when we have more actions to be taken, and talk about how we approach API design in the service of taking action against resources. Right now HTTP verbs are taking care of the CRUD features for all resources and sub-resources. While I don’t have any current actions in the queue to discus, we may want to consider this as part of the schema scope and filtering discussion–allowing API consumers to request partial, and complete representations of API resources using action paths. For example: /organization/simple, or /organizations/complete.</p>

<p>As the HSDA specification matures this question will come up more and more, as vendors, and implementations require more specialized actions to be taken against resources. Ideally, we are keeping resources very resource oriented, but from experience I know this isn’t always the case. Sometimes it becomes more intuitive for API developers to take action with simple, descriptive API paths, than adding more complexity with parameters, headers, and other aspects of the APIs design. I will leave this conversation open to help guide future versions, as well as the schema scope and filtering discussions.</p>

<h3 id="parameters"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/24">Parameters</a></h3>
<p>Currently the numbers parameters in use for any single endpoint is pretty minimal. The core resources allow for querying, and sorting, but as of version 1.1, parameters are still pretty well-defined and minimal. The only path that has an extensive set of parameters is /search, which possesses category, email, keyword, language, lat_lng, location, org_name, page, per_page, radius, service_area, and status. I’d like to to continue the discussion about which parameters should be added to other paths, as well as used to help filter the schema, and other aspects of the API design conversation.</p>

<p>I’d like to open up the parameter discussion across all HSDA paths, but I’d also like to establish a way to regularly quantify how many paths are available, as well as how loaded they are with default values, and enumerators. I’d like to feed this into overall API design guidance, helping keep API paths reflecting a microservices approach to delivering APIs. Helping ensure HSDA services do one thing, and do it well, with the right amount of control over the surface area of the request and response of each API path.</p>

<h3 id="headers"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/5">Headers</a></h3>
<p>Augmenting the parameter discussion I want to make sure headers are an equal part of the discussion. They have the potential to play a role across several of these API design questions from versioning to schema filtering. They also will continue to emerge in authentication, management, security, and even sorting and content negotiation discussions.</p>

<p>It is common for there to be a lack of literacy in developer circles when it comes to HTTP headers. A significant portion of the discussion around header usage should always be whether of not we want to invest in HTTP literacy amongst implementors, and their developer communities, over leveraging other non-header approaches to API design. HTTP Headers are an important building block of the web that developers should understand, but educating developers around their use can be time intensive and costly when it comes to guidance.</p>

<h3 id="body"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/25">Body</a></h3>
<p>There is an open discussion around how the body will be used across HSDA compliant implementations. Currently the body is default for POST and PUT, aka add and update. This body usage has been extended across all core resources, as well as sub-resource, requiring the complete, or sub resource representation to be part of each POST or PUT request.</p>

<p>There is no plan for any other APIs that will deviate from this approach, but we should keep this thread open to make sure we think about when the usage of the body is appropriate and when it might not be. We need to make sure that developers are able to effectively use the body, alongside headers, as well as parameters to get the desired results they are looking for.</p>

<h3 id="data-scope--filtering"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/22">Data Scope / Filtering</a></h3>
<p>Currently the only filtering beyond pagination that is available is the query parameter available on /contact, /organizations, /locations, and /services resources. After that search is where the heaviest data scope and filtering can be filtered and defined. We need to discuss the future of this. Should the core resources have similar capabilities to /search, or should /search be a first class citizen with the majority of the filtering capabilities?</p>

<p>There needs to be more discussion around how data will be available bia default, and how it will be filtered as part of each API request. Will search be carrying most of the load, or will each core resource be given some control when it comes to filtering data. Whatever the approach it needs to be standardized across all existing paths, as well as applied to new API designs, keeping data filtering consistent across all HSDA designs. As this comes into focus I will be making sure there is a guide that provides guidance when it comes to data filtering practices in play.</p>

<h3 id="schema-scope--filtering"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/21">Schema Scope / Filtering</a></h3>
<p>This is one of the top issues being discussed as part of the migration from v1.1 to v1.2, regarding how to not just filter data that is returned as part of API responses, but how do you filter what schema gets returned as part of the response. When it came to v1.0 to v1.1 I didn’t want to shift the response structure so that I can reduce any breaking changes for existing Ohana implementations, and open up with the community regarding the best approach for allowing schema filtering.</p>

<p>My current recommendation when it comes to the filtering of how much or how little of the schema to return with each request is to allow for schema templates to be defined and named, then enable API consumers to specify which template they’d like returned. This should be specified through either through a <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/05/24/considering-http-prefer-header-instead-of-field-filtering-for-my-api/">prefer header</a>, as part of the path structure as an action, or possibly through a parameter–all would accept the name of a schema template they desire (ie. simple, complete, etc.).</p>

<p>This approach to enabling schema templating could be applied at the GET, and could be also applied to POST or PUT requests. I personally recommend using a <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/05/24/considering-http-prefer-header-instead-of-field-filtering-for-my-api/">prefer header</a>, but I also emphasize the ease of use, and ease of defining the usage as part of documentation, and the OpenAPI definition–which it might make sense to allow for schema enablement as pat of the path name as an action. I’ll leave it to the community to ultimately decide, as with the rest of this API design and project list, I’m just looking to provide guidance, and direction, built on the feedback of the community.</p>

<h3 id="path-scope--filtering"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/38">Path Scope / Filtering</a></h3>
<p>Next up in the scope and filtering discussion is regarding how we define, group, and present all available API paths included in the HSDA specification. With the current specification I see three distinct groups of API paths emerging: 1) core resources (/contacts, /organizations, /locations, /services), and 2) sub resources (/physical-address, /postal-address, /phones, and more), then the more utility aspects of meta data, taxonomy, and eventually webhooks.</p>

<p>When a new user lands on the API documentation, they should see the core resources, and not be burdened with the cognitive load associated sub resources or the more utility aspects of HSDA consumption. However, once ready more advanced API paths are available. The grouping and filtering of the API paths can be defined as part of the OpenAPI definitions for the API(s), as well as the APIs.json index for the site. This path grouping will allow for API consumers to limit scope and filter which API paths are available in the documentation, and possibly with SDKs, testing, and other aspects of integration.</p>

<p>There are additional API projects on the table that might warrant the addition of new API groups, beyond core resources, sub resources, and utility paths. The approval, feedback, and messaging discussions might require their own group, allowing them to be separated in documentation, code, testing, and other areas–reducing the load for new users, while expanding the opportunities for more advanced consumers. Eventually there might be a one to one connection between API path groups, and the API projects in the queue, allowing for different groups of APIs to be moved forward at different rates, and involve different groups of API consumers and vendors in the process.</p>

<h3 id="project-scope--filtering"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/40">Project Scope / Filtering</a></h3>
<p>Adding the fourth dimension to this scope / filtering discussion, I’m proposing we discuss how projects are defined and isolated, which can allow them to move forward at different rates, and be reflected in documentation, code, and other resources–allowing for filtering by consumers. This will drive the path filtering described above, but apply beyond just the API, and influencing documentation, SDKs, testing, monitoring, validation, and other aspects of API operations.</p>

<p>With this tier I am looking to decouple API projects from one another, and from the core specification. I want the core HSDS/A specification to stay focused on doing one thing well, but I’d like to establish a clear way to move forward complimentary groups of API definitions, and supporting tooling independently of the core specification. As we prepare to begin the journey from version 1.1 to 1.2, there are a number of significant projects on the table, and we need a way to isolate and decouple each additional API project in the same we we do with individual API resources–keeping them clearly defined, focused on specific problem set, and a buffet of resources that the community can choose where they’d like to participate.</p>

<h3 id="pagination"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/10">Pagination</a></h3>
<p>This is the discussion around how results will be paginated, allowing for efficient or complete requests to be requested, and navigate through large volumes of human services data. We need to be discussing how we will evolve the current approach to using page= and per_page= to articulate pagination. This approach is a common, well understood way to allow developers to paginate, but we need to keep discussion open as we answer some of the other API design questions on the table.</p>

<p>The pagination topic overlaps with the hypermedia and response structure discussion. Eventually we may offer pagination as part of a response envelope, or relational links provided as part of the response when using JSON API, HAL, or other media type. Right now we will leave pagination as it is, but we should be thinking about how it will evolve alongside all other API design conversations in this list.</p>

<h3 id="sorting"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/12">Sorting</a></h3>
<p>According to the current Ohana API implementation, which is the HSDA v1.0 definition, the guidance for sorting availability is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Except for location-based and keyword-based searches, results are sorted by location id in ascending order. Location-based searches (those that use the lat_lng or location parameter) are sorted by distance, with the ones closest to the search query appearing first. keyword searches are sorted by relevance since they perform a full-text search in various fields across various tables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This guidance follows the API definition from version 1.0 to 1.2, but for future versions we should be considering providing further guidance regarding sorting of results. I’d like to get more feedback from the community on how they are providing data sorting capabilities for API consumes, or even as part of web and mobile applications.</p>

<h3 id="response-structure"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/6">Response Structure</a></h3>
<p>Right now the API responses for HSDA are pretty flat, like the schema. As part of the move from version 1.1 to 1.2 we need to be expanding on them, allowing for sub-resources to be included. This conversation will be heavily influenced by the schema filtering conversation above, as well as potentially the hypermedia and content negotiation discussions below. If we are gong to expand on the the schema being returned with API response we should be discussing all possible changes to the schema at once.</p>

<p>This conversation is meant to bring together the API schema filtering, hypermedia, and content negotiation conversations into a single discussion regarding the overall structure of a response, by default, as well as through filtering at the path, parameter, or header levels. I’d like to see  HSDA responses expand to accommodate sub resources, but also the relationships between resources, as well as assisting with pagination, sorting, and other aspects of data, schema, and path filtering. I am looking to make sure the expansion of the response structure be more inclusive beyond just talk of sub resource access.</p>

<h3 id="hypermedia"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/7">Hypermedia</a></h3>
<p>I really want to see a hypermedia fork in the HSDA definition, allowing more advanced users to negotiate and hypermedia version of the specification, instead of the more simpler, or even advanced default versions of the API. I recommend the adoption of HAL, Siren, or JSON API, as an alternate edition of an HSDA implementation. This expansion of the design of the HSDA specification would not impact the current version, but would allow for another dimension of API consumption and integration.</p>

<p>The relationships between human services data, and the semantic nature of the data really begs for a hypermedia solution. It would allow more meaningful API responses, and defining of relationships between resources, and emphasis of the taxonomy. I will be encouraging a separate, but complimentary version of HSDA that uses one of the leading hypermedia media types. I’d like to ensure there is community awareness of the potential of this approach, and support for investing in this as part of the HSDA design strategy.</p>

<h3 id="status-codes"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/3">Status Codes</a></h3>
<p>One of the areas of design around version 1.1 of the HSDA specification that was put off until future versions is guidance when it comes to API response status and error codes. Right now the OpenAPI definition for version 1.1 of the HSDA specification only suggests a 200 successful response, returning a reference to the appropriate HSDS schema. A project needs to be started that would provider further guidance for 300, 400, and 500 series status codes, as well as error responses.</p>

<p>Each HSDA path should provide guidance on all relevant HTTP Status Codes, but should also provide guidance regarding the error object schema returned as part of every possible API response. Helping standardize how errors are communicated, and provide further guidance on how to help API consumers navigate a solution. Currently there is no guidance when it comes to HTTP responses and errors, something that should be considered in version 1.2 or 1.3, depending on available resources.</p>

<h3 id="content-negotiation"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/39">Content Negotiation</a></h3>
<p>Augmenting other conversations around schema filtering, API response structure, and hypermedia, I want to make sure content negotiation stays part of the conversation. This aspect of API design will significantly impact API integration, and the evolution of the API specification. I want to make sure vendors, and other key actors are aware of it as an option, and can participate in the conversation regarding the different content types.</p>

<p>This conversation should begin with making CSV and HTML representations of the data available as part of the API response structure alongside the current JSON representations. API consumers should have the option to get raw HTML, CSV, and JSON through content negotiation–with JSON remaining as the default. Then the conversation should evolve to consider HSDA specific content type designation, as well as implementation of a leading hypermedia media type like JSON API, HAL, or Siren.</p>

<p>Content negotiation plays an important role in versioning the HSDA specification, as well as providing different dimensions for dealing with more complex integrations, as well as other aspects of operations like pagination, sorting, access to sub resources, other actions and even data, schema, and path filtering. Like headers, the mainstream developer community tends to not all be aware of content negotiation, but the benefits of adopting far outweigh the overhead involved with bringing developers up to speed.</p>

<p>That concludes the list of API design conversations that are occurring as part of the move from version 1.0 to 1.1, and will set the stage for the move towards 1.2, and beyond. It is a lot to consider, but it is a manageable amount for the community to think about as part of the version 1.1 feedback cycle. Allowing us to make a community informed decision regarding what should be focused on with each release–delivering what matters to the community.</p>

<h2 id="api-projects">API Projects</h2>
<p>As the version 1.0 to 1.1 migration occurred several projects were identified, or suggested for consideration. I want to make sure all these projects are on the table as part of the evolution of HSDA, beyond just the current API design discussion occurring. These are the projects we added to the specification that are moving forward but will have varying degrees of impact on the core API definition.</p>

<h3 id="taxonomy"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/19">Taxonomy</a></h3>
<p>There are two objects included in version 1.1 of the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) that deal with taxonomy, the service_taxonomy object, and the core taxonomy object. I purposely left these aspects of the schema out of version 1.1 of HSDA. I wanted to see more discussion regarding taxonomy before we included in the specification. This is one of the first areas that influenced the above discussions regarding path scope and filtering, as well as project scope and filtering.</p>

<p>I’d like to see taxonomy exist as a separate set of paths, as a separate project, and out of the core specification. In addition to further discussion about what is HSDA taxonomy, I’d like to see  more consideration regarding what exactly is acceptable levels of HSDA compliant taxonomy. Ideally, the definition allows for multiple taxonomy, and possibly even a direct relationship between the available content types and a taxonomy, allowing for a more meaningful API response.</p>

<p>I will leave open a Github issue to discuss taxonomy, and either move forward as entirely separate schema, or inclusion in version 1.2, 1.3 of the core HSDA definition. One aspect of this delay is to ensure that my awareness of available taxonomies is up to snuff to help provide guidance. I’m just not aware of everything out there, as well as an intimacy the leading taxonomies in use–I need to hear more from vendors and implementors on this subject before I feel confident in making any decision.</p>

<h3 id="metadata"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/28">Metadata</a></h3>
<p>The metadata, and the meta_table_description objects v1.1 of HSDA were two elements I also left out of version 1.1 of HSDA. I felt like there should be more discussion around API management, logging, and other aspects of API operations that feed into this area, before we settled in on an API design to satisfy the HSDA metadata conversation. I’d like to hear more from human services implementors regarding what metadata they desire before we connect the existing schema to the API.</p>

<p>The metadata conversation overlaps with the approval and feedback project. There are aspects of logging and meta data collection and storage that will contribute to the transactional nature of any approval and feedback solution. There is also conversation going on regarding privacy concerns around API access to HSDS data, and logging, auditing that occurs at the metadata level. This thread covers these conversations, and is looking to establish a separate group of API paths, and separate project to drive documentation, and other aspects of API operations.</p>

<h3 id="approval--feedback"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/34">Approval &amp; Feedback</a></h3>
<p>One of the projects that came up recently was about working to define the layer that allows developers to add, update, and delete data via the API. Eventually through the HSDA specification we to encourage 3rd party developers, and external stakeholders to help curate and maintain critical human services data within a community, through trusted partners.</p>

<p>HSDA allows for the reading and writing of organizations, locations, and services for any given area. I am looking to provide guidance on how API implementors can allow for POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE on their API, but require approval before any changing transaction is actually executed. Requiring the approval of an internal system administrator to ultimately give the thumbs up or thumbs down regarding whether or not the change will actually occur.</p>

<p>A process which immediately begs for the ability to have multiple administrators or even possibly involving external actors. How can we allow organizations to have a vote in approving changes to their data? How can multiple data stewards be notified of a change, and given the ability to approve or disprove, logging every step along the way? Allowing any change to be approved, reviewed, audited, and even rolled back. Making public data management a community affair, with observability and transparency built in by default.</p>

<p>I am doing research into different approaches to tackling this, ranging from community approaches like Wikipedia, to publish and subscribe, and other events or webhook models. I am looking for technological solutions to opening up approval to the API request and response structure, with accompanying API and webhook surface area for managing all aspects of the approval of any API changes. If you know of any interesting solutions to this problem I’d love to hear more, so that I can include in my research, future storytelling, and ultimately the specification for the Open Referral Human Services Data Specification and API.</p>

<h3 id="universal-unique-ids"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/35">Universal Unique IDs</a></h3>
<p>How will we allow for a universal unique ID system for all organizations, locations, and services, providing some provenance on the origin of the record. There is a solid conversation started about how to approach a universal ID system to live alongside, or directly as part of the core HSDA specification–depending on how we decide to approach project scope. Ideally, a universal ID system isn’t pat of being compliant, but could add a healthy layer of certification for some leading providers.</p>

<p>More research needs to be done regarding how universal IDs are handled in other industries. An exhaustive search needs to be conducted regarding any existing standards and guidance that can help direct this discussion. This approach to handling identifiers will have a significant impact on individual API implementations, as well as the overall HSDA definition. More importantly, it will set the stage for future HSDA aggregation and federation, allowing HSDA implementations to work together more seamlessly, and better serve end-uses.</p>

<h3 id="messaging"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/37">Messaging</a></h3>
<p>I separated this project out of the approval and feedback project. I am suggesting that we isolate the messaging guidance for APIs, setting a standard for how you communicate within a single implementation as well across implementations. There are a number of messaging API standards and best practices available out there, as well as existing messaging APIs that are already in use by human services practitioners, including social channels like Facebook and Twitter, but also private channels like Slack.</p>

<p>HSDA compliant messaging channels should live as a separate project, and set of API path specifications. It should augment the core HSDA definition, overlaying with existing contact information, but it should also be dovetailed with new projects like approval and feedback system. More research needs to be conducted on existing messaging API standards, and leading channels that existing human services implementations and their software vendors are already using.</p>

<h3 id="webhooks"><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/35">Webhooks</a></h3>
<p>I want to begin separate project for handling an important aspect of any API operations, and not just being their to receive requests, but can also push information externally, and respond to scheduled, or event driven aspects of API operations. Webhooks will play a role in the approval and feedback system, as well as the metadata, and messaging projects–eventually touching all aspects of the core HSDA resources, and separate projects.</p>

<p>Alongside the approval and feedback, universal id, and messaging projects, webhooks will set the stage for the future of HSDA, where individual city and regional implementations can work together, share information, federate and share responsibility in updates and changes. Webhooks will be how each separate implementation will work in concert, making the deliver of human services more real time, and orchestrated across providers, achieving API the vision of Open Referral founder Greg Bloom.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-next">What Is Next?</h2>
<p>We have a lot on the table to discuss currently. We need to settle some pretty important API design discussions that will continue to have an impact on API operations for a long time. I want to help push forward the conversation around these API design discussions, and get these API projects moving forward in tandem. I need more input from the vendors, and the community around some of the pressing discussions, and then I’m confident we can settle in on what the final version 1.1 of the API specification should be, and what work we want to tackle as part of 1.2 and beyond. I’m feeling like with a little discussion we can find a path forward to reach 1.2 in the fall of 2017.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Jul 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hack-education/ed-tech-investment-research.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/">My partner in crime is working on a large data aggregation project regarding ed-tech funding</a>. She is publishing data to Google Sheets, and I’m helping her develop Jekyll templates she can fork and expand using Github when it comes to publishing and telling stories around this data across her network of sites. Like API Evangelist, <a href="https://github.com/hackeducation/">Hack Education runs as a network of Github repositories</a>, with a common template across them–we call the overlap between API Evangelist, <a href="http://contrafabulists.com/">Contrafabulists</a>.</p>

<p>One of the smaller projects she is working on as part of her ed-tech funding research involves pulling the grants made by the Gates Foundation since the 1990s. Similar to my story a couple weeks ago about my friend David Kernohan, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/28/i-have-two-interesting-apis-and-i-am-not-a-developer-what-do-i-do/">where he was wanting to pull data from multiple sources</a>, and aggregate into a single, workable project. Audrey is looking to pull data from a single source, but because the data spans almost 20 years–it ends up being a lot like aggregating data from across multiple sources.</p>

<p>A couple of the challenges she is facing trying to gather the data, and aggregate as a common dataset are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PDF</strong> - The enemy of any open data advocate is the PDF, and a portion of her research data data is only available in PDF format which translates into a good deal of manual work.</li>
  <li><strong>Search</strong> - Other portions of the data is available via the web, but obfuscated behind search forms requiring many different searches to occur, with paginated results to navigate.</li>
  <li><strong>Scraping</strong> - The lack of APIs, CSV, XML, and other machine readable results raises the bar when it comes to aggregating and normalizing data across many years, making scraping a consideration, but because of PDFs, and obfuscated HTML pages behind a search, even scraping will have a significant costs.</li>
  <li><strong>Format</strong> - Even once you’ve aggregated data from across the many sources, there is a challenge with it being in different formats. Some years are broken down by topic, while others are geographically based. All of this requires a significant amount of overhead to normalize and bring into focus.</li>
  <li><strong>Manual</strong> - Ultimately Audrey has a lot of work ahead of her, manually pulling PDFs and performing searches, then copying and pasting data locally. Then she’ll have to roll up her sleeves to normalize all the data she has aggregated into a single, coherent vision of where the foundation has put its money.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data research takes time, and is tedious, mind numbing work. I encounter many projects like hers where I have to make a decision between scraping or manually aggregating and normalizing data–each project will have it’s own pros and cons. I wish I could help, but it sounds like it will end up being a significant amount of manual labor to establish a coherent set of data in Google Sheets. Once, she is done though, she has all the tools in place to publish as YAML to Github, and get to work telling stories around the data across her work using Jekyll and Liquid. I’m also helping her make sure she has a JSON representation of each of her data projects, allowing others to build on top of her hard work.</p>

<p>I wish all companies, organizations, institutions, and agencies would think about how they publish their data publicly. It’s easy to think that data stewards will have ill intentions when it comes to publishing data in a variety of formats like they do, but more likely it is just a change of stewardship when it comes to managing and publishing the data. Different folks will have different visions of what sharing data on the web needs to look like, and have different tools available to them, and without a clear strategy you’ll end up with a mosaic of published data over the years. Which is why I’m telling her story. I am hoping to possibly influence one or two data stewards, or would-be data stewards when it comes to the importance of pausing for a moment and thinking through your strategy for standardizing how you store and publish your data online.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Jul 2017</span>

<p><a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">I am moving my Human Services Data API (HSDA) work</a> forward and one of the top items on the list to consider as part of the move from version 1.1 to 1.2 is all around the scope of the API design portion of the standard. We are at a phase where the API design still very much reflects the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)–basically a very CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) API. With version 1.2 I need to begin considering the needs of API consumers a little more, looking to vendors and real world practitioners to help understand what the next version(s) of the API definition will/should contain.</p>

<p>The most prominent discussion in the move from version 1.1 to 1.2 centers around scope of API design at four distinct levels of this work, where we are looking to move forward a variety of API design concerns for a large group of API consumers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/22">Data Scope / Filtering</a> - Discussions around how to filter data, allowing API consumers to search across the contents of any HSDA implementation, getting exactly the data they need, no more, no less.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/21">Schema Scope / Filtering</a> - Considering the design of simple, standard, or full schema responses that can specified using a prefer header, parameter, or path levels.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/38">Path Scope / Filtering</a> - How are API paths going to be group and organized, allowing a large surface area to be shared via documentation (APIs.json) in a way that new API consumers can start simple, advanced users can get what they need, and serving as many needs in between as we can.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/40">Project Scope / Filtering</a> - Adding the fourth dimension to this scope / filtering discussion, I’m proposing we discuss how projects are defined and isolated, which can allow them to move forward at different rates, and be reflected in documentation, code, and other resources–allowing for filtering by consumers, as  well as prioritization by vendors involved in the API design discussion.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short I have a large number of desires put on the table by vendors and practitioners. There is a mix of desire to load up as much functionality and API design guidance as we can at the single path level–meaning /organizations, /locations, and /services will allow you to get as much, or as little, as you desire. In this same conversation I have to defend the interests of newcomers, allowing them to easily learn about, and get what they need from these three distinct API paths, without loading them up with too much functionality. While also defend the long tail of needs for mobile, voice, and other leading edge application developers.</p>

<p>I’m looking at this discussion in these four dimensions, but I am trying to apply a horizontal or vertical approach in all four dimensions. Meaning, do I access or filter the amount of data I receive vertically with parameters or headers at the single API path level, or do I access and filter the amount of data I want horizontally across many separate API paths. The same logic applies to the API schema level with accessing vertically at the same path, by adding many subpaths, or do we approach horizontally with new paths. This continues at the API path, and project levels–how do discuss, develop, evolve, and allow API consumers to filter and only get at the API paths and projects they need–limiting the scope for new users, but meeting the demand of vendors, implementors, analysts, and other power consumers.</p>

<p>Aight, ok. Phew. I just needed to get that out. Not 100% sure it makes sense, but it is a framework I’m running with for a group conversation I’m having tomorrow–so we’ll see how it goes. One significant difference in this API design process from others is that it is not about any single API implementation. It is focused on moving forward a single API definition, or in the case of this discussion, many little API definition discussions, with lots of overlap, and under a single umbrella–to support thousands of API implementations. I’ll be publishing another piece shortly which zooms out to the 100K level of my HSDA work, where I’d consider this to be a little 20K (data), 40K (schema), 60K (path), and 80K (project) levels. I just needed to get a handle on this piece–if you actually read this far in the post, you are pretty geeky, and probably need a hobby (HSDA is mine).</p>

<p>People often learn through example. Before I’d ever consider myself a software engineer, I’d consider myself a reverse software engineer. 93% of what I know has been extracted from the work of others. Even with 7% being of my own creation, it is always heavily influenced by the work of others. People emulate what they know, what they see, and use. This is why as an API provider you should be showcasing best practices, positive examples, and healthy blueprints of what API consumers could (should) be doing.</p>

<p><a href="https://api.slack.com/best-practices/blueprints">You can see this in action with Slack’s best practice blueprints page</a>, where they provide six blueprints of applications that API consumers should be learning from. Slack doesn’t just provide a title, description and image of example applications, it is truly a blueprint–providing diagrams, links to documentation, code samples, and other essential knowledge you will need to successfully develop an application on Slack. Providing six solid examples that anyone can reverse engineer to understand how Slack application development could (should) work.</p>

<p>Slack app blueprints is just one component of <a href="https://api.slack.com/slack-apps">a pretty sophisticated getting started section offered as part of the Slack API ecosystem</a>. I am adding application blueprint as a building block to my <a href="http://getting-started.apievangelist.com/">getting started API research</a>, and adding it as a dimension to my <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com/">API documentation</a> &amp; <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDK research</a>–the overlap in these areas seem like it should be strong to me. Coming across Slack app blueprints, and writing this story has reminded me that I also need to write another piece on the Slack ecosystem, and generate an outline of all the building blocks they are using in their API ecosystem, and create an updated blueprint for successful API operations that other API providers can emulate.</p>

<p>I am spending time going through some of the most relevant APIs I know of online today, working to create some 101 training materials for average folks to take advantage of. I’m looking through these APIs: Twitter, Google Sheets, Github, Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Slack, Dropbox, Paypal, Weather Underground, Spotify, Google Maps, Reddit, Pinterest, NY Times, Twilio, Stripe, SendGrid, Algolia, Keen, Census, Yelp, Walgreens. I feel they are some of the most useful solutions in the average business person who is API curious.</p>

<p>With these new lessons I’m trying to continue my work evangelizing APIs amongst the normals, helping them understand what APIs are, and what is possible when you put them to work. Once I introduce folks to each API I’m left with the challenge of how do I actually onboard them with each API when they aren’t actually a programmer. The number one way I’m helping alleviate this problem is by including <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a> examples with each of my API lessons, helping folks understand that they can quickly get up and running with each API using the Zapier integration platform as a service (iPaaS). I will be including one or more Zapier examples along with each of my API 101 lessons, helping normal folk put what they’ve learned about APIs to use–hopefully making each lesson a little more sticky.</p>

<p>One of the primary targets for my lessons is the average worker at small, medium, and enterprise businesses, trying to help them understand that APIs aren’t just for developers, and that they can be putting APIs to use in their world. I tried to pick a handful of APIs that are relevant and useful in their daily lives, and helping them become aware of useful Zapier recipes they can adopt in their daily work. I’m looking to encourage users to become more API-literate, and begin connecting and orchestrating using APIs in their daily work. I’m hoping that eventually they will become confident enough by leverage APIs using Zapier that they will eventually become an advocate within their companies and organizations.</p>

<p>In my opinion, each company could really use a Zapier advocate. To help incentivize this behavior I’m  going to show folks how they can become an advocate for APIs and Zapier at their company, and provide them with some templates for how they can publish API training material on a page dedicated to Zapier within the company firewewall, or on some sort of company portal that the rest of the company has access to. Similar to how <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">I’ve been advocating API providers to publish an integration page in their developer portals</a>, I’m looking to also encourage business users to publish a similar page of useful Zaps involving API that are relevant to their company–allowing other folks at a company to learn, explore, and implement useful recipes that can help them be more successful  in their work.</p>

<p>A significant portion of my work as API Evangelist is dedicated to pushing forward the conversation around APIs, telling stories about the leading and bleeding edge of APIs, but I’m trying to not forget my roots, and my original mission to help non-developers understand the API potential. I feel that a wealth of <a href="http://101.apievangelist.com">API 101 materials</a>, combined with examples of Zapier advocacy and storytelling, and pages dedicated to sharing Zapier recipes (Zaps) will help go a long ways to help encourage adoption amongst business users. My first API 101 lessons are rolling off the assembly line, and the next step is to create an example page where these lessons can be published, including other resources and recipes for using Zapier to exercise each lessons learned. If you would like to learn how to become a <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a> advocate at your company please drop me a line, I’m looking for a few beta users to help me push forward this work in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>I see a lot of tools come across my desk each week, and I have to be honest I don’t alway fully get what they are and what they do. There are many reasons why I overlook interesting applications, but the most common reason is because I’m too busy and do not have the time to fully play with a solution. One application I’ve been keeping an eye on as part of my work is <a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable</a>, which I have to be honest, I didn’t get what they were doing, or really I just didn’t notice because I was too busy.</p>

<p>Airtable is part spreadsheet, part database, that operates as a simple, easy to use web application, which with a push of a button, you can publish an API from. You don’t just get an API by default with each Airtable, you get a pretty robust developer portal for your API complete with  good looking API documentation. Allowing you to go from an Airtable (spreadsheet / database) to API and documentation–no coding necessary. Trust me. Try it out, anyone can create an Airtable and publish an API that any developer can visit and quickly understand what is going on.</p>

<p>As a developer, API deployment still feels like it can be a lot of work. Then, once I take off my programmers hat, and put on my business user hat, I see that there are some very easy to use solutions like <a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable</a> available to me. Knowing how to code is almost slowing me down when it comes API deployment. Sure, the APIs that Airtable publishes aren’t the perfectly designed, artisanally crafted API I make with my bare hands, but they work just as well as mine. Most importantly, they get business done. No coding necessary. Something that anyone can do without the burden of programming.</p>

<p><a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable provides me another solution</a> that I can recommend that my readers and clients should consider using when managing their data, which will also allow them to easily deploy an API for developers to build applications against.<a href="https://airtable.com/integrations">I also notice that Airtable has a whole API integration part of their platform, which allows you to integrate your Airtables into other APIs</a>–something I will have to write about separately in a future post. I just wanted to make sure and take the time to properly add Airtable to my research, and write a story about them so that they are in my brain, available for recall when people are asking me for easy to use solutions that will help them deploy an API.</p>

<p>When you take any Google Sheet and choose to publish it to the web, you immediately get an API. Well, you get the HTML representation of the spreadsheet (shared with the web), and if you know the right way to ask, you also can get the JSON representation of the spreadsheet–which gives you an interface you can program against in any application.</p>

<p>Articles I curate, the companies, institutions, organizations, government agencies, and everything else I track on lives in Google Sheets that are published to the web in this way. When you are viewing any Google Sheet in your browser you are viewing it using a URL like:</p>

<p>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[sheet_id]/edit</p>

<p>Of course, [sheet_id] is replaced with the actual id for your sheet, but the URL demonstrates what you will see. Once you publish your Google sheet to the web you are given a slight variation on that url:</p>

<p>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[sheet_id]/pubhtml</p>

<p>This is the URL you will share with the public, allowing them to view the data you have in your spreadsheet in their browsers. In order to get at a JSON representation of the data you just need to learn the right way to craft the URL using the same sheet id:</p>

<p>https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/[sheet_id]/default/public/values?alt=json</p>

<p>Ok, one thing I have to come clean on is that the JSON available for each Google sheet is not the most intuitive JSON you will come across, but once you learn what is going on you can easily consume the data within a spreadsheet using any programming languages. Personally, I use a <a href="https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop">JavaScript library called tabletop.js</a> that quickly helps you make sense of a spreadsheet and get to work using the data in any (JavaScript) application.</p>

<p>The fastest, lowest cost way to deploy an API is to put some data in a Google Sheet, and hit publish to the web. Ok, its not a full blown API, it’s just JSON available at a public URL, but it does provide an interface you can program against when developing an application. I take all the data I have in spreadsheets and publish to Github as YAML, and then make static APIs available using that YAML in XML, CSV, JSON, Atom, or any other format that I need. Taking the load of Google, creating a cached version at any point in time that runs on Github, in a versioned repository that anyone can fork, or integrate into any workflow.</p>

<p>I was looking at how many of the top mobile applications in the iTunes story actually had a public API presence, and was finding it very telling what came up in the Google search results for each company when I searched [company name] + API. It tells a lot about how a company sees the world, when they don’t have a public API presence, but they have a very public mobile application that uses APIs.</p>

<p>An example of this is with Tinder, where the top listings are all Github rogue API repositories, when you Google “Tinder API”. Tinder doesn’t own the conversation when it comes to their own APIs. While the Tinder APIs are public, and well documented, Tinder prefers acting like they are private–they aren’t. Pinterest uses SSL pinning, but <a href="https://ritcsec.wordpress.com/2016/12/11/bypassing-certificate-pinning-on-tinder/">there is even a good amount of information out there at how to get around that</a>, making the mapping out and documenting of Tinder APIs a pretty doable thing.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don’t care about Tinder’s APIs. They are just an easy example to point a finger at and use as a poster child. I don’t even expect them to have fully public APIs that any developer could use without permission. Sure, lock that shit down, but provide a sandbox, and make sure every application gets approval before they can more access to live data. Make sure that you own the API conversation by having a developers portal, and provide information regarding what it takes to get access, and maybe some day actually become an approved partner.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that every company should have freely available public APIs. I’m saying every company should own the public conversation around their APIs, no matter what their strategy for developing applications around a platform’s APIs. Have a presence. Own the conversation. Have a door for application developers to walk, even if there is a waiting room. Not all applications will be competing with your own web, mobile, device, or network applications. Some will be about enabling data portability for you users, or maybe provide useful access aggregate data for use in visualizations–you never know what folks will be bringing to the table, why keep the door closed?</p>

<p>I understand. You may not be all team API like I am, but you are using APIs to drive your mobile experience. I just don’t get why you wouldn’t want to own the conversation around these APIs. You are leaving so much on the table. If your mobile app is finding success, people will want access to the goodness going on behind it–<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/">a rogue API is what kickstarted the Instagram API in the early days</a>. It is pretty easy to reverse engineer any mobile application, and map out the surface area of the API behind, as well as the authentication in play. Either you own the conversation around your API, or someone will step up and do it for you in todays online world.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/drones/drone-rock-outdoors.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I have been following stories about, as well as personally experiencing DJI restricting where their drones can fly, going beyond just warning you about restricted areas and actually locking down or restricting your drone capabilities. <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3knkgn/dji-is-locking-down-its-drones-against-a-growing-army-of-diy-hackers">So it was interesting to also read a post in Motherboard about the company also locking down drones to prevent against hacking, modifying, and tweaking your DJI drones as you wish</a>. Drones for me are a poster child for the entire Internet of Things (IoT), and I think DJI’s approach is a sign of what is to come for all Internet connected devices.</p>

<p>In coming years, there will be a lot that the IoT community can learn from the drone space. From the technical to regulatory, drones will be pushing forward conversations about our networks, cameras, security, privacy, surveillance, and corporate and government control over us, and our devices. Drones stimulate some interesting emotions within people associated with the industry, but more importantly people who know nothing about drones, and will be weighing in on regulation at the municipal, all the way up to the federal and international levels.</p>

<p>I thought it was interesting when DJI began enforcing the recommendations I get in the dashboard for my drones, and requiring that I update my drones, RC controller, and mobile applications to reduce their liability regarding what I an actually doing with my devices. However, locking down drones so people can’t modify, augment, or fix their own drones is a whole other layer to this discussion that isn’t just about stopping ISIS from strapping bombs to their drones, it is also about maintaining sovereignty over their creations, and limiting what we can do as owners when it comes to fixing our devices. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/06/nebraska-farmers-right-to-repair-john-deere-apple">We already see the right to fix conversation bubble up in the John Deere ecosystem</a>, but it is something we will continue to see showing up in IoT ecosystems across many different business sectors.</p>

<p><a href="http://kinlane.com/2017/01/26/the-digital-things-that-happen-in-the-privacy-of-our-homes/">The bold entry into our homes and lives that IoT device manufacturers are making amazes me</a>, but what amazes me even more is how consumers allow this to happen with little resistance. This is another outcome from the drone sector I believe we’ll see more of, is drone operators standing up to defend their right to fix, as well as push back own data, content, an algorithmic ownership over what is produced using devices. Sadly consumers do not understand the value of their data, but hobbyists and commercial operators of drones, and hopefully other devices, do see the value of it, and will begin to shift the balance when it comes to who is profiting off the data our devices are generating.</p>

<p>There will be many technical, business, and political lessons to be learned from the drone space in coming years. I’m strangely thankful that my <a href="http://dronerecovery.org">Drone Recovery project</a> happened, because before that summer I really was not interested in drones, but now I’m not just interested, I own three drones, and have an active interest in understanding what manufacturers like DJI are doing. I’m feel that what DJI is doing with their platform will set a precedent (good and bad) for other IoT operators to follow–something I’ll be keeping a close eye on.</p>

<p>I run the entire front-end of my online presence using Github. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">All my API Evangelist research lives as open repositories on Github, with the website running Jekyll, hosted on Github Pages</a>. My front-end is all HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, that leverages YAML data, and displayed using <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a>. It provides me a nice way to offload the public side of my operations to Github.</p>

<p>I am increasingly doing this with all of my data, by publishing it as YAML, and rendering a dynamic (static) API representation in JSON–all done with the same approach I’m using to publish my website(s). <a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/">You can get at all of the data I use across my API research in a single API Evangelist developer portal</a>, which just aggregates all of the JSON APIs I’ve published across my network almost 100 Github repositories, and supporting sites.</p>

<p>Another thing I’m experimenting with is publishing simple JavaScript functions to individual pages within Github repositories. These scripts do a range of things from pulling items I’ve curated from <a href="https://developer.feedly.com/">the Feedly API</a>, fresh data from Google Sheets that I am using as data stores, and a variety of other jobs across my network of research sites, data projects, and API tooling. Some of these scripts I’m running manually, while others I run on a variety of schedules using <a href="https://www.easycron.com">EasyCron</a>.</p>

<p>The approach definitely has some significant limitations, but I find that I’m able to get quite a bit done with JavaScript by pulling data from external APIs and other feeds, and using each Github repo as storage, and the Github API as the read/write layer for this storage. I do not store any API keys, tokens, or other secrets in the Github repositories, I’m passing them all in via the URL, which isn’t the most secure, and could in theory be abducted in transit even though I’m using SSL–something I’d like to improve upon by passing a single token to unlock a private store. I have access to external systems via APIs, storage and compute via Github, and I can control everything through variety of functional JavaScripts I maintain using Github, and keep indexed using APIs.json.</p>

<p>It is becoming a kind of poor man’s serverless. I’m going to keep polishing my approach. Get better with my responses, and my approach to reading and writing data schema to the data storage folder in each of my repositories, which can then be read statically using JSON APIs I’ve pushed from this data, using Liquid. It is a pretty scrappy approach to serverless, but done in a way that takes the servers out of the equation for me, offloading the front-end and back-end work for my network of sites to Github. I am not sure where I’m going with this. Sometimes I get better results from a more straightforward API implementation on my Amazon infrastructure, but I am finding some interesting use cases, and seeing another side-effect I am enjoying–it is making my serverless infrastructure forkable and usable by others.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://matthewreinbold.com/2017/07/04/SiteUpdate/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/matts-blog.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>My friend Matthew Reinbold, formerly of Vox Pop, and now the Lead for the Capital One API Center of Excellence, as well as the maintainer of <a href="http://webapi.events/">web API events</a> has shifted <a href="https://matthewreinbold.com/2017/07/04/SiteUpdate/">his blogging platform to use Github, using Jekyll</a>. Ok, yawn, why is this news? Someone is shifting the underlying platform for their blog. Well, first Matt is one of the leading API practitioners in the space, who is also a storyteller. Second, his approach highlights a set of tools that other API providers should be considering for their API communications pipeline.</p>

<p>Matt is using a pretty potent formula for his communications platform in my opinion, with a handful of essential ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com">Github</a></strong> - Using a Github repository as the open source folder for your website.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></strong> - Using Github Pages to publish the front-end for your website.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></strong> - The content management system that sits in the folder for your website.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a></strong> - The DNS and SSL front-end for your website, complete with analytics.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover</a></strong> - The registrar for the domain which you offload DNS management to CloudFlare.</li>
</ul>

<p>Matt is taking advantage of the benefits of static website development, which some of the benefits are, as Matt describes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SPEED</strong> - There’s no processing server side; posts have already been reduced to the essential atomic units of the web: HTML, Javascript, and CSS. There’s something poetic to me about that.</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong> - While not so much an issue with my own coded CMS, I lived in constant fear of missing a zero-day Wordpress exploit patch and finding myself, along with clients, compromised. Reducing the number of moving parts significantly decreases the places where something might go wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Hosting</strong> - Rather than having to find, research, and deploy to increasingly rare ColdFusion hosts (or port to another language), I can post my content to anywhere that supports HTTP/JS/CSS. hosting. This becomes very compelling given that Github Pages, one option, is free.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the cheapest and quickest way for your API to get a blog stood up, and get publishing stories about the value your API is bringing to the table. This approach isn’t just limited to your developer portal or engineering team blog, this could be for partners, or any API related project that you are running. I publish a static Jekyll blog <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">for each area of my research</a>, and I try to always have one for each of my data, or API tooling project–telling the story of each project that is independent from the API Evangelist blog, providing a static log of everything that has happened.</p>

<p>Github isn’t just a pipeline for code, it can be a pipeline for your communications and storytelling. It also can be a pipeline for your documentation, how-to-guides, and other resources. I’m happy to see Matt putting it to be use. Another thing I like about his post, other than him mentioning me ;-), is that he also mentioned the benefits of this approach over using Medium, which is something I’ve been advising API providers against for some time. In my opinion you are better off publishing your blog like Matt has, and then syndicating to Medium if you want. <a href="https://matthewreinbold.com/2017/07/04/SiteUpdate/">There is a lot more detail available on Matt’s story behind his new blog strategy</a>, I recommend heading over and learning from what he’s done.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/iron-io/Iron-io-Platform_Diagram_V3-05.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.iron.io/ich-bin-ein-evangelist/">I first wrote about Iron.io back in 2012</a>. The are an API-first company, and they were the first serverless platform. I’ve known the team since they first reached out back in 2011, and I consider them one of my poster children for why there is more to all of this than just the technology. Iron.io gets the technology side of API deployment, and they saw the need for enabling developers to go serverless, running small scalable scripts in the cloud, and offloading the backend worries to someone who knows what they are doing.</p>

<p>Iron.io is what I’d consider to be a pretty balanced startup, slowly growing, and taking sensible amounts of funding they needed to grow their business. The primary area I would say that Iron.io has fallen short is when it comes to storytelling about what they are up to, and generally playing the role of a shiny startup everyone should pay attention to. They are great storytellers, but unfortunately the frequency and amplification of their stories has fallen short, allowing other strong players to fill the void–opening the door for Amazon to take the lion share of the conversation when it comes to serverless. Demonstrating that you can rock the technology side of things, but if you don’t also rock the storytelling and more theatrical side of things, there is a good chance you can come in second.</p>

<p>Storytelling is key to all of this. I always love the folks who push back on me saying that nobody cares about these stories, the markets only care about successful strong companies–when it reality, IT IS ALL ABOUT STORYTELLING! Amazon’s platform machine is good at storytelling. Not just their serverless group, but the entire platform. They blog, tweet, publish press releases, whisper in reporter ears, buy entire newspapers, publish science fiction patents, conduct road shows, and flagship conferences. Each AWS platform team can tap into this, participate, and benefit from the momentum, helping them dominate the conversation around their particular technical niche.</p>

<p>Being first with any technology trend will always be hard, but it will be even harder if you do not consistently tell stories about what you are doing, and what those who are using your platform are doing with it. Iron.io has been rocking it for five years now, and <a href="https://medium.com/travis-on-development/what-is-serverless-computing-and-why-is-it-important-3278b4ffe814">are continuing to define what serverless is all about</a>, they just need to turn up the volume a little bit, and keep doing what they are doing. I’ll own a portion of this story, as I probably didn’t do my share to tell more stories about what they are up to, which would have helped amplify their work over the years–something I’m working to correct with a little storytelling here on API Evangelist.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="https://github.com/hslatman/awesome-threat-intelligence">this valuable list of threat intelligence resources</a> and think that the section on information sources should be aggregated and provided as a single threat intelligence API. When I come across valuable information repos like this my first impulse is to go through them, standardize and upload as JSON and YAML to Github, making all of this data forkable, and available via an API.</p>

<p>Of course if I responded to every impulse like this I would never get any of my normal work done, and actually pay my bills. A second option for me is to put things out there publicly in hopes that a) someone will pay me to do the work, or b) someone else who has more time, and the rent paid will tackle the work. With this in mind, this list of sources should be standardized, and publish to Github and as an API:</p>

<p>Ideally, <a href="https://github.com/hslatman/awesome-threat-intelligence">each source on this list</a> would be publishing a forkable version of their data on Github and/or deploying a simple web API, but alas it isn’t the world we live in. Part of the process to standardardize and normalize the threat intelligence from all of these source would be to reach out to each provider, and take their temperature regarding working together to improve the data source by itself, as well as part of an aggregated set of data and API sources.</p>

<p>Similar to what I’m trying to do across many of the top business sectors being impacted by APIs, we need to to work aggregating all the existing sources of threat intelligence, and begin identifying a common schema that any new player could adopt. We need an open data schema, API definition, as well as suite of open source server and client tooling to emerge, if we are going to stay ahead of the cybersecurity storm that has engulfed us, and will continue to surround us until we work together to push it back.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jul 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/power-lines-empty-space_sunday.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>In a 30 year career as a database professional I’ve seen some extraordinary ways in which owning and controlling data is associated with power. Those who have the data leverage it against those who do not have it. Losing control means losing power, so people do whatever they can to stay in control, protecting the spreadsheets and databases at all costs. After 30 years of seeing this play out over and over again, I thought I’d seen it all, but sadly in an API era I’m just seeing new incarnations of data being wielded by those in power.</p>

<p>I recently came across an example where a company was holding back a series of JSON schema for a variety of public datasets, and standards in use as part of some government systems. From what I can tell company had been brought in to handle the systems and open data work a few years back, and with each version of the software and schema they slowly began to maintain tighter control over the schema, while they were also being mandated to be more open with the data–shifting from being controlling over the data, to being controlling of the schema.</p>

<p>They see the ability to be able to validate data, API requests and responses as something only a handful of people should be able to do. If you have the ability to validate, and say, “yes that data or API is compliant”, you are now in a position of power. This groups was mandated to be open with the data, allowing it flow freely between open source and proprietary systems, keeping in sync with laws and regulations, but they had found another way to remain as gatekeeper–I think this is what some folks call innovation, and thinking out of the box.</p>

<p>In my world, it is just another example of how power will always find ways to keep data from flowing, no matter how it learns to be perceived as playing nicely in an open data and API world. Many companies are still playing by the old rules and just hoarding, locking, up and controlling data–refusing to play along in the API game. However it is fascinating to see how power can shape shift and find new ways to protect its interest in this new landscape. After 30 years of doing this I am not surprised, but I do have to call it out when I see it because, well it is not right. Be open and share your schema, and let everyone be able to validate that data is what it should be.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jul 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/periodic-elements.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>In 2017 there seems to be an API for just about everything. You can make products available via an API, messing, images, videos, and any of the digital bits that make up our lives. I still get excited by some new APIs, but APIs have to have real usage, and deliver real value before I’ll get too worked up about them. I’m regularly looking down the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/the-api-driven-marketplace-that-is-my-digital-self/">list of my digital bits</a> thinking about which are the most important to me, which ones I’ll keep around, and the services I’ll adopt to help me define and manage these bits.</p>

<p>This process has got me thinking really deeply about what I’d consider to be the three most important types of APIs in my life:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compute</strong> - In my world compute is all about AWS EC2 instances, but when I think about it, Github really handles the majority of the compute for my front-end, but EC2 is the scalable compute for the backend of my world that is driving my APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Storage</strong> - Primarily storage is all about Amazon S3, but I also depend on Dropbox, Google Drive, and I also put Github into the storage bucket because I store quite a bit of JSON, YAML, and other data there.</li>
  <li><strong>DNS</strong> - apievangelist.com and kinlane.com are very important domains in my world–they are how I make my living, and share my stories. CloudFlare is how I manage this frontline of my world, making DNS an extremely important element in my world.</li>
</ul>

<p>I leverage compute, storage, and DNS APIs regularly throughout each day–making them very important APIs in my existence. However, these are also the essential ingredients of my APIs as well. I consume these APIs, but I also deploy my APIs with these three elements. Each API has a compute and storage layer, with DNS as the naming, addressing, and discovery for these valuable resources in my world. This makes these three aspects of operating online, the three most essential elements in my world–even beyond images, messaging, video, and other elements that are ubiquitous across my digital presence.</p>

<p>It is interesting for me to think about the importance of these elements in my world, as storage and compute were the first two APIs that turned on the light bulb in my head when it came to the importance of web APIs. When Amazon launched Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2, that is when I knew APIs were going to be bigger than Flickr or Twitter. You could deploy global infrastructure with APIs–you could deploy APIs with APIs! <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/the-api-driven-marketplace-that-is-my-digital-self/">I really enjoy thinking deeply about all my digital bits</a>, and the role APIs are playing–regularly reassessing the value of API-driven resources in my world. It helps me think through what is important, and what isn’t–showing the 98% of all of this tech doesn’t matter, but there is a 2% that does make an actual difference in my digital existence.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jul 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openapi/openapi-blue-icons.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’ve been looking through the ecosystems of banking API platforms trying to understand the technical, business, and political approach of banks when it comes to the API conversation. While <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/01/the-sustained-api-storytelling-assault-on-the-banking-industry/">Capital One is definitely leading the conversation in the U.S.</a>, I’ve also been looking to better understand what is happening around the PSD2 banking API conversation in the EU and UK.</p>

<p>I was pleased to find <a href="https://psd2-apiexplorer.openbankproject.com/?ignoredefcat=true&amp;tags=#2_2_0-getCurrentFxRate">OpenAPI present in the OpenBankProject PSD2 API Explorer</a>, as well as leading <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/read-write-apis/">the specification standards conversation over at Open Banking in the UK</a>. The existence of the OpenAPI allows analysts like me to quickly load up the OpenAPI in an API client like Postman or Restlet, and become more intimate with what paths, and definitions are available–developing my awareness of where banking API standards are headed.</p>

<p>OpenAPI is proving to be a great way to facilitate a conversation about an API at the team, as well as industry level. While the learning curve involved with OpenAPI adoption is real, I’m finding it to be an essential diplomatic tool when it comes to harmonizing the industry level conversation around <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my Human Services Data API work</a>. OpenAPI provides a central reference <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/06/15/zooming-out-to-the-100k-level-then-back-to-api-sea-level-with-openapi-and-apis-dot-json/">that business stakeholders can reference at the 100K view, while also enabling developers and architects can discuss at the nitty gritty technical level</a>.</p>

<p>I’m bookmarking all the OpenAPIs I find around PSD2, and I’m on the hunt for more OpenAPIs around FHIR. These are the two leading API standards conversation going on at the industry level, helping define a common API interface within two heavily regulated industries–banking and healthcare. While there is still a HUGE amount of work within these communities to truly achieve the adoption everyone is envisioning, I find the fact that their are OpenAPIs being used as a positive sign. It shows that we are moving towards more substance than just talk, and acknowledges the conversation stimulating powers of OpenAPI, in addition to the potential for delivering API deployment, management, testing, monitoring, SDKs, discovery, and other essential stops along the API lifecycle.</p>

<p>I have been going through <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com/">my API virtualization research</a>, expanding the number of companies I’m paying attention to, and taking a look at industry specific sandboxes, mock APIs, and other approaches to virtualizing APIs, and the data and content they serve up. I’m playing around with some banking API sandboxes, getting familiar with PSD2, and learning about how banks are approaches their API virtualization–providing me with an example within a heavily regulated industry.</p>

<p>AS I’m looking through <a href="https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API/wiki/PSD2-Sandbox">Open Bank Project’s PSD2 Sandbox</a>, and playing with <a href="https://www.sandboxbanking.com/developers.html">services that are targeting the banking industry with sandbox solution</a>, I find myself thinking about <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey">Netflix’s Chaos Monkey</a>, which is “a resiliency tool that helps applications tolerate random instance failures.” Now I am wondering if there are any API sandboxes out there that have simulated threats built in, pushing developers to build more stable and secure applications with API resources.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/products/sandbox/fortisandbox.html">threat detection solutions that have APIs</a>, and some interesting <a href="https://www.joesecurity.org/">sandboxes for analyzing malware that have APIs</a>, but I don’t find any API sandboxes that just have general threats available in them. If you know of any sandboxes that provide simulations, or sample data, please let me know. Also if you know of any APIs that specifically provide API security threats in their sandbox environments so that developers can harden their apps–I’d love to hear more about it. I depend on my readers to let me know of the interesting details from API operations like this.</p>

<p>I’m on the hunt for APIs that have sandboxes that assist application developers think about the resiliancy and security of their applications built on top of an API. Eventually I’d also love to see a sandbox emerge to emerge that could help API providers think about the resiliancy and security of their APIs. I’m feeling like this aspect of API virtualization is going to become just as critical as guidance on API design best practices, but helping API operaters better understand the threats they face as API operators, and quantify them against their API in a virtualized and simulated environment that isn’t going to freak them out about the availability of their production environment.</p>

<p>I’ll keep an eye out for more examples of this in the wild–if you know of anything please let me know–thanks!</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.apicur.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apicurio/apicurio-feedback-loop.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve been playing with <a href="http://www.apicur.io/">Apicurio</a>, the <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/05/30/apicurio-is-the-open-source-api-editor-i-was-looking-for/">open source API design editor I’ve been waiting for</a>, and saw a potential opportunity for design time collaboration, instruction, and feedback loop. When you are designing an API in Apicurio it gives you alerts based upon JSON schema validation of the underlying OpenAPI, providing a nice visual feedback loop–forcing you to complete your API definition until it properly validates.</p>

<p>Visual alerts and feedback based upon JSON schema validation isn’t really new or that interesting–you see it in the Swagger Editor, and many other JSON tooling. Where I see an opportunity is specifically when it comes to an open source visual API design editor like Apicurio, and when the JSON schema engine for the validation responses is opened up as part of the architecture. Allowing users to import and export JSON schema that goes beyond the default OpenAPI schema, which gets us to a minimum viable OpenAPI definition–while this is good, we can do better.</p>

<p>I’d like to see a marketplace of JSON schema to emerge helping API designers and architects push the completeness and precision of their OpenAPI definitions beyond the speed at which the core OpenAPI spec can move, and go in directions, and cover niche definitions that the core OpenAPI schema will never cover. I want to be able to load a schema that will help me push forward my API responses beyond just a default 200. I want to be able to load custom JSON schema crafted by API design experts who have more skills than I do, and learn from them. I want my API design editor to help me take my APIs to the next level, while also be pushing my API design skills forward along the way.</p>

<p>Apicurio takes does a good job at giving plain english responses to validation errors–much better than some tools I’ve used. You can click on the detail of each alert, to get more information about what is going on. I could see this entire structure opened up as part of Apicurio’s architecture allowing custom JSON schema templates that can be be imported, and made more informative with plain english responses, more detail, and even links to learn more about how you can improve your API. Turning the basic validation responses into more of an API design knowledge-base, and even structured curriculum walking you through best practices when it comes to API design, and what is working in the industry.</p>

<p>Just some thoughts as I’m playing with <a href="http://www.apicur.io/">Apicurio</a>. I’m very happy to see this API design editor emerge, and I have been having fun thinking about what is possible when it comes to the road map. I feel a common visual API design interface is an important part of the next step in the evolution of the API sector. Which is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">why I have been advocating for an open source API design editor</a> that any API provider can use to design their APIs, and any API service provider can bake into their services and tooling–standardizing how we all craft and communicate around our API designs. The validation feedback loop during this phase will be an important channel for pushing API designers to do what is right, make their API definitions more complete, while educating them about common API design practices, and building a more literate API workforce.</p>

<p>One question I’m regularly getting from my readers is regarding how you can increase the search engine optimization (SEO) for your APIs–yes, API SEO (acronyms rule)! While we should be investing in API discoverability by embracing hypermedia early on, I feel in its absence we should also be indexing our entire API operations with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and making sure we describe individual APIs using <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a>, the world of web APIs is still very hitched to the web, making SEO very relevant when it comes to API discoverability.</p>

<p>While I was diving deeper into “<a href="https://api-platform.com/">The API Platform</a>”, a VERY forward leaning API deployment and management solution, <a href="https://api-platform.com/">I was pleased to see another mention of API SEO using JSON-LD</a> (scroll down on the page). While I wish every API would adopt JSON-LD for their overall design, I feel we are going to have to piece SEO and discoverability together for our sites, as The API platform demonstrates. They provide a nice example of how you can paste a JSON-LD script into the the page of your API documentation, helping amplify some of the meaning and intent behind your API using JSON-LD + Schema.org.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/14/thinking-about-schemaorgs-relationship-to-api-discovery/">I have been thinking about Schema.org’s relationship to API discovery for some time now</a>, which is something I’m hoping to get more time to invest in further during 2017. I’d like to see Schema.org get more baked into API design, deployment, and documentation, as well as JSON-LD as part of underlying schema. To help build a bridge from where we are at, to where we need to be going, I’m going to explore how I can leverage OpenAPI tags to help autogenerate JSON-LD Schema.org tags as part of API documentation. While I’d love for everyone to just get the benefits of JSON-LD, I’m afraid many folks won’t have the bandwidth, and could use an assist from the API documentation solutions they are already using–making APIs more SEO friendly by default.</p>

<p>If you are starting a new API I recommend playing with “<a href="https://api-platform.com/">The API Platform</a>”, as you get the benefits of Schema.org, JSON-LD, and MANY other SIGNIFICANT API concepts by default. Out of all of the API frameworks I’ve evaluated as part of my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment research</a>, “The API Platform” is by far the most advanced when it comes to leading by example, and enabling healthy API design practices by default–something that will continue to bring benefits across all stops along the life cycle if you put to work in your operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jul 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hashicorp/hashicorp-logo.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I’m not a fan of the unfolding bot universe. I get it, you can do interesting things with them–the key word being interesting. Most of what I’ve seen done via Twitter, Facebook, and Slack Bots really isn’t that interesting. Maybe it’s that I’m old and boring, or maybe because people aren’t doing interesting things. When you hear me complain about bots, just remember it isn’t because I think the technology approach is dumb, it’s because I think the implementations are dumb.</p>

<p>After several dives into the world of bots, looking to understand how bots are using APIs, I’ve found some interesting Twitter bots, and an even smaller number of Slack bots I found to be useful–I have yet to find an interesting Facebook Bot. Honestly, I think it is the constaints of each platform that are incentivizing interesting things to be done, and also the not interesting, and even dangerous things to be done. So I find it interesting when the bot conversation moves to other platforms, bringing with it a new sets of constraints, like <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-the-hashibot-github-bot/">I just saw with a new bot out of Hashicorp</a>.</p>

<p>Hashicorp’s Bot does mundane Github janitorial work for me! This is automation (aka bot) activity I can get behind. I feel like much of the Slack automation I’ve seen is doing things that wouldn’t actually benefit me, and would be creating more noise than any solution it would bring–this is due to how I use Slack, or rather how I don’t use Slack. I’m a HEAVY Github user, and there are MANY tasks that are left undone. Things like tagging repos, README files, licensing, and the other things we either forget about, or just don’t have the time for. You fire up a bot to help me with these things, my ears are going to perk up a bit when it comes to the bot conversation.</p>

<p>In the end, I just need to remember that it is not bots that are boring and dumb–people are. ;-) That includes me. I find the concept of a Github bot infinitely more valuable than a Facebook, Twitter, or Slack Bot. I’m curious to see where Hashicorp takes this, and now that the concept of a Github Bot is on my radar, I’m guessing I will see other examples of it in the wild. I’m hoping this is an area we’ll see more bot development and investment, but I also understand Facebook, Twitter, and Slack have relevance in other peoples world, and that I’m the oddball here who finds Github a more interesting platform.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jul 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://api-insights.qlik.com/#/overview-page"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/qlik/qlik-api-insights.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I saw a blog post come across my feeds from the analysis and visualizaiton API provider Qlik, <a href="https://branch-blog.qlik.com/qlik-sense-api-insights-3e84b61602bd">about their Qlik Sense API Insights</a>. It is a pretty interesting approach to trying visualize the change log and road map for an API. I like it because it is an analysis and visualization API provider who has used their own platform to help visualize the evolution of their API.</p>

<p>I find the visualization for Qlik Sense API Insights to be a little busy, and not as interactive as I’d like to see it be, but I like where they are headed. It tries to capture a ton of data, showing the road map and changes across multiple versions of sixteen APIs, something that can’t be easy to wrap your head around, let alone capture in a single visualization. I really like the direction they are going with this, even though it doesn’t fully bring it home for me.</p>

<p><a href="https://api-insights.qlik.com/#/overview-page">Qlik Sense API Insights</a> is the first approach I’ve seen like this to attempt to try and quantify the API road map and change log–it makes sense that it is something being done by a visualization platform provider. With a little usage and user experience (UX) love I think the concept of analysis, visualizaitons, and hopefully insights around the road map, change log, and even open issues and status could be significantly improved upon. I could see something like this expand and begin to provide an interesting view into the forever changing world of APIs, and keep consumers better informed, and in sync with what is going on.</p>

<p>In a world where many API providers still do not even share a road map or change log I’m always looking for examples of providers going the extra mile to provide more details, especially if they are innovating thike Qlik is with visualizations. I see a lot of conversations about how to version an API, but very few conversations about how to communicate each version of your API. It is something I’d like to keep evangelizing, helping API providers understand they should at least be offering the essentials like a roadmap, issues, change log, and status page, but the possibility for innovation and pushing the conversation forward is within reach too!</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jul 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-deployment.png" align="right" width="30%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I am finally getting the time to invest more into the rest of my API industry guides, which involves deep dives into core areas of my research like API <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">design</a>, and now <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">deployment</a>. The outline for my API deployment research has begun to come into focus and looks like it will rival my API management research in size.</p>

<p>With this release, I am looking to help onboard some of my less technical readers with API deployment. Not the technical details, but the big picture, so I wanted to start with some simple questions, to help prime the discussion around API development.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where? - Where are APIs being deployed. On-premise, and in the clouds. Traditional website hosting, and even containerized and serverless API deployment.</li>
  <li>How? - What technologies are being used to deploy APIs? From using spreadsheets, document and file stores, or the central database. Also thinking smaller with microservices, containes, and serverless.</li>
  <li>Who? - Who will be doing the deployment? Of course, IT and developers groups will be leading the charge, but increasingly business users are leveraging new solutions to play a significant role in how APIs are deployed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Role Of API Definitions</strong>
While not every deployment will be auto-generated using an API definition like OpenAPI, API definitions are increasingly playing a lead role as the contract that doesn’t just deploy an API, but sets the stage for API documentation, testing, monitoring, and a number of other stops along the API lifecycle. I want to make sure to point out in my API deployment research that API definitions aren’t just overlapping with deploying APIs, they are essential to connect API deployments with the rest of the API lifecycle.</p>

<p><strong>Using Open Source Frameworks</strong>
Early on in this research guide I am focusing on the most common way for developers to deploy an API, using an open source API framework. This is how I deploy my APIs, and there are an increasing number of open source API frameworks available out there, in a variety of programming languages. In this round I am taking the time to highlight at least six separate frameworks in the top programming languages where I am seeing sustained deployment of APIs using a framework. I don’t take a stance on any single API framework, but I do keep an eye on which ones are still active, and enjoying usag bey developers.</p>

<p><strong>Deployment In The Cloud</strong>
After frameworks, I am making sure to highlight some of the leading approaches to deploying APIs in the cloud, going beyond just a server and framework, and leveraging the next generation of API deployment service providers. I want to make sure that both developers and business users know that there are a growing number of service providers who are willing to assist with deployment, and with some of them, no coding is even necessary. While I still like hand-rolling my APIs using my peferred framework, when it comes to some simpler, more utility APIs, I prefer offloading the heavy lifting to a cloud service, and save me the time getting my hands dirty.</p>

<p><strong>Essential Ingredients for Deployment</strong>
Whether in the cloud, on-premise, or even on device and even the network, there are some essential ingredients to deploying APIs. In my API deployment guide I wanted to make sure and spend some time focusing on the essential ingredients every API provider will have to think about.</p>

<p>-Compute - The base ingredient for any API, providing the compute under the hood. Whether its baremetal, cloud instances, or serverless, you will need a consistent compute strategy to deploy APIs at any scale.
-Storage - Next, I want to make sure my readers are thinking about a comprehensive storage strategy that spans all API operations, and hopefully multiple locations and providers.
-DNS - Then I spend some time focusing on the frontline of API deployment–DNS. In todays online environment DNS is more than just addressing for APIs, it is also security.
-Encryption - I also make sure encryption is baked in to all API deployment by default in both transit, and storage.</p>

<p><strong>Some Of The Motivations Behind Deploying APIs</strong>
In previous API deployment guides I usually just listed the services, tools, and other resources I had been aggregating as part of my monitoring of the API space. Slowly I have begun to organize these into a variety of buckets that help speak to many of the motivations I encounter when it comes to deploying APIs. While not a perfect way to look at API deployment, it helps me thinking about the many reasons people are deploying APIs, and craft a narrative, and provide a guide for others to follow, that is potentially aligned with their own motivations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Geographic - Thinking about the increasing pressure to deploy APIs in specific geographic regions, leveraging the expansion of the leading cloud providers.</li>
  <li>Virtualization - Considering the fact that not all APIs are meant for production and there is a lot to be learned when it comes to mocking and virtualizing APIs.</li>
  <li>Data - Looking at the simplest of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) APIs, and how data is being made more accessible by deploying APIs.</li>
  <li>Database - Also looking at how APIs are beign deployed from relational, noSQL, and other data sources–providing the most common way for APIs to be deployed.</li>
  <li>Spreadsheet - I wanted to make sure and not overlook the ability to deploy APIs directly from a spreadsheet making APIs are within reach of business users.</li>
  <li>Search - Looking at how document and content stores are being indexed and made searchable, browsable, and accessible using APIs.</li>
  <li>Scraping - Another often overlooked way of deploying an API, from the scraped content of other sites–an approach that is alive and well.</li>
  <li>Proxy - Evolving beyond early gateways, using a proxy is still a valid way to deploy an API from existing services.</li>
  <li>Rogue - I also wanted to think more about some of the rogue API deployments I’ve seen out there, where passionate developers reverse engineer mobile apps to deploy a rogue API.</li>
  <li>Microservices - Microservices has provided an interesting motivation for deploying APIs–one that potentially can provide small, very useful and focused API deployments.</li>
  <li>Containers - One of the evolutions in compute that has helped drive the microservices conversation is the containerization of everything, something that compliments the world of APis very well.</li>
  <li>Serverless - Augmenting the microservices and container conversation, serverless is motivating many to think differently about how APIs are being deployed.</li>
  <li>Real Time - Thinking briefly about real time approaches to APIs, something I will be expanding on in future releases, and thinking more about HTTP/2 and evented approaches to API deployment.</li>
  <li>Devices - Considering how APis are beign deployed on device, when it comes to Internet of Things, industrial deployments, as well as even at the network level.</li>
  <li>Marketplaces - Thinking about the role API marketplaces like Mashape (now RapidAPI) play in the decision to deploy APIs, and how other cloud providers like AWS, Google, and Azure will play in this discussion.</li>
  <li>Webhooks - Thinking of API deployment as a two way street. Adding webhooks into the discussion and making sure we are thinking about how webhooks can alleviate the load on APIs, and push data and content to external locations.</li>
  <li>Orchestration - Considering the impact of continous integration and deployment on API deploy specifically, and looking at it through the lens of the API lifecycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like API deployment is still all over the place. The mandate for API management was much better articulated by API service providers like Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee. Nobody has taken the lead when it came to API deployment. Service providers like DreamFactory and Restlet have kicked ass when it comes to not just API management, but making sure API deployment was also part of the puzzle. Newer API service providers like Tyk are also pusing the envelope, but I still don’t have the number of API deployment providers I’d like, when it comes to referring my readers. It isn’t a coincidence that DreamFactory, Restlet, and Tyk are API Evangelist partners, it is because they have the services I want to be able to recommend to my readers.</p>

<p>This is the first time I have felt like <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">my API deployment research</a> has been in any sort of focus. I carved this layer of my research of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">my API management research</a> some years ago, but I really couldn’t articulate it very well beyond just open source frameworks, and the emerging cloud service providers. After I publish this edition of my API deployment guide I’m going to spend some time in the 17 areas of my research listed above. All these areas are heavily focused on API deployment, but I also think they are all worth looking at individually, so that I can better understand where they also intersect with other areas like management, testing, monitoring, security, and other stops along the API lifecycle.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/3D-Printing/regions/api-regions-global-map-from-google.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I have been revisiting <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">my earlier work on an API rating system</a>. One area that keeps coming up as I’m working is around the availability of APIs in a variety of regions, and the cloud platforms that are driving them. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/04/launch-region-specific-apis/">I have talked about regional availability of APIs</a> for some time now, keeping an eye on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/your-api-access-replicated-into-multiple-regions-around-the-globe-for-additional-charge/">how API providers are supporting multiple regions</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/05/08/regional-availability-when-it-comes-to-api-access/">the expanding world of cloud computing</a> that is powering these regional examples of providing and consuming APIs.</p>

<p>I have been watching <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html">Amazon rapidly expand their available regions</a>, as well as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones">Google</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/">Microsoft</a> racing to catch up. But I am starting to see API providers <a href="https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/#regions">like Digital Ocean providing APIs for getting at geographic region information</a>, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeRegions.html">Amazon provides API methods for getting the available regions for Amazon EC2 compute</a>–I will have to check if this is standard across all services. <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/client/regions">Twilio has regions for their API client</a>, and <a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api/regions">Runscope has a region API for managing how you run API tests from a variety of regions</a>. The role of geographic regions when it comes to providing APIs, as well as consuming APIs is increasingly part of the conversation when you visit the most mature API platforms, and something that keeps coming up on my radar.</p>

<p>We are still far from the average company being able to easily deploy, deprecate, and migrate APIs seamlessly across cloud providers and geographic regions, but as APIs become smaller and more modular, and cloud providers add more regions, and APIs to support automation around these regions, we will begin to see more decisions being made at deploy and run time regarding where you want to deploy or consume your API resources. To be able to do this we are going to need a lot more data and common schema regarding the what geographic regions are available for deployment, what services operate in which regions, and other key considerations about exactly where our resources should operate. This is why I’m revisiting this work, to see what I can do to get API service providers to share more data from either the API provider or consumer side of the equation.</p>

<p>I am considering adding an area of my research dedicated to API regions, aggregating examples of how geographic regions are playing a role in API operations. I’m thinking region availability will be playing just as significant role as <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com">performance</a>, <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com">plans</a>, <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">security</a>, <a href="http://reliablity.apievangelist.com">reliability</a>, and other areas of the API lifecycle when it comes to deciding where you deploy or consume your APIs. It feels like another one of the aspects of API operations that will overlap with many stops along the API lifecycle–not just <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>. One of the areas of the API lifecycle I’m increasingly thinking about that will affect geographic API decisions is <a href="http://regulation.apievangelist.com">regulations</a>, and how governments are dictating what is acceptable when it comes to the storage, transmission, and access of digital resources. It feels like early notions of what the World Wide Web has been for the last 25 years is about to be blown out of the water, with the influences of digital nationalism, regulation, or even the Internet moving off planet, and increasingly driven by satellite infrastructure.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.osha.gov/injuryreporting/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/osha/osha-work-injury-form.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.osha.gov/injuryreporting/">I recently learned that Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued guidance regarding the electronic submission of injury and illness records via an API, from an announcement that they has postponed the availability of electronic submissions for another six months</a>. Regardless of the delay, it is good to see them migrating towards an API-focused approach to allowing businesses to be compliant with safety regulations and reporting guidelines.</p>

<p>Here are the details of the OSHA guidance, broken down into some interesting buckets of guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Who</strong>: Establishments with 250 or more employees that are currently required to keep OSHA injury and illness records, and establishments with 20-249 employees that are classified in certain industries with historically high rates of occupational injuries and illnesses.</li>
  <li><strong>What</strong>: Covered establishments with 250 or more employees must electronically submit information from OSHA Forms 300 (Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses), 300A (Summary of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses), and 301 (Injury and Illness Incident Report). Covered establishments with 20-249 employees must electronically submit information from OSHA Form 300A.</li>
  <li><strong>When</strong>: The requirement becomes effective on January 1, 2017. The new reporting requirements will be phased in over two years. In 2017, all covered establishments must submit information from their completed 2016 Form 300A by July 1, 2017. In 2018, covered establishments with 250 or more employees must submit information from all completed 2017 forms (300A, 300, and 301) by July 1, 2018, and covered establishments with 20-249 employees must submit information from their completed 2017 Form 300A by July 1, 2018. Beginning in 2019 and every year thereafter, covered establishments must submit the information by March 2.</li>
  <li><strong>How</strong>: OSHA will provide a secure website that offers three options for data submission. First, users will be able to manually enter data into a web form. Second, users will be able to upload a CSV file to process single or multiple establishments at the same time. Last, users of automated record-keeping systems will have the ability to transmit data electronically via an API (application programming interface). We will provide status updates and related information here as it becomes available.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the three options available are interesting. Manual website, and a CSV file upload–which is kind of a gateway to API-land, but they will also be providing the real deal when it comes to submitting forms using an API. All government agencies should be migrating towards this approach to handling forms, and OSHA provides us with one more blueprint to point at when convincing government to be more machine readable when it comes to forms–if there is a web form, or PDF form, there should also be an API for submitting as well.</p>

<p>Now that the federal agency is on my radar I will be keeping an eye out for when their API is ready, and maybe even offer some help when it comes to the portal and presence for the API. I like this example because it is a good reference for APIs being used to deliver government forms, but also because it is a good example of API driven regulatory compliance, which I think we need more of. Not because regulations automatically equal good, but because we need regulations and business compliance to be as observable as we possibly can–APIs will be how we do this.</p>

        <p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/webhooks/account-activity"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/twitter-account-activity-api-.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@esfand/twitter-account-activity-api-8c59347380be">I was reading an informative post about the Twitter Account Activity API</a>, which seems like something that should be the default for ALL platforms. In today’s cyber insecure environment, we should have the option to subscribe to a handful of events regarding our account or be able to sign up for a service that can subscribe and help us make sense of our account activity.</p>

<p>An account activity API should be the default for ALL the platforms we depend on. There should be a wealth of certified aggregate activity services that can help us audit and understand what is going on with our platform account activity. We should be able to look at, understand, and react to the good and bad activity via our accounts. If there are applications doing things that don’t make sense, we should be able to suspend access, until more is understood.</p>

<p>The Twitter Account Activity API Callback request contains three level of details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>direct_message_events: An array of Direct Message Event objects.</li>
  <li>users: An object containing hydrated user objects keyed by user ID.</li>
  <li>apps: An object containing hydrated application objects keyed by app ID.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Twitter Account Activity API provides a nice blueprint other API providers can follow when thinking about their own solution. While the schema returned will vary between providers, it seems like the API definition, and the webhook driven process can be standardized and shared across providers.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/webhooks/account-activity">The Twitter Account Activity API is in beta</a>, but I will keep an eye on it. Now that I have the concept in my head, I’ll also look for this type of API available on other platforms. It is one of those ideas I think will be sticky, and if I can kick up enough dust, maybe other API providers will consider. I would love to have this level of control over my accounts, and it is also good to see Twitter still rolling out new APIs like this.</p>

<p>All of this is open to anyone else who wants to publish to it via a Github commit, or via the API when you possess valid Github API token like I do. I publish data using a variety of Github accounts depending on which project or organization I am working on. In its simplest form it is collaborative website development. When you combine with YAML and JSON data, and a Jekyll presentation layer it can become collaborate dashboard publishing, with shared ownership of a forkable data engine. Each player can publish the YAML or JSON they are in charge of, and the Github hosted, Jekyll and Github Pages presentation layer displays as a website, dashboard, or even machine readable, static data feeds in YAML, JSON, Atom, CSV, or another format.</p>

<p>I have a variety of Github templates for managing my network of API research sites, as well as forkable projects that anyone can launch to support open data projects like my <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/adopta-blueprint/">Adopta.Agency blueprint</a>, or a <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">human services API developer portal</a>. It’s not just me doing this, you can find [a forkable example of an API and developer over at the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/06/14/gsa-api-standards-with-working-prototype-api-and-portal/">General Services Administration(GSA)</a>, providing a baseline API definition that other government agencies can follow when launching an API, and be publishing an API developer portal. Github works well for the continous integration and deployment of open data, and API portals, projects, and dashboards that can be managed in a collaborative fashion out in the open, or behind a curtain with a private repository.</p>

<p>I’m working with a handful of API providers to experiment publishing API industry data in this way. Combining the organizations, news, tools, patents, and other data I aggregate from across the API industry with additional monitoring, search, discovery, security, and other relevant data into single project sites, data and API portals, and industry dashboards. I’m looking to draw out more API service providers and encourage them to share data that could benefit the entire community. I’ve been doing this for a while with API definitions, but will be expanding into other areas of the lifecycle, and hopefully encouraging more sharing, and forcing y’all to come out of your siloes a bit, and learn to work together–whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>As I study the world of APIs I am always on the lookout for good examples of APIs in action so that I can tell stories about them, and help influence the way folks do APIs. This is what I do each day. As part of this work, I am investing as much time as I can into better understanding how APIs can be used to help with algorithmic transparency, and helping us see into the black boxes that often are algorithms.</p>

<p>Algorithms are increasingly driving vital aspects of our world from what we see in our Facebook timelines, to whether or not we would commit a crime in the eyes of the legal system. <a href="http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaugust-2017/code-of-silence/">I am reading about algorithms being used in policing in the Washington Monthly</a>, and I learned about an important example of algorithmic transparency that I would like to highlight and learn more about. A classic argument regarding why algorithms should remain closed is centered around intellectual property and protecting the work that gives you your competitive advantage–if you share your secret algorithm, your competitors will just steal it. While discussing the predictive policing algorithm, Rebecca Wexler explores the competitive landscape:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But Perlin’s more transparent competitors appear to be doing just fine. <a href="https://www.cybgen.com/products/casework.shtml">TrueAllele’s</a> main rival, a program called STRmix, which claims a 54 percent U.S. market share, has an official policy of providing defendants access to its source code, subject to a protective order. Its developer, John Buckleton, said that the key to his business success is not the code, but rather the training and support services the company provides for customers. “I’m committed to meaningful defense access,” he told me. He acknowledged the risk of leaks. “But we’re not going to reverse that policy because of it,” he said. “We’re just going to live with the consequences.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And remember <a href="http://www.predpol.com/">PredPol</a>, the secretive developer of predictive policing software? <a href="https://www.hunchlab.com/">HunchLab</a>, one of PredPol’s key competitors, uses only open-source algorithms and code, reveals all of its input variables, and has shared models and training data with independent researchers. Jeremy Heffner, a HunchLab product manager, and data scientist explained why this makes business sense: only a tiny amount of the company’s time goes into its predictive model. The real value, he said, lies in gathering data and creating a secure, user-friendly interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, the folks who want to keep their algorithms closed are simply wanting to hide incompetence and shady things going on behind the scenes. If you listen to individual companies like Predpol, it is critical that algorithms stay closed, but if you look at the wider landscape you quickly realize this is not a requirement to stay competitive. There is no reason that all your algorithms can’t be wrapped with APIs, providing access to the inputs and outputs of all the active parts. Then using modern API management approaches these APIs can be opened up to researchers, law enforcement, government, journalists, and even end-users who are being impacted by algorithmic results, in a secure way.</p>

<p>I will be continuing to profile the algorithms being applied as part of predictive policing, and the digital legal system that surrounds it. As with other sectors where algorithms are being applied, and APIs are being put to work, I will work to find positive examples of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">algorithmic transparency</a> like we are seeing from STRmix and HunchLab. I’d like to learn more about their approach to ensuring observability around these algorithms, and help showcase the benefits of transparency and observability of these types of algorithms that are impacting our worlds–helping make sure everyone knows that black box algorithms are a thing of the past, and the preferred approach of snake oil salesman.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://portlandfoodcartadventures.com/2013/01/23/burger-guild-food-cart-a-portland-food-cart-review/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/burger-guild-menu1.jpg" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>While working on my feedback to the EFF for the first response to the Oracle v Google API copyright case, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">one of the stories I published used the restaurant menu as an analogy for API copyright</a>. This example was used in the most recent response by Google’s lawyers as they defended themselves in court, and as I’m working on my API patent research, I wanted to revisit this analogy, in the same way, helping focus attention on why API patents are such a bad idea.</p>

<p>Building on my previous analogy, as a restaurant, imagine your restaurant specialty is delivering meat-centric dishes. Your burgers and steaks are da bomb! You literally have several “secret sauces”, some unique preparation processes, as well as some very appealing ways of naming and describing your dishes. Not that different from many API providers, who have some “secret sauces”, some unique process, as well as some very appealing ways of naming and describing the very useful APIs they are offering.</p>

<p>In regards to copyright, why would you want to lock up the naming and ordering of what you are offering? Even if your competitor copies the exact wording on their menu (documentation), their burgers and steaks do not have your secret sauce or unique processes. Also, why would you want to burden food delivery services from aggregating your menu (documentation) alongside other restaurants using copyright? Don’t restrict how the local paper or food rag can reference your menu (documentation), and publish it on and offline–it is unnecessary and will do nothing to protect your business.</p>

<p>In regards to patents, why would you want to lock up the menu to your burgers and steaks alongside your secret sauce(s) and unique process? Could you imagine if McDonalds sued everyone for patent infringement because they had a burger section on their menu? Someone comes up with a unique burger, and now nobody can have a specific meat dish sections on their menu? The menu and the ingredients of your recipe shouldn’t be included in your patent. If your process is truly that unique, and remarkable, then patent that, you shouldn’t be locking up the ingredients, and the ways of naming, describing, and providing a menu (documentation) for your dish (APIs).</p>

<p>I am not anti-patent (well almost), but am 100% anti API patent. APIs are not your secret sauce or process. The URL, parameters, headers, body, response, and other elements of your API are no more patentable than hamburger, buns, mustard and ketchup are for your killer burger. The reason we have so many API patents is that we have very greedy, short-sighted companies who are just racing to get a piece of the action, and they have been taught that patents are how you make a grab for all the digital dishes on the table, or even might possibly be on the table in the future. They see things moving in a particular direction, and rather than doing those things well, they focus on locking up the doing of that thing.</p>

<p>If you are in the business of patenting your companies technology, please focus on patenting your secret sauce and truly unique processes, not the method for exchanging, selling, and baking your solution into other systems and applications. APIs should not be patented. APIs, no matter how unique they might be, are not the thing you should be defending. You should be making them accessible, and defending the unique and valuable thing you do behind them. Stop including API in your patent filings please, it goes against everything that makes API even works.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/landing"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/census/census-2020-mobile-preparation.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I was reading about what <a href="https://gcn.com/articles/2017/06/16/census-open-data.aspx">the Census is doing to prepare for the 2020 census over at GCN</a>. I’ve been <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/08/22/delivering-value-for-developers-is-first-when-it-comes-to-the-census-bureau-apis/">invested in what they are doing at Census for some time now</a>, so it makes me happy to see where they are headed with their preparation for the 2020 census. From what I’ve read, and what I’ve seen with their existing API efforts, they have really taken API to heart and are working to bake APIs into everything they do.</p>

<p>According to GCN: Through the site’s application programming interface, users will be able to download and manipulate the data to serve their own purposes; ensuring that the API can drive all of data.census.gov’s core functions means outside users will have more power as well. “The more that we make this API capable, then we can serve our customers better by providing them with ways to extend the API in their own platforms for their customer base” – said Census Bureau Chief Data Officer Zach Whitman. Continuing to show that the folks at Census get APIs.</p>

<p>The Census Bureau is the most important API out there for helping us understand the people of the United States, and how the economy is working, or not working for us. <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/landing">When you look at the landing page there are working on in preparation of the 2020 Census you can tell they continue to work hard to find new ways of exploring and visualization the huge amount of data they have gathered through the censuses of the past</a>. I’m glad the Census Bureau has been on their API journey for several years now, as what they have learned will go a long way towards making the 2020 census make a more meaningful impact.</p>

<p>APIs are not just about providing access to data. They are also about allowing many 3rd parties to add, update, as well as access and put to use data. Having the infrastructure and practice will contribute to a more collaborative and interactive census in 2020. Allowing local and regional players to actively play a role in the census as it plays out. What the Census teams have learned over the last couple of years operating their API platform will improve the results and the reach of the 2020 census in a way that will make it inclusive and relevant for the average citizen across the country.</p>

<p>I’ve met the Census data and API teams, I’m not worried about their preparation for the 2020 census. I do worry about whether or not they will have the resources they need to get the job done. With current discussions around funding the agency, as well as supporting the proper leadership at the agency. Like every other API effort I’ve come across it, the success of the 2020 census won’t just be a technical thing, it will also be about having the right business and political platform to ensure APIs are done right and are serving all stakeholders–which in the case of the 2020 Census includes every citizen in the United States.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-documentation-unistats.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>My friend David Kernohan (<a href="https://twitter.com/dkernohan">@dkernohan</a>) emailed me the other day asking me for some advice on where to get started working with some data APIs he had been introduced to. This is such a common question for me, and surprisingly seven years into API Evangelist they are questions I still do not have easy answers for. Partly because I spend the majority of my time writing about providing APIs, but also because API consumption is often times inconsistent, and just hard.</p>

<p>David provided me with two sources of data he wanted to work, which I think help articulate the differences between APIs, that can make things hard to work with when you are just getting started with any API. Let’s break down the two APIs he wants to work with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>UNISTATS</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Description: Compare official course data from universities and colleges.</li>
      <li>URL: <a href="http://dataportal.unistats.ac.uk/Pages/ApiDocumentation">http://dataportal.unistats.ac.uk/Pages/ApiDocumentation </a></li>
      <li>Details: It is an API with 8 separate paths to get what you need.</li>
      <li>Resources: Institution, Course, Stages, Accreditations, Locations, Statistics</li>
      <li>Data Type: XML &amp; JSON</li>
      <li>Authentication: Basic Auth</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) Register of Higher Education Providers</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Description: The HEFCE Register is a searchable tool that shows how the Government regulates higher education providers in England.</li>
      <li>URL: <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/data/">http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/data/</a></li>
      <li>Details: Downloadable files with 6 urls available.</li>
      <li>Resources: Providers, Courses</li>
      <li>Data Type: XML, CSV</li>
      <li>Authentication: Auth: NONE</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here you have two sources of data that overlap. One is actually an API, which you can change paths, parameters, and get different JSON or XML results. The other is just a download of an XML or CSV file. One has authentication using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">BasicAuth</a>, which is a standard way of logging into websites, which often is reappropriated for accessing web APIs. You can start to see why API consumption can become pretty overwhelming, pretty quickly.</p>

<p><strong>CSV Is Easier</strong>
So where do we start? Well with the HEFCE downloads you get the results in CSV, something you can quickly upload into a spreadsheet and get to work. This is pretty straightforward data 101 stuff, making CSV and the spreadsheet still number one when it comes to working with data–a wide audience. However, the core dataset David wanted to work with from UNISTATS is an API, with JSON and XML returned. I know us API folk like to think of APIs as opening up access to data, but this chasm is one that many folks aren’t going to be able to step over.</p>

<p>XML is Harder
Let’s begin with the pulling a list of institutions in XML. Before I can get at the data <a href="http://dataportal.unistats.ac.uk/Account/Register">I need to sign up for an account</a>. After signing up I am given a key which I can use to authenticate the first time I try to load the URL <a href="http://data.unistats.ac.uk/api/v3/KIS/Institutions.xml">http://data.unistats.ac.uk/api/v3/KIS/Institutions.xml</a>–there are <a href="http://dataportal.unistats.ac.uk/Pages/ApiAuthentication">more details about authentication</a> as part of their documentation. As soon as I download this file, I double click on it to see which application will try to load it–Microsoft Word happily steps forward to assume the responsibility. However, it does me little good, and just loads a big XML blog in a documentation–what do I do with that? Next, I try with Microsoft Excel with the same results. Google Drive gives me the same response, uploads as XML, and loads as a blog with no recognition by Google Docs or Spreadsheet. So what now?</p>

<p>We have a set of CSV files, and potentially a set of XML files, after making our way through each available path of the UNISTATS API. We need to get the XML into Google Sheets, or Microsoft Excel. The CSV is easy, the XML is hard–we will need to convert from XML to CSV. We could accomplish this with the <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093342?hl=en">Google Sheets importXML function</a>, but because the API requires authentication it would need some programming–I wanted to keep this code free if possible for now. We are able to authentication with the UNISTATS API via our browser and download the XML with this API, so writing code, even a Google Script seems over the top.</p>

<p><strong>XML To CSV Conversion</strong>
I recommend using a simple tool like <a href="http://www.convertcsv.com/xml-to-csv.htm">XML To CSV Converter</a>, and not overengineering this time. You can just download the XML returned from the UNISTATS API, save to desktop and upload to the XML to CSV Converter to get the CSV edition. Then the data from the UNISTATS API and the HEFCE downloads, all CSV format now can be uploaded to Google Sheets, or imported into Microsoft Excel for working with. This process can be repeated as necessary, whenever the data is updated on each of the sites–no coding necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Reusing This Process For Future APIs</strong>
This process worked with these two APIs. Next time you are working on a project the APIs could have different types of paths available, returning XML, JSON, CSV, or other configuration. They might have different types of authentication requiring API keys as a parameter, or maybe even OAuth–raising the bar even higher when it comes to connecting. Most importantly, sometimes the data returned might not be neat columns and rows, and not be compatible with working within a spreadsheet. Many APIs return “flat” data like we encountered this round, but an increasing number of APIs are returning much more structured forms of data that won’t simply import into a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>For this API exercise, we were able to take care of business using the browser. We were able to download the CSV, and the XML from the API using the browser as a client–no coding necessary. This is a really important element of understanding APIs. Websites return HTML for browsers to show to humans, and web APIs return XML, JSON, CSV, or another machine readable format for use in ANY application–in this case, it was a spreadsheet that will help us take things to the next level and figuring out what we want to do next with this data, to make sense of things.</p>

<p><strong>Look At Leading API Clients – No Code Necessary</strong>
For future API projects, I recommend taking a look at the <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, or <a href="https://restlet.com/modules/client/">Restlet API client</a>. Which will help act as a client for working with simple, and more complex APIs–helping you with authentication, headers, and other aspects of consuming a diverse range of APIs. These clients allow you to connect to APIs, and work with the XML, JSON, CSV, and other responses you will receive. Of course you will still have to download, convert, and upload resulting data into whatever application you intend to work with data within. These are simply clients, not applications that will help you transform, analyze, visualize, and make sense your data–it is up to you to do this.</p>

<p><strong>Some Final Thoughts On API Consumption</strong>
Despite almost 17 years of evolution web API consumption is still hard, and in the realm of programmers. Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel have tools to help you pull in data from APIs, but authentication and complex data structures will always be an obstacle in this environment. For more complex API integrations I recommend adopting an API client like Postman or Restlet, which will augment Google and Excel spreadsheets in your toolbox. Beyond that, I encourage using Github for publishing CSV, JSON, or YAML that is returned from APIs, and telling stories around the data using Github Pages. Github has been working hard to build in features for working with CSV, JSON, and YAML data, again making it possible to work with data returned form APIs with no, or minimal coding–Github employs <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which in turn uses <a href="https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/filters/string-filters">Liquid</a> + HTML, but is something totally still within the realm of non-programmers.</p>

<p>Learning how to consume APIs is a journey, not a destination. APIs come in many shapes and sizes, but if you grasp the basic of the web, and have some of the right tools in your toolbox, you can navigate them and put them to work. I’m going to work on some more Google Spreadsheet examples, as well as some Postman and Restlet examples, using some of the most common APIs out there like Twitter, Flickr, and others. I’ll check back with David in a couple weeks to see how he is doing when it comes to onboarding with the APIs he has targeted for this project, and see where I can help him in his journey.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/27/the-open-service-broker-api/">The Open Service Broker API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://openservicebrokerapi.org/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-service-broker-api/osbapi_logo_concept3_wtm.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 20px;" /></a></p>
<p>Jerome Louvel <a href="http://apis.how/5ytnitnakm">from Restlet</a> introduced me to <a href="https://openservicebrokerapi.org/">the Open Service Broker API</a> the other day, a “project allows developers, ISVs, and SaaS vendors a single, simple, and elegant way to deliver services to applications running within cloud-native platforms such as Cloud Foundry, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. The project includes individuals from Fujitsu, Google, IBM, Pivotal, RedHat and SAP.”</p>

<p>Honestly, I only have so much cognitive capacity to understand everything I come across, so I pasted the link into my super secret Slack group for API super heroes to get additional opinions. My friend James Higginbotham (<a href="https://twitter.com/launchany">@launchany</a>) quickly responded with, “if I understand correctly, this is a standard that would be equiv to Heroku’s Add-On API? Or am I misunderstanding? The Open Service Broker API is a clean abstraction that allows ‘services’ to expose a catalog of capabilities, as well as the ability to create, use and delete those services. Sounds like add-on support to me, but I could be wrong[…]But seems very much like vendor-to-vendor. Will be interesting to track.”</p>

<p>At first glance, I thought it was more of an aggregation and/or discovery solution, but I think James is right. It is an API scaffolding that SaaS platforms can plug into their platforms to broker other 3rd party API services. It allows any platform to offer <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/extending-heroku">an environment for extending your platform like Heroku does</a>, as James points out. It is something that adds an API discovery dimension to the concept of offering up plugins, or I guess what could be an embedded API marketplace within your platform. Opening up <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale</a> and private label opportunities for API providers to sell their warez directly on other people’s platforms.</p>

<p>The concept really isn’t anything new. I remember developing document print plugins for Box back when I worked with the Mimeo print API in 2011. <a href="https://openservicebrokerapi.org/">The Open Service Broker API</a> is just looking to standardize this approach so hat  API provider could bake in a set of 3rd party partner APIs directly into their platform. <a href="http://plugin.apievangelist.com/">I’ve recently added a plugin area to my API research</a>. I will add the Open Service Broker API as an organization within this research. I’m probably also going to add it to my <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery research</a>, and I’m even considering expanding it into an API marketplace section of my research.  I can see add-on, plugin, marketplace, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API brokering like this grow into its own discipline</a>, with a growing number of definitions, services, and tools to support.</p>

<p>I was reading <a href="https://blog.runscope.com/posts/tutorial-copying-runscope-environments-using-runscope-api">the post from Runscope on copying environments using their new API</a>. I was looking through the request and response structure for their API, it looks like a pretty good start when it comes to what I’d call API environment portability. I’m talking about allowing us to define, share, replicate, and reuse the definitions for our API environments across the services and tools we are depending on.</p>

<p>If our API environment definitions shared a common schema, <a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api/environments">and API like Runscope provides</a>, I could take my Runscope environment settings, and use them in my Stoplight, <a href="https://restlet.com/modules/client/">Restlet Client</a>, Postman, and other API services and tooling. It would also help me templatize and standardize my development, staging, production, and other environments across the services I use. Assisting me in keeping my environment house in order, and also something that I can use to audit and turn over my environments to help out with security.</p>

<p>It is just a thought. An API environment API, possessing an evolving but common schema just seems like one of those things that would make the entire API space work a little smoother. Making our API environments exportable, importable, and portable just seems like it would help us think through when it comes setting up, configuring, managing, and evolving our API environments–who knows maybe someday we’ll have API service providers who help us manage our API environments, dictating how they are used across the growing number of API services we are depending on.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Runscope and Restlet are API Evangelist partners.</p>

<p><a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/#Patents">I made my API patent inventory a little more explorable this week</a>, allowing me to more easily discover new and interesting patents that will affect the world of APIs, which I can include in my research. An interesting patent from eBay quickly floated up to the top as a questionable idea for a patent.</p>

<p><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;S1=09576314&amp;OS=09576314&amp;RS=09576314"><strong>Adapting legacy endpoints to modern APIs:</strong></a></p>

<p>Example methods and systems are directed to adapting legacy endpoints to modern application protocol interfaces (APIs). A legacy endpoint may provide a powerful and complex API. A modern application may desire access to the legacy endpoint. One or more layers may be added between the modern application and the legacy endpoint. Each layer may provide a different API. These layers of APIs may transform the interface from a powerful and complex interface to a more limited but simpler and easier to use interface. In some example embodiments, a proxy layer, an adapter layer, a facade layer, and a service layer may be used.</p>

<p>Adapting legacy endpoints to modern APIs is a fundamental aspect of doing APIs in the first place. It is something that is useful and completely obvious. This is one of those patents that makes me question the competency of folks reviewing patents at the USPTO. If you at all are acquainted with the concept of web APIs, you know that this is something that is already done, and not worthy of the non-obvious aspect of being a patent.</p>

<p>APIs have no place in patents. I think this patent pretty clearly shows the system is broken, and the reasons why many companies are filing patents have reached an unhealthy level, as well as how broken the USPTO is. If they are approving a patent for adapting legacy endpoints to modern APIs in 2016 and 2017, they are pretty out of touch with the digital world that is unfolding around us.</p>

<p>I’ve been migrating from my own homebrew CMS system over the last couple of weeks, ditching it for a variety of existing services, balancing my operations across a diverse set of platforms I’ve identified as useful. I’m using Github and Jekyll to manage my content system, storing thinks like blog, news, notes, and patents there. Github repos are well suited for storing this type data for free (if it is public), and Jekyll is well suited for helping me manage small to large repositories of content I need to use across my platform.</p>

<p>This last week I migrated 60K patents I had filtered out of all the <a href="http://patents.reedtech.com/pgrbft.php">XML dumps of patents I downloaded</a>, between the years of 2005 and 2016. I filtered out any patent with API or application programming interface in the title, abstract, or body of the patent. Once done importing, I clean up the body a little bit and publish each one as a Jekyll post within a Github repo. I had to break them down by year, as Github started getting wonky after 10K file, but the Jekyll structure works well for managing up to 10K patents. Once committed, I find the Jekyll post and data structure pretty easy to navigate and use for some API storytelling.</p>

<p><a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/#Patents">I like having the full listing of title and abstract available to search in a single public HTML page</a>. I have also started publishing keyword filters for each area of my research. It is taking me a while to build the index for each JSON API, but it is allowing me to quickly get at <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/#Patents">cached searches for machine learning, API management</a>, and other patents that affect the areas of the API lifecycle I’m keeping a close eye on. I will keep adding filters and enhancing the ones that I have, but ultimately it takes me reading a large number of patents and then actually tagging each one, that will help me build a useful API patent catalog.</p>

<p>I feel that these relevant patents help tell an important story about each layer of the API lifecycle. Patents add another dimension to the story of what is going on when it comes to API design, deployment, management, discovery, and other areas that are growing in 2017, and in coming years. The products, services, and tooling I track on from organizations included in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">my API lifecycle research</a> paint a significant part of the picture, but I feel that patents pull back the curtain just a little bit more when it comes to what companies are thinking. I will keep processing new files from the USPTO every couple of weeks, evolving my filters, and tagging patents for better recall in my API patent storytelling.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/industry/industry-work-group.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Along with the growth of industry level API events for machine learning, healthcare, and beyond, I’m starting to see the emergence of more API specific working groups, something I’ve been asking for, for some time now. The API universe is expanding and we will need API specialists with domain expertise to help push forward the conversations in leading industries like healthcare, banking, education, transportation, and beyond.</p>

<p>I’ve been keeping an eye out for any movement within industries beyond <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html">FHIR</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/consumer-finance-and-payments/payment-services_en">PSD2</a>, and now I”m adding three more efforts to my list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence - <a href="https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/english/info/media_center/pr/2017/0623_00.html">NTT DOCOMO’s new docomo AI Agent Open Partner Initiative</a> to facilitate collaborative development of all-new offerings implemented with a service-agnostic, device-agnostic speech interface based on AI Agent API, a newly developed artificial intelligence (AI) application programming interface (API) that DOCOMO plans to incorporate into a new AI agent service to be launched in early fiscal 2018.</li>
  <li>Payments - <a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/api-standardization-industry-group">The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) API Industry Standardization Group</a> looking to “help improve the safety and transparency of transactions, increase efficiencies and speed of communications, and enhance support of payments innovations.”</li>
  <li>Hospitality - <a href="http://www.htng.org/?page=ActiveWorkgroups">The Hospitality Technology Next Generation (HTNG) API Registry</a> looking to address a number of inefficiencies in the Hospitality API space, including finding potential technology partners whose products and/or services that could add value to an hotelier’s offerings, by creating a registry of Hospitality API’s to help modernize this space.</li>
</ul>

<p>These three efforts provide some interesting models for how companies and existing industry organizations are stepping up to provide leadership when it comes to API definitions, standards, and discovery in a particular business sector. There are no signs of whether these organizations will get off the ground and become sustainable, or that their stewards understand the wider API space, and have their industries best interest in mind. It does provide us with a glimpse at what is coming though, and the opportunity for companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies to step up and take the lead when it comes to API standards.</p>

<p><a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">I am taking my Open Referral Human Services API work which helps lead the discussion around the 211 API standard</a>, while also looking to help my friend Phil Ashlock move forward <a href="http://www.open311.org/">the Open311 standard</a> in a similar fashion. These are community efforts that are looking to help standardize how municipal agencies and organizations share information. I’m hoping to take this work, and merge with what I’m seeing in other industries and eventually establish a blueprint that anyone looking to start an API standards organization can take and put to work–hopefully, it is something that will forkable and deployable using Github like any API project should be.</p>

<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/07/a-conference-focused-on-machine-learning-apis/">I wrote about a machine learning specific API event a couple weeks back</a>, and today I wanted to highlight the growth of conferences dedicated to <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/">FHIR, or the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources</a>. FHIR is larger than just it’s API, but it is one very important example of how APIs and open industry API specifications can help move forward the API conversation in large industries.</p>

<p>As part of my healthcare API research, I bookmarked <a href="https://www.fhirdevdays.com/">HL7 FHIR DEVDAYS 2017</a>, a conference dedicated to standardizing healthcare APIs, and increasing interoperability across the global healthcare system. I went through <a href="https://www.fhirdevdays.com/schedule/">the three-day schedule for the conference</a>, following speakers on Twitter, and learning more about what being presented when it came to healthcare interoperability–expanding my awareness of what is going on when it comes to connecting healthcare systems and pushing forward this important API definition.</p>

<p>FHIR is right there with <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/regulatory-technical-standards-on-strong-customer-authentication-and-secure-communication-under-psd2">PSD2 for banking</a>. While not perfect examples, they are the two most significant examples we have when it comes moving forward an API standard for a large industry that are critical to our society. I don’t have the time to become an expert on every detail of FHIR or PSD2, but I do think it is important as an API professional to understand what is going on in these communities. Much like we’ve done with the API sector with the <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conferenc</a>, we are going to need more industry level API-focused conferences to emerge, helping industries come together and hammer out a common API definition, as well as the services and tooling that will be putting these definitions to work on the ground across the API economy.</p>

<p>As we find ourselves darker times when it comes to transparency within the federal government in the United States, I’m always on the hunt for any positive signs of transparency at the other levels of government. I can usually depend on my friends <a href="https://socrata.com">over at Socrata</a> to help out, and <a href="https://socrata.com/blog/douglas-county-open-budget-invites-public-explore-annual-budget/">they came through this week with a story on Douglas County, Kansas publishing their budget online</a>.</p>

<p>“This week, Douglas County, Kansas, home to 117,000 residents, launched an <a href="http://budget.douglascountyks.org/">Open Budget site</a>, which provides the public with access to one of the county’s most crucial documents: the annual operating budget.” Jill Jolicoeur, Assistant to the County Administrator stated that “our goal is for Open Budget to replace the time-intensive process of developing and publishing the annual budget in a hard-copy format.” Open data and APIs is one way for resource-strapped companies can open things up, allowing external groups help share the load when it comes to auditing, analysis, visualization, and many other areas county government could use some assistance.</p>

<p>Douglas County provides us with another example of how we can make government more <a href="http://observability.apievangelist.com/">observable</a>. There is no reason that county government can’t open up their budgets like this, and let a little sunlight into the operations. In my experience, the primary reason you want to keep things closed is when you are looking to hide corruption, incompetence, and poor technological and business decisions. I’m concerned with the bar being set by the White House right now when it comes to transparency and observability, but it doesn’t mean we can’t resist at the local level, and leverage open data and APIs to get things done more efficiently–like Douglas County is doing, and <a href="https://socrata.com">Socrata</a> is enabling.</p>

<p>I was talking to a VC about one of my favorite API upstarts the other day, and one of the closing questions I received was if the API upstart had a secret sauce that made their position defensible. To which I responded, no…but they are API first, and API definition-driven in everything they do, so they will ultimately move faster than any competitor can.</p>

<p>Agility is one of the classic things you hear people tell companies regarding why they should be doing APIs. The benefit is definitely overused and overstated in situations it shouldn’t be, but when APIs are fully embraced, and done properly, the agility is real. I’ve seen companies be able to shift, pivot, and add new features in a fraction of the time of their competitors, allowing them to in new ways that nobody had intended just months before–APIs allow for the type of shape shifting you need to remain competitive in today’s environment.</p>

<p>APIs do not automagically mean a company, institution, organization, or agency will be agile by default. Organizationally, and culturally the entity behind an API needs to be in sync with the API frontline, or agility will never be fully realized. However, when you can dial all this in I’ve seen something that is more potent than any secret sauce or proprietary approach, allowing you to move more confidently and flexibly. I don’t think API agility is a competitive advantage that all companies or investors fully grasp, but once they see in action, I think they’ll realize APIs are more effective than locking something up and keeping it secret.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of Jekyll and Github when it comes to managing data-driven projects. All of my research runs on Github, and I use Jekyll to serve up YAML and JSON representations of my research for a variety of purposes. I store all data that supports my research in the _data folder for each research project’s repository. From there I will create HTML, Atom, and JSON representations for use in my API Evangelist storytelling.</p>

<p>When I am referencing any YAML data store I have in the _data folder I just use site.data.[object] to reference it. From there I can loop through collections, filter and show fields and other elements on the page using Liquid syntax. I love having all the data at my fingertips, but I’m thinking about the next step of data management at scale, as I work to build more data-driven repositories, housed within Github organizations, I want to be able to reach outside of each repo, into other repos stored within a single organization.</p>

<p>I would love it if Github allowed me to reference my data within an organization using [org].data.[object]. This way I could reference my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> research within my <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia API</a> research. I have my API industry research segregated by topic for several reasons. Often it is just a logical separator, but sometimes the research is too big to fit into a single repository, and I’ll shard thing by year, topic, or another logical separator. It would be nice if I could reach across the repository line, into other organizations within an organization, or maybe someday reach out into other organizations as well.</p>

<p>Just some thoughts as I’m working with YAML data at scale across hundreds of Github repositories. I handle this cross-repo access using JavaScript currently but would love it if it was natively built into Jekyll, allowing me to publish in a static way. The amount of Liquid YAML and JSON voodoo I could unleash would be pretty huge if I could reach across all my data drive projects and reference in a structured way.</p>

I think pricing tiers worked well to onboard the world with SaaS but for an API-driven world we a lot more flexibility and scalability when it comes to t
he business model.</p>

<p>As a small business I just can’t take another monthly payment, without some deep consideration, and bank account consultation. I’m looking at <a href="https://imageoptim.com/api/pricing">the ImageOptim API</a>, which is already a desktop tool I use, but the opportunity to automate my image optimization is very appealing. However, their entry level pricing tier is $9 a month for $1,000.00 calls. I might be able to add another monthly fee, but it damn well better be generating some value, or directly bringing in some new revenue.</p>

<p>My Amazon bill is always around $350.00, and I just downsized my Dropbox from $75 to $15 a month, and my CloudFlare is up to $75, and on and on. I have a whole list of monthly bills for a variety of services I depend on. The pricing tier based services are almost always the first to go when I have to downsize–Dropbox, gone. However, the ones that let me pay for what I use, tend to actually grow and are sustained. Overall I have about $1K a month to spend on SaaS and API solutions, but increasingly I’m favoring utility-based services over plan-based ones.</p>

<p>I think it is easy for API providers to look at their plans and pricing in a silo, exclusively from their perspective, and by itself the structure makes sense, but when you look at in the context of an entire portfolio of services for a small business, it just doesn’t make a lot of sense when you are using tens or hundreds of services. I know that all you business owners are looking for some stability when it comes to your business revenue, but you know what? So am I…</p>

<p>Here is another patent in my series of API related patents. I’d file this in the category as the other similar one from IBM–<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/06/08/patent-automated-assessment-of-terms-of-service-in-an-api-marketplace/">Patent US 8954988: Automated Assessment of Terms of Service in an API Marketplace</a>. It is a good idea. I just don’t feel it is a good patent idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Title: API matchmaking using feature models
Number: 09454409
Owner: International Business Machines Corporation
Abstract: Software that uses machine logic based algorithms to help determine and/or prioritize an application programming interface’s (API) desirability to a user based on how closely the API’s terms of service (ToS) meet the users’ ToS preferences. The software performs the following steps: (i) receiving a set of API ToS feature information that includes identifying information for at least one API and respectively associated ToS features for each identified API; (ii) receiving ToS preference information that relates to ToS related preferences for a user; and (iii) evaluating a strength of a match between each respective API identified in the API ToS feature information set and the ToS preference information to yield a match value for each API identified in the API ToS feature information set. The ToS features include at least a first ToS field. At least one API includes multiple, alternative values in its first ToS field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I don’t have a problem with a company turning something like this into a feature, and even charging for it. I just wish IBM would help us solve the problem of making terms of service machine readable, so something like this is even possible. Could you imagine what would be possible if everybody’s terms of service were machine readable, and could be programmatically evaluated? We’d all be better off, and matchmaking services like this would become a viable service.</p>

<p>I just wish more of the energy I see go into these patent would be spent actually doing things in the API space. Providing low cost, innovative API services that businesses can use, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/06/19/the-six-dimensions-of-api-patents-I-dwell-on/">instead of locking up ideas, filing them away with the government, so that they can be used at a later date in litigation and backdoor dealings</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/20/unknown-unknown-with-api-security/">I am spending more time thinking about the unknown unknowns when it comes to API security</a>. This means thinking beyond the usual suspects when thinking about API security like encryption, API keys, and OAuth. As I monitor the API space I’m keeping an eye out for examples of what might be security concerns that not every API provider is thinking about. [I found one recently in ARS Technica, about the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) leaking the email addresses through the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/psa-commenting-on-fcc-net-neutrality-plan-could-make-your-e-mail-public/">CC API for anyone who submitted feedback as part of any issues like the recent Net Neutrality discussion</a>.</p>

<p>It sounds like the breach with the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/public-api-docs.html">FCC API</a> was unintentional, but it provides a pretty interesting example of a security risk that could probably be mitigated with some basic API testing and monitoring, using common services like <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>, or <a href="https://restlet.com/">Restlet Client</a>. Adding a testing and monitoring layer to your API operations helps you look beyond just an API being up or down. You should be validating that each endpoint is returning the intended/expected schema. Just this little step of setting up a more detailed monitor can give you that brief moment to think a little more deeply about your schema–the little things like whether or not you should be sharing the email addresses of thousands, or even millions of users.</p>

<p><a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">I’m working on a JSON Schema for my Open Referral Human Services API right now</a>. I want to be able to easily validate any API as human services compliant, but I also want to be able to setup testing and monitoring, as well as security checkups by validating the schema. When it comes to human services data I want to be able to validate every field present, ensuring only what is required gets out via the API. I am validating primarily to ensure an API and the resulting schema is compliant with HSDS/A standards but seeing this breach at the FCC has reminded me that taking the time to validate the schema for our APIs can also contribute to API security–for those attacks that don’t come from outside, but from within.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> <a href="https://restlet.com/">Restlet Client</a> and <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> are API Evangelist partners.</p>

<p>My friends <a href="https://algorithmia.com">over at Algorithmia</a> are up to some good things–<a href="http://blog.algorithmia.com/google-sheets-algorithmia-machine-learning-spreadsheets/">making their algorithms available within a spreadsheet</a>. Algorithmia has created a set of open source scripts and walkthrough to help you inject the algorithms from their marketplace into your Google Spreadsheets.</p>

<p>They have seven useful algorithms to inject into spreadsheets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/timeseries/LinearDetrend">Linear Detrend</a> – removes increasing or decreasing trends in time series</li>
  <li><a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/timeseries/AutoCorrelate">Autocorrelate</a> – used to analyze the seasonality of a time series</li>
  <li><a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/timeseries/OutlierDetection">Outlier Detection</a> – flags unusual data points</li>
  <li><a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/timeseries/Forecast">Forecast</a> – predict a given time series into the future</li>
  <li><a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/Summarizer">Summarizer</a> – creates a text summary by extracting key topic sentences</li>
  <li><a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/SocialSentimentAnalysis">Social Sentiment Analysis</a> – assigns sentiment ratings of “positive”, “negative” and “neutral”</li>
  <li><a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/web/ShareCounts">Count Social Shares</a> – returns the number of times that URL has been shared on various social media sites</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kenburcham/algorithmia-google">The Google scripts are available on Github</a>, thanks to the hard work of Ken Burcham. It provides yet another interesting example of how a spreadsheet can be used as an API client but it also provides an interesting example of how machine learning API providers can get their ML warez in front of the average business user. Developers building applications with your ML APIs is one thing but getting the average business spreadsheet power user to put your ML API to work in their everyday workflow is a whole other world of API integration opportunity.</p>

<p><a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">I have been preaching the spreadsheet to API connection for a while now</a>. I know that many API developers want to do away with the spreadsheet, but I think they would be better off focusing on injecting their API solutions into spreadsheets like Algorithmia is doing. When you are designing your algorithmic-centric APIs, providing access to your machine learning models, make sure you keep your APIs simple and doing one thing well like Algorithmia does, then your ML APIs can be injected into the spreadsheets around the globe that are driving business each day.</p>

<p>Security is the number one concern companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies have when I’m talking with them about doing APIs. Strangely it is also one of the most deficient, and underinvested areas of API operations. Companies are just learning to design, deploy, and manage their APIs, and monitoring, testing, and security are still on the future road map for many API providers I know.</p>

<p>Security is one of the important areas I’ve been trying to find more time and resources to invest into my research, and I’ve been on the hunt for interesting providers to partner with when it comes to defining security as it applies to APIs. There are a number of web and infrastructure security companies out there, but there aren’t enough that are only focused on just APIs. With the number of APIs increasing, we need more eyeballs on the problem, and even more services and tools to stay ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>I finally found a worthwhile partner to help explore API security as part of my regular work as the API Evangelist, a new API security focused startup <a href="https://www.elasticbeam.com/product/#api-behavioral">called Elastic Beam</a>. They are a brand new effort exclusively focused on API security, who are hitting all the buzzworthy areas of the tech space (Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc), while also doing one thing and doing it well–API security. ElasticBeams core products are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.elasticbeam.com/product/#api-behavioral">API Behavioral Security</a> - Keeping an eye on the unknown unknowns when it comes to API threats.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.elasticbeam.com/product/#deep">Deep API Insight</a> - Access insights extracted from data ingested across all Elastic Beam implementations.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.elasticbeam.com/product/#api-security">API Security Enforcer</a> - Actually blocking and providing a smokescreen for threats against an API.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.elasticbeam.com/product/#hybrid">Hybrid Cloud API Security</a> - Plugs into existing API service and infrastructure providers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.elasticbeam.com/product/#secure">Secure MQTT Proxy</a> - Focused on API security when it comes to the Internet of Things.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/elastic-beam/infographic-products.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’ve seen Elastic Beam in action, and have a copy to play with as I’m exploring a variety of scenarios in alignment with my API security research. Elastic Beam is going to invest in API Evangelist so I can pay attention to API security more, producing stories, guides, and white papers, and I’m going to help translate what it is they are offering, and help keep them focused on API security, and doing it well.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.elasticbeam.com">Elastic Beam is live</a>. If you want to talk to them about security let me know, or just head over <a href="https://www.elasticbeam.com">to their website</a>. Also, if there are any specific areas of my API security research you’d like me to focus on, let me know. I’ve been having weekly calls with their team and advising them on their release. We’ll see where the relationship goes, but I’m stoked to finally have someone I can partner with to focus on API security. It is an area that needs more research, discussion, as well as storytelling, to help bring awareness to API providers–this stuff takes time, and we need more smart people on the case as soon as possible.</p>

<p>From the time I’ve spent with them, the Elastic Beam team seems to get the problem, and have invested in the right technology. I’m looking forward to working with them to continue to map out the API security space, identify and share information on the most common threats facing API providers. Stay tuned for more about API security, thanks to the Elastic Beam team.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/tensorflow/kites_detections_output.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was taking a look a<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/object_detection">t the Tensorflow Object Detection API</a>, and while I am interested in the object detection, the usage of API is something I find more intriguing. It is yet another example of how diverse APIs can be. This is not a web API, but an API on top of a single dimension of <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">the machine learning platform TensorFlow</a>.</p>

<p>“The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models.” It is just a specialized code base helping abstract away the complexity of one aspect of using TensorFlow, specifically for detecting objects in images. You could actually wrap this API with another web API and run on any server or within a single container as a proper object recognition API.</p>

<p>For me, it demonstrates one possible way of wrapping a single or cross section of a machine learning implementation to abstract away the complexity and helping you train and deploy ML models in this particular area. This approach to deploying an API on top of ML shows that you can use to APIs to help simplify and abstract ML for developers. This can be done to help satisfy business, regulatory, privacy, security, and other real or perceived concerns when it comes to artificial intelligence, machine learning, or any other digital voodoo that resembles magic.</p>

<p>No matter how complex the inputs and outputs of an algorithm are, you can always craft an API wrapper, or series of API wrappers that help others make sense of those inputs, from a technical, business, or even political perspective. I just wanted to highlight this example of ML being wrapped with an API, even if it isn’t for all the same reasons that I would be doing it. It’s just part of a larger toolbox I’m looking to create to help me make the argument for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">more algorithmic transparency in the machine learning platforms</a> we are developing.</p>

<p>I had ditched my phone last year after being with AT&amp;T for just shy of 20 years. Not having a phone made me realize how much you need a phone number to exist online these days. Facebook, Twitter, Google, all needed me to have a phone number which I can verify from time to time, to keep my accounts active.</p>

<p>In addition to just needing it for an account, I also need it regularly to secure my world via two-factor authentication. Sometimes I need it for SMS, but mostly I just need the authenticator app–both requiring at least having the mobile device in my presence. I’m not very tightly coupled with my phone, but it feels like it increasingly like it is always coupled to me.</p>

<p>I’m guessing that if it isn’t our mobile phones, in the future there will always be at least one device we will be required to have as part of our identity, and be helping us secure both our physical and digital worlds. It isn’t something I enjoy but like pretty everyone else, it is not a cord I am going to be able to cut anytime soon.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-security-unknown.png" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I am trying to wrap my head around the next steps in the evolution of <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">API security</a>. I am trying to help separate some of the layers of what we collectively call API security, into some specific building blocks I can reference in my storytelling. I’m ramping up my API security research as I onboard a new API service provider partner, and will have more resources to invest in the API security discussion.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the easy “Known Knowns”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Encryption - Using encryption across all aspects of API operations from portal to base URL.</li>
  <li>API Keys - Making sure everyone who is accessing an API is keying up and passing along with each request.</li>
  <li>OAuth - Getting more granular with access by applying OAuth when there is access to 3rd party data and content.</li>
  <li>Rate Limiting - Limiting how much of a resource any single API consumer can access using rate limiting.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the first things that come to mind when the topic of API security is brought up. I’d say most conversation begin with encryption, but as someone progresses on their API journey they begin to understand how they can key things up, using OAuth, rate limiting, and other aspects of API management to secure their API operations.</p>

<p>Next, I want to think about some the “Known Unknowns”, things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Freeloaders - People with multiple accounts, and generally aren’t healthy consumers.</li>
  <li>Errors - Errors, misconfigured, and malformed requests, responses, and anything that generally gums up the gears of operations.</li>
  <li>Vulnerabilities - Making sure all known software and hardware vulnerabilities are patched and communicated as part of operations.</li>
  <li>Attacks - Defending against the known attacks, staying in tune with OWASP and other groups who are actively identifying, studying, and sharing attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the things we might not totally understand or have implemented, but they are known(ish). With the right amount of resources and expertise, any API team should be able to mitigate against these areas of security. There is always a lot of work to turn the unknowns into knowns in this area, but they are doable.</p>

<p>Now I want to think a little about the “Unknown Unknowns”, likes like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DNS - What is happening at the DNS level as it pertains to my API security?</li>
  <li>Relationship - Relationship between requests, even if they are using different keys, IP addresses, and other elements–where is the overlap?</li>
  <li>Threats - What information is available to me regarding new and emerging threats that I’m only beginning to see, or maybe my partners and others in same space are seeing?</li>
  <li>Sharing - Are there opportunities to share information and see a bigger picture when it comes to vulnerabilities and threats?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a handful of my initial thoughts on what the unknown unknowns might be. Things that are currently off the radar of my known API security practices. API management seems to dominate and in some cases terminate the API security conversation, but I have the feeling there are numerous other considerations out there that we are not seeing. I’m just looking to begin defining this new bucket of security considerations so I can keep adding items to it as I’m doing my research.</p>

<p>From your perspective, what are the biggest threats out there for API security that many API providers are completely unaware of? I’m looking to keep expanding on this frontline of API security and turn up the heat beneath <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">my research</a> while I have the resources to do so. I feel like the API security conversation has kind of stagnated after the last wave of API management growth, leaving many providers thinking they have everything covered.</p>
