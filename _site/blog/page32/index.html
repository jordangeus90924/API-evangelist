			<p>One API I&rsquo;ve been watching grow and evolve from day one is the Pearson Developer Community. I first wrote about them when Peasron announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content in May of 2011. Then in August 2011 they launched three APIs: Longman Dictionary - The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English is the flagship Longman dictionary FT Press - FT Press provides essential insights from the best business books and original writings by leading business thinkers Eyewitness Guides - The DK Eyewitness Travel Guides show you what others only tell you After Pearson got acquainted with the ins and outs of API evangelism, and supporting the Pearson developer community, they released two more APIs this year: Pearson Kitchen Manager - Pearson Kitchen Manager is a valuable resource for food enthusiasts and chefs alike, featuring a vast collection of recipes from bestselling Pearson textbooks of top culinary schools Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API - The best-selling Pearson Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guide series is the UK's premier quick reference, aide memoire support for health and social care students and professionals while in practice and studying It looks like Pearson is really finding a rhythm with identifying content to make available, as well as the right approach to deploying as APIs. They have 3 more high value publishing APIs available: Penguin Classics API - The Penguin English Library is a collection of 100 of the best novels ever written in the English Language. Classics like Jane Eyre, Dracula and Great Expectations dkimages API - The dkimages API is an encyclopaedic collection of 90,000 high-resolution images Peachpit Visual QuickStart Guides API - With more than 12 million copies in print, Visual QuickStart Guides have been a vital part of the computer book category for years That is a total of 8 APIs endpoints Pearson has made available via their developer center--providing some valuable text and image content...[<a href="/2012/10/28/pearson-sets-example-for-other-publishing-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Code samples in a variety of languages are how API owners help developers understand an API in the language that makes the most sense to them.
Not all developers will understand REST, HTTP and other things you might take for granted.  Very simple code samples will help demonstrate an APIs functionality, making the learning process a hands-on experience.
Github provides a very lightweight tool for publishing API code samples, that can be embedded on any website, called Gists.  You can easily copy / paste a working code sample into a Gist and Github returns a lightweight, embeddable JavaScript that you can use in documentation, blog posts and any where you will need to share with users.
Github Gists can be a much sexier, and easier to implement alternative to html &lt;code&gt; tags. While also allowing easy management and versioning of API code samples alongside Github API SDK repositories.

			<p><em>25 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
The most common use of Github by API providers is to publish API SDK's to the popular social coding platform.  If you look at most of the the top API providers in operation today, you will find they are actively using Github to not just manage and publicize their API SDK's, but actively interact with their developer ecosystem in the process.
Github provides the necessary workflow for initial design, development and publicizing of API SDKs, allowing owners to create separate repositories for web-based SDKs like PHP, Python and Ruby and mobile SDKs for iOS, Android and Windows mobile.
By making API SDK's public repositories on Github you get all the code management benefits of Github, but also make them available for social interaction by your developers.  They will be able to download, fork and potentially commit additions and modifications back to an SDK's repository, allowing owners to harness the creative potential of the developer community.
Active Github repositories for an API are an essential part of any API ecosystem.  If you don't use Github for anything else, make sure you publish your SDK's as a public repository. It will make the development of your client libraries a much more social experience, providing huge benefits for your API.

			<p>I get so busy sometimes my stories pile up. Some only seeing the light of day when I get caught up on research, projects, travels and speaking. On story I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write for almost 3 months now is about APIphany, one of the new generation of API providers. I met the APIphany team in person when I went out to Washington DC in August. The APIphany team was cool enough to come out and support my API Craft meetup in DC, then the next morning I went out to their offices and met the rest of the team. APIphany sees the industry very similar to me, and believe in self-service, pay as you go API services that allow for anyone to innovate around APIs. I&rsquo;ve been watching their progress and they have 3 very cool projects made public so far: Washington Post - Developer area for Washington Post, providing some endpoints including an Issue Engine API, White House Visitors Log API, and the Campaign Finance API Houston Metro - Developer portal for the Houston area, providing public transit in the Houston metropolitan area for bus and rail The Voting Information Project (VIP) - Offering APIs and developers tools to provide voters with access to customized election information, helping them navigate the voting process and cast an informed vote When I met the team in August, they described how they were building out so many custom projects for customers that were API driven, they decided to standardize their approach and offer a product. The APIphany API management solution provides all the standard offerings we are getting used to in the space: Administration Portal Developer Portal Key Management Access Control and Security Subscriptions and Billing Monitoring Analytics and Reporting APIphany also gives you the ability to host the API in a variety of cloud providers, and my favorite is they provide you with an API to manage your API.

			<p><em>25 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
While I was out in Washington DC this week, one of the Presidential Innovation Fellows in my workshop was from the Department of Energy, and shared one of the best examples of APIs delivering value I&rsquo;ve seen in awhile.
The US Department of Energy has developed the Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework (KDF), which is a platform for researchers and engineers from national laboratories, academia, and private industries to upload files, customize information online, and exchange knowledge with each other.
The Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework provides acess to a landmark &ldquo;Billion-Ton&rdquo; bioenergy study on fuel resources, providing a wealth of information from a variety of researchers.   The study generated a large volume of interest, and resulted in numerous requests for raw data disclosure from the researchers.
In response the project deployed a web API, providing direct access to raw data, saving the resources necessary to reach out to researchers as well as the researchers valuable time in processing requests and providing data.
The US Department of Energy estimates they saved $882,000 in operational costs and researchers valuable time by bundling the API with the bioenergy study.
This is why I evangelize APIs.  The US Department of Energy case study demonstrates not just the value of APIs, but how they can actually make government more efficient and save tax payers money.
In addition I strongly advocate that&nbsp;APIs and raw data access should be default for all studies and resulting reports, allowing anyone to dive deeper into the research and provide additional insights.

Out of date API documentation is by far the most common mistake API providers make, and also the number one pain point for API developers.  It makes sense that you will want to keep your API documentation in sync with each version of your API, and one way to handle this is to version them both, using Github.
To use Github for your API documentation, all you need to do is create an single public repository, which you can use to manage HTML versions of your API docs.  By putting your API documentation in its own repository you can keep the version of the API code repository in sync with it's corresponding documentation.
With the API documentation in Github, you can then easily publish to your API area or just allow developers to go directly to the Github repository and browse documentation there.
To help you edit your API documentation, you can use tools like prose.io,&nbsp;which will allow even non-developers to assist in maintaining API documentation, with all changes stored neatly in a central Github repository.
Storing API docs in Github will also make them more portable.  Some developers may wish to download a copy for offline work, or just prefer having locally for their own reference.
With the right approach to managing your API docs with Github, you can easily keep them up to date, in sync with your API, while also making them easily accessible by all API consumers--without much of the headache often associated with managing API documentation.

I spent two hours with a handful of the Presidential Innovation Fellows in Washington DC yesterday.  They were some super savvy folks from a wide variety of agencies and backgrounds including education, energy and health.
During my two hours with them I walked through several areas of  the API industry, from my perspective, including:

History of APIs
API Planning &amp; Design
API Development
Business of APIs
API Service Providers
API Tools, Services, Platforms
Politics of APIs
API Evangelism
What&rsquo;s Next for APIs

You can access my innovation fellows presentation off API Evangelist, I&rsquo;ll leave it up permanently.  It&rsquo;s minus all my commentary and banter, but hopefully it will give you an idea of what I covered.  If you&rsquo;d like a custom presentation on it, let me know and I&rsquo;ll see if I can find a slot to do a Google Hangout.
I had a blast talking to the Presidential Fellows, and I hope that I left them with some value that will help them be successful in their various initiatives.  They are already halfway through their sprint, and have a lot of expectations put on them.
I will be following their progress closely and publish any stories I can on their progress.

			<p><em>24 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>I had a great discussion with a friend who works in federal government yesterday. We were talking about various ways to &ldquo;successfully&rdquo; deploy APIs within the federal government. She gets APIs, understands the benefits, but she had some very realistic perspectives on where API deployment within the federal government can fail. While discussing this with her, we kept coming back to two points: API Garbage Littering the Internet - With some of the tools, making it easier to deploy APIs, the potential to just post meaningless and worthless data sets grows Lack of API Ownership - There are big movements to get APIs deployed, but then very little ownership once its up. Regarding worthless APIs being deployed, I think we can mitigate this by providing some sort of ranking or voting systems for APIs, allowing developers to upvote or downvote and add some critical feedback on what is right, or what is wrong. This will allow the &ldquo;cream&rdquo; to rise to the top, and everything else just disappear from view. Next, her perspective on lack of API ownership after an API is launched, is a very big problem. It is something I see in the public sector all the time. Everyone gets excited about standing up an API, but once it&rsquo;s in the wild, they lose enthusiasm--leaving the API to whither on the vine. APIs will not succeed if they do not have an owner. For technology companies, it might make sense for them to have an API as a product, assemble a team and dedicate resources to the API. &nbsp;Even hire an evangelist or advocate. When it comes to government, maybe we need a different approach. A sort of personal API deployment platform like Socrata API Foundry, that will let anyone publish a dataset as API--allowing any individual to achieve "machine readable by default", as directed by President Obama back in May. By empowering data owners within government to publish themselves, and give them...[<a href="/2012/10/24/a-problem-with-finding-api-owners-in-government/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>While doing the weekly hackathon roundup in September, I noticed an uptick in the number of Windows 8 hackathons that are going on. I decided to reach out to Microsoft and see if I can get more information on what they are trying to accomplish, and see what their perspective is on hackathons. After talking to several people I was directed to a gentleman by the name of Warren Wilbee (@wwilbee), Director of ISV Evangelism at Microsoft. Wilbee is a passionate evangelist, one that isn't just externally evangelizing, he is actively working to evolve internal culture and options about the value of hackathons at Microsoft. When I got on the phone with him, he said the reason I was directed to him is because he had recently circulated an internal memo regarding the makeup and value of hackathons. He feels strong that hackathons are very useful, you get the opportunity to get X number of people into a room, doing exactly what you want--delivering a very direct result. "Hackathons are purpose built", when you put on a hackathon for developers you get to define exactly what you, sending the desired message your company wants developers to receive, says Wilbee. By contrast, sponsoring a hackathon is a very different exercise and value proposition--proceed with caution. The hackathon organizer gets to define the purpose and drive the outcomes. The sponsor will not have access to this value, potentially excluding you from all the marketing or social "halo" produced at the event. Sometimes there are opportunities to offer a prize that will be in-line with the organizers purpose, but just flashing your logo will not deliver much value to your company. When you do put on a hackathon, Wilbee is passionate about it being a "participatory event". Get your people to come and participate, don't just require them to show up, make it part of their responsibility to be involved.

			<p><em>22 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Github&nbsp;is a frequently used service in the toolbox of API owners.  The most common use of Github is for publishing API SDKs in a variety of languages and platforms.  But when it comes to truly being an "open API", some API owners are actually open sourcing their API design using Github.
Open sourcing the design of your API will not be sensible for every provider.  Many companies are looking to ensure developers use their API, maintaining an advantage over competitors.  However in some cases, open sourcing the design of your API is a way to ensure interoperability between partners or among mutliple companies within a certain business sector.
Simple examples of an API design might be for common systems like blogs, news, links, calendars or other API designs that don't deliver any sort of proprietary offerings.  If you are looking to ensure synchronicity between say, the calendar of multiple organizations, developing a single API and open sourcing the design and possibly a version of it in multiple programming languages, might make sense.
With a consistent API design, and code to deploy the API, any organization can download or fork the Github code, deploy the API for themselves--ensuring consistency and interoperability between any deployment. If a single organizations has unique needs, they can extend and commit the code back to Github, allowing the central repository manager to decide if it is a change that should be added to the core offering.
Not all APIs are created equal. &nbsp;Consider the possibility of actually open sourcing your API, the benefits it might bring to others, as well as your organization--they might exceed keeping it closed and proprietary.
This approach to using Github, is by far the truest meaning of the word, "Open API".

As soon as I told her about the event, she said &ldquo;We are in! What do we need to do, to support it!&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m stoked to have Laura kick off the event on Thursday, November 1st with a keynote as well as having Alcatel-Lucent as a gold sponsor.

If you&rsquo;ve never heard Laura speak, I highly recommend making sure you are there.  She always has great insight into the success Alcatel-Lucent is having within emerging markets and the telco space. &nbsp;Also, her talks are always positive, energetic and demonstrate leadership in the space--something I want my daughter Kaia to experience.
During Laura&rsquo;s keynote I&rsquo;m sure we will here more about Alcatel-Lucent's new open source offering, API Grove, as well as their openly licensed API lifecycle and methodology.
Make sure you get registered today, before the event is sold out--there aren&rsquo;t many tickets left. &nbsp;I'll see you there.

			<p><em>20 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>The API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference is kicking off in 12 days in New York City. The event will be keynotes, sessions and panels from over 60 leading individuals across all sectors of the API industry. I&rsquo;ve wanted to have an API industry event that was about ideas, practice and strategy, not just about companies, their products and clients for a while now. This is something that I could never achieve on my own. I just don&rsquo;t have the money or all the connections to bring everyone together. To make API Strategy &amp; Practice happen it took the right partnership. That partnership is with API service provider 3Scale. The 3Scale team views the industry much like I do, that by openly educating people about the benefits of APIs and discussing the technical, business and political challenges we face in the industry--we can truly make change across all business sectors. &nbsp;Allowing all of us to be succesful in whatever products and services we provide. Through the regular discussion I have with the 3Scale team, we discovered our shared desire to have such an API industry event. We discussed what the event would look like, then quickly started figuring out what it would take to make it happen. We felt we both had resources necessary to pull it off, and even though there is a lot of risk, that it was something that had to happen, for the benefit of the industry. Here we are, 8 weeks later, and the event is a reality. I just wanted to say thanks to 3Scale for not just sharing my vision of the API industry, but also partnering with me to make this event a reality. I hope all my readers can make it to the event and participate in the discussions about APIs, platforms, mobile, and how we can all work to solve the biggest challenges in the space. &nbsp;This discussion will allow all of us to make significant...[<a href="/2012/10/20/the-right-partnership-for-the-api-strategy-amp-practice-conference/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>When I set out to put on an API industry event in early 2012, I had grand visions of what it would be. Getting everyone together to discuss the best ideas, approaches the industry has to offer--while also discussing the critical topics such as open APIs, developer rights, monetization, etc. Fast forward 10 months, and the event is a reality, and even though it doesn&rsquo;t exactly look like I imagined, it is damn close--with&nbsp;lots of amazing API discussions. After I announced the event has 60 speakers&nbsp;yesterday, I saw a tweet from Dave Winer (@davewiner): A conference about APIs with only speakers representing corporate APIs. Not one open API, so no interop. Lost.0ox.r2.ly &mdash; Dave Winer â® (@davewiner) October 15, 2012 Now for those of you who don&rsquo;t read entire posts, I&rsquo;m NOT going after Dave. We&rsquo;ve already tweeted back and forth and discussed, and he is supportive. This post is about my feelings and thoughts on "open", and how we can all work together to make sure the industry is as open as possible. First, I don&rsquo;t see things as black and white. When it comes to politics, life or the API industry. To ability to snap our fingers and everything becomes open will not happen. It will be a lot of hard work and be very painful. Next, I can honestly say there isn&rsquo;t anyone else in the space who is dedicated to open APIs as much as I am. Sure Dave is much bigger name and has more history on this, but this is ALL I do. Period. I don&rsquo;t work on anything else. It is my day and night job. I have written constantly about the need for open API building blocks, open API billing and traffic control, all while constantly asking what open even means?

			<p><em>14 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I finished updating the speaker lineup for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference this weekend.  While we still have a couple of panels to finalize and keynotes to announce, the speaker lineup is almost final.
We have spent almost 8 weeks reaching out to leaders across the API industry, soliciting submissions for keynotes, panels and sessions.  It has been a lot of fun taking all the submissions and crafting the most compelling schedule as possible.
It was really important to me that we didn&rsquo;t just&nbsp;discuss the common areas of the API industry, like service providers, REST, etc.  Not that these aren&rsquo;t relevant--they are!  But I wanted to make sure we discuss some areas that are critical to the space, but do not get much airtime.  Topics like API design and API life-cycle methodologies.
I feel it is also critical to discuss where we are going, by covering topics like API automation, aggregation and building of programming frameworks on top of numerous APIs--trends that will allow us leap forward in how we consume and build apps on top of APIs.
In the next two weeks I will be going through our lineup in detail and talking about the various API session tracks like music, social, payments, government and education to name a few prominent session areas.

While I started getting excited about this event back in August, it is really starting to get real.  I&rsquo;m really psyched about how this event has come together.  There will only be 250-300 people at the event, so it&rsquo;s going to be a very intimate opportunity for network with these API industry leaders.
Make sure and register for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference ASAP, and I look forward to seeing you there.

			<p><em>13 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>As part of my research into how to create healthy developer communities, I've been spending time reaching out to organizers of developer meetups in different cities so I can get some insight into what it takes to successfully organize and run a developer meetup. I recently spoke to Jeremia Kimelman (@jeremiak)&nbsp;of Tout, who runs Mobile Monday Developers. Jeremia took over the Mobile Monday Developers with the idea that he would create a meet up format where tech companies could reach out to developers in a non-spammy way. Companies could sponsor workshops and come in to deliver on topics like HTML5 or HTML5 vs Native Apps, and do it in a way that would add value to developers worlds. This is a model that I'm sure many tech companies would drool over, and very often view meetups as a perfect medium for this type of sales pitch. As I reach out to meet up organizers I get the vibe that many of them already get solicited by companies in this fashion--either because they don't respond at all, or by being somewhat hostile to my questions about their meetup. Jeremia was able to grow his meet ups from about 40 to 140 members with this model, but when I asked him if this was a model that could be replicated, he replied, "definitely not". It doesn't create value. It doesn't solve the problems developers face and ultimately will doom your meetup to failure. As platform and API owners it's easy to drink our own kool-aid and think what we are offering is what developers want. Jeremia said it's easy to project your business understanding onto developers, and assume they are concerned with things like monetization and in-app payments, when in reality these things might be the furthest thing from their minds. In an effort to truly deliver value to developers, Jeremia decided to pivot, working to better understand better how to make it a community owned event....[<a href="/2012/10/13/thoughts-on-running-a-successful-meetup-from-jeremia-kimmelman-of-mobile-mondays/">Read More</a>]</p>

The Presidential Innovation Fellows program brings together top innovators from the private&nbsp;sector, nonprofits, and academia with top innovators in government to collaborate on solutions that aim to deliver significant results in six months, while being supported by a broader community of interested citizens throughout the country. The objective of the OpenData Initiatives are centered around: Stimulating a rising tide of innovation and entrepreneurship that utilizes government data to create tools that help Americans in numerous ways Working with the Innovation Fellows is just one areas I&rsquo;m working to change the way our government works using APIs. I strongly feel that opening up our government, and evolving how it operates using web APIs is fundamental in bringing democracy into the 21st century. While speaking with the Innovation Fellows I will cover the usual material I have published here on API Evangelist: History of APIs - Brief overview of the modern web API movement API Building Blocks - The essential building blocks to a successful API API Service Providers - Roundup of the service providers who can help deploy APIs API Tools - Pull together list of tools that can be used to design, deploy and manage APIs Industries - Some of the top industries putting APIs to use Hackathons - How hackathons are being used to drive innovation My intentions are to help share everything I know with the fellows to make sure they are well equipped to execute as part of the OpenData Initiatives.

Lots of big news coming out of Apple's World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC2011) in San Francisco today.
We saw major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion. What really stood out was their new iCloud.
iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.
This means documents you've written, presentations you've prepared are available on any IOS device. You can view and edit the same document, in its latest state, on all your devices. And since iCloud automatically updates any changes you make, you don't even have to remember to save your work. 
iCloud will also have a full set of APIs for developers to take advantage of, allowing them to implement iCloud storage, sync, and backup for documents into any application.
Apple's iCloud represents a continued evolution of the file system from being local to existing on the Internet and available on any device. This means that all design, collaboration, publishing and printing will move off the desktop as well. 
More to come on iClouds role in self publishing and print on demand integration.

			<p>Many folks who encounter API Evangelist think I'm working to evangelize a single API. &nbsp;I field so many questions about this I thought I would address by publishing an API Evangelist mission statement.&nbsp; The mission of API Evangelist is to educate business, nonprofit and government leaders about the value of APIs to their organizations. API Evangelist is made up of four properties: API Evangelist (apievangelist.com) - Business of APIs API Voice (apivoice.com) - Politics of APIs API Stack (theapistack.com) - API discovery and ranking Hack Weekends (hackweekends.com) - Hackathon news and calendar With API Evangelist I strive to be the independent voice for the industry, providing the public with information about API: Building Blocks Service Providers Industries Tools News Analysis The goal is to provide a wealth of resources for those looking to design, develop and deploy APIs without bias towards a specific platform--allowing them to make an educated choice about what path they should take. To stay independent and operate API Evangelist, I need to bring in revenue, and keep things moving forward. I strive to do this in as healthy of a way as possible, without giving away control over my attention and focus, and contribute as much as possible to resources I provide to the public. Areas I currently offer consulting services in are: Strategy API Evangelism - Design and oversight of companies API evangelism efforts Monetization Strategy - Design and oversight of a companies API monetization, business model and incubation approaches Hackathons - Targeting, planning and execution of hackathons Research Industry - Analysis of specific industries, API providers within and the opportunities available Markets - Identifying and deeper understanding of evangelism opportunities within specific cities and countries Developer Profiling - Targeting and profiling of developers within industries, markets and of specific, existing APIs Providers - Providing a deeper understanding of how specific APIs operate their API operations Speaking Webinars - Participating in webinars with companies and individuals Conferences - Speaking and...[<a href="/2012/10/12/the-api-evangelist-mission/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>NPR is defining new models for content distribution. One that other media providers can follow, when designing their API driven content delivery platforms. The NPR Story API provides digital access to NPR content and to other station content--allowing both NPR and stations to contribute and consume local and national news stories. In an effort to provide NPR stations with more control over the content they contribute to the platform for distribution, NPR Digital Services has introduced content permissions control via the NPR story API. Currently content stored on the Story API&rsquo;s platform can be retrieved by anyone with an API key--allowing content pushed across the network to be consumedd in 3 ways: Create Once, Publish Everywhere - Stations and npr.org push content into the API and then pull the content onto other platforms, such as other station-owned web properties and mobile apps Station Networks - Content is shared between multiple stations in a content network, both on web sites and mobile apps National - Station content is featured on npr.org and NPR mobile apps with links back to station digital properties Using the new content permissions, stations can now control who is allowed to pull their content from the API. The permissions work by allowing stations pushing content to specify whether the content should be: Public to all Public to the NPR station network Public to a group of stations listed in a whitelist Public to everyone except for stations on a blacklist The new changes allow stations to set these permissions at the individual story level, as well as create permission groups to add multiple stories to. NPR's approach is a great model for how APIs can facilitate content exchange across a large network of providers, allowing for the widest distribution possible-while also allowing content owners control over who has access to their valuable content in a very granular way. APIs are all about providing access to valuable content and resources, but should also...[<a href="/2012/10/10/npr-adds-content-permission-control-to-their-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

Marketing to developers is no straightforward task, and with the growth in the number of APIs, platforms, tools and active evangelists and advocates, it is only going to get harder.
Developers just don&rsquo;t want to be sold anything.  We just want to do what we do, and just be left alone--until we need help and reach out.  Then we need you to be there.
With API Evangelist I&rsquo;m evangelizing the importance of APIs to a wider audience beyond developers, while also helping companies understand how they can market their services to developers.
Helping non-developers understand about APIs is getting easier each month, while helping API owners market to developers is getting harder.
Many companies are even opting to not use the term advocate or evangelist, as these names are beginning to have a negative impression with developers.
Developers are bombarded by one or many evangelists, everywhere they go, and many of these evangelists are more sales and marketing than developer support--giving everyone a bad name.
If you are looking to evangelize your API in the near future, deeply consider your approach.  Your objective is not to sell developers on your API, but to help them be successful in what they are doing--something that may or may not involve your companies API.
Your only option for evangelism is to be as authentic as possible and truly solve the problems developers face, otherwise developers will look elsewhere--and with the increased competition, developers have a growing number of options when it comes to APIs and platforms to get the job done.

I will be doing a webinar with Chris Haddad (@cobiacomm) of WSO2 on October 9th, where we discuss API management best practices for digital business ecosystem.
WSO2 is one of my partner API server providers.  I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what they do because they were the first open source API service provider to emerge out of the 20 API service providers in the space.
Chris and I will be exploring a couple are of specific areas, regarding the business of APIs:

Emerging API economy and digital business ecosystems
How to assemble the building blocks of a successful API
When a complete open source API management platform delivers business value
Future trends in maximizing the value of APIs

WSO2 brings a wealth of API experience to the table and I look forward to exploring these areas with Chris.    The webinar titled "WSO2 Case Study &ndash; API Management Building Blocks and Business Value", will be on Tuesday, October 9, at 9:00 a.m. &ndash; 10:00 a.m. PDT.
Look forward to having you there, visit WSO2 for more information.

			<p><em>06 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>There is a lot of news about social networks in the last couple of weeks, with Facebook reaching 1B users, a brand new look for MySpace giving people hope for the struggling social network, the great Twitter migration to App.net and what a master of improv Dick Costolo is, writing Twitters script. All of these news items are in some way trying to convince us of what the future of social networking will look like, declaring Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and App.net as a contender. While all of these social networks aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, I think there is one social network that represents the future of all social networks--Github. If you don&rsquo;t know what Github is, you probably aren&rsquo;t a programmer. Github is a social network built around the software version control software Git. &nbsp;Using Github, programmers can collaborate around repositories of code, which allows them to download, fork and commit back code in any format--making software development a social endeavor amongst potentially thousands of developers. While Github is primarily a social network of programmers, repositories don&rsquo;t have to be just code. Github repositories can contain HTML, text files and many other formats that can be edited by anybody--allowing the power of version control and collaboration to occur between anyone, in any business sector. I just finished watching Clay Shirky&rsquo;s talk on how the Internet will (one day) transform government, using the platform to deal with a flood of new, often times divergent, ideas. As always, Clay masterfully uses history to lay the groundwork for his argument, that social collaboration and version control with Github is in alignment with how democracy should work. While Twitter and Facebook have proven to evoke profound social change, I think Github holds amazing potential for change as well. And whether it is allowing developers to build open source software, government to make the legal process truly inclusive of its citizens or empowering our teachers to collaborate on classroom curriculum--Github holds...[<a href="/2012/10/06/github-is-the-social-network-of-the-future/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Hackathons are a popular way for developers to come together and hack on mobile and web apps, in hopes of winning prizes and getting noticed for their innovation.  Silicon Valley has done a great job of keeping hackathons about building apps, but there are many other ways to apply the hackathon model.
One hackathon model that I&rsquo;ve seen a couple times now, is more about hacking a process, rather than hacking an app.  A hackathon where any company, organization or individual can come, with their existing process, and walk participants through what they are looking to accomplish--with the goal of making it better.
The process could be anything they already do on a regular basis and are looking to optimize, or a new process they would like to develop. In our ever-increasing digital world, where Software as a Service (SaaS) and APIs are becoming commonplace in our daily lives, there is an need for constantly identifying, refining and establishing new processes.
APIs open up huge opportunities for more efficient ways of getting things done, and a hackathon is a great way to pitch a process to a bunch of new users, form teams and spend some time hacking together a more efficient way to get it done.  The objective of this form of the hackathon is to refine a process and help make it better, using technology to better solve the problems we deal with every day.
While building apps is a great focus of a hackathon, they might be better used to help people gain efficiencies at their companies and organizations--allowing them to get access to creative new approaches, and knowledge about other potential tools and platforms they can put to use. &nbsp;
I predict hackathons will continue to grow in popularity, and hopefully we can continue to evolve them to reach the widest possible audience. &nbsp;

The Tumblr engineering team has been hard at work on a new Github page, showcasing the open source projects they've released. &nbsp;
Tumblr has also added a coming soon section, highlighting open source projects they are planning on releasing in the near future.
What's interesting is they have also included select presentations from conferences and events Tumblr has presented at.&nbsp;
The Github implementation by Tumblr is pretty unique, and to go even further, Tumblr has also&nbsp;open sourced their whole approach to deploying it on Github.

Tumblr's use of Github is worth showcasing. &nbsp;I think it's an innovative approach that other API owners could follow to showcase the open source project they are working on, as well as valuable event presentations.
I'm really impressed with the number of innovative uses of Github I'm seeing lately.

When it comes to any business, you want to showcase your team, and the value they bring to the table. &nbsp;
One of the things I do here at API Evangelist, is showcase great examples of technology across the API industry. &nbsp;
With this in mind I wanted to showcase the Singly team page. &nbsp;When you visit singly.com and click on team in the footer, you get immediately see a team member photo carousel:

Which isn't very unique, but next you get 3 things that are unique:

Average number of hours each Singly team member slept this week
Number of Github commits in the last 7 days
Distance walked by Singly team members


Singly team members provide this data using Quantified Self (QS) data from products like Fitbit and Runkeeper, and social programming networks like Github--driven by APIs. &nbsp;
Next Singly shows a map of their neighborhood in the San Francisco mission district:

Then they wrap up with Instagram photos from team members:

The Singly team page is the best company team page I have ever seen. &nbsp;It shows extremely personal data from their Fitbit and Rukneeper devices, as well as the day to day business of code pushes via their Github accounts. The team page also shows you where the team is located and some Instagram photos to help you get the vibe of the team.
What does your website team page tell about your companies team?

When you spend a lot of time going to conferences, hackathons and events, you start really getting picky about which events you go to. To disrupt my regular routine, I need an event that will always add value to my professional career, but also be a good time!
When it comes to the latest in Internet technolgy, I always make time each year for the Gluecon and Defrag conferences. Gluecon is usually in the spring and Defrag is in the fall--both occurring at the Omni Interlocken in Broomfield, CO.

Defrag is coming up November 15th and 16th--right after November 1st and 2nd for the&nbsp;API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC.
API Strategy &amp; Conference is psyched to be partnering with Defrag in our first year.  If you register for API Strategy &amp; Conference, you will get 10% off of your registration for Defrag.
The event combination will make November a great time to immerse yourself in the API industry, with API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference, then two weeks later, go further with Internet technology discussions at Defrag.
I look forward to seeing you at both API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference and Defrag in November!&nbsp;

			<p><em>23 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>Github should be the center of your API operations, with the most obvious use being for SDK repositories, but Github offers a lot of other valuable tools that you can use to help manage your API platform.
One great use of Github is as an API issue management tool. &nbsp;The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories.

To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management. &nbsp;Think of it as repository for your API itself.
Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentialy be part of the API product development cycle.
Along with API Issue Management with Github, you can link issues with the milestones portion of Github, providing deeper roadmap integration, but I will cover that in a separate post.

			<p><em>21 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Back in May, when the White House CIO has released a strategy, entitled "Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People", which directs all federal agencies to publish HTML, JSON and XML versions of their digital strategy, I wrote a PHP script to monitor the progress.&nbsp;
To date, 25 federal agencies have successfully published their digital strategy, and I have been updating my script regularly to keep up. And while a few of the agencies still have querks with their HTTP Codes and with JSON formatting, the code is starting to stabilize. &nbsp;So I decided to start sharing it on Github, allowing others to put it to use.
The first sample script I'm publishing is a basic example of how to pull the JSON version of a single agencies digital strategy. &nbsp;Once it pulls the JSON, it then loops through each item and field on the strategy, and renders to screen. &nbsp;It doesn't make any assumptions on what you wish to do with data.
Next I will publish a more sophisticated version that stores values in a database. &nbsp;Here is the pull federal agency digital strategy PHP script:

I&rsquo;m currently processing several discussion I&rsquo;ve had with folks about APIs and the future of search when it comes to voice enabled apps, like Apple&rsquo;s Siri.
It started with a discussion with the Webshell folks about their blog post, Webservices supply chain management : the SIRI case.  Next I was reading a presentation from Pat Cappelaere(@cappelaere) CEO of Vightel Corporation. called Building Tomorrow&rsquo;s Web Services API.
Pat has an interesting image in his deck, showing who the next generation consumer of your API will be:

These conversations reflect a whole new area of consideration for the future of web APIs.  Will voice be the dominant way to search via our mobile devices?  If so, how do we expose our companies resources, in a way that makes them easily consumed by voice enabled apps?
At the simplest, we need to discuss where REST fails us in this scenario, and at the most complex we need to discuss what &ldquo;activities&rdquo; will be consumed by voice apps and what types of &ldquo;supply chain management&rdquo; processes or framework will we need to manage all of this.
All of this will feed into to whether or not your company, its products and services will be found in a Siri-like search, when voice enabled apps become the default.

			<h3><a href="/2012/09/18/simple-api-developer-tracking-framework/">Simple API Developer Tracking Framework</a></h3>
			<p><em>18 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>
When you have an API, you track two things:  1)  Number of Developer Registrations and 2)  Number of API requests.  This is how we determine a successful API, right?
You should track those two things, but those metrics alone do not define a successful API.  You should go much further.  Each API owner will have their own definition of success, thus their own set of metrics to measure success.
With this in mind, there is no single framework for measuring your API, but here is one suggestion for a basic framework to think about when tracking your API developers.
First establish some buckets to put users in:

New - Brand new developer
Active - Developer actively using API (come up with number)
Inactive - Developers who go below the "active" number threshold for X number of days
Billable - Developer who is paying you $$
Partner - A developer who are working closer with than rest of developers
Internal - Your staff or contractors who actively use your API, even for testing

Then make sure and flag each user with a timestmap when they change status:

5/2/2012 - New
5/2/2012 - Active
7/9/2012 - Billable
8/15/2012 - Inactive


I like to generate daily, weekly and monthly counts for each bucket, plus see numbers on the churn between buckets.
Looking at developers in buckets, and tracking on their transitions between buckets allows you to start seeing the big picture, when large groups of users are migrating between status, or the individual picture, like why a single developer just went inactive.
I don&rsquo;t see much to learn from just watching new registrations and number of API calls, but by creating meaningful buckets to place developers in, then understanding their evolution between these buckets, I think you can learn a lot with a pretty simple set of metrics.

			<p>We all have our own approaches to API design and development, many of which will never see the light of day. In the API space we hear a lot about API management and API success stories, but not much about the process of designing, developing and initial deployment of APIs. I just had a little taste of how the Wordnik team approaches it, using Swagger. Often when you hear about Swagger in the industry, you hear about the UI portion. You know the sexy interactive documentation that is fast becoming a standard with APIs, but it&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg--there is a whole lot more power to Swagger, than just interactive docs. &ldquo;The heart of Swagger is the specification, and from that, cool shit can get done!&rdquo;, say Tony Tam Wordnik CEO and technical co-founder. To demonstrate, Tony walked me through Wordnik&rsquo;s approach to designing, developming and deploying a new API driven iPad app, using a team of 3: One person driving an editor writing JSON files, which are the Swagger spec for the needed API The all three discussed the operations, parameters, while adding them to the JSON, and re-running the swagger spec validator after each meaningful change When they were happy with the specs, they loaded the JSON files into the UI through apache installed on a local machine After they inspected each API and operation again, they wrote the models in the spec files, and reviewed again to make sure everything was good Then they ran the Swagger Codegen and generated a Scalatra (Scala) server from the spec files Then they ran the Swagger Codegen and generated an Objective-C client from the spec files The server developer went off and wired the server to the business logic The front-end guy went and wired the UI to the objective-c library The process took 2.5 hours in total, from API to interface--a technique they call interface-driven development, which focuses on modeling the...[<a href="/2012/09/18/generate-api-server-docs-and-client-code-using-swagger/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>
YouTube has decided to cease support for Youtube API QA via dedicated Google Group, and exclusively use Stack Overflow for developer QA support.
Every developer knows that Stack Overflow is where you go to get the best answers for your programming issues, and API providers are taking notice too.
Stack Overflow has always been something I recommend paying attention to for any API evangelist, but more API providers are considering it be the place where all API developer QA should exist.
Facebook, Foursquare, and Salesforce have all moved their API developer QA to Stack Overflow.
These API providers are still maintaining other API support building blocks like bug ticket systems, email and Twitter accounts, but when it comes to public developer forums they feel that Stack Overflow is enough.
While I think having a active presence on Stack Overflow&nbsp;is a critical part of any API evangelism strategy, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure eliminating a dedicated forum is the right way to go.  I worry you will push developer community completely out on the open Internet, reducing interactions that happen under your brand.
With the size of their developer community, larger APIs often have canyon that exists between them and their developers, and it&rsquo;s easy to widen this canyon by moving general QA exclusively into an open Internet forum.
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that much more work to monitor and respond to your community forum as well as Stack Overflow, and even add in Quora, Reddit, StumbleUpon, Google Alerts, and other ways of monitoring the API and developer landscape.

			<p><em>17 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m immersing myself into the fascinating new world of the Quantified Self (QS). If you are not familiar with what QS is, according to Wikipedia: Quantified Self is a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person's daily life in terms of inputs (e.g. food consumed, quality of surrounding air), states (e.g. mood, arousal, blood oxygen levels), and performance (mental and physical). As I do with other areas, I start my research by doing a roundup of companies who offer QS products and services--which helps me define the space. Within an hour I easily found 50+ QS device manufacturers, some of which were complete with API driven integration platforms-- way too many to list in a single roundup, but here are a couple of better known companies: Fitbit - Fitbit is a health and fitness tracking device RunKeeper - Runkeeper is a device for tracking, measuring, and improving your fitness Withings - Withings provides connected body scales, blood pressure and baby monitors Zeo - Zeo has sleep tracking and management devices and apps These QS platforms represent a whole new opportunity for the API industry, one that will drive the next generation of healthcare innovation. Self-quantification starts with data collection, followed by visualization, then cross-referencing and the discovery of correlations--all three opportunites for APIs. Devices can use APIs via cell and wifi to transmit data for collection and storage, while also allowing app developers to use the same APIs to help end-users manage and visualize their data. Then, when appropriate, use the same APIs providing access to other systems and providers who can then cross-reference and discover correlations within individual or groups of users. It is exciting to think about the possibilities around QS.

I was just reading a post via Buzzfeed, that Twitter was going to remove third-party image services from its apps.  &ldquo;According to a person who was briefed on the company's plans&rdquo;, the changes will be coming in the next updates to the Twitter client(s).
"They're trying to control those eyeballs on their apps, they're an ad-based company, they make money that way,&rdquo; says Twitpic founder Noah Everett, according to&nbsp;Buzzfeed.
One thing is clear. Twitter is serious in its effort to take control over its ecosystem. &nbsp;It has a plan, and it's systematically rolling it out, taking control over each area it needs to maximize "promoted" revenue.

			<p>
I&rsquo;m stoked to announce that Steve Klabnik will be speaking at the API Strategy &amp; Practice conference, November 1st &amp; 2nd in New York City.  I just added him to the homepage and speaker line-up.
Steve is a highly respected Ruby developer, software craftsman, and an aspiring digital humanities scholar. He spends most of his time contributing to Open Source projects, and maintains both Hackety Hack and Shoes, while also teaching and helping develop curriculum for&nbsp;Jumpstart Lab.
Steve has has written book on Designing Hypermedia APIs. Well it&rsquo;s better than a book.  I&rsquo;d call it a "living digital book". One where you can constantly come back and get fresh content and interact with the books community and author.  Much better than  the old-school programming book, which you buy once and it sits on your shelf.
What intrigues me about Steve, is that his perspective is very technical, but in his own words, &ldquo;I've found a place between the sciences and the humanities.&rdquo;  Which is a point of view we need to give a platform to, and everyone in Silicon Valley needs to listen.
Steve is exactly the fresh perspective we want to get at the API Strategy &amp; Practice conference.  I hope you can join us for the two day event in November and be there in person for Steve&rsquo;s talk.

			<p>
We are at an exciting time right now with the API Practice &amp; Strategy conference, where we get to orchestrate the best lineup of speakers, sessions and panels possible.
I just added Steve Klabnik to our speaker line-up and now we are excited to announce we&rsquo;ll be having a fireside chat with Albert Wenger (@albertwenger) of Union Square Ventures (USV).
Albert combines over 10 years of entrepreneurial experience with an in-depth technology background. As an entrepreneur, he has founded or co-founded five companies, including a management consulting firm (in Germany), a hosted data analytics company, a technology subsidiary for Telebanc (now E*Tradebank), an early stage investment firm, and most recently (with his wife), DailyLit, a service for reading books by email or RSS.
Albert also served as the president of del.icio.us through the company's sale to Yahoo. His technology background goes back to winning the German national computer science competition at age 18. Albert graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College in economics and computer science and holds a Ph.D. in Information Technology from MIT. He has managed technology projects for organizations as diverse as Tacoda (startup) and Telebanc (leading Internet bank).
USV invests in companies that have large networks of engaged users, differentiated by user experience and defensible by network effects, so USV has a vested interest in understanding developer communities, how APIs will evolve, what types of businesses are best suited to an API driven strategy.
The API Practice &amp; Strategy conference fireside chat with Albert Wenger will reflect the tone of the conference, which is a blend of both the technical and business of APIs--providing what is essential for companies to be successful with their API driven strategies.

Embeddable tools like Twitter&rsquo;s Embedded Timelines, Twitter Cards, Embedded Tweets, Tweet Button and Follow Button are all great for empowering all your users to take advantage of an API.
Twitter&rsquo;s move is similar to that of LinkedIn, who also de-emphasized their API interfaces and offered various embeddable tools, badge and widget builder tools that help extend the API across the interwebz.

			<p><em>12 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m updating the login and authentication for my content management system, APIs and other tools to provide authentication using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Github by default. I&rsquo;m using Singly as an authentication provider, because their aggregation of API authentication, endpoints and objects across these providers is easy and most efficient way I know to get this accomplished.
In addition to it being easy, I&rsquo;m using Singly for another advantage.  Each service Singly provides has a discovery endpoint, which provides me with metadata and the other endpoints each service provides.  I want to use this meta data to derive a quick snapshot ranking of my authenticating user.
For example, when a user authenticates via Github Using Singly, I get the following meta data and endpoints:

Singly gives me 6 endpoints with data from the user&rsquo;s activity in these areas.  I&rsquo;m looking to create an algorithm that will provide me with some quick ranking score based upon the number of repositories, followers and following a user has.
Right now I'm just going to add these up, take average across all my users that have logged in via Github.  I&rsquo;m sure I will evolve the design of the algorithm as I progress, but it should work for now.
My goal is to provide a little more insight into what type of user is signing up for my service, API or otherwise and possibly take different courses of action based upon their overall activity levels on Github.  I mean, if they are Github superstar I want to know it, and also know if they aren&rsquo;t very active at all.
I&rsquo;ll explore the same algorithm for Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn authentication, but probably take different values into consideration for those social networks.

I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of talk about API automation using platforms like IFTTT and Zapier these days.  It&rsquo;s one of the fastest growing areas of my&nbsp;future of web APIs series.
A sign of this growth can be seen by Sendgrid&rsquo;s announcement of their partnership with Zapier:
Zapier makes it easy to sync data between web applications. They allow SaaS users to create integrations that push data between different web applications without having to waste time coming up with complicated systems.  Now you can easily connect to SendGrid along with hundreds of other apps without having to write a single line of code.

API automation is allowing API providers to reach entirely new audiences, acting as a sort of icon-based interface allowing anyone put their APIs to work for them.
Up until now, if you wanted to integrate Sendgrid&rsquo;s email functionality into your workflow you would need to get a programmer, now any user can integrate email into their every day workflow--using the wide array of cloud services and APIs that automation platforms are supporting.
Does your company have an API that users access via API Automation?

I&rsquo;ve been tracking the adoption of the White House CIO's digital strategy, trying understand each agency's mobile and API plans.
Today I noticed that NASA, in addition to publishing their digital strategy in HTML, XML and JSON, added a "recent commits" Github widget on their digital strategy homepage.

It&rsquo;s a small, but very important addition.  It shows that NASA sees the importance of not just using Github, but pushing code and interacting with developers via the social network.
Github is a service that is getting more traction within government, and I hope that more federal agencies don&rsquo;t just put it to use, but make it part of the culture within their organization.
Github is more than a code repository, it will also help your agency be more "collaborative and open by default".

			<p><em>10 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I was spending time thinking about API discovery methodologies this afternoon (I know...I have issues), but with ProgrammableWeb approaching 8K public APIs, its a very real problem.
Currently, as an application developer, when I have an idea, I start by sketching what I want to build and set out to find all of the resources I will need to make it a reality.  I pick my platform of choice and then set out to find other API resources I will need to bring my app to life.
I will need a database, user management and some analytics for my back-end, selecting a Backend as a Service&nbsp;(BaaS)&nbsp;provider like CloudMine or Kinvey.  Next I need authentication and social integration with Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn using Singly.  After this I will have to piece together my application from a variety of individual APIs like Twilio, Urban Airship, Iron.io and many other APIs.
What if we flipped this on its head and reversed the process?  As an application developer, I could publish a list of resources I need for my web or mobile app, and APIs could find me.  I could just publish my need for image storage, facial recognition, location and other resources and API providers could find me.
It&rsquo;s just a brain exercise to see if I&rsquo;m missing anything.  Maybe the problem we need to solve isn&rsquo;t API discovery, it&rsquo;s application discovery? &nbsp;Enable APIs to find developers, in addition to developers finding APIs.

			<p>At first glance, APIs seem like something very technical, and the REST pundits do a good job of maintaining this perspective. Even though at the core of what we currently know as a &ldquo;web API&rdquo; there is plenty of tech, web APIs can be much more business than tech--a notion first introduced by&nbsp;Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake when she coined the term BizDev 2.0. APIs in practice, are a new approach to business development, using a partner or public facing API that allows consumers to sign up, start accessing valueable business assets in a self-service way--allowing a company to scale business development opportunities with fewer human resources. Developers can start building applications and businesses around a companies assets, utilizing exposed API resources and self-service tools to establish a business relationship on their own. If an API has the necessary technical and business building blocks, and API consumers have a good enough application, there is a an opportunity for finding success without the need for engagement of traditional business development resources. This process is BizDev 2.0. &nbsp;However, even with this evolution in establishing new business relationships, your company may not be ready for the flood of new relationships and ideas that will flow in through this new API driven environment. If you handle all the aspects of your API correctly, developers build applications, establish successful businesses and get traction on their ideas, they will need additional resources, attention and potentially, incubation. I&rsquo;ve been the face of this process several times, only to bring in good ideas, get traction and identify potential value, but when I present these implementations internally...I get well, nothing. Companies often don&rsquo;t have the infrastructure and resources to handle this flow of new business opportunities, even a formal process for saying, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a great idea, we see the value, but we don't have the resources to deal with that right now&rdquo;, aka no!

			<p>APIs are everywhere. The number of public APIs available on ProgrammableWeb are growing at a dizzying pace, with current count being at 7,207. The number of API service providers and tools supporting the new demand for simple, web APIs that mobile and web developers can use has seen the same pace of growth. I&rsquo;m getting requests for API 101 materials across all business sectors from healthcare to the federal government. The pace of API consumption is growing as well, and up until recently, we only communicate in single words using APIs--we checkin, post, share, get, friend, like. &nbsp;Now that we have learned the basic words, we need a way to form more "meaningful&nbsp;phrases and sentences to communicate using APIs". In the past month I&rsquo;ve explored a couple different areas where I&rsquo;m seeing APIs evolve from single uses into more aggregate, flowing forms of communication using APIs: Backend as a Service(BaaS) - Building in the resources developers need most when building mobile or web apps into a single stack, bringing together the back-end and middleware to make developers more successful. API Automation - Providing iconographic tools for any users, even non-developers to string together actions between multiple APIs. Bundling them into reusable recipes, and automating our personal and business lives in the cloud. Mobile Builder Platforms - Platforms that provide hosted tools for developers and non-developers to rapidly build cross-platform mobile applications using content from RSS and APIs. API Language Libraries - Development of language libraries allowing developers to program against APIs with single lines of code, abstracting away common friction with authentication and inconsistencies between APis. Aggregate APIs&nbsp;- Building of unified or aggregate APIs like Singly does with personal data, providing a single authentication, endpoint and object framework that makes speaking with multiple APIs a reality. These are the five fastest growing areas where I see API usage being taken to the next level, potentially allowing developers and even non-developers to better communicate using APIs,...[<a href="/2012/09/07/introducing-the-next-generation-of-communication-using-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m exploring the future of web APIs, and have come to what I feel is what of the most fascinating areas of evolution in the usage of web APIs. &nbsp;An approach that is very developer centric, which is something you don't always see in the current API service landscape. There are two companies working hard on developing new libraries for popular programming languages that abstract away much of the authentication and other complexities developers face when using APIs. Temboo and Webshell are two pioneers that are taking API development to a new level. Temboo is building libraries in Java, PHP, Python, or Ruby and Webshell is building libraries in JS, PHP, Ruby as well as providing a command line interface for programming against APIs. This isn&rsquo;t just programming directly against a single API. These are libraries that allow you to make calls against APIs using sometimes as little as 2 or 3 lines of code, opening new possibilities of efficiently programming against not just one API, but fluently across multiple APIs. In addition to simplifying calls made against APIs, both platforms work to abstract away the complexities of API authentication, one of the biggest pain points for developers. Platforms like Temboo and Webshell absorb the complexity, inconsistencies and difficult aspects of programming using APIs, providing libraries that developers can use in their native programming languages--making developers lives easier. It&rsquo;s tough to classify what Temboo and Webshell are doing. I don&rsquo;t have a term or phrase to describe them--one that does them justice. Everything I say sounds like everything you are already doing with individual APIs. But this is more. Temboo and Webshell are defining new ways of speaking using APIs, allowing us to more efficiently speak using the vast amount of valuable resources being exposed via web APIs today. Temboo and Webshell both have their own approach to solving this problem, which I will dive into separately, in future posts. &nbsp;Right now I just want...[<a href="/2012/09/06/the-next-generation-of-api-programming-using-temboo-and-webshell/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Following the creative commons release of their API lifecycle methodology, telco API service provider Alcatel-Lucent has open sourced the “underpinnings” of their Open API Platform(OAP). The API management capabilities in OAP are being released under the name apiGrove. According to Alcatel-Lucent’s methodology there are four major components to API infrastructure: Management Composition Monetization Analytics Alcatel-Lucent is opening sourcing the first of the four components, allowing companies to deploy APIs and meter usage to support a variety of monetization plans, provide authentication via API key, username/password for REST and SOAP APIs. Alcatel-Lucent’s goal is to initially open source the API management component, while providing paid upgrades to API service composition, monetization and analytics, and are considering open sourcing other components in the future, when it makes sense. The functionality of apiGrove API Management platform represents the basic features companies will need when deploying web APIs internally, and externally to the public or for partners. If more advanced features are needed, they can be obtained in paid components or can be delivered by the open source community. Bundled with apiGrove is a GUI administration tool, providing a simple interface for administrators to use, but only represents some of the features available on the platform. To fully take advantage of apiGrove API management you need to use the API--with everything on the platform accessible via an API. While talking with Laura Merling, SVP for Application Enablement at Alcatel-Lucent, she articulated that, “there is a big difference between running in the cloud and being integrated into the fabric of the cloud”, supporting Alcatel-Lucent's official response that: Our belief is that the API management layer is becoming commoditized. The experience of creating the Alcatel-Lucent Open Application Platform (OAP), demonstrated that it was vital to open the management layer to accelerated innovation, rather than keep it proprietary. I can’t express strongly enough how important this statement is.

			<p><em>05 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m building a small API that I want to allow developers to register for.  I don&rsquo;t want to make it a complicated registration process, I just want them to provide some sort of credentials and I will issWue a key that they can use to make API calls.
To keep it simple I&rsquo;m offering a login using a Github account.  Every developer has a Github account right?   Well if they don&rsquo;t, they should.  The easiest way there is to enable your API with a Github login is Singly.
Using Singly, I sign in with my Github account (this is where I got this idea), then I add a new application, giving it the root URL and callback URL of my API developer area.

Next I need to link up my Github account to my Singly account, by adding an application to my Github account.  I give it a name, URL and when adding the callback, I add a Singly specific callback--Singly will handle the rest.

Now I just add a login with Github button to my developer area with the following URL:&nbsp;

https://api.singly.com/v0/services/github?access_token=my_token

When one of my API developers click on the Github login, it will route them to Github for OAuth, back to Singly and to my API callback URL where I can grab the authorization code for the user.

Now I can reference my API developer using their Github account, using their profile image, name as well as having some stats about the user like how many repositories they have, number of followers and who they follow--which provides me a pretty good baseline metric for distinguishing active developers vs. in-active developers.

Github login should be default for all API providers. It reduces developer on-boarding friction with an API, and uses the social network that makes the most sense for API developers.

I&rsquo;m the most familiar with two leading platforms, Cabana&nbsp;and Tiggzi, but wanted to take a look at what else is out there. What I&rsquo;m classifying as a mobile app builder platform, is a web-based platform (not something you have to download), that lets you build a mobile application and usually (but not always) without any development experienced. There are a lot of sites that claim the ability to build mobile apps in minutes, but many of them clearly are spammy crap. I tried to sort through as many as I could to come up with this short list of mobile app builder platforms: AppBotic - Mobile app builder supporting iPhone, iPad, Android and HTML5 with no visible support for APIs. AppBreeder - Mobile app builder with iPhone, iPad, Blackberry and Android support, with no direct API support. App Builder - Mobile app builder with support for iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone and allows for direct API integration for content. BuildAnApp - Mobile app building platform supporting iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, and Windows Mobile with no API support. Cabana - HTML5 mobile app and Facebook fan page building application with sophisticated support for API integration. FiveSpark - Mobile app building platform with direct APIs up port. LiveCode - Mobile app building platform with support for iPhone, iPad and Android with to evident API support. Mippin - A mobile app building platform with support for iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows, HTML5, Blackberry and Nokia with no clear API support. MobBase - Fan focused mobile app building platform supporting iPhone, Android and HTML5 with no direct API support. Mobile App Wizard - GUI Mobile app builder supporting iPhone, iPad, Android, HTML5 that is content and feed based without specific extensibility for APIs.

			<p><em>04 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>This is a case study sent to me from National Instruments. &nbsp;I just had to post it as is, because it just shows the serious potential of APIs. &nbsp;If cloud computing and mobile hasn't convinced you that APIs are here to stay, take a look at what National Instruments is doing. Over the past five years, National Instruments (NI) has been using an API strategy to enable a developer ecosystem, based on their LabVIEW software platform. &nbsp;NI equips engineers and scientists with tools that accelerate productivity, innovation, and discovery &ndash; and a strong ecosystem is core to their philosophy. &nbsp;This case study takes a look at one approach, and the business role that APIs play in expanding into new markets. &nbsp;&nbsp;As background, NI LabVIEW is a productivity tool and graphical programming language used in all kinds of scientific applications. &nbsp;The breadth of users range from &ldquo;aspiring engineers&rdquo; who use a specialized version to program the Lego Mindstorms NXT software, to some of the world&rsquo;s top researchers who use LabVIEW to design complex systems including software for the CERN hadron collider and the SpaceX control center. &nbsp; &nbsp; Figure 1: &nbsp;LabVIEW is used from K through Rocket Science. To understand why an API strategy was needed, first consider the standard use-case for LabVIEW. &nbsp;Most companies use LabVIEW as a productivity tool/IDE to develop applications using the default software stack provided by NI, and combining that software with measurement hardware. &nbsp;&nbsp;A common application is production testing of a consumer device, such as the Xbox 360 controller from Microsoft. &nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW allows complete customization of an engineering application, just as is possible with any other programming language. &nbsp;The difference between a text-based language, and LabVIEW&rsquo;s graphical approach, that that the graphical approach is familiar to engineers who grow up drawing block diagrams of systems, and it makes connecting to real-world I/O very efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW also supports parallelism (multithreading), memory management, built-in analysis, control algorithms, and measurement routines which helps...[<a href="/2012/09/04/how-an-api-strategy-can-create-an-innovation-engine-for-engineers-and-scientists/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>I was just downloading all of my Facebook data. You can go under your account settings and there is a little link that lets you download everything. &nbsp;It takes some time to generate a full archive, but once my archive is ready, they&rsquo;ll email me and I can get at my data and see what the download format looks like. While waiting, I wanted to see what Google had to offer. Google has an amazing acount management dashboard which provides you access to your settings, some of the data, but Google is also working on their takeout service which gives you downloads for individual services and across multiple services. That is a pretty good start. Two of my biggest networks allow me to download data. I wasn't so lucky with the next four: Twitter - No Instagram - No Foursquare - No LinkedIn - Some (just your connections) I use all six of these services daily. It bums me out that I can&rsquo;t get out my own data. Of course all of these services have an API, which allows developers to get at my data, but even Twitter&rsquo;s API doesn&rsquo;t give me full access to all my accounts data. I want access to a data store of all my Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare and LinkedIn data in a single location. There are software available trying to solve this problem such as ThinkUp or The Locker Project. As with APIs, these solutions require you to be a developer. (I see ThinkUp has a cloud solution now) At this point I&rsquo;m thinking about how to build an application using Singly, one that allows me to pull posts, tweets, photos, friends and other vital personal data into a single store. &nbsp;I need to think it through. Then I really start questioning the storage of all of my social data. Do I really even want it all in one location? Do I just want it in another location,...[<a href="/2012/09/01/why-don039t-i-have-easy-access-to-all-my-online-personal-data/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Aug 2012</em></p>
			<p>API terms of service (TOS) is one of the most critical, yet one of the most silent links for developers who are building apps and business on top of APIs. Terms of service determine what you can or cannot do with an API, and often times developers do not understand these terms, leaving them vulnerable to some very negative outcomes. Following in the footprints of a larger project, called &ldquo;Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read&rdquo;, a group of us have gotten together, and created &ldquo;API Terms of Service Didn't Read&rdquo;, which aims at creating a transparent and peer-reviewed process to rate and analyze API Terms of Service, to establishing a rating classification that all developers can understand. To seed the process, we went out and reviewed a number of the popular API terms of service and identified seven categories that really affect developers: Business model (include pricing, rate limits and quotas) Terms change conditions Developers restrictions End-user Privacy API Data ownership Data portability Jurisdiction The goal is to rank each API using a classification ranging from A (good) to E (bad) in these seven areas, so developers can quickly understand where an API stands in the areas that are most important to them. API Terms of Service Didn't Read, also known as API-ToS;DR, is a crowd-sourced effort and requires community involvement to be successful. To get involved you can visit the API-ToS;DR website, join the working Google Group or help by pushing code in the Github repository. As APIs grow in popularity this problem is only going to get worse. Terms of service is something I see several groups working to actively understand such as Singly with their personal data terminator project, and EFF with their TOSBack project. Over the coming months I&rsquo;d like to help focus all this energy into API Terms of Service Didn't Read, providing a plain english rating system that all developers can use when navigating the often treacherous landscape of API...[<a href="/2012/08/30/crowdsourced-api-terms-of-service/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Three months after the White House CIO mandated that all federal departments and agencies have a digital strategy, we are getting closer to having access to some high value APIs, across almost twenty participating departments and agencies. Up to now, it is just a lot of talk about strategy, without much detail on what will be deployed. &nbsp;Now that there are&nbsp;20 digital strategies published, we can start seeing some of the APIs the departments and agencies will be deploying in the coming months. Here is a list of "systems" that each participating department or agency will be deploying: Department of Agriculture (USDA) World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Meat, Poultry and Egg Product Inspection Directory USDA Newsroom&nbsp;- Provides USDA's comprehensive forecasts of supply and demand for major U.S. and global crops and U.S. livestock.

			<p><em>29 Aug 2012</em></p>
			<p>Last week I announced that API Evangelist and Singly were partnering, and while I&rsquo;m helping Singly with their API Evangelism strategy and they are providing me with some vital data on some of the most important APIs in the industry and how developers are using them--I&rsquo;m fascinated by the Singly unified API model and how it can simplify developing apps that use social and personal data. As I do with any API, I sign up for an account, come up with an idea for a prototype, start hacking, then get to work telling the story of the process. To get started using Singly, I wanted to build a simply social data explorer that would help me understand how the platform works, but also give me a simple example for explaining to other developers. Before diving in, let me start with the basics. What is Singly? Singly is a unified API interface for accessing social and personal data from the top API platforms. Singly has built an API on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other API platforms. Simplified the authentication, objects and API endpoints into a unified API, allowing you to access multiple APIs through a single, simpler API interface, drastically improving the time you have to spend developing social features in your web and mobile apps. For this project I focused on the top social network APIs: Facebook, Foursquare, Github, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter. Ok, for many Github isn&rsquo;t a social network. It&rsquo;s something just geeks use, but to us, it is a social network. Anyways, let&rsquo;s start building my social data exploration prototype. First, I signed up for Singly using my Github login. Once signed up, I added my first Singly application, which allows me to generate application specific Singly keys, which features I will use, and provides a single interface to store and manage that access for each social network that I will be using. When adding a new app, it takes some time...[<a href="/2012/08/29/efficient-social-api-development-with-singly/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2012/08/28/open-source-mobile-backend-as-a-service/">Open Source Mobile Backend as a Service</a></h3>
			<p><em>28 Aug 2012</em></p>
			<p>I did a roundup of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers last week, which brought in a couple recommendations of other companies I should include, and some interesting feedback on how APIs can be integrated with MBaaS platforms.
A very interesting comment left on the post was about MBaaS vendor lock-in:
The big problem, IMHO, using a BaaS provider is the so called "vendor lock in". What if my backend provider changes the pricing models, or dismisses the service and go out of the business? 
To address this issue, the commenter said they are building an open source MBaaS platform, which anyone will be able to download and install on the server or cloud platform of their choice.
Just like with the recent addition of an open source API management platform, I think an open source Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) would benefit the space tremendously.
The new open source MBaaS is called BaaSBox, and is in early development.  I found a Twitter account and Facebook page, which I'll pay attention to for updates.
While many of the MBaaS providers are catering to the most common needs of mobile application developers, I can envision an open source MBaaS platform opening up entirely new niche offerings that could provide developers with ready to go platforms for developing, deploying and managing very specialized mobile applications, without "vendor lock-in". &nbsp;
I would like to hear your thoughts on MBaaS vendor lock-in and whether an open source version is necessary.

			<p>One very important aspect of API Evangelism is landscape analysis. When you launch an API, you need to have an intimate understanding of the landscape where you will be evangelizing your API and engaging with potential consumers. I always start by establishing potential 10K foot target areas that I will focusing on in my research. While these may vary from industry to industry, my starting list is: Individuals - Who are the key individual influencers in your target landscape Competitors - Know your competitors, you can learn a lot from what they do right or they do wrong Platforms - There are an endless amount of platforms that may benefit your company, such as Drupal, Wordpress and Salesforce Media - Who are the relevant media and blogs you should be following and engaging with Partners - Existing partners who you should be in tune with on the landscape After tackling these areas and identifying who the players are, you will identify other areas that are unique to your API evangelism efforts, so don't stress over whether you have the right areas in the first week. While researching these areas of my landscape I try to identify specific channels for getting plugged in with landscape targets: Website URL - What is the targets root URL for their website Blog URL - What is the blog for a target Blog RSS - Secondary to the blog, what is the RSS feed so I can programmatically monitor Twitter - What is a companies or individuals Twitter handle LinkedIn - Identify and sometimes connect with a target&rsquo;s LinkedIn account Facebook - Identify and sometimes connect with a target&rsquo;s Facebook account Github - Identify, follow and engage with a companies Github profile and appropriate repositories After getting the primary channels for each target on my landscape identified, I will go deeper sometimes and actually identify key individuals associated with target companies, either the founders and / or key employees.

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing lots of research into the future of web APIs lately, and one area that is definitely gaining more traction is the ability to automate tasks, by defining triggers and actions on top of web APIs. If you&rsquo;ve heard about API automation, it&rsquo;s probably due to the attention If This Then That (IFTTT) and Zapier have been getting. While these are two of the most popular platforms currently, I wanted to dive in and understand the entire landscape. Currently I&rsquo;ve found 8 API automation platforms: Cloudwork - Cloudwork is a service that allows users to automate tasks between Google Apps, Salesforce, Evernote, Zoho, Twitter, Freshbooks, MailChimp, Zendesk, Dropbox, WordPress and others. Elastic.io - Elastic.io is an API integration and orchestration platform for non programmers, offering a simple tool for users to create and run data/API mashups directly from the browser, to automating simple tasks between API platforms. FoxWeave - FoxWeave enables enterprises that are building or using Cloud based Services (SaaS, DBaaS etc) to connect those Services to each other and to external Cloud and On-Premise Apps and Databases. If This Then That (IFTTT) - IFTT is a service that allows anyone to built connections driven from APIs by building channels made up of triggers and actions, bundled into whats IFTT calls recipes, which are triggered every 15 minutes. MashableLogic - MashableLogic is a mashup development platform that provides a system for leveraging API's by turning them into re-usable components that can be combined to compose software solutions. Tarpipe - Tarpipe provides a platform for automate tasks, creating workflows between apps to automate low value tasks, generate activity streams from multiple apps in one place, sync data from one app to another as a background task, and publishing of content to multiple API locations.

			<p><em>21 Aug 2012</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been running a monitoring script every night, so that I could tell when any of the federal department and agency have launched their digital strategy pages, per Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API, and the White House CIO's strategy, entitled "Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" I noticed that many of the departments and agencies aren&rsquo;t properly using HTTP response codes, and when I pulled pages, I often get 302 redirects to 404 pages, so I tended to treat 301, 302, 500 as 404&rsquo;s. Today, I noticed that some of them actually were redirecting to their digital strategies, published at alternate locations, other than directed by the White House strategy, which was [domain]/digitalstrategy. Recognizing this I put in some logic to handle redirects and check if it was a valid strategy page, and after re-running the script I found 11 more digital strategies published, bringing the total to 14 to date: &nbsp; &nbsp; Executive Departments or Agencies Digital Strategy Department of Agriculture (USDA) Department of Commerce Department of Defense (DOD) Department of Education (ED) Department of Justice (DOJ) Department of Labor (DOL) Department of Transportation (DOT) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) General Services Administration (GSA) National Science Foundation (NSF) Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Social Security Administration (SSA) United States Agency for International Development (USAID) With 246 federal departments and agencies, we have a long way to go, but I&rsquo;m optimistic that we&rsquo;ll see enough publish their strategies, identify enough high value data-sets to deploy as APIs, so that the developer community can get to work building some important web and mobile apps or data visualizations. Once the other departments and agencies see what is possible, hopefully we can get more of them on board, creating somewhat of a domino effect for API deployment, getting us closer to a reality where machine readable data is as common...[<a href="/2012/08/21/11-more-federal-departments-and-agencies-have-published-their-api-digital-strategies/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The world around us is being redefined and a new currency is taking shape. Tweets on Twitter, wall posts to Facebook, pictures on Instagram, files on Dropbox and health data via Fitbit are emblematic of the emerging API-driven economy. This data isn&rsquo;t just social, nor just a currency. It is vital personal data that contains details from intimate aspects of our daily lives. Platform players like Facebook and Twitter have shown through their APIs the possibilities that emerge when developers can build, unfettered with their own creativity on top of this data -- enriching people&rsquo;s lives in a richer, more connected way. With the number of social and personal data APIs available today, it is getting increasingly difficult for developers to keep up to speed on which platforms are most important to their end users, the technical differences between each platform&rsquo;s APIs and where to keep up with the changes from each platform as they are rolled out.

			<p><em>19 Aug 2012</em></p>
			<p>
It will be 3 months since the White House CiO Steven VanRoekel released a federal API strategy, entitled "Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People", part of the Executive Order 13571, directing all federal departments and agencies to make open data, content and web APIs the new default.
This Thursday, August 23rd 2012 will be the first major milestone for departments and agencies, where they should have met two goals:

2.1 - Engage with customers to identify at least two existing major customer-facing services that contain high-value data or content as first-move candidates to make compliant with new open data, content, and web API policy
7.1 - Engage with customers to identify at least two existing priority customer-facing services to optimize for mobile use

I&rsquo;ve been monitoring 246 departments and agencies and so far three have released drafts of their strategy:




Department of Commerce




Department of Education (ED)




United States Agency for International Development (USAID)




While the Department of Commerce and Department of Education have only published paragraphs discussing how they are engaging with users, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has identified three datasets for the web API portion and two optimized for mobile use.  All three have published their digital strategy in HTML, XML and JSON formats, meeting the requirements of "machine readable by default".
I anticipate we&rsquo;ll see many more agencies releasing their digital strategies this week, but there is no way to tell how many agencies will be able to get on board with the CIO&rsquo;s strategy in time.  No matter what, the next 3 months will be critical time for APIs in Washington DC, not just because of the presidential election, but the end of November will be the next milestone where agencies are expected to have established an agency-wide governance structure for developing  and delivering digital services via web APIs.

			<p><em>18 Aug 2012</em></p>
			<p>
While out in Washington DC last week I was invited to speak at the Montgomery County Java User Group in Rockville, MD.  Without much of an understanding of who my audience was I chose to talk about the Building Blocks of a Successful API.
There was about 25 developers attending from various companies with a heavy health care influence, since the building that hosted the event was home to several health care technology companies.   There were also developers from firms who contracted with federal agencies ranging from Census to the Department of Defense.
I was pleasantly surprised to find out how hungry many of these developers were for information about the API movement and what is working in the open, public API space.  As with my experience with other enterprise companies, these developers were well versed in APIs in the context of service oriented architecture, but had little experience with the building blocks used by many of the successful public APIs operating today.
My presentation went for about an hour, then we discussed not just the business of APIs, but the politics of APIs for another hour.  With the health care presence in the room, the conversation quickly focused on the challenges around deploying APIs in an industry that is so heavily regulated, but also dominated by several 1000 pound gorillas who really have no interest in opening up data, something that threatens their control and dominance.
If I had more money, I think I could spend 100% of my time traveling around the country talking to user groups like MCJUG.  There is a hunger for information about the tech, business and politics of APIs by developers, and I will be coming back soon to Rockville, MD to talk more about APIs with MCJUG. For now I will keep publishing as much content as I can to help these developers understand APIs.

			<p>Continuing my API Craft road show, I landed in Washington DC for the second week in August.  As I planned my trip to the nations capital, I planted the seeds for an API Craft DC version.
I chose a popular H Street watering hole, the Queen Vic to host the event, and in tune with API Craft PDX and API Craft SFO about 10-15 people showed up to drink beer and discuss APIs, DC Style.

I was impressed with not just the energy for APIs in DC, but the startup buzz occurring in a city, many like to associate with slow moving government bureaucracy.  API Craft DC brought out one API Service Provider APIphany, and an assortment of companies that contract for the government and several other private companies including API geeks from QVC.
API Craft DC has triggered requests for three new gatherings that I will be planning, including API Craft NYC, API Craft Philadelphia and API Craft Atlanta.  Dates coming as soon as I can.

10-15 people showing up seems to be about the normal for these events, and this API craft had a good showing of API Service Providers with 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery and Mashape representing.  Then we had API folks from IFTTT, Pearson and SendGrid.

It was also great to have out fellow evangelist and unicorn herder, @abraham.  The SFO API Craft meetup was another great gathering in a growing trend within the API community, and I plan on having them in every city that I can, I hope you do too!

			<p>
When I started API Evangelist two years ago, I noticed some common practices by API owners, in how they tailored their API areas, and I started calling these API building blocks.  I started a section of the site dedicated to my building block philosphy and showcased what I felt were the most common building blocks across the most successful APIs.
Two years later, and after having viewed just about every API publicly available, I have updated my building blocks section, based upon the practices of 1500 of the most successful APIs.  Along with this update I have also published a white paper called The Building Blocks of a Successful API.
The Building Blocks of a Successful API is not meant to provide detail on implementing these building blocks, but shed light on the common ones used by the top APIs.  The white paper is 32 pages long and provides:

73 Common API Building Blocks, in 18 Categories
30 Top APIs for Review While Planning Your API
Building Block Checklist for Easy Review Before Launch

All of this information is freely available on this site, but will require some clicking to gather across pages and blog posts.  If you can&rsquo;t afford the white paper, I want you to be able to learn what you need to be successful. The Building Blocks of a Successful API is meant to be a single PDF, for you to easily read, and find success in planning your own API.
The Building Blocks of a Successful API is the first in a series of white papers I&rsquo;m producing to provide the resources needed to successfully plan, deploy and manage your APIs while also producing the revenue I need to keep doing the research and writing the drives API Evangelist and API Voice.
Thanks for your support, and I good luck with your API!

			<p><em>08 Aug 2012</em></p>
			<p>When planning an API, I always tell people to go look at as many of the top APIs as they can before crafting their own API strategy. I'm always surprised how many API owners I talk to don't actually use other APIs. They can usually reference the main ones like Twitter and Facebook, or the usual rockstar Twilio--but very few can cite 10 or more APIs they like. Recently I spent some time looking through all of ProgrammableWeb's APIs, and I made a list of the 30 APIs I like, and would reference when designing an API strategy. Since I'm more about the Business of APIs and not just the finer, technical points, these I feel are unique because of their business approach to delivering their API. Here are 30 of the best APIs I think you should look at when planning your own API strategy: Amazon Web Services - Cloud Computing Bitly - URL Shortening Box.net - Cloud Storage Compete - Web Analytics Constant Contact - Small Business Marketing Datasift - Data Marketpalce Disqus - Comments and Discussions Dwolla - Payments Ebay - Products and Online Auctions Etsy - Handmade Marketplace EventBrite - Event Management EverNote - Memory and Notetaking Factual - Data Marketplace Flickr - Images Foursquare - Locations and Check-Ins Full Contact - Contact Intelligence Google Maps - Mapping Google+ - Social Network Instagram - Photos LinkedIn - Business Social Network RapLeaf - Email Contact Intelligence Salesforce - CRM and Sales SendGrid - Email Stripe - Payments The EchoNest - Music Twilio - VoIP and SMS Twitter - Micro Blogging Wolfram Alpha - Computational Knowledge Engine Xero - Accounting Zappos - Shoes and Clothing Not all of these APIs do it perfectly, but each of them have something we can learn from when planning, deploying and managing our own APIs. &nbsp;All of these APIs have an active presence, so I recommend reaching out to them and ask questions about what made them...[<a href="/2012/08/08/thirty-apis-to-look-at-when-planning-your-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I maintain an active list of online services I depend on for my business, in Evernote. Each month I spend an hour or two maintaining this list, to make sure it is complete and actively change my logins when appropriate. As a recovering IT guy, and maintaining infrastructure for myself, but also Audrey Watters--so I keep good tabs on the various services I use. While going through this my services list this month, I added a new section to it, and started tracking if I depend on the service for their API. I have enough automated jobs running on top of APIs I needed to make sure I keep good track of which APIs I depend on. Here are some of the API I depend on to keep my business operational. First I depend on a couple of key Google APIs: Gmail - Integrate my daily emails, as well as email blasts with my administrative system Google Contacts - Keep business and individual profiles in my admin system in sync with my daily Google Contacts activity. Google Calendar - Publish hackathon calendars to Google Calendar as well as keep conferences, meetups and other events I pull through APIs and curate in sync Google Docs - Publish copies of blog posts to Google Docs, as well as version of pages from my content management system to Google Docs Google Sites - All of my research is in Google Sites. So I tend to publish lists of curated news, blog posts and other research to wiki pages under specific projects Next, I would say Amazon Web Services delivers some pretty critical APIs I can't live without: Amazon EC2 - I deploy and shutdown various EC2 instances for various jobs I run for API Evangelist. All APIs are managed on AWS EC2 Amazon S3 - All heavy objects in my systems are stored at Amazon S3 including photos, PDFs, presentations and video Amazon Route 53 - I use...[<a href="/2012/08/02/the-apis-that-i-depend-on-for-my-business/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for extremely simple ways API Evangelists can support their developers without rolling out complex tools or platforms.  The latest approach comes from the Disqus API, and how they are using Twitter to answer developer questions.

Tweet with the hashtag #DisqusFAQ to get your frequently asked questions answered by @disqus!
&mdash; DISQUS (@disqus) July 25, 2012

Using a #hashtag is a great way to allow developers to ask questions without learning some new system or complex process.  They can simply Tweet out their question in real-time, in a format they are hopefully already familiar with.
As an API owner, you can quickly help solve a developers problem, allowing them to get back to developing.  Because of the Twitter 140 character format it will help keep their questions brief.  Then using the Twitter REST API, you can easily pull, filter and integrate FAQs for your API into your master FAQ list.
Thanks Disqus for keeping developer support so simple.

			<p><em>29 Jul 2012</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with my Twitter Advertising account, trying to understand Twitter&rsquo;s path to monetization. The Twitter Advertising interface is pretty clean and simple, allowing me to promote my account or tweets in four easy steps. Step 1 - I can choose the locations where I want to reach users anywhere in the world, in specific countries only or in specific US cities: Step 2 - I can promote my Twitter account prominently in the who to follow section to users that are most likely to be interested in my account--I only pay for new followers that I gain: Step 3 - I can promote my Tweets, prominently displaying them to other users with similar interests: Step 4 - Then plug in my credit cards to pay for the ad spend I setup for my promoted account or tweets: Twitter Advertising is pretty straightforward. I wouldn&rsquo;t call it anything revolutionary. But it is implemented simply, making it work for the masses. I could see businesses adopting it right alongside Google AdWords. By itself Twitter Advertising makes sense, but when you step back and look at it in context of the rest what&rsquo;s going on with the Twitter ecosystem, I wonder if they are seeing the big picture. As a Twitter Advertiser will I be able to: Use the Twitter API to truly understand the space I&rsquo;m advertising in? Track on patterns, opportunities and be able to get at the data I need to make my advertising successful? If I have to pay Gnip or DataSift for my business intelligence, it won&rsquo;t work Have access to an API that gives me full access to the Twitter advertising resource? Allowing me to programmatically tailor my Twitter Advertising campaign It just seems like to me that Twitter is seriously reducing the potential network effect by not including the Twitter API ecosystem in the Twitter Advertising program.

			<p><em>27 Jul 2012</em></p>
			<p>Photo by&nbsp;Nicholas_T APIs are about to enter a new phase, one where developers can easily program using multiple APIs at once, and non-developers can easily introduce API automation into both their business and personal worlds. &nbsp;A time where APIs are seen as a valuable resource anyone can quickly put use, not just as a technical interface only the geekiest of us understand. Web APIs have matured out of its earlier service oriented architecture (SOA) roots, often shedding a rigid SOAP approach to a more flexible RESTful implementation, increased efficiency by opting for more lightweight JSON over bloated XML, and becoming more accessible with API explorers and interactive documentation like Swagger, Mashery I/O Docs, and Apigee&rsquo;s Console. Now with over 6,000 public APIs available, there is a need to get more efficient about how we work with APIs, and evolve to where we can truly program the web. &nbsp;But to get there, we have to add a new platform layer that can help standardize the authentication, interfaces and resource types available--simplifying how not just developers, but average users can take advantage of APIs. One approach is targeting developers with new languages, or extensions of existing languages that can be used to program against one or many APIs, as with Webshell and Temboo: Webshell&nbsp;- A scripting language designed for fast API consumption and implementation Temboo&nbsp;- Platform allowing you to easily choreograph API workflows using Java, PHP, Python, or Ruby&nbsp;code snippets The second approach is targeting a wider audience with automation platforms that create API driven tasks, such as IFTTT, Elastic.io and WhenAUser: IFTTT&nbsp;- IFTTT is a service that lets you create powerful connections with a simple If This Then That statement Elastic.io&nbsp;- elastic.io helps you to automate routine operations and connect multiple cloud APIs. WhenAUser&nbsp;- A simple rules engine that makes APIs tools work together Both approaches provide a much needed platform to help make APIs more accessible, where one is still targeting the developer community and...[<a href="/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Jul 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Embeddable tools like widgets, gadgets and buttons built on top of an API are nothing new. A healthy embeddable strategy was behind the success of popular platforms like Youtube, Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook.
Even with this success, embeddable tools often get overlooked by many companies when planning their APIs.   I was recently introduced to BandPage, formerly known as RootMusic, who made a name for themselves by building a successful band promotion application within the Facebook ecosystem, and have crafted a very interesting embeddable strategy. To recover from a recent Facebook platform change, BandPage employed a robust embeddable strategy to quickly decouple their business from Facebook, enabling bands to not only deploy on Facebook, but manage music, photos, tour dates across the web.

Driving the embeddable band pages is a robust JavaScript API, which isn&rsquo;t publicly available, but at some point it&rsquo;s something they&rsquo;d like to expose.  Calling BandPage&rsquo;s embeddable tools widgets really doesn&rsquo;t do them justice, they have a seriously crack team of developers who&rsquo;ve built a pretty sophisticated platform. &nbsp;Their approach deserves notice, not just for the embeddable strategy, but the way they were able to use it to quickly recover from the changes they encountered in the Facebook ecosystem.
I think a healthy embeddable strategy is something every API owner should craft. &nbsp;The right set of embeddable tools can extend your reach beyond the average developer community, while also allowing your data and resources to exist on any site or platform.   And in the case of BandPage it can also free you from having your wagon hitched to any single platform like Facebook, and open up much wider opportunities for success.

			<p>The current API development space is very self-ruled, in that web API developers have freed themselves of earlier SOA attempts to rigidly define and ultimately constricted API growth, into a more grassroots, community-owned approach to RESTful API design. You can see this happen in real-time on the public Google Group called API Craft. API Craft was started by Apigee, as an open forum for sharing and developing knowledge and skills around APIs, where you can find the latest throughts, from the smartest people in the space. &nbsp; I thoroughly enjoy the online version of API Craft, and just experienced my first offline version of API Craft at OSCON in Portland this week. Several API folks got together for beers and API Craft discussion at the White Eagle Saloon creating an awesome real-time, face-to-face extension of the online API Craft group--an experience I intend to initiate whenever I am in new cities around the country, and I encourage you to do the same. I think Apigee has really started something important and feeling inspired, I wanted to share my thoughts on a definition of API Craft. Deriving from the dictionary definition of craft: "Skill in doing or making something, as in the arts; proficiency" and "The membership of such an occupation or trade; guild." I suggest the following definitions of API Craft: "An online forum for sharing and achieving proficiency in the skill and art of web API design, development and management" and "A physical gathering for discussion of the skill and art of web API design, development and management while enjoying a craft beer and good food." Apigee has started something that has taken on a life of its own, becoming a powerful, community driven approach to evolving the skill and art of web API design, development and management--both on and offline.

			<p>
I was playing with Singly, a unified social API last night. One of the first things I saw, after landing on the home page, were two choices for signing up as a developer--one with Facebook or the other with my Github account.
I&rsquo;m seeing Github as an option for API developer registration, more frequently these days. And it makes sense.  Each of my social networks have a place in my life--Facebook is my more personal social network, Twitter my more public persona, Google is my business platform and Github reflects my developer profile.
When registering for APIs and development centric platforms I&rsquo;d much prefer to keep these associated with my Github profile. And for an API owner it makes sense to have developers linked using Github, because of the social effects and interactions possible with code library repositories and documentation.
With two clicks I was signed up for Singly, using my Github, and I dropped into the dashboard where I was given an option to add my first application and begin integrating.
Developer registration using Github should be standard operating procedure for all APIs. Github is the social network I want APIs to interact with me on, and it is definitely where API owners want to connect with their developers, so they can further interact around code, documentation and all the other geeky goodness Github provides.

			<p><em>18 Jul 2012</em></p>
			<p>Web APIs come in all shapes and sizes. The differences between API authentication, interfaces and data types can be a big challenge when developers work with multiple social networking APIs like Twitter, Facebook and social media APIs like Instagram and Flickr. Each API tends to run with their own interpretation of what a RESTful API means, leaving developers left with navigating not only the differences between various APIs, but the changes a single API will make from version to version. Many industry pundits claim this will become unmanageable. I think its the nature of the web API space, and we should leave API owners to do what they do best, rather than forcing them to agree on standards. &nbsp;Then how will we bridge these difference? This is an important opportunity for providers to step in and aggregate critical APIs within specific sectors, and provide a unified interface that developers can depend on. One example of this in action is Singly. Singly aggregates some of the most important social APIs, simplifying authentication, creating consistent patterns for API endpoints and a unified set of data types to work with across all supported APIs. Singly pays attention to the differences between APIs and versions, so developers can do what they do best--build social applications, using social data from the platforms their users are already on. Immediately the pundits will ask, how can they keep up with all the changes? I respond with how can we not move this industry forward without someone paying attention to it for developers. I see Singly as a necessary component for the API industry to stabilize and move forward. Developers needing to integrate with a single API can visit the API directly, while developers who need to integrate across multiple APIs can depend on Singly. I see opportunities for the Singly model to be applied in other niche areas like location based services, video, restaurants and government to just name a few fast...[<a href="/2012/07/18/a-unified-interface-for-social-apis-with-singly/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Jul 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Next generation payment platform Dwolla just revamped the home page of their developer center to speak to the widest audience possible.  When you land at developers.dwolla.com you are given two options:

I can code - You know the difference between Java and JavaScript and just want to dive into our API documentation
I don't code - You're a non-technical executive, the master of partnerships and products, and want to know why Dwolla is right for you

This is an approach I've been long advocating for, and rarely see in API areas. The best case study I always point out is the LinkedIn developers area, who provide buttons, widgets and embeddable tools that non-developers can put to use.



Why do this? Well according to Dwolla, "One of the biggest misunderstandings about API portals is that their purpose is only for developers. That&rsquo;s just not true. Integrations start with a spark of curiosity, &ldquo;Would this work for my company?&rdquo; Technical or not, who asks that question is irrelevant at that point; how it&rsquo;s answered is what determines the outcome."
Dwolla's approach reflects the core philosophy of why I started API Evangelist.  I'm not advocating just to developers about the power of APIs, I'm evangelizing to the business leaders and decision makers about the power of APIs.
While actually integrating with your API might be a technical endeavor, much of the business decision around using your API will most likely be made by a non-developer.  Make sure your API speaks more than just geek, and reaches as wide an audience as possible.

			<p><em>12 Jul 2012</em></p>
			<p>
As we continue to stress over all the news of API ecosystem battles, and how APIs owners are evil, and once a business grows up, it has to choose between being a hobby developer platform or real grown up business--let&rsquo;s remember the web API pioneers.
Salesforce, eBay and Amazon are all three going strong, making money, treating developers as part of the equation and continue to operate legitimate business via APIs for over a decade now.  These three API pioneers set the stage for the API industry during the first &ldquo;dot com bubble&rdquo; in 2000 and Amazon in 2002, and 10 years later still proving you can become an Internet powerhouse with the help of your API developer ecosystem.

API skeptics always step up and say they are different, that they have core web products, existing business models, etc. Sure, there are differences, but Salesforce, eBay and Amazon have all managed to achieve success with continued investment in their API ecosystem.  None of these platforms have had to restrict or shed their developers to make ends meet, once the utopian API early days are over.
When I read comments, tweets and other noise from people about what fools developers are for depending on an API, I stop and think about these API pioneers.  Developing a large, healthy API ecosystem is not easy--but when you see your API as an essential part of your core platform, and give it the necessary resources, you can strike the harmonious balance necessary to make APIs work.

According to Techcrunch, Twitter suspended Mobber, a platform that rewards users for distributing promoted content through their social media accounts, from using the Twitter API.
Mobber's service is obviously in direct competition with Twitter's Promoted Trends, part of Twitter's suite of advertising products, which also includes promoted accounts and promoted Tweets.
Of course it's Twitter's platform, they can shut off anyone's access, and easily file it under a terms of service violation.  But ultimately wouldn't it make more sense if Twitter opened it's advertising platform with APIs, and allowed developers to innovate, enabling Twitter to still make money, but providing a much wider reach and audience?
Mobber's story is just another casualty in Twitter recent efforts to take control of it's platform, leaving developers to wonder, who is next?

			<p>I&rsquo;m closely following the Oracle v Google case playing out in a court of law right now, and more specifically the Tweet stream of Wired writer, Caleb Garling. According to Garling: "A jury has ruled that Google infringed on Oracle&rsquo;s copyrights in building a new version of the Java platform for its Android mobile operating system, but it was unable to reach a decision on whether this infringement was acceptable under the law." Google quickly moved for a mistrial based upon this incomplete decision, and in a statement to Wired, Google says: "We appreciate the jury's efforts, and know that fair use and infringement are two sides of the same coin,&rdquo; reads a canned statement from Google sent to Wired. "The core issue is whether the APIs here are copyrightable, and that&rsquo;s for the court to decide. We expect to prevail on this issue and Oracle&rsquo;s other claims". The case is now moving into other areas which include patent infringement, but today&rsquo;s portion is what I&rsquo;m most concerned about, dealing with the API copyright vs. fair use, when Google "mimicked" 37 APIs used by the Java platform while building a new Java engine for Android. While Java APIs During this case Judge William Alsup defined copyright by saying: "Copyright protects the "expression of ideas" but not a procedures, processes, systems, methods of operation, concepts, principles, or discoveries." I&rsquo;m not 100% sure where I stand on copyright of APIs, I have a lot more education and contemplation to do on the subject. My gut reaction is concern. If you can&rsquo;t mimic an API interface, what will this do for innovation and growth in the API space? One API I depend on daily is the Pinboard API. Pinboard provides an essential bookmarking API I use in my curation, which is modeled after Delicious. This is right off the Pinboard API documentation page: "In order to make life convenient for developers, wherever possible the Pinboard API uses the...[<a href="/2012/07/10/where-do-i-learn-more-about-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

Acquisition of technology startups by companies is a regular part of business today, providing a way for these companies to get the technology, talent, as well as user and market share they need to be successful. These acquisitions play an important part of API ecosystems, with API owners hoping developers build the next killer feature that users will love, something they can invest in, and developers dream API owners will notice their work and purchase their &ldquo;startup&rdquo;.
Looking back at the acquisitions made by a company can function as a sort of &ldquo;tea leaves&rdquo;, allowing us to interpret the companies motivations, possibly telling us where they are headed and who they might acquire next. As part of my&nbsp;Twitter research&nbsp;I wanted to look at the acquisitions made by Twitter over its six year history:

			<p>When covering the API space, it is easy to talk about the APIs that are doing it wrong. When Twitter gets ready to screw over developers, Facebook breaks something or Google changes their approach--the blogosphere and twittersphere eats it up. What is harder, is finding the stories about success in the space. I see a lot of comments on recent posts about how developers are fools for every believing in APIs, and what positive outcomes have their been with APIs? Has there been a great success story of building a company around an API/platform (not an OS) you don't control? Does that ever end well? &mdash; Tim Carmody (@tcarmody) July 2, 2012 In response, I always step up with Twilio. Twilio is the poster boy of how to do it right. They just get it. Ok, we use Twilio a lot, I admit. After Twilio I tell people to look at Stripe. Another great example of an API centric company, who elegantly solves a problem with a dead simple, but powerful API. After Twilio and Stripe. I try to think about some of my favorite APIs from the past, the social pioneers that helped kick things off--APIs like Flickr and Delicious. Flickr Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase "Biz Dev 2.0", which was a driving force behind the Flickr API originally. Ok, Flickr and Delicious are the past, leaving a little to be desired after acquisitions, but another API from the past that really doesn&rsquo;t get much bad API press is eBay. Have you taken a look at the eBay API ecosystem lately? They have APIs that are there to help make the API ecosystem more efficient. Let&rsquo;s take it one notch further. One reason I believe in APIs, is my personal experience deploying mission critical infrastructure with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS I deployed web, mail and database services with Amazon EC2 and delivered content ranging from PDF files to streaming video...[<a href="/2012/07/01/not-all-apis-are-bad/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Jun 2012</em></p>
			<p>Twitter has become a global communication platform, allowing anyone in the world to express anything, from simple everyday thoughts, to ideas that some say have the potential to be the seeds of revolution. Twitter&rsquo;s success was made possible because of open access to Twitter via the web and mobile phones via either SMS or native apps--with a large portion of this access made possible via an open Twitter API. While the Twitter API is still showcased as an important part of the platform, access via the API is certainly not what it used to be. While most every feature on Twitter.com is accessible via the API, overall access has been diminished through what is known as &ldquo;rate limiting&rdquo;. Rate limits began in 2007, to help limit the load on Twitter servers by reducing the number of calls anyone can make in an hour. But over 6 years these rate limits morphed into not just hourly limits, but to restricted access to Twitter increasingly valuable data stores--something that is not at all related to server stability. Restricting Access As the importance and value of the Twitter data grows, API access limits have become an vital tool for Twitter to tame the Twitter API ecosystem. Twitter has also slowly establish 100% control over web and mobile clients, while also setting the stage for the commoditization of Tweets, creating a new ecosystem where only sanctioned firehose partners are allowed to provide API access. While the Twitter firehose began as a way to provide wider access to developers, and not as a monetization strategy, it has become just that--a way for Twitter to monetize each and every Tweet, leaving access to Twitter data looking something like this: Provider Access Cost License Twitter REST API 350 calls per hour and 1500 total Tweets via search and 3500 total for a user's timeline FREE Display Twitter Streaming API 400 track keywords, 5,000 follow user ids, and 25 0.1-360 degree locations FREE...[<a href="/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m on a roll tonight, writing about tension between API owners and consumers. After some driving around California this week, I&rsquo;ve had time to ponder three recent episodes with Netflix, LinkedIn and Craigslist. This is my last post tonight, and was inspired by a Tweet from James Watters (@wattersjames): RT @kinlane: Tension Between API Owners and Consumers - bit.ly/MtqeoR via @kinlane &lt;-API economy welcomes its early trade wars &mdash; James Watters (@wattersjames) June 24, 2012 I thought about his Tweet for the last week and he&rsquo;s right. While it&rsquo;s easy to run and get our pitchforks in these situations and demonize API owners, or bitch about how much API developers suck, this all is just the beginning of something greater--the API economy. Trade wars are an active part of our global economy, and with the growth in the number of APIs, the tension between API owners and consumers is only going to grow. We can&rsquo;t see them as black or white, we will have to evaluate them on a case by case basis. I think my three posts tonight reflect the potential diversity in issues. Netflix - The movie industry isn&rsquo;t quite ready for public APIs, other change required first, sorry developers LinkedIn - A little communication can go a long ways in how we approach terms of service violations Craigslist - Sometimes the market just demands that you need an API, allowing you to tame scrapers James Watters Tweet definitely made me look at this issues in a different light. And that is what I love about this space, it is constantly changing, forcing me to constantly reevaluate how I see things and tell stories in the space. And even before I can finish this post John Sheehan (@johnsheehan) has got me thinking about another angle all three of these stories share: @kinlane all 3 posts hit on one thing: API use has to drive value for the company providing it not just the...[<a href="/2012/06/29/the-api-economy-welcomes-its-early-trade-wars/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Jun 2012</em></p>
			<p>After looking at over 6000 APIs, the most irritating thing for me when reviewing an API, is when I have to work to figure out what an API does. &nbsp;Many APIs just don't communicate what their API does and articulate the value for developers. Every API should have a quick introductory paragraph at the top of the first page that clearly defines the API in 250 words or less. Many APIs have a description, but it often reads like this: The [Insert Company Name Here] API delivers programmatic access to all the features available in the [Insert Company Name Here] web application. Developers can use the API to build web and mobile applications using the functionality it provides. Ok? You just told me nothing. I have no idea what your core web application does, or your API. The second worse offense I see API owners commit, is they get all RESTful on you: The [Insert Company Name Here] API delivers RESTful access to the features available in the [Insert Company Name Here] web application. Using the API you can construct URLs and GET or POST information to the API and receive either XML or JSON responses. Ok? You just told me nothing. You gave me a brief introduction to REST. Not very helpful. Often times I have to go to the parent website to figure out what a company does, before I understand the value of an API. As an API owner, make sure and provide a quick, concise description of your API and the value it delivers. Don&rsquo;t assume developers are in your head or understand what your company does. When writing your description, give it to someone who knows nothing about your company and see if they can figure out what it does. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to work to understand what your API does. Describe the value to me, quickly make me understand how it will help me, so I have the motivation...[<a href="/2012/06/27/what-does-your-api-do/">Read More</a>]</p>

I&rsquo;m still working on my thoughts about both of these, but in the meantime I can't help but think about the tension between API owners and their consumers. This tension doesn&rsquo;t exist in all ecosystems, but seems default by nature in others. In these flare ups, I can&rsquo;t help but empathize with both sides and see each others perspective: API Owners - This is my company, our resources and our brand. I may &ldquo;eat our own dog food&rdquo; to show I share your pain, but I really don&rsquo;t understand the developer perspective because I don&rsquo;t use other people&rsquo;s APIs, let alone depend on them for my business livelihood. I appreciate the work that&rsquo;s going on within the ecosystem, but I also have to keep my bosses happy and maintain relationships with our partners and vendors. API Consumers - It&rsquo;s hard when I can&rsquo;t figure out an API or find the right info that will make it easier for me to on-board. It&rsquo;s even harder when there is nobody to respond to my questions. It really frustrates me when I can&rsquo;t get the access I need to be successful, even when I&rsquo;m willing to pay. It&rsquo;s even worse when I spend tens or hundreds of hours on a project or startup idea only to see you build it or even worse cut off my access because you feel threatened by me. Both sides of the ecosystem can get along, you see it happen with APIs like Twilio, Stripe and even Amazon Web Services. There will be problems within ecosystem, but not all APIs are looking to screw over developers and not all developers are looking to exploit APIs. I think in the beginning it can be fairly easy to maintain order in an API area, but as it evolves and the community of consumers...[<a href="/2012/06/24/tension-between-api-owners-and-consumers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>This is a much quicker follow-up to last week&rsquo;s post, Where Is The Open Source API Platform, than I anticipated. I just finished a demo of WSO2 API Manager, a completely open-source API management platform. I got quite a few emails and DM&rsquo;s from folks after that post, and while there are other open-source API offerings like API Axle and Cumula (which I will write about separately), I was looking for a full platform tool, and it appears WSO2 is what I was looking for. WSO2 API Manager is a simple, easy to understand API platform, but has all the hardened enterprise goodness many of you will be looking for when it comes to security, governance, policy enforcement, etc. The platform is broken into three main buckets: API Gateway - To secure, protect, manage, and scale API calls API Publisher - Enables API providers to easily publish their APIs, share documentation, provision API keys, and gather feedback on APIs features, quality and usage API Store - Provides a space for consumers to discover APIs functionality, test APIs online, subscribe to APIs, evaluate them and interact with API publishers They break the API users into what I think are important target segments: API Creator - The technical owner of an API API Publisher - The business owner of an API API Consumer - The developer or consumer of an API I really like this distinction, because it acknowledges that many APIs are not born out of technical departments, and allows for duel ownership of any API from the technical and business disciplines-- which is very important to the success of an API. WSO2 API Manager meets my vision because its a platform that has the identity, proxy and other essential technical pieces, but provides an extensible platform to deliver the other building blocks for a successful API like documentation, code samples, how-tos, forums, etc. WSO2 has a target of end of July for the version 1.0...[<a href="/2012/06/19/the-100-open-source-api-platform-i-was-looking-for/">Read More</a>]</p>

Last May, Pearson Publishing began the roll-out of their new API platform, by doing initial tests using their DK&rsquo;s Eyewitness Travel Guide material, before moving on to a wider range of subjects.  By the end of the summer they had rolled out a total of three APIs:

Eyewitness Guides
FT Press
Longman Dictionary

A year later, they now have APIs for the Pearson Kitchen Manager and most recently the Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API.
Pearson is obviously being very cautious with their precious business assets. Taking time to do it right when bundling up these resources and making available for developers via a RESTful interface.
The Pearson Developers community has many of the essential API building blocks like documentation, blog, forum, and FAQ. Registration for Pearson APIs is self-service, allowing me to immediately verify my email, login and begin exploring the APIs.
For support, Pearson provides a contact form while also maintaing an active presence on Twitter, and even provides a "report a bug" feature for each API. &nbsp;The terms of of use for Pearson APIs is pretty liberal, allowing to me use their content in my commercial applications, even if I use advertising.
Pearson has a done well in opening up their content with APIs.  They&rsquo;ve done it wisely, requiring registration so they can track how its used, but keeping registration self-service and providing sensible terms of use, so they are protected, but also giving developers enough freedom so they can get to building apps and innovating around their content.
It makes sense for Pearson to take it slowly and learn with each API implementation, making sure they do it right.  I think Pearson&rsquo;s simplistic approach to opening up their catalog is a great example for other publishers to follow.

			<p>Its been over six months since I did my roundup of 11 API service providers on ProgrammableWeb. &nbsp;I've been seeing enough new entries into the space, I think its time to do another roundup, providing a single list of API service providers for you to explore. I will start with I called the grandfathers of the space. &nbsp;The ones who were doing it before APIs became all cool. Atmosphere&nbsp;- The SOA Software, Atmosphere&trade; provides a secure, robust platform that companies can use to share their APIs with the developer community of their choice. SOA Software Atmosphere manages, monitors, and secures companies&rsquo; APIs ensuring that they deliver the level of service customers and partners require; the security of corporate and customer information and assets; and the integrity of the corporate brand.&nbsp; Layer 7 Technologies&nbsp;- Layer 7 is a leading provider of security and management products for API-driven integrations spanning the extended hybrid enterprise. Layer 7 products simplify the management of open API for developer communities, partner and cross-divisional integration via SOA, cloud connectivity, and enterprise mobile enablement for BYOD (bring-your-own-device) initiatives.&nbsp; After my post in October of 2011, two other providers came out of the woodwork and said, "Hey! what about us? &nbsp;We've been doing this a while too!" &nbsp;So I have to include them this time. Intel&nbsp;- Intel&reg; Expressway Service Gateway provides an enforcement point for REST web services messages and can delegate authentication and authorization to identity management and PKI systems such as Active Directory and CA* Siteminder. It provides a secure point of entry to fend off denial of service threats, code injection, and other malicious traffic.&nbsp; Vordel&nbsp;- Vordel API Gateway is a policy enforcement point to authenticate API clients and users against enterprise access management platforms. Vordel adds advanced capabilities such as security token mediation for single sign-on and identity federation. Vordel API Gateway also integrates with fine-grained authorization tools to externalize authorization for new and legacy applications.

I&rsquo;ve had some amazing feedback on my post about&nbsp;the demand for API and developer evangelists.  One great perspective was from the team over at Iron.io, who do cloud messaging, event handling, workers, scheduling and provide a key/value data caching.
Ironi.io&rsquo;s has a unique company philosophy that addresses the need hire an API or developer evangelist.  Their approach is that in an API-driven company everybody is an API and developer evangelist.   Iron.io has their entire team monitoring their public chat, which has lead to everyone in the company understanding customer pain points as well as hearing the praise and positive feedback from the community.

While it sounds simple, spreading core philosophies like this company-wide can have a transformative power.  Think of Amazon&rsquo;s success after Jeff Bezos mandated that, "All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces."
Sometimes it&rsquo;s the little things that can provide huge shifts in how we think.  A cornerstone of my API Evangelism philosophy is internal evangelism within a company about the power of APIs, in addition to public and partner evangelism.  Iron.io&rsquo;s philosophy changes this for me.
I know that not all companies can make the shift to API-driven companies, but if an entire company can adopt an API-centric frame of mind and share the evangelism role across the company, there is no need for a single API or developer evangelist.
Maybe API evangelist is more of a philosophy than an actual role your company needs to fill?

			<p>Every couple weeks I get posts that really strike a chord with my audience, like Barack Obama Directs All Federal Agencies to Have an API, which has received 40K+ page views and 1000+ tweets. When it comes to sustained traffic numbers, two posts seem to really bring in eyeballs each and every week via organic searches: Open Building Blocks for an API Open Source API Billing and Traffic Control These posts are successful, not because of searches driven from a couple of hours on the home page of Reddit or Hacker News, these get page views because users are searching for open source API tools on the open Internet. Seeing these sustained numbers validates for me the need for an fully open-source set of tools for API deployment and management. While the top API management service providers like 3Scale, Apigee, Layer7, Mashery and SOA Software are enjoying growth in API adoption, to reach a million APIs and a truly healthy API industry, we need a solid open-source API platform that provides: RESTful Framework for Deployment and Management API Analytics and Metering API Service and Billing Management Ecosystem Building Blocks Like Documentation, Code Samples, etc. Discovery I know there are individual tools that deliver in some of these area, and this is what I am working to bring together via the API Evangelist tools section. But we need a full suite of tools that API owners can deploy from start to finish, and service providers can benefit from as well as contribute to--something in PHP, Python, Ruby and / or Java. While looking through thousands of APIs I notice that many of them go silent about 6 months after launch, which tells me many of them spent their resources on development, deployment and initial management--not leaving resources for properly handling the business of their APIs, allowing them to evolve, pivot and find success.

			<p><em>11 Jun 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I just got off the phone with a recruiter of a major API management company, looking to recruit me as a developer evangelist, and last week I talked with two companies looking for developer evangelists.
My profile comes up in a lot of searches on Google, LinkedIn , and with the growing number of APIs, the number of companies looking to fill the role, grows as well. It makes sense that I come up in searches and get a regular stream of calls.
Most recruiters I decline, as I&rsquo;m looking to pay attention to the bigger picture, beyond just a single API--and tell them I will put out a signal to my network, about the role.  I do this knowing, there really is nobody to fill the role.
The recruiter today asked an interesting question.  If you're not available, what type of person should I be looking for?  In my mind, an evangelist should be equal parts:

Engineer
Product Development
Business Development
Sales
Marketing

So if you can find anyone coming from one of those disciplines, but has the technical chops and isn&rsquo;t afraid of programming-I recommend starting with whichever of those skillsets is most important to you.
Ideally you want to find someone who has been programming for years, but recently has been a lead developer or architect, and has upper management experience as well as understands the business and customer end of operations.
If you fit the profile of an API or developer evangelist, or are just curious about the role, drop me a line I&rsquo;d like to talk more, there is potentially a huge demand out there for your skills.

I have a workflow for dealing with the steady stream of ideas that fly out of my arse on a daily basis.  First, I write them all down in Evernote.  If an idea sticks with me and keeps nagging on me in the back of my mind, I usually give it a place on the internal wiki that I use for managing my world.  Then if an idea sits on the wiki for over a year and I haven&rsquo;t finished building it, and successfully deployed or integrated into my platform--I set it free.
The one year expiration date has come for one of my ideas, and I want to publish here so maybe someone else will run with it.

Project Idea: RESTGit
Summary: A RESTful interface for any public or private Github repository.

I just want a quick way of throwing up a RESTful front, with or without authentication using 3Scale API management. RESTGit would deploy any flavor of language I choose: PHP, Python, Ruby, Java or anything else.
This way I could take select code resources I possess, commit them to a Github repository--then point RESTGit at the repository, and it would generate a REST framework and allow me to customize and adjust as needed.
RESTGit would be open source of course.  It could be deployed as an Amazon EC2 instance, letting me rapidly deliver APIs for any resources I posses and scale as needed using AWS.
I wish I had more time to invest in my side projects, but I&rsquo;d rather see it implemented.  Hopefully one of you readers will find the time to develop RESTGit and open source it for everyone to use.

			<p>Right after security, controlling your brand is the biggest concern I get from companies interested in deploying APIs. They are worried about being able to control their brand and overall message portrayed by their potential developer community. Branding guidelines and a robust image, button and UI gallery is something I encourage API owners to invest in from day one, because it&rsquo;s easier to set the stage early on than trying to take control after the unicorns are running wild. One example of this is the darling of the API industry, Twitter. Twitter has took further control of their brand today, with the release of #Twitterbird. As Twitter states: Starting today you&rsquo;ll begin to notice a simplified Twitter bird. From now on, this bird will be the universally recognizable symbol of Twitter. (Twitter is the bird, the bird is Twitter.) There&rsquo;s no longer a need for text, bubbled typefaces, or a lowercase &ldquo;t&rdquo; to represent Twitter. The #TwitterBird is the latest addition to the Twitter Trademark and Content Display Policy, where Twitter lays down the following branding guidelines for the Twitter ecosystem: Assortment of Twitter approved images Dos and Don'ts of using Twitter images How to use buttons to promote your Twitter account Use of Twitter brand in advertising and marketing materials Use of Twitter brand in merchandise and manufactured items Naming your applications, products and domains How to visually design your website What to do when your writing a book or publication about Twitter How to display Tweets and other Twitter content We&rsquo;ve come a long ways from 2008 and 2009 where logos, buttons, badges and other Twitter branding items were yet another area where Twitter depended on the Twitter ecosystem for support.

I look at a lot of APIs, the first page you land on makes a big impression, and I can always tell when someone cares enough about developers to craft a simple, quality API Area landing page.
I&rsquo;ve talked about what it takes to qualify for my API stack, and today&rsquo;s winner for simply and elegantly qualifying for the API stack is iContact.

Upon landing on the iContact Developers Area main page I visually see what I need to get going:

Get Started
Self-Service Registration
Documentation
Code Samples
Resources
Blog

Then in the footer you can immediately connect with other areas of the company:

Legal
Twitter
Facebook
LinkedIn

The iContact Developers Area landing page is well crafted and as a developer, makes you feel like someone considered you while designing.  You can quickly get at what you need to start integrating and you feel like someone is there to support you as well as keep the API up and running.
What impression does your API area landing page say about your API?

			<p>Mobile is fueling a lot of API growth right now. Or is it APIs fueling a lot of Mobile growth right now? Either way, APIs and Mobile go together like chocolate and peanut butter (or Nutella as my girlfriend would say). With this growth in mobile, we are seeing a rise of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers, delivering a basic stack of storage, messaging, notifications, user management and other essential components for mobile developers. The goal of MBaaS providers is to make it very easy for developers to setup and operate a backend for any application. After delivering the essentials like storage, messaging access, push notifications, etc., it makes sense that now developers will need easier integration with the data and resources available in web APIs. MBaaS provider Kinvey is doing just that. Using ql.io, a declarative, evented, data-retrieval and aggregation gateway for HTTP APIs, they are bringing web APIs to developers, like GeoPlaces data using Google Places, product data from Ebay&rsquo;s Product API and social data using Twitter. Kinvey is baking in the most popular and valuable web APIs right into the Kinvey SDK, making data from APIs as easy to access, as data in your local Kinvey data store. Kinvey will deliver an abstracted layer on top of each API, storing data into tables, making them accessible using common queries like SELECT, FROM and WHERE. They will even let you do JOINS on multiple data sources, allowing you to mashup and improve API data performance. Kinvey will take on the heavy lifting associated with the differences between APIs and maintain access between different API versions. I&rsquo;m assuming with the amount of work involved, Kinvey will be only delivering the most valuable of web APIs or at least the most stable. Sounds like API owners need to start building relationships with Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers, as this might be the doorway to the next round of growth in your...[<a href="/2012/06/03/rise-of-mobile-backend-as-a-service-mbaas-api-stacks/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Jun 2012</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m excited about Barack Obama directing all federal agencies to have an API. The President has given federal agencies 90 days to create a page on its website, located at www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy, to publicly report progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable format, and implement the requirements of the Strategy within 12 months. As I said in my post, I wanted to setup a page to monitor this activity. I found a dataset of federal executive branch Internet domains, thanks to Anthony Sutardja, one of my readers. In the dataset there are 1467 domains, with 106 distinct agencies running those domains. The President states "executive department and agencies" in his directive. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t imagine we are going to see digital strategies in 90 days for all 1467 domains? I&rsquo;m assuming it will occur within the top level agencies first. But I&rsquo;m very curious see which agency domains follow, so I&rsquo;m going to leave all of them up. I created a script that will poll www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy for each agency. I will run this every night this year. The script checks the HTTP status code for the page, records it with a time stamp, and the we&rsquo;ll see who returns HTTP status code 200(OK) first. Quick note: It&rsquo;s interesting to see which agency doesn&rsquo;t properly use status codes, but that is another issue. Anyone want to wager on who is first, and how many of the 1467 meet the requirements for posting their strategy and ultimately implementing APIs? Personally I&rsquo;m hoping for CIA and the NSF. Think of the mashups you could make!!! I all seriousness, this is extremely important. If agencies meet these requirements, we can see a radically different federal government in the coming years.

			<p>I wanted to publish some thoughts, on what Federal Agencies responding to the Executive Order 13571 issued on April 27, 2011, and the White House CIO&rsquo;s, "Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" strategy should be considering. These thoughts are in the business and marketing aspects web API deployment, with light thoughts in the technical areas. My speciality is not with technical deployment of APIs, I recommend agency leaders visit API-Craft, an industry forum with some seriously smart API industry leaders discussing the finer, technical points of web API deployment. Where I would like to share some thoughts is in the business of deploying and managing Federal Agency APIs. Insights evolved over 20+ years in the technology field, but exclusively spending the last 2 years studying the business of popular APIs like Twitter and Facebook, and larger API providers like Google and Amazon Web Services. I&rsquo;m sharing my thoughts, not to benefit any company, but because I strongly believe in the transformative powers of Web APIs. Web APIs have the power to change the way our Government operates both internally, and with the public. Barack Obama&rsquo;s mandate, &ldquo;requiring agencies to establish central online resources for outside developers and to adopt new standards for making applicable Government information open and machine-readable by default&rdquo;, marks an important point in history. We can&rsquo;t screw this up! While much of the discussion around this announcement on Twitter, Reddit and Hacker News is positive, there is a lot of skepticism around whether the government can succeed. With this post, I wanted to share some thoughts on the essential building blocks we&rsquo;ll need to make this work. Technical Building BlocksI will only speak lightly on essential technical building blocks that need go into Federal Agencies Web APIs, but there are a couple I consider essential: Access - Idenitying proper access levels for web APIs, leaving open when possible, requiring keys when needed and implementing oAuth...[<a href="/2012/06/02/thoughts-for-federal-agencies-about-to-deploy-web-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>
