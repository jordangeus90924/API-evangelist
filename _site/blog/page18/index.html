			<p><em>19 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was reading a post about how having an&nbsp;unclear sense of ownership hurts API security, which showcases the different views on who owns security, when it comes to exposing corporate digital assets via APIs. When I read the title, I anticipated the story being about a difference in how ownership of the asset(s) itself is viewed, but it ended up focusing on the ownership of security itself, not ownership of the assets which are being exposed -- something I think gets closer to the root of the problem, than who "owns security".&nbsp; In short, the IT and developers who are often charged with exposing corporate assets via APIs will view those digital resource in some very different ways, than other people at the company. These groups will focus on exposing digital resources in a very technical sense, making them available so that others can integrate into their apps and systems--it isn't always in their nature to secure things sensibly. Their focus is to open up access, something the article touches on, but is something I think it goes deeper than just being about API security. Developers and IT are rarely ever going to see the digital resource in the same way that business stakeholders will, let alone security focused players (hopefully your IT and dev team has specialist influencing things). APIs have made a name for themselves because a handful of companies successfully exposed their digital resources in this new way, allowing external perspectives of those digital resources to enter the conversation, which allowed for innovation to occur. In this handful of API origin stories we tell like to tell, owners of the digital resources at play were open to outside views of what their digital resource was, and how that resource could be put to use. These leading companies were open to an alternative view of the ownership and access of these digital resources, something that allowed API platforms to flourish &lt;&lt; This is...[<a href="/2016/04/19/competing-views-around-the-value-and-ownership-of-digital-resources-impacting-api-security/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I track on the API operations of around 2000 companies. Honestly, most of the 10K+ APIs in the ProgrammableWeb API directory have long been gone, deprecated, acquired, and had the lights shut off. There are only a couple thousand companies, institutions, organizations, and government who are doing public APIs, with only a couple hundred doing them in an interesting way. This should not diminish the API conversation, as public APIs are just one aspect of the API discussion, and honestly it is one are that not all companies and organizations will have the stomach for. However, a certain amount of available public APIs will always play an important role in setting the tone for the entire API space, providing us with a (hopefully a diverse amount of) lead(s) when it comes to crafting our own strategies for operating our businesses on the Internet. Very little of what I do as the API Evangelist involves ideas that originate from my own head, and is something that requires a wealth of examples which I can point to in the wild.&nbsp; I am working on new ways to earn a living, while also generating research, analysis, code, and specification that the API sector can put to use in their own operations. One way I will be doing this, is by publishing technology, businesses, and politics of API design guides. This isn't API design as in the sense of REST, and how you craft endpoints, it is design thinking around the operations of your API. I learn a ton, flipping through the API portals of the 2000+ companies I keep an eye on, and I wanted to carve off small chunks of this, and share with you. One area of API operations that has always fascinated me, and is one of the original founding focuses of API Evangelist, is how companies craft their API plans and pricing. Whether or not an API has a plans &amp; pricing page is...[<a href="/2016/04/16/the-pricing-amp-plans-for-250-api-platforms/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was going through the Expedia Affiliate Network again yesterday, as part of my Travel Stack Network work. Having individual research projects that pop up on my radar, and force to me take a fresh look at API providers is a huge part of what I do. As I was going through their portal, taking a fresh look at things, their approved developer catalog&nbsp;was something that stood out for me. A list of approved developers for any API is something I get asked about fairly regularly, so I want to keep referencing examples when I come across in the wild. Each developer entry in the catalog has the following details: Logo - A company logo, or photo of individual developer. Name - Name of the company or devloper. Title - The title of the developer that is available. Website - A dedicated website for the developer. Address - The physical or mailing address. Email - An individual or company email address. Office Phone - The office / business line for developer. Mobile Phone - A mobile phone for developer. Company Description - Details about the company. Developer Overview - Any additional details about developers. Sample(s) Of Work - Samples of work with title, description, and a link. In the big picture, I would bundle developer programs, and catalogs as just another layer of a partner program for any platform. Developer would just be an additional tier, sharing most of the same characteristics of other partner programs. I'll have to figure out how to clearly articulate the developer portion, and coherently weave into my existing partner research. I'd like to see mature partner and developer programs operating within every API out there. I'm hoping we'll see this dimension of regular operations gain traction, alongside some of the tightening down of API programs I am seeing, and API providers work to get to know their ecosystems better. In my opinion, it will all work together to help...[<a href="/2016/04/15/providing-an-approved-developer-catalog-for-your-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I sign up for a lot of APIs, and I am always surprised at what I see, or don't see, when I first signup for an API service. Personally I really enjoy the ones that have a simple, getting started formula to their signup emails. I signed up for Rosette a text analytics API yesterday, and I thought their registration email was a good example of this.

This is all I do in the space, is explore, and experience the various APIs available today, and share my thoughts about what I see. I'm looking to organize these elements, into best practices that I can share with other companies as they work on their own strategies. Oh, I also look to apply some of these to my own operations -- I know my registration process needs some love too.
Eventually I will pull together the best of the signup / registration emails I get, and pull together a best practices checklist, that can be used as guide for setting up your own email format. Let me know if you need help in this area, and I'll expedite this work.

			<p><em>14 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>
Over the last five years many of us have been pushing forward our API design skills to deliver valuable resources to mobile apps. The multi channel opportunity for delivering data, content, and other resources to not just websites, and web applications, but also to iPhone, Android, Windows, and other mobile platform is clear. Alongside delivering web apps to multiple browsers (IE, Chrome, and Firefox), we had to learn to deliver to an increasingly diverse mobile ecosystem (iOS, Android, Windows).
When you have an API core, crafting new endpoints that speak to new channels is not as daunting of a task. I'm thinking through how to deliver API Evangelist knowledge into a Slack channel, Facebook Messenger discussions, and via Alex Voice for use at our APIStrat Conference in Boston this fall. Whether I am creating bots, or delivering new skills to voice enablement, I'm just adding new design constraints to my already existing stack of things I consider when I'm crafting my API stack(s).
I can't help but be in tune with the frenzy around bots, and the interesting things AWS is doing within the Alexa ecosystem. I do not feel like it is a distraction from my core business, as I'm just applying some new design constraints to what I am already doing. I'm not chasing entirely new things, I'm just responding, and participating in what the latest shifts in what technology are.
I don't feel like any of the 50 areas of the API space that I'm keeping an eye on are distractions, as long as I stay true to my API core, and they help me critically think through, and apply new design constraints to the core business value I am already bringing to the table.

			<p><em>13 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am working to identify the low hanging fruit for deploying APIs at Davidson College. It is a process where I target the domain, at the request of someone on campus, then slowly spider the website over a couple week period, and identify CSV, XML, XLS, and JSON files, as well as any tables with over five rows--now I"m also tracking on the presence of any HTML form.&nbsp; At the same time I'm talking with Form.io about some of their case studies and client implementations, working to better understand how their form-centric API solution is making an impact with small business owners. Form.io lets anyone built forms, which then does all the heavy lifting of deploying an API that drives each of the form implemented. I am finding it very valuable to hear about the inroads they are making with businesses, as an API solution, because they speak using "forms"--a language that the average business user often understands. When it comes to APIs, not everyone has a ready to go implementation in mind for how an API can be used to publish data and content to a website or mobile app, but a greater number of people will understand the need to fill out a form, and have it publish to a central place. I am feeling like this opens up an opportunity to educate the normals about APIs, when it is done in the service of form submissions, eliminating PDF, or even the printed form. I am adding forms to my list of how I identify low hanging fruit for APIs. I will be tracking on the forms that companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies have on their site, and using as one potential opportunity for some API literacy. I'll also think about other ways that I can use the concept of a form, to help normals understand the possibilities with APIs -- I just wanted to kick off this exploration, as I see...[<a href="/2016/04/13/using-forms-as-an-introduction-to-world-of-apis-for-normals/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I spend my days mapping out the API life cycle, keeping track of what I consider to be the 50+ areas of a modern API life cycle, based upon the approach I am seeing from leading providers. One area of this life cycle I'm spending way more time than I want to be lately, is in the area of API deprecation.&nbsp; This is why I conduct my API research in the way that I do, because when people approach me for advice, guidance, or brain dump in any of these areas, I have a wealth of resources I can pull from. Sadly I have a couple of folks ask me for input on what I'd consider to be a good approach to individual API deprecation, as well as entire company, platform, and API deprecation. Sadly, there very few "good approaches" to shutting down your APIs in the wild. Luckily there are quite a number of very bad approaches available, that we can reverse engineer, and begin putting together a scaffolding for what might be some possible best practices, when it comes to API deprecation.&nbsp; I went through what I had curated as part of my API deprecation research, and assembled these common building blocks: Types Individual API Endpoints - Looking to have a plan for the deprecation of individual APIs, or sets of APIs. Individual API Tooling - An approach to how you deprecate one of the client solutions available on API platform. Entire Platform Shutdown - What is the plan for an entire platform shutdown, ceasing all API operations. Enter Platform Safe Mode - What is the plan for just putting the platform into safe mode, and still operating. Runway Initial Expectation Set - What expectations are, or have been set early on in the API design, and deployment parts of the life cycle when it comes to API deprecation. Legal Department - What legally has been provided in terms of service, privacy policy,...[<a href="/2016/04/13/some-of-the-common-building-blocks-of-api-deprecation/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I get approached by folks all the time who are looking to do APIs at their company, organization, institution, or government agency. The reasons behind these desires to do APIs vary widely. Some want to do API to deliver a specific web or mobile app, while many others just understand they need to get started somewhere, but are unsure of exactly where to begin with this daunting, never-ending task.&nbsp; In these situations I always tell people to start with the low hanging fruit, which means, if its already on your website, it should also be available as an API. If you are publishing data or content to your website, as HTML, CSV, XML, XLS, or JSON, you should have available via an API. The average company has a mess of information made available via a website, and the API journey is about untangling this mess, and make it available for not just the web, but also mobile, messaging, bot, voice, and other emerging channels in which people are getting their information. I've been asked to help identify the low hanging fruit for enough groups now, I'm looking to formalize it as a service. My low hanging fruit process involves spinning up a web spider instance on AWS, giving it a domain as a target, and letting it slowly spider all the HTML pages, looking for the following low hanging fruit, over the course of a couple of weeks. Tables - Identify an HTML page with a table on it that has more than 5 rows. CSV - Identify an CSV file that is linked to from any HTML page within the domain. XLS -&nbsp;Identify an XLS or XSLX file that is linked to from any HTML page within the domain. XML -&nbsp;Identify an XML file that is linked to from any HTML page within the domain. Forms - Identify any page that has a form on it, and also index any fields available with it....[<a href="/2016/04/13/formalizing-my-approach-to-identifying-the-low-hanging-api-fruit/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>While I am on the subject of API deprecation, showcasing some of the interesting ways folks deprecate their APIs, I want to actually send out a message to API operators, that if you are considering, preparing (or not preparing) to deprecate your API, I wanted to talk with you including it in the API Purgatory Museum.&nbsp; I was joking about missing Google Wave today, as I read about the army of bots, and bot platforms today, which resulted in Stefano Buliani jokingly asking about my API purgatory list.&nbsp; @kinlane @dberkholz think there should be an API purgatory, do you have the list? &mdash; Stefano Buliani (@sapessi) April 13, 2016 Which is something that actually isn't a bad idea. When an API goes away, I would like to have the chance to take a snapshot of what was. I'm not insane enough to think that I can take every API and stand it up, host it, and continue to operate it. However there would be a handful that I would actually be willing to do that, and for the rest I would at least like to create an OpenAPI Spec, and JSON Schema snapshot of the API. Along with some screenshots of the API portal, docs, and other common elements. Who knows maybe I can get a working mock of it up and running for the museum. Even though Stefano Buliani and I were joking. I'm actually putting out there for real, so if you are planning on deprecating your API and would like to donate the server code to the API Purgatory Museum, or have me take a snapshot of it, drop me a line. I can't guarantee I'll be interested, but if you are interested in your API living on, beyond what you are able to do -- ping me. I'm happy to keep private, so we do not disrupt the order of the universe.&nbsp; I might even work out some sort of credit...[<a href="/2016/04/12/the-api-purgatory-museum/">Read More</a>]</p>

When I am review API services and tooling, the majority of what I see is targeting the API elite, the most technical, and specialized of us in the API space.

I get regularly walk through from the team, so what they do is no surprise, but each time I see it in action, I'm moved by what is possible, and the inroads they are building into everyday businesses. Using Form.io you can build forms, but these aren't forms, they are apps, and they are APIs, as well as being a form. When you are building a form, you are building an API, and when you hit publish, it publishes the API, with the form as the first web or mobile app that is consuming the API.&nbsp;
Form.io gives you the capability to publish one or many of these apps (forms), and manage the data that is pushed out, pulled in, and aggregated from across your network of apps. Form.io does all the heavy lifting for you, while still speaking the common language of the form -- which almost everyone in the business world understands. I walked though a couple of Form.io most recent case studies (which I'll talk about in future posts), but I wanted to take a moment to highlight that Form.io has made an API design, deployment, and management tool--except you don't realize that is what you are doing, as an end user, you are just building a form that matches meets your business need.

			<h3><a href="/2016/04/12/api-deprecation-art/">API Deprecation Art</a></h3>
			<p><em>12 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I'm in the middle of a sprint, where I am going through 50 of my main API stacks, to see what has changed, and who is still home. I'm always fascinated by the number of APIs that just fade away into a 301 redirect to a domains home page. Some projects get gobbled up by domain squatters, where others almost rise to the level of API deprecation art.

I might get this one framed. I thought the background, combined with the message was a great representation of the current state of API affairs. Its getting harder and harder to operate an API, keep it up and going, and live up to the hype and expectations.
I am going to start saving more snapshots of what happens when an API goes away--who knows maybe some day I'll have an interesting collection.&nbsp;

			<p><em>11 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was going through the list of APIs that I depend on, auditing the services that I'm paying for, and trimming the budget where I can, a process that involves spending time on the pricing and plan pages for the APIs I pay for--understanding pricing. I have all of my internal APIs defined as an APIs.json collection, as well as the 3rd party APIs which I depend on. This allows me to easily navigate all the moving parts of these APIs, and quickly get at what I need during times like this. As I was browsing the pricing pages, and evaluating the replacement of a couple of these systems I wanted to better understanding the terms of service, and licensing for these APIs I am employing. I try to keep the legal department for all of the API I use indexed with APIs.json as well, something that allows me to then navigate to the legal side of these platforms. My APIs.json index for this IT collection, gives me easy access to the legal side of my API integrations. 3scale Pricing Support Privacy Policy Terms Of Service AlchemyAPI Pricing Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Trademarks Amazon Web Services Paid Support Pricing Privacy Policy Security Status Support Terms Of Service AngelList Privacy Policy Support Terms Of Service API Science Pricing Privacy Policy Terms Of Service APImetrics Pricing Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Bit.ly Privacy Policy Support Terms Of Service CloudFlare Pricing Privacy Policy Security Terms Of Service CrunchBase Pricing Support Terms Of Service Disqus Privacy Policy Support Terms Of Service Docker Privacy Policy Security Support Terms Of Service Trademarks Dropbox Branding Guidelines Pricing Privacy Policy Support Terms Of Service EasyCron Pricing Privacy Policy Support Terms Of Service Eventbrite Pricing Privacy Terms Of Service Facebook Privacy Policy Status Terms Of Service Flickr Privacy Policy Support Terms Of Service FullContact Pricing Privacy Policy Support Terms Of Service GitHub Pricing Privacy Security Status Terms Of Service Google Privacy Policy Terms...[<a href="/2016/04/11/do-you-have-all-the-links-to-pricing-tos-and-other-critical-info-for-the-apis-you-depend-on/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I see a lot of APIs in my daily work. The diverse number of ways in which APIs are being used is one of the things that keeps my ADD brain interested in all things APIs. While the technical, business, and politics of the API game infinitely has ways to keep me paying attention, I find myself engaged more lately, not just for the belief in the potential of APIs for good, but around the potential for misuse--at a troubling pace.&nbsp; Increasingly I am stumbling across API implementations, that when I am initially learning about, the 12 year old boy in me is immediately interested, but then the 43 year old skeptical in me recoils, like I am seeing a car accident on the highway.&nbsp;Insitu's Tungsten Software Development Kit has this effect on me -- Insitu makes technology for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). I think the tagline on their home page sums itup well--the API opportunity is at this layer of civil, commercial, and defense deployment of UAVs. I think their own description of the&nbsp;Tungsten Software Development Kit, speaks well to what APIs can do for almost any device, including UAVs: Our Tungsten Media Toolkit offers the ideal software development kit (SDK) for companies and platforms that demand flexible, superior, real-time digital media solutions. Designed by software developers, Tungsten can be used for a wide array of media purposes and applications and offers developers an extensive application programming interface (API) to operate on media from a variety of sources, be it cameras, network streams, archives, and beyond. Insitu Mission Systems addresses your metadata-rich media challenges by applying the Tungsten toolkit and deep expertise in tactical data collection and processing. With the awareness I've seen realized from using APIs in between the back-end, and front-end web and mobile applications, I can only imagine what is possible, when you open up API access to a drone, its camera, and all its information gathering capability.&nbsp;It is exciting to...[<a href="/2016/04/10/using-apis-to-provide-building-blocks-for-still-and-motion-uav-imagery-media-applications/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>I just published the OpenAPI Spec I just created for the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) into one of my default portals, which once the OpenAPI Spec is indexed via the portals API.json, I get a ready to go landing page, documentation, and other tooling for supporting the API. I have been pushing forward my API documentation, beyond the (now) standard issue Swagger UI, keeping the OpenAPI Spec core, but evolving the UI portion using Jekyll and Liquid.&nbsp; I have a default API docs implementation, which loops through all OpenAPI Spec included within a project, and renders HTML documentation for each path, verb, etc. I'm still working on how I recreate the dynamic functionality brought to the table by Swagger UI, but so far I'm really, really enjoying the flexiblity with the user interface, and overall experience I get using this approach--I know the interactive portion will come. One of the things I'm enjoying being able to do, is apply additional, external elements to the OpenAPI Spec, by augmenting them with independent, APIs.json defined schema. One example of this I am calling API filters, a simple filter collection defined in both YAML and JSON, that is indexed along with the OpenAPI Spec, within the APIs.json index. For the Open Referral API I wanted to provide the complete documentation, but also play around with other different, filtered views of the API -- designed for specific audiences. The first entry I made into API filters, I called "learn the basics", only showing the core resources that were available via the Open Referral API, eliminating all of the noise.

			<p><em>09 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>As I was preparing for my talk with Dan from Open Referral, I published some of my thoughts on the organization, and the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS). One of the things I did as part of that work was generating of a first draft of an OpenAPI Spec for the Open Referral API. To create that draft, I used the existing Ohana API as the base, exposing the same endpoints as they did in the Code For America project.&nbsp; Over the last couple days, I spent some more time getting to know the data model set forth by HSDS, and got to work evolving my draft OpenAPI Spec to be closer in alignment with the data schema. To do this I took the JSON Schema for HSDS that was available on the Github, and generated used it as a framework to add any missing elements to the API definition, resulting in almost 70 API paths, in support of almost 20 separate entities dictated in the HSDS.

			<p>I had another conversation with an API service provider today about their freemium accounts not converting. I've been sharing my thoughts about these freemium service account conversations, as I work to understand a shift that is occurring, and what my own feelings are. At this point, I feel like we (providers and consumers) are all responsible for freemium not working, than it is about the concept itself not working. Some of the poor behaviors of service providers: No Business Models - Everything being free, and not having a coherent business model. No Ascension Possible - There is free account, maybe one more paid level, then unobtainable beyond. Credit Card Trap - Requiring credit card on demos, trials, without easy way to not be billed. Some of the poor behaviors of service consumers: No Communication - Never actually engaging in a conversation with platform providers. Multiple Accounts - Using multiple accounts to get around limitations of individual accounts. Drop Service - Only use the service to get what you need, then migrating off of service.&nbsp; I feel that the concept of freemium model, when its bundled with a coherent monetization strategy, can work. However, I feel like service providers will ultimately have to tighten down their controls, and do like Best Buy has done, requiring that developers get to know them before you get any meaningful API access. #MakesSenseToMe Sadly, when the bad behavior by developers, and API consumers, is coupled with a push by investors to focus&nbsp; on selling to the enterprise, we are going to see free and freemium tiers go away. We'll see plenty of quality services emerge, but unless you have enterprise resources behind you, you won't be getting access to them. Which in my opinion will further shift the way software is developed and consumed, back toward the old way we did before SaaS.&nbsp; I'm guessing many of you business folks will just file this under markets working things out.

			<p>I am spending time evaluating the evolution of the three applications offered by Restlet, as they work to bring the experience across API Spark, Restlet Studio, and DHC, into closer alignment. To describe what Restlet does in my API terminology, API Spark is an API deployment solution, Restlet Studio is an API design solution, and DHC is an API client solution. These are extreme simplifications, but helps me keep the fast moving API space somewhat organized (for me), and helps me share stories that (hopefully) make sense (for you).&nbsp; Every couple of weeks I spend an hour or two talking with Jerome Louvel (@jlouvel), the founder of Restlet, about their road map, and where the wider API space is going. Similar to my own work, trying to map out the API life cycle, Restlet is trying evolve their own suite of API solutions, into more of a life cycle management solution. Restlet touches all of the core areas of the life cycle, including design, definitions, deployment, management, and client, while also making moves into testing, and beyond. I told Jerome I would spend more time thinking about this journey that they are on, and provide any thoughts I can. While I was playing with DHC, making some calls to my blog API, I kept being pulled down to the bottom tab, below my API response information, where there are tabs for history, assertions, HTTP, and docs. While the API request and response is very technical, at the bottom of the DHC client, I see elements of the business and politics of APIs. For me, the features Restlet has exposed as tabs in the DHC footer, resemble how APIs are acting as business contracts. The docs represents the contract language, the HTTP tab is the details of the exchange, assertions are what is expected of the contract, and history is the recording of the contracted exchange (or lack of).

			<p><em>08 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and Postman, have been gaining in popularity over the last couple of years, mostly because of the their ability to deploy interactive documentation like Swagger UI. However, the API providers who have been using them the longest, have also realized these machine readable definitions can be applied effectively at almost every step along a modern API life cycle, from design to deprecation. I'm always encouraging companies, who are selling software services to the API space (aka API service providers), to make sure and have APIs for their entire stack, as well as speak in as many of the leading API definition formats as you possibly can. To help in this effort, I try to regularly showcase the API service providers who are doing it right--this round, its the folks over at APImetrics. The screen that comes up, when you go to add new API calls to the monitoring service is exactly what I am talking about, allowing me to get up and running using the API definition format of my choosing. I am given the option to manually add an API, or do a bulk import of the APIs I wish to monitor using the service. I'm given the option of importing WSDL, OpenAPI Spec, RAML, Blueprint, and Postman, which reflects the leading API definition formats, any API service provider should be speaking by default. If you need help enabling this in your services, I recommend talking to the APIMATIC folks about using their API Transformer. API definitions are quickly becoming the central contract that gets passed around among technical folks, and increasingly with business units as well. No matter where you exist on the API life cycle, between API design, all the way to deprecation, your customers should be able to onboard, and offboard using all of the modern API definition formats--enabling your users get up and running in seconds, rather than minutes, hours, or even not...[<a href="/2016/04/08/example-of-api-service-providers-making-onboarding-with-services-easier-using-api-definitions/">Read More</a>]</p>

It just makes me sad that platforms don't just ignore platform fans and advocates like this, but actively work to lock things down to prevent this kind of serendipity from happening. Why would you want to shut down people who are looking to promote your tool? You should be enabling them.
If Snapchat had a proper API portal, they would take this signal, internalize it, and turn it into an official set of embeddable tools for the messaging platform. #derp

			<p><em>07 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>One common thing you hear from the growing number of integrations and bots that are leveraging the Slack API, is all about injecting some specific action into the platform and tooling, we are all already using. Startups like Current, who are providing payments within your Slack timeline, use the slogan, "transact where you interact". I began to explore this concept, in what I call API injection, and is something I'm sure I'll be talking about over and over in the future, with the growth in bot, voice, and other API enabled trends I am following. The concept is simple. You inject a valuable API driven resource, such as payments, knowledge base, images, video, or other, into an existing stream, within an existing platform or tool you are already putting to use. It is not a new concept, it is just seeing popularity when it comes to Slack, but really has been happening for a while wit Twitter Cards, and chatbots who have been around for some time.&nbsp; I'm seeing another incarnation of this coming from my friends over at Blockspring, who I've showcased for some time, for bringing valuable API resources to spreadsheet users. Blockspring just released&nbsp;Google Sheets Templates, which enables your spreadsheets&nbsp;to "do useful things", and "get data, use powerful services, and do things you didn't think were possible in a spreadsheet." Instead of Slack being the "existing tool", it is Google Spreadsheet, but the approach is the same -- bring useful API driven resources to users, where they are already existing and working. As I continue to watch the latest bot evolution, a stark contrast has emerged between the types of bots we've seen between Twitter and Slackbots--a contrast I feel is being defined by the tone and business viability of each platform. Twitterbots are much more whimsical and about stories, poetry, and other information, where Slack is very much productivity, and business focused, making it a prime target for the next wave...[<a href="/2016/04/07/that-thing-you-all-are-doing-with-slack-integrations-blockspring-is-doing-it-with-spreadsheets/">Read More</a>]</p>

What is API, and what APIs enable, are all in the eye of the beholder, with only a handful of common aspects shared by any single group of people. This is one of the things that make it very difficult to answer the common newcomer question of where they should start with APIs. This is what makes it so difficult for APIs to ever rise to the expectations of leading architects, and API visionaries. For me, APIs are about enabling API providers to open up access to their resources, and empower API consumes to get at the resources they need to be successful in their every day worlds. Some folks out there enjoy regularly reminding me that APIs are not for everyone, and they should only be used by a handful of sanctioned tech practitioners, to facilitate the technical, business, and political / ideological motivations of these per-ordained--my dreams of enablement and empowerment are nice, but they are just not reality. I've heard this from day one of API Evangelist in 2010, and I'm sure I will hear it for some time to come. Some days these currents are strong, and get me down, but other days there are the small rays of light, that keep me hopeful (enough) to keep on, keep'n on. One of these rays of light in my world currently is watching my friend Tom Woodward (@twoodwar) work through his world, after the university API workshop I did in North Carolna.&nbsp; Tom has been working through his own thoughts on what a personal API means to him, via his blog. Something that has seriously turned him on to the potential of APIs: @glassbeed @dajbelshaw which to me is a neat idea- the common &amp; structured is what allows for the unique/personal cc @jimgroom @kinlane &mdash; Tom Woodward (@twoodwar) April 7, 2016 To the folks I...[<a href="/2016/04/07/some-very-different-views-of-what-api-are-and-what-apis-can-do/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>Many of the core areas of my API research, and the common building blocks of the API life cycle that I talk about regularly, often seem trivial to the technically inclined, or the purely business focused segments of my audience. To many, having a road map might be a thing you have when developing and deploying an API, but really doesn't matter if you share publicly. I'd say, with technical folks they often don't even think of it, with the more business focused individuals often deliberately choose not to, seeing it as giving away too much information to your competition.&nbsp; I think Slack nails the reason why you want to open up and share your API road map. I can talk about this kind of stuff until I'm blue in the face, but people just don't listen -- they need leadership like Slack brings to the table. In their post today, they open with: We know that being a developer is hard, and building on a platform is not a decision to be made lightly. Many platforms have burned developers and we frequently see that risk highlighted. This is our response. They nail the the (often elusive) promise of the API ecosystem: An ecosystem, a real platform, is shared. We are growing fast, but no one company alone could grow fast enough to meet the amount of potential in front of us. We are working hard, but no one team can work hard enough to meet the demand that lies before us all. Instead, we are building a platform where this potential, this demand, is shared. As we grow, developers are able to succeed with us; sharing our customers and joining us in changing the way people do work. In turn, our customers are delighted, new customers have even more reason to use Slack, and the cycle continues. They nail the reality of the API ecosystem, and how it is a shared experience: An ecosystem...[<a href="/2016/04/07/slack-nails-the-reasons-why-you-open-up-and-share-your-api-road-map/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>It is pretty easy to design, define, and deploy APIs these days, and I get a number of folks who approach me with questions about how to get going with the operations and management side of things. While each company, and API provider, will have different needs, I have a general list of the common building blocks used by the leading API providers I track on across the API sector. So that I have an up to date URL to share with a couple of my partners in crime, I wanted to organize some of the common building blocks across my almost 50 areas of API research, into a single list, that can be considered when anyone is planning on deploying an API. For this guide, I wanted to touch on some of the building blocks you should consider as part of your central API developer portal, documentation, and other elements of the management and operations, what I feel should be a minimum viable presence for successful API providers.

			<p><em>07 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>To augment my last post about when you have an API, but you need some help to identify what is needed to manage your presence, I wanted to talk about some of what you can do once you've established your base API management, operations, and presence--now you need to get the word out, and get people using your APIs. Whether your APIs are intended for a public, partner, or internal group, there are many well established techniques, that are employed by successful API platforms, that you can employ. When I first sat down to write this guide, I was going to label it simply as API evangelism, but after pulling together the building blocks that I needed from across my research, to support a specific point, I shifted to make sure it was more of a week to week guide of things that should be considered. I wanted to share my own list which I use regularly, to help make sure I'm not forgetting any important things, and possibly re-evaluating existing practices to make sure they still relevant. I wanted this API evangelism, outreach, and maintenance guide to speak to as wide of an audience as possible. To help do this, I wanted to focus on some simple goals, and building blocks that could be employed as part of the day to day, week to week, and month to month of the average API operations--here is what I have so far. What Are The GoalsWhat are the core goals of the API operation? These need to be precise, measurable, and obtainable goals. While there may be unique ones to your situation, these are some of the common ones I see employed regularly. Growth in New Users -&nbsp;Is growth in the number of new users a goal?

			<p><em>06 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I process many press releases to feed the of API.Report beast. The primary reason I do this work each week, is to identify new APIs, being done in interesting business sectors. One common thing I see, is companies that reference their API in their press release, and when I head over to their website -- no API, or information to be found.&nbsp;
Ok, I only spend about 30-60 seconds looking for a link to a dedicated API area, but its pretty clear that people either haven't though making it accessible, or are holding their cards close to their chest. I'm sure there are a whole spectrum of reasons why people do this, but it just doesn't make sense for you to talk publicly about your API, while also making it so difficult to learn more--it is not very API-like.&nbsp;
I'm all for companies intelligently approaching how they tailor API efforts, but if its something you are showcasing as a selling point in your PR, you should also be making it easy for us analysts, bloggers, and potential customers to get additional information, without asking for help. If I can't find a dedicated API portal, and easily discover information about what an API does, I won't add it to my queue of research, and stories -- I'm sure this is the case for other tech writers.

			<p><em>05 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>
As I study the approach of bot, and messaging platform integrations like Current, I keep thinking about the potential for API injection at this layer of messaging. In this scenario I am thinking about Slack, and how you craft messages, approach the unfurling of links, and customize attachments.
I am envisioning a Twitter Cards, but a more open approach, that can help companies deliver nice looking, well designed, and media rich messages that deliver what messaging users are looking for. The service would be cross platform, allowing me to design for Twitter Cards, Slack Messages, or any other messaging platform that finds its 15 minutes of tech fame. With just a little bit of exploration of how to craft a good looking, and functional Slack message, I can see this being a full time job for someone.
When building my own messaging integration or bot solutions is to not vomit up any text, images, or functionality into people's message timeline. I would like to understand how to deliver exactly what they need, in a visually appealing way. Like every other channel I've developed a competency around, I want to understand the best approaches employed by the savviest of the channel operators, and if I can encourage them to offer their solutions as a service, I will. I don't have the time or patience to master every channel (ie. mobile), and will gladly pay for the right service that actually helps me do this right.
If you are working on any simple solutions that touch on helping inject API resources, and craft them into meaningful messages and experiences, via platforms like Slack, let me know. If you aren't, but want to do as startup, get going, send me a beta invite, and I'll make sure you have my address so you can send the royalty checks.&nbsp;

			<p><em>05 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>It has been acceptable for integration platform as a service providers (iPaaS) like IFTT and Zapier to focus on delivering the end-solutions that their consumers have needed, and requiring them to visit your domain to discover and then make the magic happen. While I have always been an advocate for more accessibility, I have to admin that the current "closed" approach has brought a number of new people to the world of APIs, as people realize that IFTTT and Zapier are possible because of APIs! However to me, it is a no-brainer that if you build a business on top of public APIs, you should pay it forward by providing an API, but I understand many of you startups follow a different philosophy than I do. One that is more about trapping, locking up, and owning these activities. You wouldn't want someone building on what you've done via an API, and potentially offering more value than you do!! Kind of like you did. No we wouldn't want to do that. Derp! #SelfishBusiness As I see it, the altruistic reasons for offering an API if you are an API integration service providers are being pushed aside, for more business centric reasons, that these startups will have to take notice of. If you do not provide API access to your API driven recipes, they will not be available to discover, and execute for the growing number of bot enabled solutions we are seeing emerge. Your really useful iPaaS recipes will not play a role in this new bot driven phase of API consumption, and be left in the ditch of yesterdays tech. If you are an iPaaS provider, please make your recipes discoverable, and executable via an API. I have long complained that if I can search for recipes via an API, I'm less likely to know it exists. I'm also less likely to embed your meaningful actions into my web site or application, if there is...[<a href="/2016/04/05/the-api-integration-providers-who-have-api-access-to-actions-will-be-successful-in-bot-environments/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am spending time talking to more API providers, and API service providers, about the challenges they are facing, while reaching out to potential customers, thanks to the support of my partners Cloud Elements. One of the conversation I had last week was with&nbsp;Diego Oppenheimer (@doppenhe) of Algorithmia (@algorithmia), who shared with me the challenges he faces in getting senior engineers to realize the potential of APIs, and the &nbsp;value API driven platforms like Algorithmia bring to the table.&nbsp; Diego expressed that the biggest thing they face is convincing their engineer, senior dev, and other tech-focused consumers, that Algorithmia isn't just something new they need to add to their existing stack, and that it is more about enabling what is already in place. While some folks will benefit from discovering entirely new algorithmic approaches on Algorithmia's marketplace, the biggest impact will come from the platform's approach to defining, scaling, and stabilizing the algorithms developers and IT folks are already putting to work.&nbsp; These are the content, data, and other resources you are already putting to work, the algorithms in your business life that already have relevance in your operations. I'm constantly working to focus on the fact that APIs are all about making these resources better defined, accessible and more discoverable, but when you also leverage what's being called "serverless" approaches like Algorithmia, you are also making them more scalable, more stable, and usable as well. Diego said he's always trying to reassure senior tech folks of the fact that they aren't pointing out that they don't have the skills needed to define, deploy, and scale the bits of code (algorithms) that are making all of our worlds go around. It is about employing APIs, the cloud, and making your existing algorithms more agile, flexible, and scalable, augmenting your existing world with tangible benefits--ultimately making you better at what you are already doing. I've talked about this concept before within my own operations.

			<p><em>05 Apr 2016</em></p>
			<p>During the latest IFTTT flareup, I realized how much I haven't written about my feelings surrounding API integratio service providers, iPaas, or whatever else you call it. Something that always frustrates me in the future, as I am unable to reference my earlier thoughts with a specific URL. So while I am ranting about the lack of APIs for these integration platform as a service (iPaaS) provider, let me add to my list of critical elements I feel are missing from the space: Embeddability! As a user of your service, provide me an API, so I can embed your API recipes into any website, web and mobile application. While the fact that Zapier does have a public API, where IFTTT does not have one at all, the Zapier API doesn't not provide me any access to what API integration recipes (Zaps) are available (ie, core business value). I cannot automatically search for all the Google Spreadsheet integrations. I cannot search for all the Twitter API integrations. Let alone embed the actions enabled by these recipes on any of my website.&nbsp; When preparing any list of meaningful actions you can take with APIs, like I did for my university workshop a couple weeks ago, I have to manually go to Zapier, search for actions, and then craft my own link to the detail page (which isn't public BTW). The response from Zapier to why there is no API for this, each time I ask, is that nobody has ever asked for that? Which is starting to smell more and more like business lock-in to me, in the wake of the IFTTT / Pinboard shitstorm.&nbsp; It isn't like the concept of an API driven, embeddable button is anything new. Facebook Share, Twitter Tweet? I just can't buy the fact that nobody has asked for a Run Zapier Zap button? I'm just guessing that folks aren't seeing the embed opportunity, when they are down in the weeds, like...[<a href="/2016/04/05/api-integration-service-providers-should-have-an-api-so-that-their-actions-are-embeddable/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Here is the email I received from the CEO of IFTTT, in response to the whole Pinboard kerfuffle, a few minutes ago. It looks like they've done a little soul searching, and wanted to apologize: Hello Pinboard Customers,&nbsp; We've made mistakes over the past few days both in communication and judgment. I'd like to apologize for those mistakes and attempt to explain our intentions. I also pledge to do everything we can to keep Pinboard on IFTTT. IFTTT gives people confidence that the services they love will work together. There are more services in the world than IFTTT can possibly integrate and maintain alone. We are working on a developer platform that solves this by enabling service owners to build and maintain their integration for the benefit of their customers.&nbsp; The vast majority of Channels on IFTTT are now built on that developer platform by the services themselves. We made a mistake in asking Pinboard to migrate without fully explaining the benefits of our developer platform. It's our responsibility to prove that value before asking Pinboard to take ownership of their Channel. We hope to share more on the value of our platform soon. I also want to address Pinboard&rsquo;s concerns with our Developer Terms of Service. These terms were specific to our platform while in private beta and were intended to give us the flexibility to evolve our platform in close partnership with early developers. We&rsquo;ve always planned to update and clarify those terms ahead of opening our platform and we are doing so now. We are specifically changing or removing areas around competing with IFTTT, patents, compatibility and content ownership. The language around content ownership is especially confusing, so I'd like to be very clear on this: as a user of IFTTT you own your content. I truly appreciate all of your feedback, concerns and patience. Helping services work together is what IFTTT does. We respect and appreciate the open web.

			<p>I am working on several very rewarding API efforts lately, but one I'm particularly psyched about is Open Referral. I'm working with them to help apply the open API format in a handful of implementations, but to also share some insight on what the platform could be in the future. I have been working to carve out the time for about it, and finally managed to do so this week, resulting in what I am hoping will be some rewarding API work. As i do, I wanted to explore the project, work to understand all the moving parts, as well as what is needed for the future, using my blog. I am not recommending that Open Referral tackle of all this work right now, I am just trying to pull together a framework to think about some of the short, and long terms areas we can invest in together. I intend to continue working with Greg, and the Open Referral team to help spread the awareness of the open API specification, and help build the community. Open Referral is all about being an open specification, dedicated to helping humans find services, and even more humans to help other humans to find the services they need--I can't think of a more worthy implementation of an API. In my opinion, this is what APIs are all about -- providing open access to information, while also allowing for commercial activity. To help prime the pump, let's take a look at the specification, and think more about where I can help, when it comes to the Open Referral organization and eventually, the Open Referral platform. Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) "The Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) defines content that provides the minimum set of data for Information and Referral (I&amp;R) applications as well as specialized service directory applications." &nbsp;Which represents a pretty huge opportunity to help deliver vital information around public services, to those who need them, where they...[<a href="/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I'm engaging in another conversation with a higher education institution about where to start with APIs on campus. A new CIO has assumed a leadership position, and some very forward thinking folks on campus asked me to come visit, talk with IT about APIs, and try to understand where they can get to work with APIs on campus--a perfect opportunity to get to work developing an API culture at&nbsp;Davidson College. As their Twitter profile says, "Davidson is a highly selective independent liberal arts college committed to access and equal opportunity." Sounds like a rich environment to get to work empowering students, teachers, and faculty using APIs. Which leaves at the familiar place of being asked by folks on campus, where do we start with APIs? First we need a place to coordinate the getting started with APIs effort at Davidson with: Creating a Github Repo - To help facilitate the discussion, as well as store any code, data, and content that is generated. Publish a Github Pages - To help provide a web friendly destination to share content, information, and act as public face. Leverage Issue Management - To help establish an asynchronous communication stream around the initial API effort. Second, let's start mapping out all the moving parts, that will be meaningful to APIs on campus: Who Are The Key Stakeholders? What Are The Campus Run Systems Used? What Are The Cloud Services Being Put To Use? What Open Source Software Tools Are Used? What Are The Bits and Bytes That Are Involved? Who Are The Key Individuals Involved With API Efforts?

			<p><em>30 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I always dig it when API stories spin out of control, and I end up down story holes. I'm sure certain people waiting for other work from me do not appreciate it, but these are where some of the best stories in my world come from. As I was writing the story about Best Buy limiting access to their API when you have a free email account, which resulted in the story about Best Buy using Medium for their API platform blog presence, which ended up pushing me to read Medium's terms of service.
Anyways, to help manage the evolution of the terms of service, privacy policy, Medum uses Github to establish a historical record of all the changes to all legal documents that impact platform, and API operations. Seems like a pretty sensible, and default approach to the legal department for any platform. Hosting your legal department on Github, making sure their is as much transparency, and logging across this area of operations will play a central role in establishing and maintaining trust with your partners and consumers.
Maintaining the legal side of your platform operations on Github, taking advantage of the version control build in makes a lot of sense. Something that also opens the door for using Github Issue Management, and the other more social aspects of Github for assisting in the communication of legal changes, as well as facilitate ongoing conversations around changes in real time. I can see eventually working this into some sort of rating system for API providers, a sort of open source regulatory consideration, that is totally opt in by API platforms -- if you give a shit you'll do it, if you don't, you won't.&nbsp;

			<p><em>30 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>One thing that struck me as I wrote my post about Best Buy stopping issuing API keys to free email accounts, was the fact that Best Buy operates their developer blog on Medium--something I am seeing more of. As I discover new API-centric companies via my blog, Twitter, Product Hunt, AngelList, and the many other ways I tune into the space, I'm seeing more companies operating the blog portion of their presence in this way.&nbsp; One of voices in my head points out that this just doesn't seem like a good idea. It reminds me of hosting our blogs on Posterous. Medium doesn't let you map your domain, or sub-domain to your blog (invite only), but I'm sure is something they'll do soon. They don't have RSS, and they don't have a read API either? *warning bells* &nbsp;While I get the Medium thing, it seems like one of those neatly tended gardens, where as many roads out are gated off with friendly hand-painted signs. However some of the other voices in my head chimed in that Medium is just asking for non exclusive license to use your content. They let you delete your account, and I know they are working hard on their API strategy. Also, I'm a big supporter of API providers being as scrappy as possible, as many of us have to do as much as we can with some often very non-existent budgets. Best Buy rocks it at leveraging Github, Medium, Twitter, and all the channels I usually recommend. So in the end I really can't bitch about API platforms using Medium for their blog presence. When you use Medium you get the network effect for your blog presence--something I'm working to understand better, and leverage more as part of my own work. I'll keep tracking on the APIs I find that use Medium for their blog presence. Right now my only complaint is simple -- THERE IS NO RSS!!!

			<p><em>30 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>Best Buy is one of the many of the recent responses I am seeing from public API providers, as they work to strike a healthy balance within their API community. In an attempt to incentivize the behavior they desire within the Best Buy API community, the platform will not be issuing API keys to any email address that comes from the popular free email platforms (@google.com, @yahoo.com, etc.). While I hate seeing any public API access be tightened up, I can't help but sympathize with their move, and I have to support any API providers who works to set a healthy balance within their communities. While I am not sure limiting access based upon email account may not be the solution they are looking, they hit all the right notes for me: Develop Human Relationships &gt;&gt; If we want to have a better relationship with you, our active users, we need to make better connections between your alpha-numeric key and the services we provide to you Respect For What You Build &gt;&gt; If we disable a key because the email address is old, we may break an app. We don&rsquo;t like breaking things. Business With Companies &gt;&gt; Over the next couple of months we will transition to a new system that will associate API keys with a company and not an individual. Empowering Education usage &gt;&gt; We are developing a program that we intend to have up and running before the start of the next school year that will accommodate educational use.&nbsp; Allow For Play &amp; Exploration &gt;&gt; Similarly, we have ideas for how to accommodate events, hackathons and developer sandboxes to allow folks to test the waters without needing to go through a formal key sign up process.

			<p><em>29 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I am always trying to identify the common building blocks employed by leading API providers, and Twilio is one of the usual suspects I showcase. This time it is focusing their annotated code walk-throughs and tutorials, which provides a pretty good model that other API providers can follow when planning their own tutorials.
Twilio offers up a tutorial for almost every API endpoint they offer. Some of the more popular tutorials have versions for almost every programming language, while some of the lesser traveled ones only have a single version. Once you click in to each tutorial, it delivers as the title implies, an annotated walk through, showing you how to get up and running, making the API call, in the language of choice.
Each tutorials provides you a direct link to the code libaries, available on Twilio's Github account. It can get pretty busy in the walk-through section for Twilio, but the value is clear. I could envision a more portable, embeddable, and machine readable tool, that would help API providers do this as well as Twilio, but maybe in a more cleaner, plug and play way.
I've had tutorials as a common API management building block for some time, maybe I'll take Twilio's model and expand on it, and provide a more detailed blueprint that API providers can follow when planning their own approach. Maybe someone could also turn it into a simple service, or open source solution that the API space could put to use.

			<p>I was disappointed to see the email in my inbox this morning from IFTTT about their Pinboard integration. I also helped amplify Pinboard when he was Tweet'n up a storm earlier, and I recommend you read his post:&nbsp;My Heroic and Lazy Stand Against IFTTT. However I had work to get done on an essay about the API effort over at Brigham Young University, and prepare for some meetings I have this week around the Open Referral API definition, to help people find government services--IFTTT bums me out, but priorities. The loss of Pinboard integration in IFTTT sucks, but there is always Zapier. ;-)&nbsp;I began moving away from my IFTTT support back in 2014, after I began seeing their lack of an API, and the absence of a forward-facing business model, as an early warning sigs about the sustainability of IFTTT as an service provider. I prefer having the option of paying for services in which I have a growing dependence on for my personal digital presence, and it is vital when it comes to my business presence. This was a deal breaker for me when it comes to IFTTT being a service I could support. I also strongly believe, that if you are building a startup using the APIs of other companies, you should be offering an API for your own aggregation, automation, interoperability, and any other aspect of your tech--otherwise it isn't a service I want to support.&nbsp; There are many other approaches to integrating your cloud services, and the concept of iPaaS is a growing layer of the API space. Unfortunately there will also continue to be incentives for startups to not offer an API, be secretive and shady about their operations, not communicate honestly with their community, and have fucked up terms of services.&nbsp; All we can do to combat this, is to make sure and only use the services who have a sensible business model which is in alignment with their...[<a href="/2016/03/28/the-lack-of-an-api-and-healthy-partner-integrations-is-an-early-warning-system-for-service-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The&nbsp;news out of Runscope&nbsp;makes today&nbsp;a good day to kick off discussion around a project that I've been helping push forward&nbsp;with the API Garage team, assisting them find the healthiest path forward for their API client tooling. As Runscope demonstrates, it is a tough time for API startups, something that adds fuel to my personal mission to do what I can to help startups find success.&nbsp; First, what is API Garage? It is one of the HTTP / Web API Client tools available today, including Postman, Paw, DHC, and Stoplight. API Garage is an Electron based solution, you can download and put to work in helping you integrate with web APIs, allowing you to make calls, see the requests / response, all without having to write code. This approach to working with APIs has evolved beyond use by just API consumers, and is quickly becoming the tool of choice for API development teams, and being applied at almost every stop along the API life cycle. The API Garage team approached me a couple months back to discuss the roadmap, and figure out how we can evolve it beyond just being a web API client, and help it emerge as an "garage environment" where individuals and teams can work on APIs, at any stage of the API life cycle. Inevitably this discussion led us to the talking about how the API Garage would be licensed, and generate revenue to sustain their vision. At this point, the API Garage team expressed interest in open sourcing the solution, and focusing on alternative approaches to generating the money they needed to sustain the solution, and keep them working on meaningful API projects. After a number of conversation, they settled in on open sourcing the API Garage, and begain focusing on revenue being focused on several key areas: Sponsorship - The API Garage website, and the open source download will have a handful of sponsorship spots, ranging from the default home...[<a href="/2016/03/28/exploring-a-new-way-to-fund-api-life-cycle-tooling-by-open-sourcing-the-api-garage/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I recently caught a glimpse of how APIs are going to deliver the change we need in this world. It began while I was attending a gathering of indie ed-tech folks on the campus of Davidson College in North Carolina. Where 20-30, mostly non-developers, discussed what is indie ed-tech, something which included many visions of what was dubbed "the personal API". While the gathering was very enlightening, it was what this gathering has set into motion, after we all parted ways, that I think has the most potential Since the gathering occurred, a rolling wave of API driven awarenss has been picking up speed, with&nbsp;Indie Ed Tech, Colleagues/Friends, APIs, Unexpected Emergent Ideas, and dot dot dot and Can The JED-API Power a Certification with a fellow who barks about and plays with web tech.

I then&nbsp;read about how we are&nbsp;Pushing/Pulling Data &ndash; Thinking Computationally? Differently? from someone focused technology integration in K12 and higher ed.

			<p>History is everything. Understanding where we have come from is critical to knowing where we are going. While pushing forward with the latest technology, it is always healthy to pause and take a look at that past. Someone Tweeted the link to my history page, and I realize it has been three years since I refreshed my view of the overall history of the space, so I wanted to take some time and add a few other milestones that I feel were significant along the way. When I talking about APIs, I'm focused one version that was born out of the enterprise, during the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) movement, which sometime around 2000, a portion of the SOA experiment left the enterprise and found a more fertile environment in the world of start-ups. In 2016, this version of API has re-captured the attention of the enterprise, as they see them being used in popular, public API driven services, and the startups they are acquiring and gobbling up. Where we stand in 2016, there are some obvious technical reasons of why web APIs are finding success in companies of all shapes and sizes, and even within government; but not all the reasons for this success is technical. There are many other, less obvious aspects of web APis that have contributed to their success, things we can only learn by closely studying the past and looking at why some of the pioneers of web APIs were successful, and have continued to be successful over the years. In 2016, it is critical that we emulate the best practices that have been established over the last 16 years, following the lead of early API providers like Amazon, Salesforce, eBay and Twitter--much of what is still being emulated by new API practitioners in 2016. As a startup, SMB, enterprise, institution, and government agency organization, you don't have to follow every example set in this 16 year history, but you should...[<a href="/2016/03/27/some-milestones-from-the-last-15-years-of-web-api-history/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>As I was reviewing patent #20160070605:&nbsp;Adaptable Application Programming Interfaces And Specification Of Same, from yet another person I know, after I pick my head up off the desk, I begin thinking about all of the unintended consequences of API patents. Here is the abstract from this work of beauty: Aspects of the disclosure relate to defining and/or specifying an application programming interface (API) between a client and a computing device (such as a server) in a manner that the client, the computing device, or both, can evolve independently while preserving inter-operability. This is something that WE ALL should be building into our clients, and is fundamental to all this API shit even working at scale. This particular patent is owned by Comcast, so I'm assuming it will be wielded in the courtroom, and leveraged in back room net neutrality discussions among cable and telco giants. There really isn't a lot of unintended consequences involved when two or three 1000 lb gorillas battle it out. The little people always suffer in these battles, and there really isn't much I can do--I will leave this to my friends in the federal government to take on. Where I feel like I should be speaking up more, is when it comes to the patents being filed by my startup friends, like the hypermedia patents I talked about a few months ago. For weeks after I published that story, my friends came out of the woodwork to tell me this is what you have to do in this game, and they are well meaning, and would never ever use the patent for anything bad. Everyone I talked to I respect, and do believe they mean what they say, but its the unintended consequences that keep me up at night. What happens after your startup is acquired, and you have cashed out, and long gone?

			<p><em>25 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I spend a lot of time gathering, creating, and organizing machine readable OpenAPI Specs, as part of my API Stack, and personal API stack work. I'm not insane enough to think I can create OpenAPI Specs for all of the public APIs out there, I'm just trying to tip the scales regarding how many API definitions that are out there, to increase the usage and value of open tooling, which in turn will increase the number of people who will create their own OpenAPI Specs. (just kind of sort of insane) As I do this work, I realize how easily I can obsess over unnecessary, and meaningless metrics and goals in the tech space. Two things have stood out for me as I do this work: Overall Number of API Specs - Much like our obsession over the completely meaningless and incorrect number of APIs that are in the ProgrammableWeb directory, the number of OpenAPI Specs means nothing. At some arbitrary point, things will change and people will get on board--it is already happening. The Complete OpenAPI Spec - Having a complete OpenAPI Spec that contains ALL endpoints, parameters, and underlying data schema is a myth, and really doesn't matter. You only need as much as you are going to use. Maybe to API providers this matters, but to consumers, you only need what you need. The trick is figuring out what this is, without dumping everything on a consumer. I won't stop what I am doing. As an experienced technologists I know when I am simply a tool in a larger game, and I perform as the automatron that is expected of me. However I will not obsess over the completeness of the API specs, or ever showcase the overall number of OpenAPI Specs that I have--I'll just keep on working. In this data driven world, it is easy to get caught up in focusing on mythical, meaningless, data points.

I get these regular updates from FullContact when there is new information available about the contacts I have added to my contact list of people I care about. Anytime there is a new photo, social network, or other element of their contact information updated, I get notified, andI &nbsp;can choose to update it in my CRM.
Would someone go ahead and create this, but for OpenAPI Specifications? All you have to do is use Github, and build your own index of the websites of leading companies who are publishing APIs (common crawl is good start), and begin keeping track of ALL of the OpenAPI Specs, and API Blueprints that are increasingly spread across the web. Then you will need to develop some sort of API definition diff solution (which I've talked about before), and then send me any changes or updates that I do not have in my directory of API definitions--which you know, because you have indexed already.
You can offer premium services, like private repositories, and pathways to the wealth of API definition driven tooling out there. Again, this is something I could very well do, except I am one person, and not really interested in doing anything beyond all the work I already do. Especially if it involves taking VC money, scaling, and being any closer to the machine than I already am. So if you could get to work on this for me, and help solve this growing need in the API space, that would be great! Yeah. Also make sure and cut me in for 10% of all the $$$ you are going to make.

			<p><em>24 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I play with a lot of services that are looking to provide solutions to the API industry, and I'm always looking to better understand what leading API services providers are using to deploy their warez. I was test driving the testing and monitoring solutions from Opsee this week, and separate from the solutions they provide (which I'll talk about later), I thought the deployment of their API testing and monitoring solutions was worthy of talking about all by itself. Opsee deploys as a micro-instance within my AWS stack, and gets to work testing and monitoring the APIs that I direct it to, providing a very precise, and effective way of doing monitoring. I do not think this approach will work in all scenarios, for all API providers, but I think packaging up the services, so that API providers can deploy within their stack, and run within the cloud or on-premise environment they choose, is a potentially very powerful formula. I have written before about offering up your APIs as wholesale or private label solutions before, and I would categorize what Opsee is doing as offering up your API industry service provider as wholesale or private label solutions. Many companies will do just fine consuming your SaaS or publicly available API driven solution, but more sophisticated operations, and potentially regulated companies, are going to need a solution that will run within existing infrastructure, not outside the firewall.&nbsp; I could see bandwidth and CPU intensive situations also benefiting from this approach. Opsee's way of doing things has gotten me thinking more about how we package up and deploy the services we are selling to API providers. Once Opsee was up and running in my stack, using a set of keys I setup and configured especially for it, it got to work monitoring the endpoints I tell it to. I could also see this approach also work as a locally available API, where I tell my systems to...[<a href="/2016/03/24/deploying-the-api-service-providers-that-i-depend-on-within-my-own-infrastructure/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>As I'm working through my morning work monitoring the API space, I'm proccesing stories about the availability of valuable resources, like the&nbsp;House Rules Committee data being released in XML formats, and&nbsp;ExoMol, the molecular line lists DB used in simulation of atmospheric models of exoplanets, brown dwarfs &amp; cool stars.&nbsp; I feel fortunate to live in a time where the world is opening up such valuable resources, making them available online--available for anyone to use, remix, improve, and make better. My faith in APIs doesn't come from any single API, it comes from the possibilities that will exist when individuals, companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies all publish valuable resources using APIs. While there is still a lot of work ahead, I'm seeing the early signs of this reality emerging across my API monitoring in 2016. I'm coming across so many, extremely valuable, openly licensed, machine readable resources that can be used in some very interesting ways. The trick now, is how do we expose the most meaningful parts of these resources, and make sure they get found by the people who will actually put them to use. As the number of APIs increase, this is something that is going to get harder and harder, and the need for value even more critical. Another dimension to this discussion is the growing number of channels we need to make our API resources available in. Web and mobile are still king when it comes to consuming APIs, but quickly devices, messaging, voice, bots, and other channels are growing in use. The next wave of API evangelism is going to require that the right people (domain experts) are available to help expose the most meaningful skills that our APIs posses, via these growing number of quick moving channels. An example of this in action, using one of the valuable resources above, could involve making the Congressional activity that is most relevant and important to me, available in my Slack...[<a href="/2016/03/23/exposing-the-meaningful-skills-our-apis-possess-for-use-in-the-next-gen-messaging-and-voice-apps/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have self-censored stories about microservices, because I have felt the topic is as charged as linked data, REST, and some parts of the hypermedia discussion. Meaning there are many champions of the approach, who insist on telling me, and other folks how WRONG they are in the approach, as opposed to helping us work through our understanding of exactly what is microservices, and how to do well. For me, when I come across tech layers that feel like this, they are something that is very tech saturated, with the usual cadre of tech bros leading the charge, often on behalf of a specific vendor, or specific set of vendor solutions. Even with this reality, I've read a number of very smart posts, and white papers on microservices in the last year, outlining various approaches to designing, engineering, and orchestrating your business, using the "microservices diet". Much of what I read nails much of the technology in some very logical, and sensible ways--crafted by some people with mad skills when it comes to making sense of very large companies, and software ecosystems. Even with all of this lofty thinking, I'm seeing one common element missing in most of the microservices approaches I have digest--the human element. I hear a lot of discussion about technical approaches to unwinding the bits and bytes of technical debt, but very little guidance for anyone on how to unwind the human aspect of all of this, acknowledging the years of business and political decisions that contributed to the technical debt. Its one thing to start breaking apart your databases, and systems, but its another thing to start decoupling how leadership invests in technology, the purchasing decisions that have been made, and the politics that surrounds these existing legacy systems. I don't know about you, but every legacy system I've ever come across almost always has had a gatekeeper, an individual, or group of individuals who will fight you to the...[<a href="/2016/03/22/your-microservices-effort-will-fail-if-you-only-focus-on-the-technical-details/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I have looked at way more Bots than I should have in the last couple days, and I'm beginning to see&nbsp; similar patterns emerging across bot implementations, in sync with what I shared as part of my advice to API service providers. After you look at hundreds of APIs, and now a couple hundred bot implementations, you really begin to see what some of the common building blocks of the successful bot implementations are: Domain - Having a domain dedicated to the bot, its operations, and the community around it. Website&nbsp;- Simple, modern, and informative website for your folks to discover, and put your bot to work. Logo - Having a simple, modern, and often clever logo and overall branding to your bots presence. Twitter&nbsp;- Have a genuine, active Twitter account that actually engages in conversations with community. Github&nbsp;- Establish an active, and useful Github presence via a dedicated user account or organization. Blog&nbsp;- Provide a thoughtful, active, and informative blog that engages with a community,&nbsp; customers, and the public at large. API&nbsp;- You are using open APIs, and messaging formats to make your bot work, pay it forward with APIs and Webhooks. Monetization&nbsp;- You gotta make some money, how are you going to keep the lights on, feed and cloth your bot. ;-) Support&nbsp;-Every bot will need support, even if it is automated. Make sure have answer questions via Twitter, and Github.&nbsp; The most interesting bots I came across, whether they are Twitter, Slack, or Telegram bot, all had at least half of the items listed above. I'm guessing we are going to see a huge surge in the number of bots that are available, as well as the platforms in which bots can operate, and I am thinking that the bots that follow these patterns will be floating to the top of the churn. I'm just getting started documenting the common building blocks in this recent surge in API driven bot activity.

			<p><em>22 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I'm constantly working to hand-craft, scrape-craft, and auto-generate OpenAPI Specs, and APIs.json files for as many of the top APIs I can. It is something Steve Willmott (@njyx), the CEO of 3Scale always flicks me shit about, saying I shouldn't have to do that--API providers should be doing this! While I agree, I feel like we haven't reached the point where all providers understand the importance of having an up to date OpenAPI Spec available for their API (some even have them, and work to hide them!)
This is something the savvy API providers like SendGrid are doing, rolling around Github, making sure copies of their OpenAPI Specs are up to date.&nbsp;

Thank Elmer, you da man. Now I just need to convince another 2K other API providers of the importance of having up to date machine readable API definitions available, and actively maintain them. Having your definitions up to date, and easy to find increases the chance a developer will load up in the favorite HTTP client like Postman, Postman, PAW, or API Garage.&nbsp;
Its going to happen Steve! I tell you! Some day, all the good API providers will maintain their own API definitions. You should always have an easy to find copy available as part of your API documentation, but you should also search for them on Github, and submit pull requests to keep them up to date. It is like have little machine readable business cards for your API, sitting on the desks of developers, except with this business card allows you to submit a pull request to update.&nbsp;
P.S. While on the subject--PUBLISH AN RSS FEED FOR YOUR BLOG!!! ;-)

			<p><em>22 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I'm seeing a significant shift in the conversations around how SaaS, and API-first platforms are planning access to their APIs. I'm seeing a pretty significant back peddling around free, and freemium access levels. I'm trying to keep notes on what I'm hearing, so that I can better understand what is causing this, and see if I can identify where the balance might exist in providing self-service access to API our valuable resources. Let' me explore some of the main reasons I'm hearing for reducing, restricting, or completely doing away with these lower level areas of access: Too Many API Freeloaders - There is a growing number of poorly behaved API consumers who are just looking for a free ride. At Odds With Sales Teams - Free layers of access cannibalize our sales cycle, and make it harder for sales teams to close the deal. These Layers Do Not Convert - The users coming in at these layers are just not converting, and becoming paid customers. We Built It And Nobody Came - Nobody seems to care about the API, and nobody signed up for acess, so we are shutting down. No More Money To Support Free - We just don't have the money to pay for the infrastructure and support it takes to support. VC's Told Us To Focus On Enterprise - Our investors told us to focus all our attention on selling to the enterprise, consumer focus is gone.&nbsp; When it comes to providing and consuming APIs, I've seen it all. I sympathize with many of these reasons for shrinking of the free tiers of access to APIs. There will be many contributing factors to why things might be off in an API community. As my friend Ed Anuff (@edanuff) focused on in his latest post about how a large number of us are doing API wrong, with many companies approach to APIs being fundamentally at odds with their ecosystem.&nbsp; Ultimately I think that...[<a href="/2016/03/22/i-am-hearing-a-lot-more-talk-about-restricting-free-and-freemium-tiers-of-api-access/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am slowly getting sucked into the world of bots. I've been tagging stories related to Twitter bots for some time, but it was the growing buzz of Slack bots that has really grabbed my attention. It pushed me to light up a research area, so that I can begin to look at things closer, and work to understand the common building blocks, like I do for the other areas of the API space. The world of bots intrigues me, from the perspective of how APIs can be used to execute bots, but also provide the valuable resources needed to deliver bot functionality. I feel like the list of categories of available Slack bots are somewhat telling of the business potential for bots: Analytics Communication Customer Support Design Developer Tools File Management Health &amp; Medical HR Marketing Office Management Payments &amp; Accounting Productivity Project Management Security &amp; Compliance Social &amp; Fun Travel While I find Twitter bots creative and interesting, there are many I also found annoying as hell. I've had similar responses to some of the bots I've encountered on Slack. I tend to be pretty boring when it comes to goofy shit online, so my threshold for bot silliness is low. I don't care what others do, I just don't go there that often, so you'll see me highlighting more of the business productivity bots, or the more creative ones.&nbsp; Another thing I think is significant, is the growing number of platforms in which bots are becoming common practice, with many of the bots operating on multiple platforms. Twitter bots Slack bots Tumblr bots YouTube bots Reddit bots Telegram bots Snapchat bots Kik bots Trello bots Another interesting part of this, is that not all bots are executed via API. Some bots simply use the chosen protocol of popular messaging applications, and operate via an account setup on the platform. However, even with these implementations, APIs still come into play in providing the...[<a href="/2016/03/21/sucked-into-the-world-of-bots-and-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>For some workshops preparation this week, I needed to isolate just the best of the API calls and documentation from handful of APIs I am trying to teach my intended audience about. I have almost twenty separate companies targeted, with a couple hundred individual endpoints across the API provided served up by these companies. I needed to a way to easily define, organize, and present a subset of API samples, intended for a specific purpose audience.&nbsp; In this workshop, I need the simplest, most intuitive samples possible across these popular APIs. For Twitter I need to be able to just send a tweet, or list friends, and on Facebook I need to post to my wall, and search for user. I need simple actions, that will be meaningful to my higher education audience--most likely students. I don't want to bury all of them with the endless API possibilities that surround the APIs I'm showcasing, I need the twenty use cases that they'll give a shit about, and result in them being interested in what an API is. As I do with all my research, I organize my lists of APIs into APIs.json collections, and publish the results as a Github repository. This allows me to quickly assemble, relevant collections of APIs, designed for specific audiences, in a way that I can wrap with informative content and stories, helping them on-board with the importance of APIs, as well as the individual APIs. This got me thinking, because as part of an APIs.json index I have all the moving parts identified, I just need a way to simplify, and distill down into little API samples, so that I can offer up through the experience I am crafting. To help me in my effort I started defining a new APIs.json API type schema, which allows me to define a sample subset of any API I have defined using OpenAPI Spec. Within each schema, I can map to a...[<a href="/2016/03/17/further-simplifying-my-api-docs-and-providing-api-samples/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am preparing a project for the conversations, and a workshop I have on my schedule this week at Davidson College, called:&nbsp;Indie EdTech &amp; The Personal API.&nbsp;I'll be going on campus, talking to campus leadership, administrators, teachers, and students about APIs. To put myself into the right frame of mind, I wanted to explore what the concept of a personal API. The Concept Of Personal APIs Is RidiculousFirst, I'll set the stage with what is a common reaction, when I mention the term "personal API" to other API folk in the space: "Its a nice idea, but it just isn't something the average person will ever need, let alone care about what an API is--it is a non problem." To me, that response sounds just like what you'd hear in early 2000's when asked if any single individual would ever need a web presence--something that blogging and the social media star has continued to&nbsp; evolve, while also proving the naysayers wrong.&nbsp; At first glance, a personal API seems like it would be a stack of APIs that you would setup, and manage yourself. Again, something the average developer or IT person would dismiss as out of the realm of reason for the average person--there just isn't a need. I would probably agree here. While having a set of APIs that could help you manage your life bits sounds like a great idea, I just don't think the average Internet user is going to care about their digital life bits at this level--the average person will have to have a an actual problem to solve, before they will ever need and care about an API (secret is that this is true for business too) Everybody Already Has Personal APIsI prefer looking at this topic as something that has already been answered--everyone already has personal APIs!

			<p><em>14 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I'm evaluating the Alexa Voice Service ecosystems alongside leading API messaging platforms like Telegram, and Slack, who are changing the way users engage and communicate, but also are evolving how we are putting our API driven resources to work. As I do this research, I keep finding myself coming back to Amazon's concept of an Alexa Skill, and thinking about how it applies to average everyday APIs like mine. Do my APIs have the skills they need to compete in this new voice and bot enabled world? It is bad enough that I don't always have the skills necessary to compete as a programmer, but now my APIs have to have the right skills? WTF ;-) Seriously though, I feel the Amazon's concept of the "skill" reflects a wider experiental shift in the API space, where APIs need to deliver information and other digital resources in the context of how they will be experienced by users, and not just how they are stored and maintained by developers and IT operations. Since there is such a diverse amount of APIs out there, what exactly consitutes as a "skill" could vary widely. If you are person or business directory, the skill might be returning the website address or phone number for an individual or business. If you are an email or SMS service it might be simply send a message to an individual. The concept of a skill further come into focus when you think in context of Alexa Voice Service, or as Amazon puts it: Alexa, the voice service that powers Amazon Echo, provides capabilities, or skills, that enable customers to interact with devices in a more intuitive way using voice. Examples of skills include the ability to play music, answer general questions, set an alarm or timer, and more. How does this same way of thinking apply when we are communicating in Slack? Does my API have the same skills to identify that someone just...[<a href="/2016/03/14/do-my-apis-have-the-skills-they-need-to-compete-in-a-voice-and-bot-enabled-world/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was experimenting with breaking apart API definitions over the weekend, and exploring different ways of assembling the moving parts into different types of tools, visualizations, and other goodies. I do not have any particular objective with this work, other than just pushing the boundaries of we dynamically tell the story of our APIs, and hopefully assist in moving forward the current available API documentation toolbox we have for API providers, and consumers.
Yesterday I published a short piece on API definition driven tag clouds,&nbsp;and this morning I have an API definition driven autocomplete text box, providing access to the paths, verbs, or tags present in any single, or multiple OpenAPI Specs that are indexed using APIs.json.

This particular edition of the API.json and OpenAPI Spec autocomplete pulls across the SMS API providers included in my SMS API research, but is something that will be available for any of my research areas, as part of my ever evolving set of APIs.json tooling. I will be building these into my own custom API design tooling, allowing me to quickly recall the hundreds of endpoints available in my API stack, as well as learn about additional API endpoints available in the 3rd party APIs I already depend on.
I am going to also play with how I can use across the documentation of the APIs that I include in my research. Ultimately I would like to see these types of solutions available as a suite of UI, and UX tools in my overal API driven, hacker storytelling toolbox, allowing me to better tell stories around what APIs can do.

			<p>I am playing with different ways of exploring APIs, building on documentation solutions like Swagger UI, Lucybot Console, and Slate. I want to push the boundaries of how we document, tell stories, and understand our APIs. I'm playing with two different formats, one is driven using Jekyll + Liquid, and the other are more embeddable JavaScript editions. I haven't hit on anything groundbreaking, but I am having fun breaking up the API definitions of common APIs, and organizing them for different experiences. This weekend I took my API Stack tag cloud, and made it driven by API collections defined using APIs.json and OpenAPI Spec. Instead of driving it from a simple tag JSON file, I wired it up to the APIs.json for each of my research projects, and it loops through each API that is indexed, finds their OpenAPI Spec, and uses various elements to publish as tags. First I applied to my SMS research, to help me understand the verb usage across the APIs: Then I wanted to scale it, and see what the tag cloud would look like when applied to a larger collection: I'm not sure if these visualizations offer me any value, but it gets me thinking about APIs at the macro level, considering different ways to slice and dice the information available as part of any of the API's indexed. The verb tag cloud is extracted from an API I have that returns the verb count for any APIs.json collection, which gives me one possible data point to consider when quantifying how open, or closed an API is. Its not always constant, due to the wide variety of ways people design their APIs, but when you see an API that is all GET, there is good chance they are pretty tight with their resources. As a quick next step, I also connected it up to the tags applied across all the OpenAPI Specs indexed, looking a different slice of the...[<a href="/2016/03/13/api-definition-driven-visualizations-verb-tag-clouds/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was reading a post on Amazon's new SMART(Surveillance Marketed As Revolution Techonology) water pitcher, which is more about Amazon's new connected device partner commerce strategy, than it is about this individual connected device example. The quote from the story explains the strategy pretty well. Last week, Amazon.com curiously devoted an entire press release to a water pitcher. But not just any water pitcher. Rather, Amazon detailed a new partnership with Brita to bring consumers the $45 smart Brita Infinity Pitcher. Just connect it to your Wi-Fi, and the Brita Infinity Pitcher will automatically track how much water passes through its filter. Then, using Amazon Dash Replenishment, it'll automatically order a new filter when a replacement is needed. So now, your pitchers orders its replacement filters, your lights will order new bulbs, your printer will order more of those wonderfully expensive print cartridges for you. At a consumer level, most of this seems pretty lazy to me, and unnecessary, but then again, I do not represent mainstream society in any way. Having your common devices in your life, order up their replacement parts, or even servicing, seems pretty attractive, but is something I'm sure we won't consider the downside until its way to late. Ok, let's stop for a second. There is your new startup idea Jane / Joe entrepreneur, "the Angie's List + Dash Replenishment == service scheduling API platform". My cable modem calls for a service provider when the modem needs replaced with newer model, my refrigerator and dishwasher call repair(wo)man when they are not running at optimal levels. When you get your funding, make sure and cut me in for a point or two. ;-) Well, as with 96% of this API circus, I'm not highlighting this because I think it is a good idea, I am talking about because it is happening, and will begin impacting the rest of us.

			<p><em>10 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I am borrowing from the very prescient post from Martin Fowler, an older post, but is a topic that should be revisited regularly. Google translate tells me Datensparsamkeit means "data minimization". I prefer Fowler's translation:
It's an attitude to how we capture and store data, saying that we should only handle data that we really need.
My partner in crime Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) sent me the link, and expressing that it was very telling that we (United States) do not have a word that applies for this concept. I think data minimization gets the point across, but I think Fowler elevates it from being just a data process, to something that should be rooted in company culture.
I am adding&nbsp;Datensparsamkeit as a building block to any area of the API life cycle that will potentially store data. The goal is to help API platforms consider &nbsp;how they capture and store data at the strategy level, as well as tactically at every stop along the API life cycle, and only capture and store exactly what you need, and nothing more.
Just because cloud storage is cheap doesn't mean we should capture and store everything we can--just because we can, doesn't mean we sould. Data can just as easily be a liability as it can be an asset, and your machinations around there being an all knowing, all seeing big data future are pure fantasy. The real trouble becomes clear when you realize that the majority of the tech sector, and the NSA, kind of enjoy living in this fantasy world.

			<p><em>10 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>One topic that has been present in numerous discussions lately is just how much work goes into designing, deploying, and managing APIs, as well as around the integration between the growing number of APIs. It keeps coming up in conversations with existing API service providers, as well as internal actors within small business, enterprise, and government API efforts. When you live and breathe API, it all just makes sense in your head, but as API architects, designers, and believers trying to shepherd forward your API within existing organizations, it will come up against many unanticipated challenges.&nbsp;I have discussed this before with my stories about 75% of your API efforts in the enterprise being cultural and political, not technical, and with a short one on your API strategy providing a glimpse into your company culture. In any API journey, there will always be numerous business, political, and ultimately human obstacles between you and the API success you see in your head, something that takes investment, and access to the right expertise and resources. In conversations with API tooling and service providers lately, the need to focus more resources in training, development, and integration services has come up several times. It is good that companies in the space are recognizing the need, and investing in what is needed. Where the imbalance in all of this begins to show up, is that it isn't something these companies are willing to highlight as a core competency on their site, or in my storytelling, because it is viewed as a potential negative with investors. I am guessing that investment in training, development and integration services just isn't trendy enough for VCs. I get it. Investors want to put their money into the coolest tools, the ones that match all the stories they are hearing. However I can't help but feel this positioning is creating an imbalance that is preventing some very interesting tools, and API driven solutions from getting the...[<a href="/2016/03/10/an-imbalance-in-investment-priorities-that-will-continue-to-slow-api-growth-and-adoption/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>When a startup goes away, either through acquisition, or any other reason, and I find the site dormant, with a friendly goodbye message, or just gone, I usually just remove the tag from them in my primary system, and they are gone from my research with the next publishing of the project.&nbsp; When Parse announced they are turning off the lights, and Kimono Labs said they were going away after an "acquisition" by Palantir, I started putting more thought into what I was going to do at the time of deprecation. I want to be able to capture more of these stories. I actually have a lot of data, content, notes, and analysis on these companies that are going away, and I need to do a better job making it all accessible. To support this effort I am beginning to add a dead pool page to each of my research areas, where I will simply re-tag any company or organization that is present in my research, when the shut off the lights--providing a single place where we can see our recent history. I find it valuable to have this recent history, right at my fingertips, when I am trying to understand where each of my research areas are headed. Without the actual companies to reference I am reliant on my own memory, which isn't always the best. In the tech space, I feel like we are good at focusing on the future, and we easily forget the past, even what just happened last month. I am always amazed at which startups just go away, without any notice. Many of them do not have customers, but some of them do, and many of them have aksed me for my thoughts on the space, and on their road maps. Part of having a deprecation page is also to inform newcomers that the road is littered with corpses of those who came before them, but to also provide...[<a href="/2016/03/10/adding-a-dead-pool-page-to-each-api-research-area-so-we-remember-the-past/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>It definitely sucks that Parse went away like they did, but you have to commend them on the page they left behind. Facebook put up the download link to an open source version of Parse Server, and a link to the migration guide. I like that they also left up the blog, which I think is almost just as important as the code, telling the story of what happened, right up to the end.

I come across newly deprecated API providers, and API service providers all the time. Most of the time they are just dormant, nothing going on but the site is up, and other times the website is just gone, with no message at all. I rarely ever come across anyone who puts up an open source version of their platform, with instructions on what to do next, and leave the blog up.
If you are running an API, or a service that caters to the API space, and you are facing shutting everything down, feel free to reach out, and I'm happy to put up a splash page, help organize a Github repo of any server, and client code, as well as your API definitions. I'm happy to pay for the domain, so that the work you did doesn't go away, and people can learn from, and in some cases build off of what you did.&nbsp;

			<p><em>08 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am building on my conversation with&nbsp;Abhinav Asthana (@a85), the&nbsp;Co-founder and CEO&nbsp;of&nbsp;Postman, around how we can simplify the API documentation we are providing to our API consumers. As part of my work to profile the 50+ stacks of APIs I list on my home page, I am playing with different ways of listing APIs, sharing the valuable endpoints available within, and other key aspects with users. All this work is being driven by APIs.json, and Open API Spec listings. First I've rewritten my main API listing page using Liquid, running in Jekyll, which uses a _data folder full of APIs.json, and OpenAPI Specs published as part of each of my API life cycle, or API stack research. To operate, this listing just mounts the _data folder, and loops through all APIs.json files it contains, then parses each property present, giving special attention to OpenAPI Spec, and API plan formats. Liquid + Jekyll, running on Github Pages gives me a simple, static way of representing the machine readable indexes I generate for any of my research areas using APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and my new API plan format. Jekyll gives me the entire contents of the API definitions I'm storing in my _data folder, as a single Liquid object which I can loop through, to generate the static HTML for my listing of APIs. Using this approach gives me a machine readable index of all the moving parts of any single, or multiple API collection.&nbsp; The list of SMS APIs in this research is pretty verbose. I'm not even listing out the parameters, headers, and other details of each API, and the listings are pretty involved--further backing up&nbsp;Abhinav thoughts around simplifying the API documentation that we are generating. To help me push forward my Liquid skills, and the possibilities around breaking up the properties of each API defined using APIs.json, I took the same code and generated a separate, trimmed down version which only shows the APIs...[<a href="/2016/03/08/playing-with-concepts-around-simplifying-the-api-docs-that-are-generated-using-api-definitions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>If you follow my blog at all you know I love Noun Project icons. I started using them with my last minimal website design, and is something I've carried over with the latest edition. I've been using some images for so long I even started reworking, remixing, and making my own images, to help me tell my API stories.&nbsp; I find it difficult to conjure up just the right image, or images, to represent many very abstract API concepts, so it is something I am constantly working on alongside my research, as well as writing. As I was working on the content for a workshop I am doing at Davidson College this month, I wanted to have a simple, icon-based way for expressing just how open an API is (or isn't). &nbsp;My first crack at coming up with an icon set, breaks things down into three distinct groups. API (Flowing) API (Just Is) API (Not Flowing) My objective here is to provide a quick and easy way to help articulate how open an API is or isn't. Right now, these icons are set manually by me, based upon my overall feeling of the platform, the access they offer (or don't), terms of service, and overall business model. This will evolve in the future, as I have a lot of data that could also influence these ratings, but for now, it is all me. (Mwahahahaaaa) In this particular use case, I want to help university students better understand the many types of APIs, but in the future I'd like to evolve the ranking, and the icon set to be more meaningful, and apply across all of my research, anywhere you come across an API. I also just like playing with icons, and using my mad graphic design skills (not).&nbsp; Full Disclosure: The faucet idea was Audrey's idea, but she doesn't like the faucets I ended up using--maybe I'll switch them out with another set in future....[<a href="/2016/03/08/new-icons-for-helping-me-communicate-how-open-or-closed-an-api-is/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was being interviewed by an IBM group the other day, and I scribbled some thoughts on a piece of paper as I was rambling, which I just picked up trying to make sense of what was going through my mind, before I archive the chicken scratches.&nbsp; It look like during the call I was talking about how I see the world of API deployment, based upon how I am currently organizing providers, services, and tooling that I find. I was discussing with them how I am moving towards breaking things down into four buckets: Gateway - The more enterprise focused, IT department led API efforts, usually conducted at larger enterprises, and institutions. Artisan - A more farm to table, hand crafted approach that employs organic open source REST frameworks in the process. Cloud - Leverage the latest breed of cloud API service providers that allow you to deploy APIs from common resources online. Serverless - Outdoing the artisan hipster approach, all the cool kids are doing it without servers, piece by piece using Iron.io and Lambda. My API deployment research has just been a single list of service providers, and open source tooling for the last couple of years. Its time I started breaking things down a little more, and helping my readers find solutions based upon a more realistic approach to how APis are being deployed in the wild, or at least within their organizations. I almost added database as layer here, but I want to keep these API deployment buckets more about the middle layer in between the backend infrastructure, and the clients that wll be consuming API resources. API deployment touches on API design and definitions, and stops short of API management, with some overlap with containers, and API virtualization. This post also reveals the fact that I write most of these stories to help me think through the world of APis, get my thoughts in order, and help formalize them...[<a href="/2016/03/08/four-buckets-to-organize-my-api-deployment-research-into/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>As I made my way through nine of the leading SMS providers, profiling the details of their API plans, trying to bring it all together into a single, machine readable definition, Messente's pricing API stood out for me. Alongside their SMS API, and their number lookup API, they have a pricing API. As I take a moment to look at the simplicity of the endpoint, I am also thinking about the potential, and the details of their API docs really stand out for me. In addition to a pricing API being a valuable utility for any API consumer, I can't help but think the process of constructing a pricing API would force API providers to think another layer deeper in their API plan(s). Similar to how you have to think through the details of any resource you make available via an API, considering how it will be put to use, crafting a pricing API would force you to do the same for one of the most valuable, and overlooked resources you offer, that is core to all of your API operations. I've talked about the importance of API providers having management level APIs before, and I think they should also follow the lead of API providers like Messente who exist in a pretty mature sector, and have a handle on their API pricing. I've said it before, and will keeping harping on this issue...that all API providers and their service providers should have pricing APIs, as well as APIs for the other essential building blocks of their API operations. Another thing to note here, that I will be writing about more in the future, is the presence of two-letter country code as a parameter for an API. While not all APIs will have country specific pricing like SMS providers do, the API providers who are looking to truly operate globally, you will need to continue the automation of your operations, making pricing available on demand,...[<a href="/2016/03/07/thinking-through-the-design-of-your-pricing-api-would-help-you-think-through-your-api-plan/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I try to spend time each week evaluating what types of companies are looking for API / developer evangelist / advocates, to help keep my awareness in sync with what mainstream companies are needing (or not), when it comes to API outreach. In a little under an hour last night, I found almost 70 companies who had job postings for an evangelist or advocate for their platform. Google, Brightcove, Pubnub, Atlassian, Yahoo, Uber, Esri, Indix, Couchbase, edX, Amazon, Verifone, IBM Strongloop, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, Impinj, Twilio, Cybersource, Shopify, Jibo Inc., Vidyo, UrtheCast, Talend, Stormpath, Square, Mailjet, Cylance In., Bandwidth, MediaMath, Nuxeo, Clarifai, NodePrime, Visa, UrtheCast, Stream.io, mLab, FullContact, Sumo Logic , Twitch, Auth0, Iron.io, Wercker, ANS Affiliates Solutions, Okta, Button, Lever, PlayFab, DreamFactory, Nitrous, Firebase, IBM, Accurate Background, Inc., PagerDuty, Coda Search, Aerospike, SGF Global , Bodymedia, DataBricks, Dropbox, Heroku, Gitlab, New RElic, Crate.io, Asana, Vaadin, Ionic, Neura, and Algolia. I gathered these company names, after looking around LinkedIn, Indeed, and a couple of Google searches, over the course of an hour. I'm sure I would find even more if I kept on looking. As the API Evangelist, I have had a handful of these companies reach out, asking if I'm interested in the job, or possibly know someone that would be. Another seasoned evangelist, Keith Casey (@CaseySoftware), Twilio Alum, and Director of Product at @ClarifyIO, who also lives with a similar amount of attention from recruiters, responded like this when I shared the list with him.

			<p><em>07 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>
As I finish writing a piece on the 70 platforms who are looking for an API evangelist or developer advocate currently, sharing the wisdom of leading evangelist I follow in the space, I am also working to gather up my own wisdom so that I can share. While i am not an evangelist for a single API, I was at one point in my career, and I also practice many of the same techniques in my own work, evangelizing for all APis.
Out of my lists of advice for existing, and new API evangelists, one stands out: take care of yourself.&nbsp;Make sure and find balance in what you do, or you will burn out. You can ask anyone who has been in the scene for a while, and they'll tell you the same thing. However my message is ringing my ears right now, because I hit a wall last year with evangelism, and part of it was due to a fairly scary health concern.
In 2015, I finally settled down long enough to get health insurance (thanks Obama, jeez ;-), and made it to the doctor, who told me my liver wasn't functioning as expected, was fatty, overloaded, and sending out some pretty bad signals to the rest of my body. When you look through my timeline on Twitter or Facebook, it is pretty easy to understand why this is---no surprise here.
Anyways, luckily the liver is (hopefully) a pretty resilient part of the body, something that will recover now that I'm NOT drinking, not traveling, and getting more exercise. Anyways, I just wanted to take the opportunity to caution other evangelist out there to be careful, and make sure that finding balance is a priority, or you may find yourself in a situation where you might not be able to recover. I hate being the old dude of the bunch, but please take care of yourself, the work we do is important.&nbsp;

			<p>I had an exchange with Abhinav Asthana (@a85), the&nbsp;Co-founder and CEO&nbsp;of Postman on Twitter today. He was tweeting about API documentation, and I chimed in with my support, about how we need to keep evolving our approach to delivering API documentation so that they speak to a diverse audience. An API description created by experts is probably not the right way for building docs meant for beginners. &mdash; Abhinav Asthana (@a85) March 7, 2016 While I think we have come along ways with the introduction of Swagger UI, making learning about APIs much more interactive, and hands on, I think its time to look at how we can further refine how we deploy API documentation for our users. There is a lot going on with an API sometimes, and listing out all your endpoints, parameters, example requests, responses, and other elements can be overwhelming for new users who are just looking to learn the basics of an API, or possibly just get at s single resource, completing a specific action.&nbsp; Swagger UI, and similar API definition driven documentation like Lucybot API Console, do well in providing a comprehensive set of documentation for a potentially wide variety of API docs, but we need to keep scratching. I'm not exactly sure what the answer here is, but I'd love to see much more simpler, embeddable, API documentation emerge. Solutions that allow API providers to display a small set of precise APIs, or possibly come up with some sort of slick user interface (UI), that delivers a simpler, more meaningful user experience (UX) that speaks to what a specific group of users is needing. This is not a well-formed idea of mine, but is something I want to get out early. I'm seeing an increase in the number of new API documentation resources lately, and hopefully I can influence at least one or two of their road maps with my ideas. This is one reason I've broke out...[<a href="/2016/03/07/it-would-be-nice-to-have-some-simpler-interactive-api-documentation-in-addition-to-what-we-have-now/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was pushing forward my API plan research this weekend, building on some of the tooling I developed during the last round, and the machine readable API plan format I hammered out late last year to help me define API plans. This time I'm applying it to nine of the SMS API providers I'm currently profiling, trying to get a new view of the plans of SMS APIs like Twilio and Plivo, but also working &nbsp;to continue polishing my 100K view on the SMS API industry.&nbsp; Documenting The API Plans Of Nine SMS APIsThis last friday I got to work profiling the pricing, plans, rate limits, and access tiers for nine of the leading SMS API providers that I keep an eye on. From their pricing pages I gathered the common metrics, limitations, geographic considerations, pricing, and other element offered by each provider, putting them into separate buckets, standardizing how I record these valuable aspects of each API providers resource. This is a process I'd say 1/3 of the time falls right into place, 1/3 of the time it takes some translation and massaging to make it fit, and the other 1/3 things just don't fit into any common way of thinking. Identifying The Common Metrics&nbsp;I found it pretty easy to identify the common metrics applied to SMS APIs, as most everything revolving around the concept of the message and a number. There are nuances to these resources that are being metered, like the separation between SMS and MMS, and a local phone number, toll free phone number, and a short codes, but for now I'm just trying to put pricing into common buckets, by loosely grouping the metrics that are applied via API plans. List of Pricing Across SMS APIsAlong with identifying the common metrics being applied to SMS APIs, I was able to establish a list of the pricing that is being leveraged across these providers.

			<p><em>04 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was looking to create an APIs.json plus OpenAPI Spec(s) for the WordPress.org API, and the Instructure Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) API. I am pulling together a toolkit to support a workshop at Davidson College in North Carolina this month, and I&nbsp;wanted a handful of APIs that would be relevant to students, and faculty on campus.&nbsp; In my experience, when it comes to documenting large APIs using OpenAPI Spec, you don't want to be hand rolling things, making auto generation essential. There are two options for accomplishing this, 1) I can use a proxy like Charles or Stoplight.io, or 2) I can write a script to scrape the publicly available HTML documentation for each API. While I do enjoy playing with mapping out APIs in Stoplight.io, allowing it do the heavy lifting of crafting each API definition, sometimes there is more relevant meta data for the API available in the API documentation. The OpenAPI Spec, plus APIs.json files for both the WordPress and Instructure Canvas APIs took me about an hour a each, to write the script, and round off the OpenAPI Spec, making sure it was as complete as possible. Through scraping, I get description for endpoints, parameters, and sometimes I also get other detail including sample responses, enum, and response codes. One downside of obtaining an API definition by scraping, is that I only get the surface area of an API, not the responses, and underlying data model. Sometimes this is included in documentation, but I do not always harvest this--waiting until I can get a often more correct schema, when I map out using a proxy or via HAR file. This is OK. I find the trade-off worth it. I'd rather have the more human-centered descriptions, and names of each endpoints, than the response definitions--that will come with time, and more usage of the actual APIs. In the end, it really depends to the size of an API, and the quality...[<a href="/2016/03/04/scraping-static-docs-is-often-better-than-proxy-for-generating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>As I'm thinking about the bigger picture of how startup acquisitions are impacting the world of APIs, I am also having several conversations with folks about their brand spank'n new API focused startup, I can't help but feel that things are never as they seem, when it comes to the 1000 lb gorillas acquisitions within each wave of API driven startups. Of course there are many reasons why big companies gobble up the little startups, one that has a wide range of positive, and negative impacts on the overall health of the API economy, but from my vantage point rarely do the public stories ever size up with the real motivations behind the acquisitions.&nbsp; Why do big companies buy well performing API startups? Leading technology? User adoption? Integrations? Talent acquisition? Revenue? Relevance? Look cool? I'm sure it "could" be a mix of any of those elements, but after seeing many acquisition's get shut down, users flee, and talent jump ship from these soon to be irrelevant, investment saturated startups--I'm always looking for the other motivations beyond why these corporate giants are trying to look alll pretty in their startup jewelry. To me, the motivations behind startup acquisitions are more about what isn't said, than it is ever what is said (jewelry is a distraction). Its about posturing in the space where you dominate (or want to). It is about steering the conversation where you want it to go, and if you don't want things to change, the conversation will go nowhere. It is about sending the right signals to your competition, and the market--all while prancing around wearing your pretty startup jewelry. Ok, so why do I give a shit? Well, when the majority of companies I profile, track on, have conversations, take money from, and in some cases, advocate their products, services, and tooling, are playing in this game, and I have to consider the bigger picture of how shit flows upstream.

			<p><em>03 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>As I look through API portals, profiling the building blocks of successful API platform, I'm always looking for bite-size stories for my readers. I was working to complete my Instagram API definition, as part of my photo API research, and their getting started graphic caught my attention.
This three step getting started visual for Instagram is prominently available on the home page, providing a very distilled down version of what I recommend API providers usually accomplish with a dedicated getting started page.

The featured getting started area provides you with the link to register your application, and overview on authentication and authorization, and a link to all the endpoints, so you can start making requests. I am a big fan of there always being a dedicated getting started page for APIs that I am on-boarding with, but I am always a bigger fan when someone distills these building blocks into something that is way easier to understand, and execute--without all the blah blah blah.
I'm going to consider adding a feature getting started building block, in addition to having the dedicated page. When done right, I think they can accomplsh the same thing, but with one less click--reducing any friction we possibly can in the on-boarding process.

			<p><em>01 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have had several conversations with API providers lately who are somewhat frustrated with the way their API operations are going. While their APIs have brought in many new conversations, and supported some interesting integration, they haven't been the business driver that they had hoped when they kicked off their API efforts.&nbsp; There are many reasons why API efforts may not live up to the hype, mostly its because I think we raise the bar too high in Silicon Valley. We raise up the Amazon's and Twilio's up in our mind as models we want follow, and talk about API success in terms of number of users, and in billions of API calls--as just a couple of examples. I will be the first to admit that many of us pundits have over hyped, and is something I've been working to filter out of my storytelling over the last couple of years. The people I am having conversations with admit that an API is necessary, and wouldn't dream of getting rid of their API effort, but are just wrestling with the fact that the API just didn't end up be the business driver like they expected. In most of these conversations, APIs are just having to play second fiddle to traditional business elements like sales, marketing, education, support, and many of the other more mundane, fundamental aspects of business operations. While I can talk through these companies API strategy, to see where I can make suggestions, but in the end, an API is just one of the tools in your business toolbox. Your next customer most likely will not be making their way through your sales funnel simply because you have an API. It may be one important consideration, and almost certainly will come up down the road, but most likely will not be the conversation starter everyone hopes it will be.&nbsp; I do not want to throw a wet blanket on your API enthusiasm.

			<p>
The NextWeb had a great story today that&nbsp;Google has redesigned its developer policies with clearer language and visual examples, and normally I don't jsut parrot what the tech blogosphere publishes, but it's an important enough API message, I think it warrants repeating. In my experience, API providers just emulate what they hear in the space, and stories like this need amplifcation.
What Google did isn't rocket surgery, they just simplified the legalize around what they expect of developers. What better way to actually help ensure these best practices around the platform actual happen, then by actually providing simple titles, summary description, images, and other relevant links, on a developer policy page. In most scenarios developers aren't malicious, they are just usually ignorant of the best practices that often exist in the platforms legalize we agree to, but seldom ever read.
My friend Tyler Singletary (@harmophone)&nbsp;stated that, "the organization here for policy is fun, mostly clear, and interactive. A company the size of Google distilling the deep TOS policy into such a user and developer friendly front end is pretty astounding.&rdquo;&nbsp;-- I agree. Simple like this, when you operate at Google scale can be pretty hard, and is somthing I'd love see standardized across Google offerings.&nbsp;
I will be adding any of the elements from the simplified Google Play developer policy that are missing in my API terms of service, privacy, licensing, and branding research. I will also add the concept of having visuals for each area, or building block, and add the common them of "keep it simple", helping API providers remember that they actually want developers reading and understanding this stuff, not having it buried in the legaleze that nobody will give shit about.

			<p><em>29 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I've been moving forward with my efforts to better on-board folks with the sometimes overwhelming amounts of research available via API Evangelist. I have several groups looking for guidance on where to start with their strategy, as well as develop some lower level tactical approaches to propelling themselves forward in their API journey. I recently posted a master list of my essential building blocks across, 20+ areas of my research, and now I'm distilling these into a single project to help me move forward as one potential operational API strategy for a small businesses. First i took the almost 1000 building blocks I've organized across my areas of API research, and added a question for each, which simply asks where things are with each of these potential considerations along the API life cycle. For this particular small business API strategy, I've opted to include discovery, definitions, design, hypermedia, DNS, deployment, virtualization, containers, management, documentation, SDK, embeddable, real time, webhooks, support, monitoring, testing, road map, authentication, security, terms of service, privacy, licensing, branding, monetization, plans, partners, and evangelism, covering 28 areas of the API life cycle that would be relevant to a small business. The result is a pretty comprehensive API strategy that might help a small business adopt a more coherent framework for their own efforts--the problem is this can still be very high level thinking, and difficult to know where to get going on day one, what to do when you launch a new API, and other more tactical aspects of API operations. &nbsp;To help me bring such a large, lofty API strategy down into the tactical weeds, I'm going to be applying it to my own, existing operations, and deriving a handful of tactical implementations: Day One - Where do we begin, even with a legacy mess of systems, services, web services, and APIs?

			<p>I need some help with APIs! Ok, where can I help you? Well, I have multiple systems, that we use to operate our business on a daily basis, and when we do things in one system, we need the other system to know about it, and when certain events occur we need to trigger pushes or pulls between all systems--this is how many conversations begin as the API Evangelist. While many people think they are looking for an API solution, they are really looking for an API journey, with a little assistance from me along the way. Sure they want an API to make their world more integrated, inter-operable, automated, and real time, but in reality, they are needing to get to work unwinding a mess of legacy technical, business, and political business decisions that have been over years--this takes a journey. Ok, so where do we get started (another common theme lately) in helping quantify the problem set, and what a journey will look like to get us closer to a solution? This post is designed to help you self assess, answer a handful of key questions, and put yourself on a path forward. Internal Systems InventoryWhat systems are involved? If this is a company-wide effort, this might be a more involved task, but if it is a single project, or objective, it will hopefully be much smaller.

			<p>I often push back against API consumers when they complain about the deprecation of API platform, focusing on the fact that we cannot depend on APIs to be around forever. I also push back against API providers when they express concern around having to support developers forever, for fear of revolt in the community. I think the rational folks in the space understand that a balance is needed in these situations, but alas, there are always new incidents that make us go WTF?? I was reading about Venmo halting new developer access to its API from Techcrunch today, which left me shaking my head, saying damn, damn, damn. I know a lot of you are invested in the startup game, and in all honesty, I am too. A lot of my income comes from startsup, who have taken VC money. I want to believe there can be an ethical path forward in all of this, and it is not all just gambling by a bunch rich white dudes who don't give a shit, but it is getting harder and harder to do. Venmo gained a lot of traction with the support of its API and its developer community, and to just turn off the spigot after riding on the backs of its API and community is just exploitation. I'm not saying they can't shut down their program--I am saying the are obligated to communicate better.&nbsp; In several conversations with folks today, the topic of a ranking system for API providers came up again, with some sort of rating for good and providers, as well as some sort of warning system to alert developers ahead of time, that an API is stumbling. This is something I've been working on for a while, and will keeping working on, with my partners. While I think such a system could help us identify some bad actors early, and incentivize others to think through their approach to API operations, and...[<a href="/2016/02/26/extracting-as-much-value-from-your-api-developers-as-you-can-then-screwing-them-over-in-the-end/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>As part of a renewed focus on the API discovery definition format APIs.json, I wanted to revisit the propsed machine readable API discovery specification, and see what is going on. First, what is APIs.json? It is a machine readable JSON specification, that anyone can use to define their API operations. APIs.json does not describe your APIs like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint do, it describes your surrounding API operations, with entries that can reference your Open API Spec, API Blueprint, or any other format that you desire. APIs.json Is An Index For API OperationsAPIs.json provides a machine readable approach that API providers can put work in describing their API operations, similar to how web site providers describe their websites using sitemap.xml. Here are the APIs, who are describing their APIs using APIs.json: APIStrat Austin API API Evangelist Acuity Scheduling BreezoMeter CheckMarket Clarify Data Validation DNS Check Email Hunter FeedbackHub Fitbit Gavagai Kin Lane Link Creation Studio OneMusicAPI Pandorabots API Qalendra RiteTag Singlewire SiteCapt Social Searcher API Super Monitoring Timekit Trade.gov Twitch Bot Directory EnClout frAPI Section.io Spoonacular APIs.json Indexes Can Be Created By 3rd PartiesOne important thing to add, is that these APIs.json files can also be crafted, and published by external parties. An example of this is with the Trade.gov APIs. I originally created that APIs.json file, and coordinated with them to eventually it get published under their own domain, making it an authoritative APIs.json file. Many APIs.json files will be born outside of the API operations they describe, something you can see in my API stack project: The API Stack - Provides almost 1000 APIs.json files, that describe the API operations of many leading public API platforms. There is also around 300 OpenAPI specifications, for some of the platforms described APIs.json Can Be Used To Describe API CollectionsBeyond describing a single API, within a single domain, APIs.json can also be used to describe entire collections of APIs, providing a machine readable way to...[<a href="/2016/02/25/what-is-apis-json-and-what-is-next-for-the-api-discovery-format/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>In the last six months I was fortunate enough to be able to push forward one of my side projects, with the help of a prototype grant from the Knight Foundation. The mission of the project, is to help move forward existing open federal government data projects, by adopting them, and helping clean up the data, publish simple APIs, generate more meta data, while also telling stories around the project. Something I originally called&nbsp;Federal Agency Dataset Adoption, but then shortened to simply Adopta.Agency. When I was doing my final presentation in Pittsburgh last month, for the Knight Foundation, someone from the University of Miami was present, and when they got home, contacted me about helping move forward the database available at ClinicalTrials.gov. I do not know much about the data present in the collection, but immediately recognized it as a viable Adopta.Agency project. To summarize their request, it went something like this :-) I am working on a project that uses data from https://clinicaltrials.gov/ . Their API is crap to say the least. I was wondering if you could help me out. Is there a tool I could use to get better access to the data? If we download the entire thing is an 850MB zipped file in XML. I only need a fraction of the trials in the db. I guess I am looking for advice on how to proceed.&nbsp; I get questions like this a lot, something that contributed to me pushing forward my Adopta.Agency work. The Knight Foundation prototype grant was just that, the prototype funding, something I intend to keep pushing forward, targeting new data sets, and looking for more open data activists to assist in doing the heavy lifting.

What Zapier enables, is very much aligned with how I would like the API economy end up operating. Where system to system, website, mobile, and device based API integration is important, but platform interoperability for the masses I feel is much more critical. Zapier is how the average person will take control over their digital self, and move the growing amount of data and content we are generating, across across the growing number of service we depend on daily.
Thanks to Wade, and the Zapier team for hanging out with the API Evangelist, and doing such important, and cool work with APIs.

			<p><em>23 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>As I listen to my hangout with Wade Foster of Zapier, I'm considering the overlap between my API reciprocity, bots, virtualization, containerization, webhooks, and even voice research. At the same time I'm thinking about how APIs are being used to inject valuable data, content, and other valuable API driven resources to the stream of existing applications we use every day.&nbsp; Some of this thinking is derived from my bot research, where they impersonate Twitter users, or respond to specific key words, phrases, or keyboard shortcuts in Slack. Some of this thinking comes from learning more about the ability to inject "code steps" into multi-step workflows with Zapier. Then as I continue doing my curation of news I read about Uber allowing developers to create trip experiences, opening up another window for potential API driven injection into the Uber "experience".&nbsp; It got me thinking, where else is this happening? I would say Twitter Cards is a form of this, but is an example that is more media focused, rather than bots (although it could be bot driven behavior). Then I started looking across the 50 areas of the API life cycle I'm monitoring, and voice stood out, as another area of potential overlap. Amazon is allowing developers to inject API driven content, data, and other resources into the conversational stream occurring Alexa users. I don't see this being much different that bots injecting responses into the messaging stream of Slack and Twitter users. I'm just getting going with these thoughts. Something I'm thinking containers, and serverless approaches to API deployment are going to impact this line of thought as well. I'm considering pulling together a research project around this overlap, something I will call API injection. Essentially, how are people injecting API driven data, content, and other resources, into the streams of other applications, using APIs. I could see a whole new breed of API provider emerge, just to satisfy the appetite of bots, and other...[<a href="/2016/02/23/exploring-my-thoughts-around-api-injection-into-messaging-voice-and-other-online-experiences/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>When I talk about companies using APIs to be more transparent, one of the immediate comments I receive from folks is that "not everyone can be public by default". I agree with this situation, but I always counter with an introduction to the concept that transparency can be applied in strictly internal or partner situations as well--public is not the only type of transparency out there. I am a big proponent of the public version of API driven transparency, but I also feel it can be applied within the firewall, as well as on the open web. Simple developer portals, with a quality selection of valuable APIs, up to date interactive documentation, and other resources, available at a known, yet secured location, can go a long way to stimulate integration--both human (team) and system. Self-service access to API design, definitions, deployment, management, testing, and other life cycle strategies, as well as the API resources can go a long way to establish a rich environment for collaboration, reuse, and consistency in API strategy across an organization. The benefits of internal and partner layers approaches to transparency, as well as public transparency helps break down silos. Think about the separations between some of the other groups in your organization, and possibly with your leadership up the ladder. Would it help if the road map for your team was out in the open for anyone within your company to follow? Would conversations around outages and system stability be more productive if they included a wider group--maybe preventing some of the micro aggression that occur behind closed doors?&nbsp; There are many, many ways API can bring transparency to your organization, way before you ever consider doing it publicly. When I say API, this starts with the technical endpoints, but a modern API conversation ALWAYS involves documentation, code, communications, and feedback loops. The Amazon Web Services family of APIs isn't just purely about the compute and storage endpoints. It is...[<a href="/2016/02/17/the-api-transparency-discussion-is-not-exclusively-about-being-public-or-private/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have been working for a month or so on what some of the common tasks that developer advocates and evangelists would like to see occur around their API operations. These are small little tasks that evangelists should be doing themselves, but if they can encourage their own API community, or the wider developer and tech community to help out, they might achieve a greater reach. Getting your community to help out with tasks on your platform is nothing new. This is a core premise of modern web API operations, something that can work well in some ecosystems, but has historically been abused by other ecosystems. Some API providers enjoy vibrant communities where developers are more than happy to step up and build things for free, generate a buzz, and show up to events. The reality for most is that it can be very hard to stimulate developers to help in any way, and resort to the exploration of other ways they can stimulate this activity. As I was exploring these concepts with fellow evangelist, soliciting ideas for what some of the common tasks evangelist might need, someone brought up how sleezy this sounds. Are you going to give away swag, gift cards, or money for these tasks? Are you going to do it for points? I agree, on the surface, when you describe it like that, it does sound cheezy, if not sleezy. Then I got thinking about the micro transactions and tasks people ask of me on a regular basis--things like: Writing Blog Posts Retweeting a Link Voting Up Something on &nbsp;Hacker News Voting Up Something on Product Hunt Write a Code Sample Build a Prototype Integration Comment On a Discussion Create a Visualization Participate in a Webinar Keynote a Conference Participate In Discussion Write a White Paper Provide a Quote Talk To Reporter Talk To Analyst These are some of the common requests I get.

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I was going through the SendGrid API and profiling their available plans and pricing, using my new API plan tracking format, and I just have to stop and say--I wish everyone would present their pricing pages as simply as SendGrid does. I cannot speak to whether their pricing is good, fair, or otherwise, but the layout, and the way they explain it, is very simple straightforward and easy to make sense of.
In addition to having the pricing for their email API broke down into six coherent plan tiers, they also have a compare plan details table which shows all six plans, side by side, with each core feature, and other elements of API access available to browse. As an API analyst, it make the data entry for my API tracking much easier, but as an API consumer it make it much easier for me to budget for the API driven resources I will need as part of my API operations.

The state of your pricing page tells a lot about how baked your overall API strategy. I will be the first to admit my own API plans and pricing are half-baked at best. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to be, the value of my resources, and what the market will bear--my pricing page reflects and amplifies this dilemma. This is something I am determined to get into order, as I continue to push forward my API plan research.

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I like my API service providers like I like my APIs, doing one thing and doing it well. Sure services can work together (using APIs), and companies can launch multiple services, but I prefer selecting the services that I use as part of my API operations, as small, modular pieces of API infrastructure. In my opinion, API service providers are just another class of API provider, they just happen to be selling services to businesses that are operating APIs. You can see this in action with API Docs, part of the StopLight.io platform. API Docs does one thing well--API documentation! Although for me, it touches on two important areas of the API lifecycle, both documentation and definitions, but also illustrates the maturation of these stops along the API life cycle, since Tony first launched Swagger UI. The StopLight team is taking API definitions to the next level, but they are also helping us better deliver the documentation portion of our API life cycle(s)--all driven by API definitions. (meta) If you are looking for another example of this in action, take a look at API transformer, from the APIMATIC team. APIMATIC alone fits my definition of a modular API service provider, doing SDKs, and doing the well, but then you factor in their API translation tooling. #winning Again, APIMATIC is focusing on modular services, that are API definition driven--very similar to what StopLight is up to with their strategy.&nbsp; In 2016 you will hear me hammer on three key concepts when it comes to delivering services in the API space, and selling to indivivdual API providers. 1) do one thing and do it well, 2) speak in API definition formats, and 3) do it with APIs!! It isn't rocket surgery that API service providers should be practicng what they preach, but in 2016 I am finding that these three characteristics are proving to be a reliable way for me to differentiate the API service providers who...[<a href="/2016/02/16/i-am-liking-the-modular-services-that-are-delivering-in-specific-areas-of-api-life-cycle-like-apidocs-io/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>Stoplight.io is a very cool new API modeling and proxy tool. I just wrote a post about the overall features of the platform, but I wanted to zoom in on a specific benefit that Stoplight.io brings to the table--the auto generation of OpenAPI Specs, for the mobile apps you depend on, as you use them. To understand the process in detail, I recommend watching the how was this created video on the Peach API documentation generated by Stoplight.io. When you download the Stoplight API designer for Mac (available on the account dashboard), you get the Prism API Proxy, which allows you to easily route all the traffic from your Macbook, as well as iPhone and IPad, through the platform. Once you create a new API, add the base URL for the API you are profiling, StoplLight does the rest, automatically generating an OpenAPI Spec, and attractive API documentation in the application, in real time as you watch--it is pretty cool to watch once you have turned on. Why do I want to do this? Well first of all, I am someone who has spent five years traveling around the world wearing the same t-shirt evangelizing APIs to everyone who will listen--obviously I have a number of problems. Beyond that, I'm fascinated by the API design practices of the leading "dark APIs" I use everyday, but rather than doing so via a public API program, it is via a mobile device. I'm fascinated by this layer of the API sector, one that is fueling all of the API growth we are seeing, but getting a much smaller portion of the conversation that is dominated by leading public APIs.&nbsp; To help me learn about what is possible with StopLight, I profiled the APIs that LinkedIn and Instagram mobile applications used. It took me about 15 minutes to go through each application, and hit publish on the documentation you see published to API Docs.

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>After I've talked about my mapping of the public, and mobile APIs with various folks over the last couple of months, I can usually put folks into one of three camps 1) they do not understand what the hell I am talking about and could care less, wishing the geek dude would shut up 2) thinks its a really interesting idea and worth exploring and discussing, or 3) they express concern, and liken it to scraping, and even hacking. I can understand folks not caring because they don't grasp it technically, but I do not fully yet grasp why people express concern, and think its wrong that I am mapping out, and wanting to discuss this layer of our digital world(s). As I was working with the new features in Stoplight.io last night, profiling some of the applications on my mobile phone's desktop, I spent some more time thinking about this topic. I find it fascinating that companies do not consider the APIs they use to drive mobile applications as public infrastructure, when I can sit in my living room, and engage with them over the public Internet. i find it even more fascinating that some folks consider what I do as contributing to securing problems, when I map these APIs out, share and discuss them on the open Internet.&nbsp; I am not intercepting anyone's traffic, or hacking anyone's systems. I am simply using a publicly available mobile application I found in the app store, and I am interested in understanding how leading companies are designing their APIs. Next I'm interested in discussing how these APIs compare with the same companies public API infrastructure, or possibly why a company does not have a publicly available API program. After that, I am also looking for a better understanding around which of my life bits (and others) are being transported as part of my daily mobile app usage.&nbsp; I've heard many arguments on why this public infrastructure...[<a href="/2016/02/16/concern-around-mapping-and-discussing-shadow-mobile-apis-shows-signs-of-an-imbalance/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I stayed up way too late playing with some of the new features in Stoplight.io. If you aren't familiar with what the Stoplight team has been cooking up--they have been hard at work crafting a pretty slick set of API modeling tools. I feel the platform provides me with a new way to look at the API life cycle--a perspective that spans multiple dimensions, including design, definition, virtualization, documentation, testing, discovery, orchestration, and client.&nbsp; Stoplight.io gives me a pretty powerful platform for managing, interfacing, sharing, collaborating, publishing, understanding, and evolving my API designs and definitions. You can begin modeling your APIs by importing an existing OpenAPI Spec, RAML, or Postman collection, or get to work modeling a new or existing API via the Stoplight client interface, which is just one tool in the Stoplight modeling toolbox. Additionally, I am able to create separate work spaces and import the OpenAPI Spec for all my own APIs, as well as the&nbsp;APIs that I depend on in the API space&nbsp;&lt; this organization is very important to me. Stoplight.io provides me with a new way to approach the organization of my API design and definitions, but the biggest impact for me, is when it comes to modeling the existing APIs out there. I've been working on automating the generation of OpenAPI Spec definitons of the APIs I use, as I use them--something that is two separate tasks at the moment. Stoplight.io does this, but does it waaaay better than what I have been doing, quietly crafting the OpenAPI Spec for any API I am using, in the background when you have Stoplight API discovery mode turned on, and the Prism API Proxy on. I am enjoying the view of the API space that Stoplight.io is giving me.

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have had multiple conversations with folks in the space who are building services and tooling for the API sector lately, where I was asked whether or not they should only be using existing API definition formats, or create their own API definition format that better represents what they are delivering. The reasoning is usually that they feel their own format would offer a more comprehensive approach than any single, existing API definition could--yet they fully understand the potential for adoption when they use existing formats like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint. My answer to them, is you deliver d) All The Above. I fully get that you will have your own unique view of the API space, and of what your tools and services will deliver, so you should be defining your own schema, but that you also can't ignore what is happening with OpenAPI Spec annd API Blueprint either. There is a groundswell of services, tooling, and savvy API architects and developers using these existing API definition formats, and you do not want to be an island in this very connected sea. Some examples of this already in motion can be found with APIMATIC and Runscope. Both of these providers fluently speak multiple existing API definition formats, but they also have their own, custom format for describing what their service(s) brings to the table. I'd say the one difference is that Runscope is more focused on their own format, emphasizing the import / export in the Runscope version, while APIMATIC is holding their version behind the scenes and emphasizing the use the existing API definition format of their own. I think it is important that service providers flex both their own spec, as well as supporting existing formats like these providers do, even if it is just by using the API Transformer service. However, there is also an opportunity at the intersection of these two worlds with the x- extension for OpenAPI Spec....[<a href="/2016/02/16/as-an-api-service-provider-should-i-craft-my-own-api-definition-format-or-just-reuse-what-is-already-available/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I'm spending some time going through v2 docs for the Zapier API, following the release of multi steps work flows, and code steps for calculating, converting, and manipulating data and content, last week. While IFTTT gets a significant amount of the attention of the API reciprocity platforms I track on, I feel like Zapier is the most successful, and reflects most of what I'd lie to see in an API driven integration, and automation platform--specifically, the fact they have an API. Along with keeping track of what Zapier is up to, I'm spending more time thinking about the increasing number of API driven bot platforms I'm seeing emerge, and API enabled voice platforms like Alexa Voice Service. As I was reading Zapier's platform documentation, I couldn't help but see what I'd consider to be the essential building blocks for any integration, automation, and reciprocity platform emerge: Authentication - Providing the mechanisms for the most common approaches to API authentication, including basic auth, digest auth, session based, oAuth. Triggers - Provide the framework to use verbs and nouns, with help text, and webhook infrastructure to trigger anything users will desire. Actions - Provide the framework to use verbs and nouns, with help text, and webhook infrastructure to accomplish an action users will desire. Searches -Allowing for simple questions to be asked, and provide a framework to allow APIs to e employed in answering any question asked. Webhooks - Putting the automation in API integration, allowing for webhooks that can be triggered, and used as part of actions. Notification - Using notifications throughout the process to keep the platform, developers, and end-users informed about anything that is relevant. Scripting - Allowing for code integration for calculating, converting, and manipulating data as part of any step of the process. Multi-step - Going beyond just just triggers and actions, and allowing for multi-step workflows that put multiple APIs to use.

			<p><em>15 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I just finished looking through the documentation for the Zapier API, and for the Alex Voice Service, trying to understand the approach these platforms are taking to incorporate API driven resources into their services. How do you translate a single API call into a Zapier trigger or action? How do you build a rich index of resources for Alexa to search via voice commands? Learning how APIs are being consumed, or can be consume, is an infinitely fascinating journey for me, and something I enjoy researching.&nbsp;
All of my research into reciprocity, bots, and voice enablement via APIs, makes me think more about experience based API design, trumping much of the resource based dogma that has domnated much of the conversation. How will my APIs enable meaningful interoperability via Zapier, voice searches via Alexa, and stimulate interesting bot interactions? I am not just focusing on how my resources are defined, I am now also forced to think about how they will be searched, consumed, and put to use in these new client experiences.&nbsp;
Just like mobile significantly shaped how we craft our APis, automation, voice, bots, and increasingly Internet connected devices will continue to define our API strategies. Users, and developers will increasingly small, meaningful resources that they can use to orchestrate their personal and business lives, that will respond to simple voice commands at home, in the car, and via our mobile devices. When we are designing our APIs, are we thinking about these bite-size resources that will be needed in this emerging bot and voice driven evolution in the API space.

			<p>I shared a list of just the essential building blocks from across only 21 areas of my API areas of the API life cycle with a company I'm helping craft an API strategy for, and I got some very common feedback--all this information is great, but where do I start with my API strategy? This is excellent feedback, as that particular overview is void of any specific 101, or on-boarding elements for each of the areas of the API life cycle that I cover.&nbsp; This is on purpose for this particular document, providing me with a generic outline that I can use in many different scenarios, but the feedback rings loud in my ears, and is something I get constantly. I receive a constant barrage of emails, tweets, and voice mails asking me where they should get started with their API strategy, spanning both the provider, and consumer side of the API coin.&nbsp; The problem for me in all of this is that what "API" means, where someone is at in their journey, and what their overall goals are, can be radically different depending on who you talk to. What API design means to you, may not be what it means to the next. What API deployment might be about gateway solutions in your organizations, for others it means cloud based, or possibly specifically with a Java API framework like Restlet. My goal in my research is to to map out each area, distill down the common building blocks, then yes, build as many introductions (101), and on-boarding doorways as I can, targeting both API provider and consumers, across a wide variety of business sectors, and the public sphere. To help illustrate my point, I get regular requests from folks around how do they pull all the data on Twitter via the API, and how do publish a video to all the leading video platforms via APIs. In the same day I will get requests...[<a href="/2016/02/15/all-this-information-is-great-but-where-do-i-start-with-my-api-strategy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>A couple of weeks ago I started playing with a machine readable way to describe the pricing, and plans available for an API. I spent a couple of days looking through over 50 APIs, and how they handled the pricing, and their API access plans, and gathered the details in a master list, which I am using for my master definition. I picked up this work, and moved it forward over the last two days, further solidifying the schema, as well as launching an API, and set of admin tools for me to use. While my primary objective is to help me establish a machine readable definition that I can use to describe the plans of the APIs I provide, as well as the ones that I monitor as part of my regular work in the space--I needed an easier way to help me track the details of each API's plan. So I got to work creating an simple, yet robust admin tool that allows me to add one or many plans, for each API that I track on.&nbsp; To help me drive this administrative interface I needed an API (of course), that would allow me to add, edit, and delete the details for each plan, using my API plan schema as a guide. I got to work designing, developing, and launched the first beta version of my API plans API, to help me gather, and organize the details for any API I want, whether its mine, or one of the many public APIs I track on. Now that I have an API, and an administrative interface, I'm going to get to work adding the data I gathered from my previous research. I have almost 60 APIs to enter, then I hope to be able to step back, and see the API plan data Ive gathered in a new light. Once I get to this stage, I'm looking to craft a simple embeddable page for...[<a href="/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>Evaluating exactly what is the "right" API can be very difficult. This is what I do full time, and its hard for me to understand the differences--I cannot image what it is like for people who have real jobs. I've used both the Crunchbase API, and the AngelList API for some time now, to help me better profile the companies that I am paying attention to as part of my research. I use both the website, and API for both of these business data platforms on a regular basis.&nbsp; As I read about the recent investment in Crunchbase, and their changes in pricing, I'm reminded of my half finished work, incorporating the OpenCorporates API, and taking another look at all of my business data sources. I won't be able to afford Crunchbase after the changes, which will suck, but honestly I'm not a big fan of their overall operations, and approach, and happy to see the data source leave the stack of APis that I depend on.&nbsp; This leaves me assessing what is next, as any major API plan changes will do to consumers. In addition to needing the data behind each company I monitor in the API space, I need a public page to reference across my storytelling. It is unfortunate that I've used Crunchbase for this historically. In an effort to keep my readers informed, I've also been supporting the very closed (and increasingly so) platform. When I pick up my business API integration work, I will switch off Crunchbase, keep my AngelList feed, and turn on OpenCorporates, but I will also start using the public OpenCorporates page as the URL reference I use in my storytelling.&nbsp; For me, it is important to find the resources I need to run my business, but it is also important to support services that have healthy practices. I have an overall objective to have relevant business data on companies I monitor, something Crunchbase and AngelList has...[<a href="/2016/02/12/considering-the-obvious-and-subtle-differences-between-similar-api-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>
One reason for having a well thought out, comprehensive API strategy, is that you are thinking about all the moving parts, and at ever turn you can weave things together, and potentially amplify the forward motion of your API operations. With every new release you should be considering all other areas of your API strategy, how you can include your API consumers, your partners, and where all of the opportunities lie when it comes to evangelism, and storytelling.
This approach was present in the latest release from Postman, with the release of their Run in Postman, embeddable button. As part of the release of the new embeddable button for their API client tooling, Postman also made a call for partners. It was a savvy marketing technique to reach out to partners like this, something that will not just generate implementations in the wild, but will also establish new partnerships, strengthen existing ones, while also generating new blog posts, and press releases around API platform operations.
When it comes to the API Evangelist operations, the approach by Postman is gold--when I consider across many areas of my own strategy. Postman is showcased as part of my API client research, their product release exists within my embeddable API research, and also lives within my API evangelism and API partners research. The moral of this story is Postman thought across their strategy when crafting the release strategy for their new feature, and I also put in similiar thoughts across my own strategy while reading their blog post, giving us both an opportunity for establishing biggest bang possible, around a single API platform release.

			<p><em>10 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was in Philadelphia last week, hanging out with educational technology practitioners, and at one of the dinners I found myself talking to a young lady who was a digital learning assistant at a university. She spent her days, helping administrators, and faculty, when it came to understanding what digital resources and tooling were available, and assisting them to better understand how they can put them to use in their daily work.&nbsp; This conversation left me thinking about the role I play in the API space. I long ago elevated myself above evangelizing any single APIs, a position I enjoy because of my partners 3Scale, Cloud Element, Restlet, and WSO2. I elevated myself into this role because I saw nobody else doing it across the space, and saw an opportunity to make a wider impact, beyond just peddling a single product or service. My conversation in Philly made me realize how much general API assistant I am in my daily operations.&nbsp; The role of an API assistant, helping others understand that APIs exist, and how they can be applied in our everyday personal and business lives is an increasingly critical role in our society. How do you teach people they can pull corporate data from OpenCorporates, or Tweets from a specific #hashtag into a Google Spreadsheet? How do you help people understand that APIs make the everyday exhaust from your world organize-able", accessible, and more "orchestrate-able", via APIs--without knowing how to code! I've talked about my work as an API broker, where I help organize coherent stacks of APIs, for potential use in specific business verticals, and web, mobile, or even device based applications. I'm adding API assistance to this spectrum now, because an API broker addresses the professional business side of the API equation, but an API assistance addresses the individual side of the API equation. I hope this schism in my own existence as API evangelist, broker, and assistant, is also addressed at...[<a href="/2016/02/10/api-evangelist-assistant-and-broker/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I look at a lot of APIs, and one characteristic I judge them by, is their ability to simply explain what their API does. The most import aspect to any individual or company when doing APIs, is the process can potentially bring you out of your bubble, and make you think a little bit more externally.&nbsp;
One of the most common things I see from API providers, is they think it terms of, and present their API in the context of the language they program in. It is a ".NET Web API", or a Python API. When in reality it is a web API, and if it employs enough HTTP, it should be able to be consumed in any language.
Another regular mistake made by API providers, is they describe their API in terms of their own platform, and never actually tell you what it does. Here is an example of this from PushBullet:
Pushbullet's API enables developers to build on the Pushbullet infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a full API that enables anything to tap into the Pushbullet network.
While I appreciate the short description of what the API does, I'm left still not knowing what it does. You see, I do not know about Pushbullet like you do, and chances are neither will many of your other potential API consumers. Knowing about your company shouldn't get in the way of me learning about what your API does.
To me, this is classic walled silo-itis, where programmers are operating within their little company or tech silo, and don't look much further. That is ok, this is why we do APis, to help break you free of these cycles.&nbsp;

			<p><em>07 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am continuing to push forward my API plans research, where I look closely at the common building blocks of the service composition, pricing, and plans available for some of the leading API providers out there. I have no less than ten separate stories derived from Algolia, the search API provider's, pricing page--I will be using Algolia as a reference for how to plan your API, along with elder API pioneers like Amazon, and Twilio, for some time now. On area of Algolia's approach I think is worth noting, is the enterprise level of their operations. They provide the most detail regarding what you get as part of the enterprise tier, being very public about their operations, in a way you just do not see with many API providers. When it comes down to it, the Algolia enterprise search plans are all about no limitations--I think their description says it well: Your own dedicated infrastructure. Don't like limits? Meet our dedicated clusters. Optimal for high volumes of data, they scale to thousands of queries per second. Search performance and indexing times have never been so good. The basic building blocks of how Algolia is monetizing their search API, records and operation API calls, melt away at the enterprise level. The lower four plans for Algolia API access meter the number of record, and operation API calls you make, and charge consumers, using four separate pricing levels. If you are an enterprise customer, the need for this metering melts away, eliminating the default limitations applied to lower levels of API consumption. I support more transparency in enterprise API plans, as well as other partner tiers of access. I do not think Algolia's approach to delivering enterprise services is unique, but their straightforward, simple, and transparent approach to doing it is. In an API driven world, the enterprise levels of access do not always have to be that age old mating dance, that involves smoke and mirrors,...[<a href="/2016/02/07/it-is-all-about-no-limitations-with-the-enterprise-api-plans/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>
The popular API client tool Postman just launched an embeddable "run in Postman" button, that you can use to fast track integration with your API(s). Shortly after I wrote a post about the importance of API definition driven embeddable tools for API service providers, Postman contacted me and said, "hey! we are already working on that!" ;-)
With the latest update, when you use your Postman Client, you can generate some embeddable JavaScript, which you can then post alongside your API documentation, throughout your developer portal, or possibly anywhere on the open web. Something that could trim minutes, or even hours off the time it takes for new developers to go from discovery to integration.
Embeddable tooling for APIs is nothing new, something we've seen leading providers like Twitter and Facebook employ successfully, but it is something that is fairly new for API service providers. Having a robust embeddable strategy like this one from Postman, and last week's example from SDK provider APIMATIC, is something all API service providers should be considering in 2016.

			<p><em>05 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>One of the approaches to API plans I was studying recently is from the data provider Factual, who provides access to places, products, and other valuable data-sets. I felt Factual had a pretty straightforward approach to the free tier of access for their platform, that was worthy of sharing. When you visit the page for the Factual data services, they offer two distinct levels of free access to data resources: Free (unverified) -&nbsp;Up to 100 read requests per day. No access to resolve or write APIs. Free (verified) -&nbsp;Up to 10,000 requests per day for most tables. When I look at the plans for many APIs, they almost always have free tiers of access, but normally there is just one dimension to it. You get a certain amount of API calls per second, day, or month, for free. What is unique about the approach from Factual is they offer another free level, which gives you more API calls if you verify yourself--this is a pretty interesting approach, that other providers should consider. You want free access, but don't want to verify yourself, and you get 100 red requests per day, but if you go through the verification process, you get 10,000 requests per day--a pretty significant difference. I am talking with a number of providers lately about how they are tightening up the free tiers of API access, and working to incentivize users to become paying customers, which made me take another look at Factual's approach. I think free access to APIs is essential to operations, but I think providers need to be more thoughtful about just how much of their resources they give away at this tier. It is OK if you want to get to know your consumers, before you give away too much of the farm. There can be a lot of bad behavior from API consumers at the free tier level, and developer verification is one way you can minimize the...[<a href="/2016/02/05/different-api-rate-limits-for-verified-and-unverified-free-tiers-of-access/">Read More</a>]</p>
