        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.uber.com/products/drivers"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_21_at_10.42.50_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was taking a look at the new <a href="https://developer.uber.com/products/drivers">Uber Driver API</a> and trying to understand the possibilities with the API, and some of the the motivations behind Uber's launch of the API. According to Uber, <em>"o</em><span><em>ur Driver API lets you build services and solutions that make the driver experience more productive and rewarding. With the driver's permission, you can use trip data, earnings, ratings and more to shape the future of the on-demand economy."</em> Providing an interesting opportunity for partners to step up and help build useful apps that Uber drivers can leverage in their worlds, helping them be more successful in their work.</span></p>
<p><span>The first dimension of the Uber Driver API I find interesting is that it is not an API that is about their core business--ridesharing. It is focused on making their drivers more successful, and developing tools, and integrations that make their lives easier. I could see something like this evolving to other platforms like AirBnB, and other sharing or gig economy platforms, helping operators make sense of their worlds, while also strengthening partnerships and hopefully their relationship with operators along the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The second dimension I find interesting is thinking about why Uber is publishing their Driver API. At first glance it is all about making their drivers happy--something Uber needs a lot of help with currently. However, once you think a little more about it, you can start to see a bigger picture that Uber is looking to paint of their drivers. The company's leverage over drivers has proven to only go so far, and they need to understand more about the lives of their drivers, and if they can invite corporate partners to do their taxes, and potentially other key tasks in their lives, a greater picture of their&nbsp;life will come into focus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If an Uber driver is also a Lyft driver, the Uber Driver API gives them more of a look into their competitor's accounting. They also get a better understanding of what else their drivers have going on, and other ways they can increase their leverage over them. It's fascinating to think about. Right now, all the examples Uber providers are tax related, but I'm sure other types of partners will emerge--it is why you do APIs. Open up an API, and people will line up innovate for you, helping you understand the dimensions of your driver's life. It is a fascinating look at why you would do APIs, and how there is almost always more than one dimension to why a company will deploy&nbsp;an API.</span></p>
<p><span>I am sure there are other reasons I am not considering here. Maybe now that I've planted the seed in my brain, I'll come up with some other incentives for why Uber operates their APIs as they do--it is fascinating stuff to unpack.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2017/introducing-the-periscope-producer-api"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/periscope_twitter.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It is common for API providers to be really private with their APIs, and we often hear about providers restricting access as time goes by. So, when API providers loosen up restrictions on their APIs, inviting wider use by developers, making them public--I think it is worth taking notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent example of this in the wild is from the API poster child Twitter, with their <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/">Periscope video service</a>. <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2017/introducing-the-periscope-producer-api">Twitter has announced that they are slowly opening up access to the Periscope video API</a>, something that has been only available to a handful of trusted partners, and via the mobile application--there was no way to upload a video without using your mobile device. Twitter is still "l<span>imiting access to fewer strategic partners for a period", but at least you can apply to see if your interests overlap with Twitters interests. It also sounds like Twitter will continue to widen access as time goes on, and as it makes sense to their Periscope strategy.</span></p>
<p>While I wished we lived in a world where API developers were all well behaved, and API providers could open up services to the public from day one, this isn't the reality we find on the web today. Twitter's cautious approach to rolling out the Periscope API should provide other API providers with an example of how you can do this sensibly, only letting in the API consumers that are in alignment with your goals. Slowly opening up, making sure the service is stable, and meets the needs of consumers, partners, as well as helps meet a platform's business objectives.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Twitter's approach to launching the Periscope API provides us with a positive example of how you can become more public APIs, instead of always locking things down. There is no single way to launch your APIs, but I'd say that Twitter's cautious approach is probably a good idea when you operate in such a competitive space, or when you don't have a lot of experience operating a fully public API--start with a handful of trusted partners, and open things up to a slightly wider group as you feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Thanks, Twitter for providing me with a positive example I can showcase--it is good to see that after a decade you can still launch new APIs, and understand the value of them to your core business--even amidst the often intense and volatile environment that is the Twitter platform.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_definitions_webconcepts_screenshot.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the&nbsp;<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide&nbsp;is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Keeping up with the standards bodies like International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&nbsp; can be a full-time job. Thankfully,&nbsp; Erik Wilde (<a href="https://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>) has help simply and made the concepts and specifications that make the web work more accessible and easier to understand, with his <a href="http://webconcepts.info">WebConcepts.info</a> project.</p>
<p class="p1">According to Erik, &ldquo;the Web&rsquo;s Uniform Interface is based on a large and growing set of specifications. These specifications establish the shared concepts that providers and consumers of Web services can rely on. Web Concepts is providing an overview of these concepts and of the specifications defining them.&rdquo; His work is a natural fit for what I am trying to accomplish with my API definition industry guide, as well as supporting other areas of my research.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the areas that slows API adoption is a lack of awareness of the concepts and specifications that make the web work among developers who are providing and consuming APIs. The modern API leverages the same technology that drives the web--this is why it is working so well. The web is delivering HTML for humans, and APIs are using the same to deliver machine-readable data, content, and access to algorithms online. If a developer is not familiar with the fundamental building blocks of the web, the APIs they provide, and the applications they build on top of APIs will always be deficient.</p>
<p class="p1">This project provides an overview of 28 web concepts with 643 distinct implementations&nbsp; aggregated across five separate organizations including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Java Community Process (JCP), Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)--who all contribute to what we know as the web.&nbsp; An awareness and literacy around the 28 concepts aggregated by Web Concepts is essential for any API developer and architect looking to fully leverage the power of the web as part of their API work.</p>
<p class="p1">After aggregating the 28 web concepts from the five standards organization, Web Concepts additionally aggregates 218 actual specifications that API developers, architects, and consumers should be considering when putting APIs to work. Some of these specifications are included as part of this API Definition guide, and I will be working to add additional specifications in future editions of this guide, as it makes sense. The goal of this guide is to help bring awareness, literacy, and proficiency with common API and data patterns, making use of the work Web Concepts project, and building on the web literacy work already delivered by Erik, just makes sense.</p>
<p class="p1">Web Concepts is published as a Github repository, leveraging Github Pages for the website. He has worked hard to make the concepts and specification available as JSON feeds, providing a machine-readable feed that can be integrated into existing API design, deployment, and management applications--providing web literacy concepts and specifications throughout the API life cycle.&nbsp; All JSON data is generated from the source data, which is managed as a set of XML descriptions of specifications, with the build process based upon XSLT and Jekyll, providing multiple ways to approach all concepts and specifications, while maintaining the relationship and structure of all the moving parts that make up the web.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to the startup space, the concepts that make up the web, and the specifications that make it all work, might seem a little boring, something only the older engineers pay attention to.&nbsp; Web Concepts helps soften, and make these critical concepts and specifications accessible and digestible for a new generation of web and API developers--think of them as gummy versions of vitamins. If we are going to standardize how APIs are designed, deployed, and managed--making all of this much more usable, scalable, and interoperable, we are going to have to all get on the same page (aka the web).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://webconcepts.info/">Web Concepts</a> is an open source project, and Erik encourages feedback on the concepts&nbsp;and specifications. I encourage you to spend time on the site regularly&nbsp;and see where you can integrate the JSON feeds into your systems, services, and tooling. We have a lot of work ahead of us to make sure the next generation of programmers have the base amount of web literacy necessary to keep the web strong and healthy. There are two main ways to contribute to the building blocks of the web: participate as a contributor to the standards body, or you can make sure you are implementing common concepts and specifications throughout your work, contributing to the web, and not just walled gardens and closed platforms.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>I was studying examples of how I can validate the data returned from <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">a human services APIs demo</a>, and develop a set of API tests, as well as API service providers who can implement the tests, for cities to consider as part of their API deployments that are serving up locations and organizations where you can find critical services. I'm looking for examples of the common things like API availability and response time, but I'm also looking to get very granular and specialized to organizational, location, and service APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/runscope_data_validation.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/">The image I borrowed from RunScope helps visualize what I'm talking about, showing us how we can keep an eye on the basics, but also getting really granular when specifying what we expect from of our APIs</a>. I have a pretty good imagination when it comes to thinking of scenarios I want to test for, but I'm also looking for any API providers who might be already sharing their tests&nbsp;and being more transparent when it comes to their API monitoring and testing practices. If you know of any API&nbsp;providers that would be willing to share the lists of what types of things they test for, I'd love to hear more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking a regular blog series on different examples of how people are testing APIs from a diverse range of business sectors might help stimulate people's imagination when it comes to API testing concepts. I'm thinking it is another area that we could all learn a lot from each other&nbsp;if there was just a little bit of sharing. I'd love it if the examples were machine readable and reusable in any API testing service, but I would settle for just a blog post, or sharing of a bulleted list of API tests via email, or another channel. ;-)</p>

<p>Building on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/09/api-management-is-getting-more-modular-and-composable/">earlier stories about how my API partners are making API deployment more modular and composable</a>, and pushing forward my understanding of what is possible with API deployment, I'm looking into the details of what <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">DreamFactory</a> enables when it comes to API deployment. "<span>DreamFactory is a free, Apache 2 open source project that runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. DreamFactory is scalable, stateless, and portable" -- making it pretty good candidate for running it wherever you need.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/16/the-ability-to-deploy-apis-in-aws-google-or-microsoft-clouds/">After spending time at Google and hearing about how they want to enable multi-cloud infrastructure deployment</a>, I wanted to see how my API service provider partners are able to actually power these visions of running your APIs anywhere, in any infrastructure. <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/features">Using DreamFactory you can deploy your APIs using Docker, Kubernetes, or directly from a Github repository</a>, something I'm exploring as standard operating procedure for government agencies, like we see with <a href="https://github.com/18F/fs-middlelayer-api">18F's&nbsp;US Forest Service ePermit Middlelayer API</a>--in my opinion, all federal, state, and local government should be able to deploy API infrastructure like this.</p>
<p>One of the projects I am working on this week is creating a base blueprint of what it will take to deploy a <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">human services API</a> for any city in Google or Azure. I have a demo working on AWS already, but I need a basic understanding of what it will take to do the same in any cloud environment. I'm not in the business of hosting and operating APIs for anyone, let alone for government agencies--this is why I have partners like DreamFactory, who I can route specific projects as they come in. Obviously, I am looking to support my partners, as they support me, but I'm also looking to help other companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies better leverage the cloud providers they are already using.</p>
<p>I'll share more stories about how I'm deploying APIs to AWS, as well as Google and Azure, as I do the work over the next couple of weeks. I'm looking to develop a healthy toolbox of solutions for government agencies to use. This weeks project is focused on the human services data specification, but next week I'm going to look replicating the model to allow for other <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org vocabulary</a>, providing simple blueprints for deploying other common APIs like products, directories, link listings, and directories. My goal is to provide a robust toolbox of APIs that anyone can launch in AWS, Google, and Azure, with a push of a button--eventually.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the&nbsp;<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide<span>&nbsp;is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">The OpenAPI Specification</a>, formerly known as Swagger is approaching an important milestone, version 3.0 of the specification, but it is also the first major release since the specification was entered into the Linux Foundation. Swagger was the creation of Tony Tam of Wordnik back in 2010, but after the project was acquired by SmartBear in 2015, the company donated the specification to the newly formed OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) which is part of the Linux Foundation. Swagger has now been reborn as the OpenAPI Specification, and in early 2017 is approaching its first major release under the guidance of a diverse group of governing members.</p>
<p class="p1">Version 3.0 of the API specification format has taken a much more modular, and reusable approach to defining the surface area of an API, enabling more power and versatility when it comes to describing the request and response models, as well as providing details on the common components that make up API usage like the underlying data schema and security definitions. There are numerous changes to the API specification, but there are just a handful that will have a significant impact across every stop along the API life cycle where API definitions are making an impact.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Hosts</strong></p>
<p class="p1">When describing your API, you can now provide multiple hosts, allowing you to better deal with the complexity of how APIs might be located in a single location, or spread across multiple cloud location, and global infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Content Negotiation</strong></p>
<p class="p1">You can now provide content objects to define the relationship between response objects, media types, and schema, opening up the negotiation of exactly the type of content needed, encouraging the design of multiple rich dimensions for any single API resource.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Body</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The latest version of the specification plays catch-up when it comes to allowing the body of a request and response to be defined separately from the request parameters, allowing for more control over the payload of any API calls.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Schema</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There is an increased investment in JSON Schema, including the support of `oneOf`, `anyOf` and `not` functions, allowing for alternative schema, as well as the standard JSON schema definition included.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Components</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The new components architecture really reflects APIs, making everything very modular, reusable, and much more coherent and functional. The new version encourages good schema and component reuse,&nbsp; helping further bringing the definition into focus.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Linking</strong></p>
<p class="p1">While not quite full hypermedia, version 3.0 of the OpenAPI Spec supports linking, allowing for the description of relationships between paths, giving a nod towards hypermedia design pattern, making this version the most resilient so far.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Webhooks</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Like the nod towards hypermedia, the specification now allows for the inclusion of callbacks that can be attached to a subscription operation describing an outbound operation--providing much needed webhook descriptions as part of API operations, making it much more real time and event driven.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The new version enables API architects to better describe, and provide examples of APIs responses and requests, helping make API integration a learning experience, by providing examples for use beyond just documentation descriptions.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Responding to a large number of API providers, and the reality on the ground for many implementations, the new version allows for the definition of cookies as part of API requests.</p>
<p class="p1">These nine areas represent the most significant changes to the OpenAPI Spec 3.0. The most notable shift is the componentized, modular, reusable aspect of the specification. After that, it is the content negotiation, linking, web hooks, and other changes that are moving the needle. It is clear that the 3.0 version of the specification has considered the design patterns across a large number of implementations, providing a pretty wide-reaching specification for defining what an API does, in a world where every API can be a special snowflake.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2017, the OpenAPI Spec is the clear leader of the API definition formats, with the largest adoption, as well as the amount of tooling developed. While documentation and SDK generation are still the top two reasons for crafting API definitions, there are numerous other reasons for using API definitions including mocking, testing, monitoring, IDE integration, and much, much more. In 2017, the OpenAPI Spec is the clear leader of the API definitions format. It has the highest usage rate, as well as the largest number of tooling (or tools?) available.</p>

<p>I'm keeping an eye on the different approaches to deploying infrastructure coming out of AWS, Google, Microsoft and other providers. In my version of the near future, we should be able to deploy any API we want, in any infrastructure we want with a single push of a button. We are getting there, as&nbsp;<a href="https://t.co/IzZs6W0wAr">I'm seeing more publish to Heroku buttons</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">AWS and Azure deployment packages</a>, and I recently came across the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/launcher/">Google Cloud Launcher</a>, which I think will work well for deploying a variety of API driven solutions--we just need more selection&nbsp;and a button!</p>
<p>All the parts and pieces for this type of push button API deployment exist already, we just need someone to step up and provide a dead simple framework for defining and embedding the buttons, abstracting away the complexities of each cloud platform. I want to be able to take a single manifest for my open source or wholesale API on Github, and allow anyone to deploy it into Heroku, AWS, Google, Azure, or anywhere else they want. I want the technical, business, and legal complexities of deployment abstracted away for me, the API provider.</p>
<p>API management has matured a lot over the last 10 years, and API design and definitions are currently flourishing. We need a lot more investment in helping people easily deploy APIs, wherever they need. I think this layer of interoperability is the responsibility of the emerging API service providers like <a href="http://apis.how/5ytnitnakm">Restlet</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">DreamFactory</a>, or maybe even <a href="http://apis.how/kjtj5bbuxu">APIMATIC</a>. I will keep tracking on what I'm seeing evolve out of the leading cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and now Google with their Cloud Launcher. I will also keep pushing on my API service provider partners in the space to enable API deployment like this--I am guessing they will just need a little nudging to see the opportunity around providing API deployment in this seamless, cloud-agnostic way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://konpa.github.io/devicon/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/devicons_screenshot.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://google.stack.network/">I am working on profiling 75 of the Google APIs</a>, and one thing I struggle with at this scale is standardizing the images I use, or more specifically, icons that represent each service as well as the value they deliver under the hood--something Google seriously needs to get more organized in by the way. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/25/moving-towards-a-meaningful-set-of-icons-for-the-api-community/">I have written before about having a set of icons for the API sector</a>, for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/21/a-new-api-programming-language-sdk-icon-set/">SDK related icons</a>, and also <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/21/icons-to-describe-each-of-your-api-resources-like-aws/">about how Amazon is getting more organized when it comes to icons for the AWS platform</a>, as I beat this drum about the need for common imagery.</p>
<p>While I am glad that Amazon is started to think about iconography when it comes to working with APIs at scale, a lead that Google and Microsoft should follow, I'm hoping that API icons are something that someone will tackle at the same level as say a <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>. I would like to see API provider (company) level icons, <a href="http://konpa.github.io/devicon/">building on the work of Devicon</a>, but I'd also like to see individual icons developed for common resources that are made available via APIs--like compute, storage, images, video, etc.</p>
<p>What Amazon is doing provides the best model we have so far, but I want to make sure icons are not vendor specific. I would like to see a universal icon to represent a compute API for instance, whether it was Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. Think about IFTTT or Zapier, but something that would universally represent the valuable bits and bytes we are putting to use via individual platforms, but are increasingly also moving around between platforms--I want a common visual iconography we can use to communicate about what is being done with APIs.</p>
<p>There is a ton of work involved with establishing a project of this scale. Ideally, it is something that would also involve API providers, and not just be an external thing. I'd also like to see each icon be more than just a visual icon, I'd like there to be semantics and vocabulary attached to each image. Imagine if we had a common set of icons describe machine learning APIs, that helped us quickly understand what they do, but would also help us more consistently articulate the reality of what they do, and do not do (ie. Facial Recognition, Sentiment Anlysis, etc.).</p>
<p>I am going to keep talking about this until someone either does it&nbsp;or gives me the money to pay someone to do it. Sadly, I feel like it will end up being like the rest of common API definitions and tooling, we'll see each provider do it on their own, where all meaning and vocabulary becomes platform-driven, and not about actually finding a common language to communicate about what is possible with APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_definitions_human_services_screenshot.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide<span style="font-size: 9px;">&nbsp;is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1">A lot of attention is given to APIs and the world of startups, but in 2017 this landscape is quickly shifting beyond just the heart of the tech space, with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies of all shapes and sizes are putting APIs to work. API definitions are being applied to the fundamental building blocks of the tech sector, quantifying the computational, storage, images, videos, and other essential resources powering web, mobile, and device based applications. This success is now spreading to other sectors, defining other vital resources that are making a real impact in our communities.</p>
<p class="p1">One API making an impact in communities is the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), also known as the Open Referral Ohana API. The project began as a Code for America project, providing an API, website, and administrative system for managing the organizations, locations, and the human services that communities depend on. Open Referral, the governing organization for HSDS, and the Ohana API is working with API Evangelist and other partners to define the next generation of the human services data specification, API definition, as well as the next generation of API, website, admin, and developer portal implementations.</p>
<p class="p1">The HSDS Specification API isn&rsquo;t about any single API, it is a suite of API-first definitions, schema, and open tooling that cities, counties, states&nbsp;and federal government agencies can download or fork, and employ to help manage vital human services for their communities. Providing not just a website for finding vital services, but a complete API ecosystem that can be deployed incentivizing developers to build important web, mobile, and other applications on top of a central human services system. Better delivering on the mission of human services organizations, and meeting the demands of their constituents.</p>
<p class="p1">This approach to delivering APIs centers around a common data schema, extending it as an OpenAPI Spec definition, describing how that data is accessed&nbsp;and put to use across a variety of applications, including a central website and administrative system. While server-side HSDS API implementations, website, mobile, administrative, developer portal, and other implementations are important, the key to the success of this model is a central OpenAPI definition of the HSDS API. This definition connects all the implementations within an API&rsquo;s ecosystem, but it also provides the groundwork for a future where all human services implementations are open and interoperable with other implementations--establishing a federated network of services meeting the needs of the communities they serve.</p>
<p class="p1">Right now each city is managing one or multiple human service implementations. Even though some of these implementations operate in overlapping communities, few of them are providing 3rd party access, let alone providing integration between overlapping geographic regions. The HSDS API approach employs an API-first approach, focusing on the availability and access of the HSDS schema, then adding on a website, administrative and API developer portals to support. This model opens up human services to humans via the website, which is integrated with the central API, but then also opens up the human services for inclusion into other websites, mobile and device applications, as well as integration with other systems.</p>
<p class="p1">The HSDS OpenAPI spec and schema provide a reusable blueprint that can be used to standardize how we provide human services. The open source approach to delivering definitions, schema, and code reduces the cost of deployment and operation for cash-strapped public organizations and agencies. The API-first approach to delivering human services also opens up resources for inclusion in our applications and system, potentially outsourcing the heavy lifting to trusted partners, and 3rd party developers interested in helping augment and extend the mission of human service organizations and groups.</p>
<p class="p1">If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the HSDS API you can visit <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a>. From there you can get involved in the discussion, and find existing open source definitions, schema, and code for putting HSDS to work. If you&rsquo;d like to contribute to the project, there are numerous opportunities to join the discussion about next generation of the schema and OpenAPI Spec, as well as develop server-side&nbsp;and client-side implementations.</p>

<p>It is easy for me to get excited about a new API. I'm an engineer. I'm a dude. I am the API Evangelist. It easy to think about the potential for good when it comes to APIs. It is much harder to suspend the logical side of my brain&nbsp;and think about the ways in which APIs can be used in negative ways. As a technologist it is natural for me to focus in on the technology, and tune out the rest of the world--it is what we do. It takes a significant amount of extra effort to stop, suspend the portion of your brain that technology whispers to, and think about the unintended consequences, and the pros and cons of why we are doing APIs.</p>
<p>Technologists aren't very good at slowing down and thinking about the pros/cons of connecting something to the Internet, let alone whether or not an API should even exist in the first place (it has to exist!). <a href="http://www.securityweek.com/network-layer-ddos-attacks-hit-record-levels-imperva">As I read a story about the increases in DDOS attacks on the network layer of our online world</a>, I can't help but think that with each new API we deploy, that we are significantly increasing the attack surface area for our businesses, organizations, institutions, and government agencies. It feels like we are good at thinking about the amazing API potential, but we really suck at seeing what a target we are putting on our back when we do APIs.</p>
<p>We seem to be marching forward, drunk on the potential of APIs&nbsp;and Internet-connected everything. We aren't properly securing the technology we have, something we can see playing out with each wave of vulnerabilities, breaches, and leaks. We are blindly pushing forward with new API implementations, and using the same tactics we are using for our web and mobile technology, something we are seeing play out with the Internet of Things, and the vulnerable cameras, printers, and another object we are connecting to the Internet using APIs.</p>
<p>With each API we add, we are increasing the attack surface area for our systems and devices. APIs can be secured, but from what I'm seeing we aren't investing in security with our existing APIs, something that is being replicated with each wave of deployments. We need to get better at thinking about the negative consequences of doing APIs. We need to stop making ourselves targets. We need to get better at thinking about whether or not an API should exist or not. We need a way to better visualize the target surface area we've crafted for ourselves using APIs, and be a little more honest with ourselves about why we are doing this.</p>

<p>This is my regular public service reminder of why I do API Evangelist. I do not evangelize APIs because I think everybody should be doing them, that they are the solution to all of our problems, or because I have an API I want you to buy (I have other things for you to buy). I do API Evangelist because I want to better understand how platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Uber, and others are operating&nbsp;and impacting our personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>I do believe in APIs as an important tool in our professional toolboxes, but Silicon Valley, our government(s), and many other bad actors have shown me that APIs will more often be used for shady things, rather than the positive API vision I have in my head. I still encourage companies, organizations, institutions,&nbsp;and agencies to do APIs, but I spend equal amount of time ensuring people are doing APIs in a more open and equitable way&nbsp;while still encouraging folks to also embark on their API journeys--taking more control over how we store, share, and put our bits and bytes to work each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs are playing a role in almost every news story we read today, from fake news and elections to cyber security,&nbsp;healthcare with the FHIR API standard, or banking with PSDS, to automobiles and transportation with Tesla and Uber. I can keep going all day long, talking about the ways APIs are influencing and delivering vital aspects of our personal and professional lives. In ALL of these situation's it's not the API that is important, it is the access, availability, and observability of the technology that is impacting the lives of humans--APIs are just the digital connector where our mobile phones and other devices are being connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>I like to regularly remind myself why the fuck I'm doing API Evangelist, so I don't burn out like I have before and end up roaming the streets foaming at the mouth again. I also do it to remind people of why I do API Evangelist, so they don't just think I'm a cheerleader for technology (rah rah rah, gooo&nbsp;APIs). My mission isn't just about APIs, it's ensuring APIs are in place and allow us to better understand the inputs and outputs of the technology invading all aspects of our lives. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/25/thinking-about-an-api-observability-stack/">Without the observability into the backend systems and algorithms</a> that are driving out personal and professional lives, we are screwed--which is why I do API Evangelist, to help ensure there is observability into how technology is impacting our world.</p>

<p>Most of the APIs I look at are special snowflakes. The definition&nbsp;and designs employed are usually custom-crafted without thinking other existing APIs, or standards that already in place. There are several contributing factors to why this is, ranging from the types of developers who are designing APIs, to incentive models put in place because of investment&nbsp;and intellectual property constraints. So, whenever I find an API that is employing an existing standard, I feel compelled to showcase&nbsp;and help plant the seeds in others minds that we should be speaking a common language instead of always being a special snowflake.</p>
<p>One of these APIs that I came across recently was the <a href="https://developers.google.com/spectrum/v1">Google Spectrum Database API</a> which has employed a standard&nbsp;<span>defined by the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-paws-protocol/">IETF Protocol to Access White Space (PAWS)</a><span>. &nbsp;I wouldn't say the API is the best-designed API, but it does follow a known standard, that is already in use by an industry, which in my experience can go further than having the best-designed API. The best product doesn't always win in this game, sometimes it is just about getting adoption with the widest possible audience.&nbsp;</span>I am guessing that the Google Spectrum Database API is targeting a different type of engineering audience than their more modern, machine learning and other APIs are, so following standards is probably more of a consideration.</p>
<p><span>I wish more APIs would share a little bit about the thoughts that went into the definition and design of their APIs, sharing their due diligence of existing APIs and standards, and other considerations that were included in the process of crafting an API. I'd like to see some leadership in this area, as well as some folks admitting that they didn't have the time, budget, expertise, or whatever the other reasons why you are a special snowflake. It is a conversation we should be having, otherwise, we may never fully understand why we aren't seeing the adoption we'd like to see with our APIs.</span></p>

<p>I keep an eye on over 70 areas of the API sector, trying to better understand how API providers are getting things done, and what services and tooling they are using, while also keeping my perspective as an API consumer--observing everything from the outside-in. The most important area of my research is <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">API definitions</a>--where I pay attention to the specifications, schema, scopes, and other building blocks of the API universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way my research works&nbsp;is that I keep an eye on the world of APIs through monitoring the social media, blogs, Github, and other channels of companies, organizations, institutions, and agencies doing interesting things with APIs. I curate information as I discover&nbsp;and learn across the API sector, then I craft stories for my blog(s). Eventually, all of this ends up being published <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/">to the main API Evangelist blog</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">the 70+ individual areas of my research from definition to deprecation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a couple years now I have also published a guide for the top areas of my research, including API <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">definitions</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>. These guides have always been a complete snapshot of my research, but in 2017 I am rebooting them to be a more curated, summary of each area of my research. My API definition guide is now ready for prime time after receiving some feedback from my community, so I wanted to share with you.</p>
<p>I am versioning and managing all of my API industry guides using the Github repositories in which I publish each of my research areas, so you can comment on the API definition guide, and <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">submit suggestions for future editions using the Github issues for the project.</a>&nbsp;My goal with this new edition of the API Evangelist API definition guide is to make it a community guide to the world of API definitions, schema, scopes. So please, let me know your thoughts--it is meant to be a community guide.</p>
<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">I am keeping my API definition guide available for free to the public.</a> You can also <a href="https://gum.co/Wlwnk">purchase a copy via Gumroad if you'd like to support my work</a>--I depend on your support to pay the bills. I will also funding this work through paid one page or two-page articles in future editions, as well as some sponsor blogs located on certain pages--<a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">let me know if you are interested in sponsoring</a>. Thanks as always for your support, I hope my API definitions guide helps you better understand this important layer of the API universe, something that is touching almost every aspect of the API and software development life cycle.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/20/google-support-buttons/">Google Support Buttons</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/15/the-relationship-between-dev-relations-and-support/">I talked about the gap between developer relations and support at Google</a>, something that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/15/the-relationship-between-dev-relations-and-support/">Sam Ramji (@sramji) has acknowledged is being worked on</a>. Support for a single API can be a lot of work&nbsp;and is something that is exponentially&nbsp;harder with each API and developer to add to your operations, and after <a href="http://google.stack.network/">looking through 75 of the Google APIs this weekend</a>, you see evidence that Google is working on it.</p>
<p>While there are many Google APIs that still have sub-standard support for their APIs, <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/support">when you look at Google Sheets you start seeing evidence of their evolved approach to support</a>, with a consistent set of buttons that tackle many of the common areas of <a href="http://support.apievangelist.com">API support</a>. For general questions, Google provides two buttons linked to StackOverflow:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_20_at_9.41.01_am.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>The search just drops you into Stack Overflow, with the tag "google sheets api", and the ask a new question drops you into the Stack Overflow submit new question form. For bug reporting, they provide a similar set of buttons:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_20_at_9.45.01_am.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>The search and report bug buttons drop you into the Google Code issues page for Google Sheets, leveraging the issues management for the Gooogle Code repository--something that can just as easily be done with Github issues. Then lastly, they provide a third set of buttons when you are looking to submit a feature:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_20_at_9.47.56_am.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Even though there is a typo on the first button, they also leverage Google Code issue management to handle all feature requests. Obviously working to centralize bug and feature reporting, and support management using Google Code--something I do across all my API projects using Github organizations, repositories, and their issue management. I'm guessing Google Support is tapping into Google Code to tackle support across projects at scale.</p>
<p>These support buttons may seem trivial, but they represent a more consistent approach by the API giant to be consistent in how they approach support across their API offerings--something that can go a long way in my experience. It gives your API consumers a familiar and intuitive way to ask questions, submit bugs, and suggest new features. Equally as important, I'm hoping it is also giving Google a consistent way to tackle support for their APIs in a meaningful way, that meets the needs of their API consumers.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/20/a-community-strategy-for-my-api-definition-guide/">A Community Strategy For My API Definition Guide</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_definitions_2017_03.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">tpublished the latest edition of my API definition guide</a>. I've rebooted my industry guides to be a more polished, summary version of my research instead of the rougher, more comprehensive version I've bee publishing for the last couple of years. I'm looking for my guides to better speak to the waves of new people entering the API space, and help them as they continue on their API journey.</p>
<p>In addition to being a little more polished, and having more curated content, my API guides are now going to also be more of a community thing. In the past I've kept pretty tight control over the content I publish to API Evangelist, only opening up the four logos to my partners. Using my API industry guides I want to invite folks from the community to help edit the content, and <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">provide editorial feedback</a>--<a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues/6">even suggesting what should be in future editions</a>. I'm also opening up the guides to include paid content that will help pay for the ongoing publication of the guides with the following opportunities available in the next edition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One Page Articles -</strong> Sponsored suggested topics, where I will craft the story and publish in the next edition of the guide--also published on API Evangelist blog after the guide is published.</li>
<li><strong>Two Page Articles&nbsp;-</strong> Sponsored suggested topics, where I will craft the story and publish in the next edition of the guide--also published on API Evangelist blog after the guide is published.Sponsor Slot -&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Sponsor Slot - </strong>On the service and tooling pages there are featured slots, some of which I will be giving to sponsors, who have related produces and services.</li>
<li><strong>Private Distribution - </strong>Allow for private distribution of the industry guide, to partners, and behind lead generation forms, allowing you to use API Evangelist research to connect with customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I will be accepting paid content within these industry guides, and posts via the blog now, they will all be labeled as sponsored posts, and I will also still be adding my voice to each and every piece--if you know me, or read API Evangelist blog you know what this means. I'm looking to keep the lights on, while also opening up the doors for companies in the space to join in the conversation, as well as the average reader--allowing anyone to provide feedback and suggestions via <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">the Github issues for each area of research</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">My API definition research</a> is just the first to come off the assembly line. I will be applying this same model to my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a> research in coming weeks, and eventually <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the rest of my research as it makes sense</a>. If there is a specific research area you'd like to see get attention&nbsp;or would be willing to sponsor in one of the ways listed above, <a href="mailto: kin@apievangelist.com">please let me know</a>. Once I get the core set of my API industry research guides published in this way, I will be working on increasing the distribution beyond just my network of sites, and the API Evangelist digital presence--publishing them to Amazon, and other prominent ecosystems.</p>
<p>I also wanted to take a moment and <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/05/28/the-community-has-spoken-api-evangelist-will-stay-as-it-is/">thank everyone in the community who helped m last </a><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/05/28/the-community-has-spoken-api-evangelist-will-stay-as-it-is/">year</a>&nbsp;and for everyone who is helping make my research, and the publishing of these industry guides a reality. Your support is important to me, and it is also important to me that my research continues, and is as widely available as it possibly can.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/openapi_spec_structural_improvements.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am spending some time adding more tools to <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">my OpenAPI Toolbox</a>, and I'm looking to start evaluating what it will take for tooling providers to evolve their solution from version 2.0 of the OpenAPI Spec to version 3.0. I want to better understand what it will take to evolve the documentation, generators, servers, clients, editors, and other tools that I'm tracking on as part of my toolbox research.</p>
<p>I'm going to spend another couple of weeks populating the toolbox with OpenAPI solutions. Getting them entered with all the relevant metadata. Once I feel the list is good enough, I will begin reaching out to each tool owner, asking what their OpenAPI 3.0 plans are. It will give me a good reason to reach out and see if anyone is even home. I'm assuming that a number of the projects are abandoned, and even that their owners do not have the resources necessary to go from 2.0 to 3.0. Regardless, this is something I want to track on as part of this OpenAPI toolbox research.</p>
<p>The overall architecture of OpenAPI shifted pretty significantly from 2.0 to 3.0. Things are way more modular, and reusable&nbsp;in there, something that will take some work to bring out in most of the tooling areas. Personally, I'm pretty excited for the opportunities when it comes to API documentation and API design editors with OpenAPI 3.0 as the core. I am also hoping that developers step up to make sure that the generators, as well as the server and client code generators become available in a variety of programming languages--we will need this to make sure we keep the momentum that we've established with the specification so far.</p>
<p>If you are looking at developing any tooling using OpenAPI 3.0 I'd love to hear from you. I'd like to hear more about what it will take to either migrate your tool from version 2.0 to 3.0&nbsp;or even hear what it will take to get up and running on 3.0 from scratch. I'm going to get to work on crafting my first OpenAPI definition using version 3.0, then I'm going to begin playing around with some new approaches to API documentation and possibly an API editor or notebook that takes advantage of the changes in the OpenAPI Specification.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_google_aws_microsoft.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spent a day last week at the Google Community Summit, learning more about the Google Cloud road map, and one thing I kept hearing them focus on was the notion of being able to operate on any cloud platform--not just Google. It's a nice notion, but how real of a concept is it to think we could run seamlessly on any of the top cloud platforms--Google, AWS, and Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept is something I'll be exploring more with my <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a>, Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) work. It's an attractive concept, to think I could run the same API infrastructure in any of the leading cloud platforms. I see two significant hurdles in accomplishing this: 1) Getting the developer and IT staff (me) up to speed, and 2) Ensuring your databases and code all runs and scales seamlessly whichever platforms you operate in. I guess I'd have to add 3) Ensure your orchestration and continuous integration works seamlessly across all platforms you operate on.</p>
<p>I am going to get to work deploying an HSDS compliant API on each of the platforms. My goal is to have just a simple yet complete API infrastructure running on Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. It is important to me that these solutions provide a complete stack helping me manage DNS, monitoring, and other important aspects. I'm also looking for there to be APIs for managing all aspects of my API operations--this is how I orchestrate and continuously integrate the APIs which I roll out.</p>
<p>Along with each API that I publish, I will do a write up on what it took to stand up each one, including the cloud services I used, and their API definitions. I am pretty content (for now) on the AWS platform, leveraging Github Pages as the public facade for my projects, and each repositories acting as the platform gears of API code, and definitions. Even though I'm content where I am at, I want to ensure the widest possible options available to cities, and other organizations who are looking to deploy and manage their human service APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/autocomplete.gif,qx38712.pagespeed.ce.mdv9wuhtbw.gif" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>The Postman team has been hard at work lately,&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/02/28/introducing-the-new-data-editor/">releasing their API data editor</a>, as well as <a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/03/07/autocomplete-and-tooltips-for-variables-are-here/">introducing variable highlighting and tooltips</a>. The new&nbsp;<span>autocomplete menu contains a list of all the variables in the current environment, followed by global variables, making your API environment setups more accessible from the Postman interface. Introducing a pretty significant time saver, once you have your environments setup properly.</span></p>
<p>This is a pretty interesting feature, but what makes me most optimistic, is when this approach becomes available for parameters, headers, and some of the data management features we are seeing emerge with the new Portman data editor. It all feels like the UI equivalent of what <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/the-openapi-specification-version-30-highlights/">we've seen emerge in the latest OpenAPI 3.0 release</a>, helping us better manage and reuse the schema, data, and other bits we put to use across all of our APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine when you can design and mock your API in Postman, crafting our API&nbsp;using a common vocabulary. Reusing environment variables, API path resources, parameters, headers, and other common elements already in use across operations. Imagine when I get tooltip suggesting that I use <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org vocabulary</a>, or possibly even RFCs for a date, currency, and other common definitions. Anyways, I'm liking the features coming out of postman, and I'm also liking that they are regularly blogging about this stuff, so I can keep up to speed on what is going on, and eventually cover here on the blog, and include in my research.</p>

<p>I wanted to provide an easy way to publish and share some of the tools that I'm tracking on in the <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> ecosystem, so I launched <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">my API toolbox</a>. In addition to tracking on the name, description, logo, and URL for OpenAPI tooling, I also wanted to categorize them, helping me better understand the different types of tools that are emerging. As I do with all my research, <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox">I published the OpenAPI Toolbox as a Github repository</a>, leveraging <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/blob/master/_data/tools.yaml">its YAML data core to store all the tools</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be a never ending project for me to add, update, and archive abandoned projects, but before I got too far down the road I wanted to also begin tracking on the license for each of the tools. I'm still deciding whether or not I want the toolbox to exclusively contain openly licensed tools, or look to provide a more comprehensive directory of tooling that includes unknown and proprietary solutions. I think for now I will just flag any tool I cannot find a license for, and follow up with the owner--it gives me a good excuse to reach out and see if there is anyone home.</p>
<p>Eventually, I want to also provide a search for the toolbox that allows users to search for tools&nbsp;and filter by license. Most of the tools have been Apache 2.0 or MIT license, details that I will continue to keep tracking and reporting on. If you know of any tooling that employs the OpenAPI Specification that should be included feel free to <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/issues">submit a Github issue for the project</a>, or submit a pull request on the repository and add it <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/blob/master/_data/tools.yaml">to the YAML data file that drives that OpenAPI Toolbox</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was following <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/pull/1445">the discussion around adding a&nbsp;WebAPI class</a> to Schema.org's core vocabulary, and it got me to think more about the role Schema.org has to play with not just our API definitions, but also significantly influencing API discovery. Meaning that we should be using Schema.org as part of our OpenAPI definitions, providing us with a common vocabulary for communicating around our APIs, but also empowering the discovery of APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I describe the relationship between Schema.org to API discovery, I'm talking about using <a href="http://pending.webschemas.org/WebAPI">the pending WebAPI class</a>, but I'm also talking about using common Schema.org org within API definitions--something that will open the definitions to discovery because it employs a common schema. I am also talking about how do we leverage this vocabulary in our HTML pages, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">helping search engines like Google understand there is an API service available</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/4fd35c3a5ab20881f86283bc001137ab.js"></script>
<p>I&nbsp;will also be exploring how I can better leverage Schema.org in <a href="http://apisjson.org">my APIs.json&nbsp;format</a>, better leveraging a common vocabulary describing API operations, not just an individual API. I'm looking to expand the opportunities for discovering, not limit them. I would love all APIs to take a page from the hypermedia playbook, and have a machine readable index for each API, with a set of links present with each response, but I also want folks to learn about APIs through Google, ensuring they are indexed in a way that search engines can comprehend.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> I am primarily invested in APIs.json (because it's my baby) describing API operations, and <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> to describe the surface area of an API, but I also want this to map to the very SEO driven world we operate in right now. I will keep investing time in helping folks use Schema.org in their API definitions (APIs.json&nbsp;&amp; OpenAPI), but I will also start investing in folks employing JSON+LD and Schema.org as part of their search engine strategies (like above), making our APIs more discoverable to humans as well as other systems.</p>

<p>I saw an interesting chasm emerge while at a Google Community Summit this last week, while I heard their support team talk, as well as their developer relations team discuss what they were up to. During the discussion, one of the companies presents discussed how their overall experience with the developer relations team has been amazing, their experience with support has widely been a pretty bad experience--revealing a potential gap between the two teams.</p>
<p>This is a pretty common gap I've seen with many other API platforms. The developer relations team is all about getting the word out, and encouraging platform usage&nbsp;and support teams are there to be the front line for support&nbsp;and being the buffer between integration, and platform engineering teams. I've been the person in the role as the evangelist when there is a bug in an API, and I'm at the mercy of an already overloaded engineering team, and QA staff, before anything gets resolved--this is a difficult position to be in.</p>
<p>How wide this chasm becomes ultimately depends on how much of a priority the API is for an engineering team, and how overloaded they are. I've worked on projects where this chasm is pretty wide, taking days, even weeks to get bugs fixed. I'm guessing this is something a more DevOps&nbsp;focused approach to the API life cycle might help with, where an API developer relations and support team have more access to making changes&nbsp;and fixing bugs--something that has to be pretty difficult to deal with at Google scale.</p>
<p>Anyways, I thought the potential chasm between developer relations and support was worthy&nbsp;enough to discuss and include in my research. It is something we all should be considering no matter how big or small our operations are. There is no quicker way to kill the morale of your API developer relations and support teams by allowing a canyon like this to persist. What challenges have you experienced when it comes to getting support from your API provider? Or inversely, what challenges have you faced supporting your APIs or executing on your developer outreach strategy? I'm curious if other folks are feeling this same pain.</p>

<p>In 2017 <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/10/hoping-schema-becomes-just-as-important-as-api-definitions-in-2017/">I think that getting our act together when it comes to our data&nbsp;schema</a> will prove to be just as important as getting it together when it comes to our API definitions and design. This is one reason I'm such a big fan of using OpenAPI to define our APIs because it allows us to better organize the schema of the data included as part of the API request and response structure. So I am happy to see <a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/02/28/introducing-the-new-data-editor/">Postman announce their new data editor</a>, something I'm hoping will help us make sense of the schema we are using throughout our API operations.</p>
<p>The Postman data editor provides us with some pretty slick data management UI features including&nbsp;drag and drop, a wealth of useful keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, and other timesaving features. Postman has gone a long way to inject awareness into how we are using APIs over the last couple of years, and the data editor will only continue developing this awareness when it comes to the data we are passing back and forth. Lord knows&nbsp;we need all the help we can get&nbsp;when it comes to getting our data backends in order.</p>
<p>The Postman data editor makes me happy, but I'm most optimistic about what it will enable, and what Postman has planned as part of their roadmap. They end their announcement with <em>"we</em><span><em>&nbsp;have a LOT of new feature releases planned to build on top of this editor, capabilities inspired by things you already do </em>using<em>&nbsp;spreadsheets"</em>. For me, this points to some features that would directly map to the most ubiquitous data tools out there--the spreadsheet. With a significant&nbsp;portion of business in the world is done via spreadsheets, it makes the concept of integration into the API toolchain a pretty compelling thing.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/03/07/visual-studio-2017-productivity-performance-and-partners/">I was reviewing the latest changes with Visual Studio 2017</a>&nbsp;and came across the section introducing connected services, providing a glimpse of Microsoft APIs baked into the integrated development environment (IDE). <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/18/integrated-development-environment-ide-for-apis/">I've been pushing for more API availability in IDE's for some time now</a>, something that is not new, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-within-the-developers-ide/">with Google and SalesForce having done it for a while</a>, but is something I haven't seen any significant movement in for a while now.</p>
<p>I have talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/27/apisjson-driven-api-dictionaries-for-use-in-atom-ide-autocomplete-packages/">delivering APIs in Atom using APIs.json</a>, and have <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-delivers-relevant-api-code/">long hoped Microsoft would move forward with this in Visual Studio</a>. All APIs should be discoverable from within any IDE, it just makes sense as a frontline for API discovery, especially when we are talking about developers. Microsoft's approach focuses on connecting developers of&nbsp;mobile applications, with <em>"the first Connected Service we are providing for mobile developers enables you to connect your app to an Azure App Service backend, providing easy access to authentication, push notifications, and data storage with online/offline sync".</em></p>
<p><span>In the picture, you can see Office 365 APIs, but since I don't have Visual Studio I can't explore this any further. If you have any insight into these new connected services features in the IDE, please let me know your thoughts and experiences. If Microsoft was smart, all their APIs would be seamlessly integrated into Visual Studio, as well as allow developers to easily import any other API using OpenAPI, or Postman Collections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>While I think that IDEs are still relevant to the API development life cycle I feel like maybe there is a reason IDEs haven't caught up in this area. It feels like a need that API lifecycle tooling like <a href="http://getpostman.com">Postman</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://restlet.com/modules/client/">Restlet Client</a>, and <a href="http://stoplight.io">Stoplight</a> are stepping up to service the area. Regardless I will keep an eye on. It seems likno-braineriner for Microsoft to make their APIs available via their own IDE products, but maybe we are headed for a different future where a new breed of tools helps us more easily integrate APIs into our applications--no code necessary.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_12_at_9.16.57_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was learning more about <a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC</a> from the Google team last week, while at the Google Community Summit, as well as the API Craft SF Meetup. I'm still learning about gRPC, and how it contributes to the API conversation, so I am trying to share what I learn as I go, keeping a record for others to learn from&nbsp;along the way. One thing I wanted to better understand was something I kept hearing regarding gRPC delivering more of a tighter API contract between API provider and consumer.</p>
<p>In contrast to more RESTful APIs, a gRPC client has to be generated by the provider. First, you define a service in a .proto file (aka Protocol Buffer), then you generate client code using the protocol buffer compiler. Where client SDKs are up for debate in the world of RESTful APIs, and client generation might even be frowned upon in some circles, when it comes to gRPC APIs, client generation is a requirement--dictating a much&nbsp;tighter coupling and contract, between API provider and consumer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have the first-hand experience with this process yet, I am just learning from my discussions last week, and trying to understand how gRPC is different from the way we've been doing APIs using a RESTful approach. So far it seems like you might want to consider gRPC if you are looking for significant levels of performance from your APIs, in situations where you have a tighter relationship with your consumers, such as internal, or partner scenarios. gRPC requires a tighter API contract between provider and consumer, something that might not always be possible, depending on the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I'm still getting up to speed, it seems to me that the .proto file, or the protocol buffer definition acts as the language for this API contract. Similar to how <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI is quickly becoming a contract for more RESTful API</a>s, although it is often times much looser contract. I'll keep investing time into learning about gRP, but. I wanted to make sure and process what I've learned leading up to, and while at Google this last week. I'm not convinced yet that gRPC is the future of APIs, but I am getting more convinced <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/10/focus-on-having-a-robust-and-diverse-api-toolbox/">that it is another important tool in our API toolbox</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was following <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/pull/1445">the discussion around adding a&nbsp;WebAPI class</a> to Schema.org's core vocabulary, and it got me to think more about the role Schema.org has to play with not just our API definitions, but also significantly influencing API discovery. Meaning that we should be using Schema.org as part of our OpenAPI definitions, providing us with a common vocabulary for communicating around our APIs, but also empowering the discovery of APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I describe the relationship between Schema.org to API discovery, I'm talking about using <a href="http://pending.webschemas.org/WebAPI">the pending WebAPI class</a>, but I'm also talking about using common Schema.org org within API definitions--something that will open the definitions to discovery because it employs a common schema. I am also talking about how do we leverage this vocabulary in our HTML pages, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">helping search engines like Google understand there is an API service available</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/4fd35c3a5ab20881f86283bc001137ab.js"></script>
<p>I&nbsp;will also be exploring how I can better leverage Schema.org in <a href="http://apisjson.org">my APIs.json&nbsp;format</a>, better leveraging a common vocabulary describing API operations, not just an individual API. I'm looking to expand the opportunities for discovering, not limit them. I would love all APIs to take a page from the hypermedia playbook, and have a machine readable index for each API, with a set of links present with each response, but I also want folks to learn about APIs through Google, ensuring they are indexed in a way that search engines can comprehend.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> I am primarily invested in APIs.json (because it's my baby) describing API operations, and <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> to describe the surface area of an API, but I also want this to map to the very SEO driven world we operate in right now. I will keep investing time in helping folks use Schema.org in their API definitions (APIs.json&nbsp;&amp; OpenAPI), but I will also start investing in folks employing JSON+LD and Schema.org as part of their search engine strategies (like above), making our APIs more discoverable to humans as well as other systems.</p>

<p>I spent last week in San Francisco listening to Google's very machine learning focused view of the future. In addition to their Google Next conference, I spent Tuesday at the Google Community Summit, getting an analyst look at what they are up to. Machine Learning (ML) was definitely playing a significant role in their strategy, and I heard a lot talk of machine learning marketplaces.</p>
<p>Beyond their own ML offerings like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/">video intelligence</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">vision APIs</a>, Google also provides you with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/09/google-cloud-machine-learning-now-open-to-all-with-new-professional-services-and-education-programs">an engine for publishing your own ML models</a>. They also have a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/asl/">machine learning advanced solution lab</a>, throwing a <a href="https://cloudplatformonline.com/Machine-Learning-Startup-Competition.html">machine learning hackathon</a>, and pushing a <a href="http://cloud.google.com/certification">machine learning certification program</a>&nbsp;as part of their cloud and data offerings. As the Google machine learning roadmap was being discussed throughout the day, the question of where can I publish my ML models, and begin selling them, came up regularly--something I feel like is going to be a common theme of the 2017 ML hype.</p>
<p>I'm guessing we will see a relationship between the Google ML engine, Google Cloud Endpoints emerge, and eventually some sort of ML marketplace like we have with <a href="https://algorithmia.com/">Algorithmia</a>. We are already seeing this shift in the AWS landscape, between their Lambda, ML, API Gateway, and AWS Marketplace offerings. You see hints of the future in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">the AWS serverless API portal</a> I wrote about previously. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/exploring-the-economics-of-wholesale-and-retail-algorithmic-apis/">The technology, business, and politics of providing retail and wholesale access to algorithms and machine learning models in this way fascinates me</a>, but as with every other successful area of the API economy, about 90% of this will be shit, and 10% will be actually doing anything interesting with compute&nbsp;and APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2017/01/03/learning-about-machine-learning-apis-with-my-algorithmic-rotoscope-work/">I'm doing all my image and video texture transfer machine learning model training using AWS and Algorithmia</a>. I then use Algorithmia to get access to the models I've trained, and if I ever want to open up partner level (wholesale), or public (retail) access to my ML Models I will use Algorithmia, or an API facade on top of their API to open up access, and make available in the <a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms">Algorithmia ML marketplace</a>. I'm guessing at some point I will want to syndicate my models into other marketplace environments, with giants like Google and AWS, but also other more niche, specialty ML marketplaces, where I can reach exactly the audience I want.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dna.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been simmering on thoughts around Uber's greyballing&nbsp;for some time now, where they target regulators and police in different cities, and craft a special Uber experience just for them. Targeting users like this are not new, all companies do it, it's just that Uber has a whole array of troubling behavior going on, and the fact that they were so aggressively pushing back on regulators, is why this is such a news story.</p>
<p>I'm familiar with this concept because greyballing is embedded in the DNA of APIs, we just call it API management. Every web, mobile, and device that uses an API have a unique fingerprint, identifying the application, as well as the user. Not all apps&nbsp;or users are created equal, and everyone gets's a tailored experience. I wanted to explore the spectrum of experiences I see on a regular basis, helping us all understand how this broadway production works.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Greyballing</strong> - Uber's situation is focused on creating a special scenario for regulators, but many companies also do this for their competitors, and anyone they see as a threat. Smoke and mirrors for those who threaten you is the name of the game.</li>
<li><strong>Sales Funnel -</strong> Where are you in my sales funnel? Based upon your application or user fingerprint, and IP address you will receive a different experience, support, and access to resources--the bigger opportunity you are, the better experience you will get.</li>
<li><strong>Country</strong> - Due to laws in specific countries, platforms have to deliver a different experience based upon the country, and region an application and user are operating within.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization</strong> - We regularly create sandboxes, staging, and alternate means of providing an environment for applications and users to operate in, delivering a more virtualized experience, based upon platform objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - Dashboards, analytics, and other visualizations provide us with snapshots of our world. These metrics, KPIs, analytics, visualizations, and other reporting drive everything, even when companies like Facebook and Twitter misreport and inflate their numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limiting - </strong>Access to data, content, media&nbsp;and algorithms online is always logged and metered. What you have access to, and how much&nbsp;you can use is always limited--something that usually occurs silently behind the apps we are using, protecting the interests of the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Error Rates -</strong> In response to rate limiting, or possibly because you are a special regulator or competitor you may be receiving elevated error rates. On mobile devices, it is easy to blame this on the network, but your elevated error rates may be more about who you are than the cell service where you are located.</li>
<li><strong>Access Tiers -</strong> The experience you are getting is the one you have paid for. Depending on what we can afford, we will get a different experience within an application--with all levels of access, and experience available to me the consumer.</li>
<li><strong>Partner Tiers -</strong> You only gain access to this experience because you are a partner. Only our trusted, approved partners have access to the full experience. While also letting everyone else know what it takes to become a partner.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Personalization</strong> - We are tailoring a unique experience for each user based on their interests, location, friends, activity, and a wealth of other data points. Each user of our platform gets their own experience, allowing the algorithm to define a personalized experience for each human.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - You are given a look into the kitchen, and are shown how the algorithm is working (or not). Helping be more transparent about the technology, business, and politics of the experience you are receiving.</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong> - In addition to having a window to look in, there are machine readable / defined inputs and outputs that allow for the experience to be measured and quantified, providing some accountability to the transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - What we hear is in alignment with the experience. When we are told to expect a certain experience we receive it. There is no surprises&nbsp;or mysterious behavior in the application experience for any user, and all expectations are in alignment with marketing and other communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many acceptable forms of greyballing. The problem isn't the technology and experience delivered. It was the motivations behind each company doing it. These things don't always happen as the result of malicious intent as we saw with Uber either. In the majority of the cases, it is just incompetence and greed that are the driving forces. <span>Platform engineers are good at being hyper-focused on a single objective, and being totally oblivious to the negative and unforeseen consequences</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Uber we know this was intentional when it happens with Facebook and Twitter misreporting their numbers, things can be much cloudier. Did they do it intentionally? Or did they just get caught? There really is no holy grail for ensuring tech companies behave with virtualization, personalization, greyballing, or whatever you want to call it. We live in a world where nothing is real, and everything is meant to be fabricated, and tailored just for us--it is what everyone seems to be asking for, wanting, or at least blindly accepting.</p>
<p>This will all come down to transparency, observability, and communication. If a company is doing shady things with their platform, there really is no fool proof way of knowing. We only can depend on them being transparent and communicating, or we can push for more access to the inputs and outputs of the platform, in hopes of gaining more observability. Beyond that, I guess whistleblowers is the last line of defense against this kind of behavior, which is pretty much how we are learning so much about Uber's motivations and internal culture.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>I am spending time learning more about what <a href="https://www.airmap.com">Airmap</a> is doing with their <a href="https://www.airmap.com/stakeholders/">digital notice and awareness system</a>. I first <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/05/airmap-is-positioning-itself-to-be-a-critical-api-broker-for-the-drone-industry/">learned about what Airmap was up to when I learned they&nbsp;were behind the notifications of national parks, and forest fires</a> that displayed via the iPhone enabled radio controller for my <a href="https://www.dji.com/phantom-3-pro">DJI Phantom 3 Pro drone</a>. I found it to be a pretty slick way to&nbsp;notify me of issues with the drone, my radio signal, and the environment around me, so when I came back to civilization I set out researching more about what Airmap does, staying in tune with what they are up to ever since.</p>
<p>Now, Airmap's&nbsp;digital notice and awareness system caught my attention: <em>AirMap&rsquo;s Digital Notice &amp; Awareness System works by sending an encrypted digital flight notice from a drone operator to a secure airspace management dashboard accessible by airspace authorities. </em>Moving this beyond just the drone operator getting notifications about device or environmental conditions based upon my latitude, longitude, and elevation. This system allows for an event driven notification system to be put in place between drone operator(s) and the cloud, modeling an airplane flight control system, but for the drone universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.airmap.com/stakeholders/"><img style="padding: 3px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_12_at_5.33.25_pm.png" alt="" width="98%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>For me, this is just one possible control system for drones--a cloud, mobile, and device based flight control system. I'm thinking about movie production, agricultural, mining, disaster, and many other types of control systems.<a href="https://developers.airmap.com/"> Airmap&nbsp;provides you with some of the APIs you will need to develop a drone platform and/or application(s) that will deliver in these areas</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.airmap.com/reference#status-api-overview">Status API</a></strong> - Provide nearby airspace information, including advisories, and notice requirements.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.airmap.com/reference#airspace-api-overview">Airspace API</a></strong> - Interact with the surrounding airspace including its obstacles, rules, and requirements.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.airmap.com/reference#flight-api-overview">Flight API</a></strong> - Create and query flights, verify a pilot meets flight requirements, and provide digital notice.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.airmap.com/reference#pilot-api-overview">Pilot API</a></strong> - Manage a pilot's profile, preferences, and provide identity verification.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.airmap.com/reference#aircraft-api-overview">Aircraft API</a></strong> - Information about drone manufacturers, models, and metadata.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.airmap.com/reference#vector-tiles">Maps</a></strong> - Provides a TileJSON spec map style for use with MapBox GL.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm taking these APIs and including them in my drone API research. Next, I'm taking what I've learned about machine learning and API enabled cloud pipelines and get to working mapping out some of the common blueprints for video production pipelines, and data processing workflows. I am looking to identify some common ways that AWS and Google cloud infrastructure can be seamlessly mapped to Airmap, and other drone enablement solutions--providing the next generation digital notice and awareness systems like Airmap is doing.</p>
<p>I am enjoying staying in tune where Airmap is headed with their platform. They have identified a very interesting and important layer to the emerging world of drones. Providing the API for tracking for airspace, aircraft, pilots, and their flights is a super smart approach to providing APIs, as well as leading the charge when it comes to information, advisories, and notices in the real world where drones are operating. This space fascinates me, as well as the production, and post-production API enablement when it comes to processing the video, images, and data these fascinating devices generate.&nbsp;</p>

        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-connect-the-dots.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I spend a lot of time connecting the dots with APIs, trying to understand what resources are available via an API, and then how I can actually put them to use. I can usually land the documentation page of an API, and be up to speed about what resources are available, and have a basic level of understanding of how I can put the APIs to work withing 15 minutes--if the API is reasonably designed, and somewhat documented. Where things get tougher for meÂ and require much heavier of a cognitive load, is going from the basicsÂ to understanding what is possible when you can really connect the dots between all the APIs a provider makes available.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/27/an-example-of-an-api-service-provider-using-hypermedia/">While I was profiling, and learning more about the AWS API Gateway</a>, which is an API that let's you deploy and manage your APIs, I found that their usage of the hypermedia format HAL, significantly contributed to me going from basicsÂ to aÂ better understanding the big picture, and what is possible at scale. Each API path I learned about gave me a wealth of links describing what was possible next, providing details on what I should be doing next, perpetually introducing and teaching me about what is possible with the AWS API Gateway.</p>
<p>I am hyper aware of the cost of getting up and running using an API. As a one person shop, reviewing thousands of APIs, my time is precious. I've looked at all of the AWS APIs, and it's easy to get a basic understanding of the resources available with their classic action= approach, but I rarely ever see the big picture of what is possible with the API. After spending the same amount of time in the AWS Gateway API as I would have spent learning any of the other AWS APIs, I found that I had a much greater understanding of what was possible, due to the presence of the hypermedia design pattern.</p>
<p>Hypermedia provides a much more complete story for me, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/18/a-more-honest-and-flexible-api-contract-using-hypermedia/">as well as offering up a much more honest approach to supporting the API</a>. It doesn't just provide me with documentation of available API resources, it connects the dots for me, showing me what is possible. In this scenario, it is an API deployment and management API, so while I'm learning about the API, I'm also being introduced toÂ new API deployment and management concepts along the way. We shouldn't assume that all of our consumers will be able to connect the dots, we should be providing them withÂ a more complete story of what is possible with the API design patterns we choose.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-toolbox.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm learning a lot about HTTP/2 and gRPC this week, so I have been thinking about how we isolate ourselves by focusing in on individual toolsets, where we should really be expanding our horizons, helping ensure we have the most robust and diverse API toolbox we possibly can. Depending on what part of the tech universe an engineer comes from they'll have a different view on just exactly what I mean when I say API to them.</p>
<p>The most common perspective that people respond with is REST. Folks automatically think this is what I mean when I say API--it isn't. That is your dogma&nbsp;or your gullibility to other people's dogma--please expand your horizons. When I say APIs, I mean an application programming interface that leverages web technology (aka HTTP, HTTP/2). Sure REST is the dominating philosophy in this discussion, but I see no benefit in limiting ourselves in this fashion--I see API as a toolbox, with the following toolsets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REST</strong> - Considering Roy Fielding's&nbsp;guidance when it comes to leveraging HTTP in my API design.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong> - Considering the web, and the role that links can play in your API design.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong> - Helping keep APIs a two-way street, expanding your API to respond to events not just single requests.</li>
<li><strong>GraphQL</strong> - Helping put powerful query tooling in the hands of API consumers when working with large and complex datasets.</li>
<li><strong>gRPC</strong> - Acknowledging that the HTTP protocol is evolving, and our API contract can evolve along with the specification.</li>
</ul>
<p>This represents the major toolsets that are currently in my API toolbox. Sure there are a number of other individual tools and specifications in there as well, but this represents the top tier toolsets I am looking at when it comes to getting things done. In my opinion, there is a time and place for each of these toolsets to be put to use. I can easily geek out on any of these areas, but because I'm not selling you a product or service, I'm more interested in finding the right tool for the situation.</p>
<p>I do not expect that all providers have this robust of API toolbox from day one--it is something that will come with time. My recommendation is everyone begins with REST, developing proficiency in this domain, while you are also learning about hypermedia webhooks. As your understanding evolves, then you should start looking at GraphQL, gRPC, and other more advanced approaches to round off your skills. Do not let your religious technological beliefs or any single vendor motivations limit the scope of your API toolbox, you should be working to make it as robust and diverse as you possibly can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/managing_grpc_apis_with_google_cloud_endpoints_3_638.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have been learning more about the way Google designs and defines their APIs after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/03/google-shares-their-api-design-guide/">their release of their API design guide</a>. When I research a company's APIs I always spend time looking through their Github repositories for anything interesting, and while poking around in Google's I found a repository of "<a href="https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis">interface definitions for a small (but growing) set of Google APIs</a>". I keep track of any Github repo I find containing API definitions, but Google's repo stood out because it contained a set of API definitions that covered both APIs that support both REST and gRPC.</p>
<p>Straight from the Github repo, they support two ways of access APIs: <em>"Google APIs use&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">Protocol Buffers</a>&nbsp;version 3 (proto3) as their Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface and the structure of the payload messages. The same interface definition is used for both REST and RPC versions of the API, which can be accessed over different wire protocols."</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>JSON over HTTP: You can access Google APIs directly using JSON over HTTP, using&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-libraries">Google API client libraries&nbsp;</a>or third-party API client libraries.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Protocol Buffers over gRPC: You can access Google APIs published in this repository through&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/grpc">GRPC</a>, which is a high-performance binary RPC protocol over HTTP/2. It offers many useful features, including request/response multiplex and full-duplex streaming.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the first example of this I've seen in the wild, and it feels like we are shifting from an HTTP to an HTTP/2&nbsp;API world. I don't think regular old REST or web APIs are going anywhere, I think they'll continue to be a staple, but it looks like Google is laying the groundwork for two-speed APIs, that are defined using a common API definition--you pick the speed you need. I've been hearing tales of gRPC usage for a while and seeing more APIs defined using protocol buffers, but Google's approach signals a wider more significant shift for me.</p>
<p>I'm still learning about gRPC, so I can't quite visualize the overlap between&nbsp;gRPC and REST quite yet. I'm going through their API definitions because they provide an interesting snapshot of the surface area of these hybrid APIs. As I spend my week in San Francisco for Google Next, I'm eager to learn more about their evolving approach to designing and defining APIs--something that I think will be setting the tone for API design at scale in the near future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_onion.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I read a lot of content about APIs. I read a lot of redundant and fluffy marketing and technical jargon, trying to understand exactly what an API does, or doesn't do. Before I criticize, I have to admit that crafting really good API marketing and documentation is hard. Only about 5% of what I read is good, a significant portion is just incomplete and lazily done by someone who doesn't care--the rest is actually incorrect, misleading, and straight up hype.</p>
<p>There are three layers to the API hype onion in my experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing - </strong>The fluff on the main page written by the marketing team who usually doesn't care about the API and has taken the time to get to know what it does.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation - </strong>The technical fluff in the API portal usually written by someone technical, and not quite possessing the skills to talk to humans, let alone coherently explain something to another human being.</li>
<li><strong>API -</strong> The actual naming, ordering, parameters, and overall request and response structure for an API that actually accomplishes something--it may not always accomplish exactly what I'm looking for, but at least it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I still read marketing&nbsp;and documentation, because they provide me with clues about the intent behind API operations, when I actually want the honest take of what an API does, I always go straight to the API and get to work making API calls. This is a problem that is only increasing as we enter into the artificial intelligence and machine learning hype phase.</p>
<p>After you finish writing the marketing, documentation, and have your API up and running--step back, and re-read everything, and think about the synchronicity between these three areas of your operations. It takes a lot of practice&nbsp;and hard work to do right, but I think if you just take a moment, step back, and think about these layers to how you articulate what your APIs does--you will immediately find yourself in a better position to communicate what it is you are trying to accomplish to a much wider audience.</p>

<p>I always enjoy learning about how companies are versioning their APIs. The topic is always one of the most discussed areas when we do APIStrat workshops, and is an aspect of the API space that I think there is never a 100% right way of doing things. Making it an area I recommend learning as many different approaches as you can, then decide on the right solution for your particular situation.</p>
<p>To help you in your journey, and mine, I try to document any official versioning strategies published by API providers I research. Today I have one from Google, providing some very interesting insight into how they version their APIs. Google uses&nbsp;<a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, which follows this approach to each version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, incrementing the:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>MAJOR</code>&nbsp;version when you make incompatible API changes,</li>
<li><code>MINOR</code>&nbsp;version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner,</li>
<li><code>PATCH</code>&nbsp;version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to their REST APIs Google puts the version in URL, and I'm still learning more about their approach to how it's applied to the proto package for gRPC APIs. They also have some good advice when it comes to what is breaking and non-breaking changes.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-broken-gears.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Backwards-compatible (non-breaking) changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding an API interface to an API service definition</li>
<li>Adding a method to an API interface</li>
<li>Adding an HTTP binding to a method</li>
<li>Adding a field to a request message</li>
<li>Adding a field to a response message</li>
<li>Adding a value to an enum</li>
<li>Adding an output-only resource field</li>
</ul>
<p>Backwards-incompatible (breaking) changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing or renaming a service, field, method or enum value</li>
<li>Changing an HTTP binding</li>
<li>Changing the type of a field</li>
<li>Changing a resource name format</li>
<li>Changing visible behavior of existing requests</li>
<li>Changing the URL format in the HTTP definition</li>
<li>Adding a read/write field to a resource message</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/versioning">This Google API versioning advice comes from their API design guide</a>. I also f<a href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/versioning-an-api">ound some versioning advice from them as part of the Google Cloud Endpoints documentation</a>, which provides some easier to follow advice for REST APIs. It also includes some advice for handling as part of your OpenAPI definition, something I will be investigating further.</p>
<p>I am just looking to add semantic versioning approach, the example of putting the version in the URL, and the advice on backwards-compatibility to my API research. It helps me keep my work full of healthy examples, and URL references to how specific API providers are documenting their own APIs, as well as offering guidance to customers who are using their services to design, deploy, and manage their APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>This is the third post in my effort to try and define the three sides of my API monitoring. I'm trying to quantify what is needed as a sort of API industry monitoring dashboard -- if there is such a thing. To help me think through this, I have taken my approach to monitoring the API space and I'm breaking them up into three buckets <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/16/trying-to-define-api-awareness/">API awareness</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/a-checklist-for-api-observability/">API observability</a>, and now API ratings. While the three areas share many common characteristics, the motivations behind each area are significantly different--enough so, I want to look at them and evolve them separately.</p>
<p>A rating system for the API space is something I usually get one or two requests to discuss each quarter, sustained throughout the year. I have very different actors approaching me to solve this, from hedge fund managers, to venture capital managers, to startups and enterprise organizations. Everyone (except one) who has approached me to date has been woefully unaware of the scope of doing something like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">creating a Standard and Poors or Moody's for the API economy</a>, which is always a red flag for me when it comes to understanding their motivations.</p>
<p>I do not have the resources to develop an API ranking system on my own, and I have no desire to exclusively own such a thing--it needs to be an open, community driven thing. However, I do have interest it trying to define possible algorithms for such a ranking system, derived from the approach I've developed for myself. I am driving this work from <a href="http://apievangelist.com">a master dump of my research,</a> and the approach I have used to track on in the world of APIs since 2010--an analyst 100K view, and here is what I'm considering...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery -&nbsp;</strong>If we are rating APIs, they need to be discoverable, and accessible--if you can't find them, understand what they do, and kick the tires--you really can't rate something. How many APIs? What is churn?
<ul>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- Find new applications built on top of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>People</strong>&nbsp;- People who are doing interesting things with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Organization</strong>&nbsp;- Any company, group, or organization working with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;- API-centric services that might help solve a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>&nbsp;- Open source tools that put APIs to work solving a problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Versions -&nbsp;</strong>What versions are currently in use, what new versions are available, but not used, and what future versions are planned and on the horizon. What is the time since the last release, or between releases?</li>
<li><strong>Paths</strong>&nbsp;- What paths are available for all available APIs, and what are changes or additions to this stack of resources.</li>
<li><strong>Schema&nbsp;</strong>- What schema are available as part of the request and response structure for APIs, and available as part of the underlying data model(s) being used. What are the changes?</li>
<li><strong>SDKs</strong>&nbsp;- What SDKs are available for the APIs I'm monitoring. What is new. What are the changes made regarding programming and platform develop kits?
<ul>
<li><strong>Repositories</strong>&nbsp;- What signals are available about an SDK regarding it's Github repository (ie. commits, issues, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Contributors</strong>&nbsp;- Who are the contributors.</li>
<li><strong>Stargazers</strong>&nbsp;- The number of stars on SDK.</li>
<li><strong>Forks</strong>&nbsp;- The number of forks on an SDK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>&nbsp;- What is the chatter going on around individual APIs, and across API communities. We need access to the latest messages from across a variety of channels.

</ul>
<p>I use data and make gut-level decisions from these areas across my monitoring of the space. Some of these signals are directly within the control of API providers, while others are more in control of their consumers, and the wider public. Many of these signals depend on a company, organization, institutions, and government agencies being public with their API operations. I just can't know about and measure private, internal APIs, without some sort of observability into their operations.</p>
<p>The most obvious areas for measuring the quality of API providers have been based on the&nbsp;number of users, or the&nbsp;number of API calls, which are both completely within the control of the API provider to report, or not to report. My approach to rating APIs is dependent on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/16/trying-to-define-api-awareness/">my API awareness</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/a-checklist-for-api-observability/">the API observability</a> of each API&nbsp;provider. This is why I am working my way through these three levels, trying to take another look at how to distil down what I do into a set of metrics that can be used to establish some sort of rating for each provider.</p>
<p>I actually have metrics in place for about 25% of this list, and I know other API service providers who have an additional 10% of this, but really there is a pretty big opportunity out there right now for an organization (or organizations) to step up in the area of API ratings. The challenge is going to be about how you are going to keep the money from influencing the rating system, or I guess to be as transparent as possible in how you take money from the people you are rating, and how the process works. Let me know if you want to talk about in detail, I'm looking to stimulate this conversation further in 2017.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>I just wanted to take a moment and highlight some folks who are doing interesting things with APIs. I spend a lot of time focusing on the companies, products, and services from&nbsp;the sector, but I don't talk a lot about individual people. So I wanted to pause for a moment and just highlight a couple of people doing really interesting things with APIs right now.</p>
<p>If have been paying attention to API definitions in the last year, then you probably have come across APIs.guru, <a href="https://apis.guru/openapi-directory/">the Wikipedia for APIs</a>. They have 244 OpenAPI definitions available in their catalog, which&nbsp;is the most comprehensive directory of machine readable API definitions out there. If you have an OpenAPI for your API you should be <a href="https://apis.guru/browse-apis/">publishing it to APIs.guru</a>. if you don't, you should be creating one, and then publishing it to APIs.guru.</p>
<p>Here are the hardworking, API-savvy folks behind APIs.guru:</p>

<p>I am in the middle of a project where I am building on the work these two have invested in with APIs.guru. I'm hoping that with the next wave of this work, I'll have some complete API definitions I can contribute to APIs.guru. I encourage you to make sure your API definitions are published to the directory so that other people like me can include your APIs in our work.</p>
<p class="p2">Beyond the APIs.guru directory, <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory">I recommend checking out their Github repository, as they are doing some interesting things with GraphQL</a>. If you need help crafting an API definition for your API platform, or in need of other API advice, I recommend messaging the APIs.guru team. I'm sure they'd be happy to talk to you, and see where they can help you with your API efforts.</p>

<p><em>This is an outline I pulled together for a potential project I am working on this week. It's derived from my research, and previous workshops I've done with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies in the past. I wanted to share here, in hopes it would stimulate API-focused conversations with some interesting folks.</em></p>
<p>I put together a framework to guide a full day discussion between us, which will leave you with a greater awareness of what an API focus can bring to your company, and leave you with a strategy that you could apply to your API operations back home. This framework is assembled from the last seven years of monitoring the API practices of leading companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others, but tailored to meet the needs of a retail and digital commerce focused company. I don't expect you to digest everything here in a single reading, it is the complete list of building blocks which we will move around, and organize in a guide for you to take back with you.</p>
<p><strong>API 101<br /></strong>I wanted to start with the basics&nbsp;and help provide you and your organization grasp the fundamental concepts of why having an API focus is important to doing business in 2017. It is important that all stakeholders have a base level awareness of the what and why of APIs are, as well as the technical, business, and legal implications of API operations. Here is an outline for our discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What Is API?&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss your overall web strategy, and discuss how your API operations will augment, complement, and extend your web presence.</li>
<li><strong>Why do API?&nbsp;</strong>- Cover why APIs will help you deliver to web and mobile, as well as bring more flexibility in any&nbsp;system to system integrations internally, and with your partners.</li>
<li><strong>API Consumption</strong>&nbsp;- Talk about the current and future consumption of 3rd party APIs&nbsp;and from trusted partners, as well as thoughts about internal usage.</li>
<li><strong>Providing APIs&nbsp;</strong>- Talk about the overall world of providing APIs, alongside your existing web and mobile application development.</li>
<li><strong>The Technology of APIs</strong>&nbsp;- Briefly talk about the technological building blocks of providing and consuming APIs, without getting too much into the weeds.</li>
<li><strong>The Business of APIs&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the nuances of how APIs are being monetized when it comes to retail and products, as well as approaches to data, and other resources.</li>
<li><strong>The Politics of APIs&nbsp;</strong>- Makes sure to highlight many of common legal, privacy, security, transparency, and other political aspects of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>API Operations&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the final product of our gathering, assembling a strategy for your API operations that can be implemented in phases, and growing with successes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we dive into the details of modern API operations I want to make sure we have a solid base for understanding why your company should be investing APIs. Then we can talk about what else will be needed to do this successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions<br /></strong>Before we get started, let's define the building blocks of doing APIs, starting with the high-level objectives of why your company is looking to do APIs. Then we will move from the 100K level, and identify some of the common building blocks we'll use to define API operations across all the working areas below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectives&nbsp;</strong>- Get to work defining the primary objectives of your&nbsp;company-wide API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Web Concepts&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the core elements of the web, and how they are reused for APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Web Standards</strong>&nbsp;- Walk through a handful of the common standards employed as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Data Schema</strong>&nbsp;- Talk about how data is defined, managed, shared, and monetized using APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Definitions</strong>&nbsp;- Introduce you to common ways in which APIs are being defined and communicated around.</li>
<li><strong>Access Scopes</strong>&nbsp;- Talk through the myriad of ways in which data, content, and other resources are accessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these areas touch on&nbsp;and will guide our discussions throughout the day. The definitions will guide our conversation, and then also become a core outline for governing API operations at every stage of its development--defining the design, deployment, management, and every other area of operations.</p>
<p><strong>Design<br /></strong>A design first strategy is needed to achieve consistency, and maturity before we enter the more costly phases of development and deployment. There are many common approaches to API design on the web, and these are the common areas I'd like to discuss as part of your operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best Practices&nbsp;</strong>- Walk through some of the best practices of API design, and the common approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Requests /&nbsp;</strong><strong>Response</strong>&nbsp;- Talk through the common patterns of how API requests are made, and what responses look like.</li>
<li><strong>Errors&nbsp;</strong>- Think briefly about error handling, and how this feeds into overall stability strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Media Types&nbsp;</strong>- Talk about the common media types in play, starting with HTML, and moving into common API patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong>&nbsp;- Move into a more detailed discussion around hypermedia, and how it impacts design.</li>
<li><strong>Schema&nbsp;</strong>- Take the building blocks in the definition discussion, and talk about how they'll be applied as part of design.</li>
<li><strong>Standards&nbsp;</strong>- Walk through some of the common standards that will be applied, such as dates, currencies, and other standards.</li>
<li><strong>Resources&nbsp;</strong>- Talk more about the types of resources that will be in play, and what actions can be taken using these resources.</li>
<li><strong>Process&nbsp;</strong>- What does the full process of API design look like, across all APIs being deployed and managed.</li>
<li><strong>Organization&nbsp;</strong>- How are tooling, practices, knowledge, and process stored, shared, and implemented as part of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Internationalization</strong>&nbsp;- What international considerations are there regarding the overall design of the API its design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your API design strategy will evolve and mature with time, but setting a healthy base for operations will help set a tone for API operations. How you design your API resources, will affect how they speak to your partners&nbsp;as well as 3rd party developers, and contribute to the overall success or failure of internal and external API consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Versioning<br /></strong>I want to discuss the high level of how things will evolve across API operations. Your web and IT development already have established cycles&nbsp;and workflows. How will these apply to API operations, and what are the key considerations when it comes to API versioning, and all applications that consume them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Versioning&nbsp;</strong>- How will APIs&nbsp;and their supporting operations be versioned, from design to deprecation?</li>
<li><strong>Communication&nbsp;</strong>- What are the communication considerations around API versioning and changes?</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia -</strong>&nbsp;Consider hypermedia design practices, and their contribution to the versioning of APIs, and the applications that are integrated.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is necessary to discuss versioning in a technical and business sense. Better understanding how things will change and evolve, and being truthful and honest about how this change impacts operations, integrations, and each application that touches API operations.</p>
<p><strong>DNS<br /></strong>You already have DNS in place for your web operations. We will be taking a look at what is in place, as well as discuss the front line for API operations. DNS provides the base URL for API access, as well as human access for the overall API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain(s)&nbsp;</strong>- What domains are required for the API, portal, and other supporting elements of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved with setup and management of the DNS for API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>&nbsp;- How is DNS stability considered, and managed,&nbsp;ensuring resources remain available.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is already DNS infrastructure in place, this is a discussion around what is required to deliver and support API operations. As with the web, DNS is the frontline for the&nbsp;presence of the API operations, and we need a snapshot of the role it will play in API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Data<br /></strong>I would like to learn more about all of the data sources for your operations. Where is data stored? Where does it come from? What is the complete picture when it comes to data and content accessibility?&nbsp;We can cover a handful of areas to help paint a picture of what is currently&nbsp;behind&nbsp;operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platforms&nbsp;</strong>- What internal,&nbsp;partner and 3rd party platforms, software, and data solutions are in place, or being considered for the next phase.</li>
<li><strong>Files -&nbsp;</strong>What is a general look at how data and content&nbsp;are&nbsp;accessed in a raw file format, considering spreadsheets, XML, CSV, and many other common formats.</li>
<li><strong>Process -</strong>&nbsp;What is a general look at your overall data acquisition, normalization, development, and production&nbsp;life cycle&nbsp;-- how is data currently flowing inside and outside the firewall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all APIs will be about delivering data, but a significant portion of APIs will be data or content driven from a myriad of sources. I need an honest perspective of the data landscape behind. Opening up APIs shouldn't just expose everything behind, it should be thoughtfully composed, providing the best possible view of the database backend.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment<br /></strong>Next up is the actual deployment of APIs. Discussing how APIs are deployed, building from the database backend that is available, and moving forward to look at many of the common ways APIs are being deployed today. These are some of the common areas we'll discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Database&nbsp;</strong>- Taking the database snapshot, and building on the current data connectivity in place, and drive a sensible web API facade.</li>
<li><strong>Code&nbsp;</strong>- Considering the code required to drive APIs, providing the business logic behind each resource, allowing interaction with data, content, and algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Gateway</strong>&nbsp;- What are the current gateways are in place, proxying, and providing access to existing systems, starting with databases, but also other systems.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud&nbsp;</strong>- Moving the discussion into the cloud, and talking about what cloud infrastructure is in place, or being considered as part of future API operations.</li>
<li><strong>On-Premise</strong>&nbsp;- How much of the operations are in the cloud vs. on premise? What are the short and long-term strategies for managing API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Serverless&nbsp;</strong>- How decoupled and modular are existing&nbsp;compute resource across the company? Are looking at or discussing a serverless approach to delivering APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>These areas represent the current API deployment stack, providing the framework for our discussion when it comes to publishing APIs. How you are currently deploying web infrastructure will significantly impact this discussion. However, I'd like to also introduce you to other approaches to deploying APIs, so that you can consider the future of your web and API infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Environment / Virtualization<br /></strong>APIs are rarely deployed directly into a production environment. Leading approaches to API deployment involve a variety of virtualization techniques for underlying infrastructure, the APIs themselves, and possibly even the data, and content they serve up. These environments will provide solutions to mock, simulate, conduct quality assurance, production, and other approaches to staging API deployment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the need for mocking API resources, allowing resources to be designed and tested before costly development begins.</li>
<li><strong>Data&nbsp;</strong>- What needs are there around testing, simulating, and virtualizing data and content across API consumption to support development and production environments.</li>
<li><strong>Containers&nbsp;</strong>- Are there any containerization and virtualization efforts underway, starting with cloud practices, but also focusing on Docker and other leading approaches to isolating deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Environment&nbsp;</strong>- What are the needs for staging, sandbox, as well as production environments? Let's think about a variety of environments beyond just a single production environment.</li>
<li><strong>Import / Export&nbsp;</strong>- What import and export capabilities will be in place to help support the ephemeral nature of virtualized environments, templates, and other enablers of virtualization.</li>
</ul>
<p>This are might seem like a nice to have a category,&nbsp;but in reality, API and data virtualization can significantly lower the cost of deployment and management&nbsp;and rapidly increasing the rate of maturation of API resources. Different APIs will have varying virtualization needs, let's consider what is needed, based upon your goals with API enablement.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication<br /></strong>Let's take a quick look at what is needed regarding platform authentication. Looking at internal and partner needs first, but then also considering the 3rd party, and authentication using popular social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or even Github for developers and more technical user.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- What does authentication look like for internal systems and existing applications? Provide some discussion on common concerns, needs, and benefits of the authentication layer of API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Approaches</strong>&nbsp;- Let's walk through some of the common approaches, to making 100% publicly available, all the way to very granular level authorization and access with OAuth--allowing for fine-grained authorization and access at the user and API resource levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a common toolbox for enterprise applications. There is also a common set of authentication practices for web APIs. The goal of our conversation will be to set a baseline for this overlap between what you currently have, and what will be needed to deliver API resources across web, mobile, and device applications, in as frictionless a way as possible.</p>
<p><strong>A Portal&nbsp;</strong><br />Where will internal, partner, and public users find API resources? It is common to have a central portal to find all APIs and supporting resources can be found. Providing a focused presence and voice for an API, encouraging the awareness and usage of common APIs across company operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public / Private&nbsp;</strong>- Who will be served by a portal? Will there be separate portals for internal, or partner operations? What is the relationship between portals?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>&nbsp;- Let's talk about the target audience for portals. Who will be stumbling across them, and who will be regular visitors, making it a community thing.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Portals</strong>&nbsp;- What are the pros and cons of a single, focused portal vs. a variety of portal serving different audiences, and providing a variety level of security.</li>
</ul>
<p>Portals can be permanent, or ephemeral. They can exist in the cloud, on-premise, or on devices. Portals can act like a retail storefront, providing a permanent or tempory snapshot of resources available across the entire platform, in support of a single project or event. Regardless of the objectives, a portal provides a single doorway into API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Management<br /></strong>Next, let's walk through the management of API operations. Focusing on what it takes to manage the intersection of providing and consuming APIs. How will engagement be documented, managed, measured, and provide a wholesale representation of the companies existing platform, brand, and presence?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Onboarding&nbsp;</strong>- What does onboarding look like for the platform. Once onboard, what happens next? How are users engaged, challenged, and verified?</li>
<li><strong>Developer Account(s)&nbsp;</strong>- What resources are available to developers and consumers to help them manage their account, applications, access, and consumption of resources?</li>
<li><strong>Internationalization&nbsp;</strong>- APIs augment your web presence. What are the international efforts already in place, and what are the considerations for API efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Corporate&nbsp;</strong>- What is the corporate presence within the API operations, and how do management reach across the corporate environment, locations, and brand.</li>
<li><strong>API -&nbsp;</strong>What APIs should be present to help access and manage API operations. Every aspect of API operations should be controlled via APIs, adding another dimension to operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Management doesn't stop here. Each of the following areas will play a role in the management of the platform and have a place in the portal. The goal of API management is to provide a scalable, measurable, observable layer for efficiently managing the technical and&nbsp;business intersection that APIs open up.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started<br /></strong>First impressions are everything. Let's take the onboarding discussion, and think about it from a consumer's perspective, and establish exactly the right experience for new, as well as existing users. A little bit of discussion ahead of time around what it takes to get started can go a long way.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- Let's think through the big picture of getting started for internal and partner users, then discuss any other potential consumers from the media to application developers.</li>
<li><strong>Steps&nbsp;</strong>- What are the steps involved with getting started with integration? What approval steps required? Where can we reduce friction, and encourage new and existing users to do more?</li>
<li><strong>Targets&nbsp;</strong>- Who are we targeting with this process? Are there different steps, and objectives for different users. Are there users who won't actually be building applications, but just encouraging and supporting other consumers?</li>
<li><strong>FAQ&nbsp;</strong>- Let's address some of the questions developers will have with getting started. Let's discuss a way to plug the FAQ into the overall feedback loop, keeping it a growing and evolving list that represents the evolution of API operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is common to launch an API and think only technical people will be accessing it. In reality, an API should speak to technical, as well as non-technical users. You never know who will be researching your API for a story, creating the curriculum for a university class, or other use that hadn't occurred to you. APIs aren't just for developers--anyone should be able to get started without too much friction.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation<br /></strong>The next step in getting started is always about visiting documentation for an API. API documentation provides the next step after the marketing and advertising that directed a consumer to an API. Let's explore what should be available to ensure all users quickly get up to speed on the details of what an API does or doesn't do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>&nbsp;- What documentation is required for each available API? Let's talk about common approaches to delivering interactive documentation using API definitions and schema, ensuring there is always up to date documentation available for the entire platform.</li>
<li><strong>Solutions&nbsp;</strong>- Documentation should just be about the API resources available, they should also be about the solutions they provide. Sharing case studies, showcasing applications, and helping consumers understand the opportunities available through integration partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Errors&nbsp;</strong>- Don't just document what a platform does. Let's talk about what an API platform does when it fails. What are the boundaries, and limitations of a platform, helping consumers develop more resilient applications?</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation is always identified as the number one pain point for developers when it comes to putting APIs to work in web, mobile, and device applications. I will walk you through the advancements made in the area of documentation, minimizing it as a pain point for both API providers and consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Software Development Kits (SDK)<br /></strong>It is common for API providers to provide a variety of language and platform development kits for consumers to put to use. Web APIs are language and platform agnostic and can be consumed in any programming language. There are some common aspects of delivering and management code as part of API operations--let's look at some of the common areas:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- What is the overall tone of code for a platform. Is there a heavy lead for development internally, is it partner driven, or will it be more of a community effort? There are plenty of approaches to managing and delivering code in support of API integration.</li>
<li><strong>Language Samples&nbsp;</strong>- Starting with the samples, many providers offer up simple, standalone code samples in a variety of programming languages, giving only what is needed for making and handling of a single request.</li>
<li><strong>Language SDKs&nbsp;</strong>- Additionally more mature providers also offer up complete software development kits that help developers with authentication, as well as working on all available API paths.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile SDKs</strong>&nbsp;- Beyond language SDKs, some API providers focus on mobile SDKs helping consumers deliver iPhone, Android, and Windows applications using API resources.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Code Management&nbsp;</strong>- A discussion about where the code is managed. The common approach is to use Github, which provides the resources for managing code but done in a social way that also allows continued engagement with consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Development Kits (PDK)&nbsp;</strong>- What platform integrations needs will there be? Is there the need or desire to provide WordPress, SalesForce, AWS, Heroku, Facebook, or other existing platform integration.</li>
<li><strong>Single Page Applications (SPA)</strong>&nbsp;- Will there be single page application libraries and scaffolding available for API consumers to use as a start for delivering storefronts, and other deliverables?</li>
<li><strong>Browser Development Kits (BDK)</strong>&nbsp;- What browser add-on toolkits will be needed to help developers better integrate with the browser, providing a different experience for end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery&nbsp;</strong>- How are SDKs discovered, made available, and showcased as part of API operations, making sure standardized, approved resources are put to use as often as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where APIs really shine, providing a variety of openly licensed or even premium resources for API consumers and developers to put to use. When you look at the leading pioneers in the space like Amazon, SalesFroce, and Google, they all have a wealth of existing code resources, helping to go from idea to integration as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Support<br /></strong>Let's talk about supporting API operations. Providing the necessary technical and business support that individuals, companies&nbsp;and any consumer will need when working with APIs in their integration or application--a successful API has a wealth of support resources that scale with the demand.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- What support resources are available? There should be a variety of channels, as well as dedicated human resources to providing timely, and information support when developers need it.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Support&nbsp;</strong>- It is common for APIs to provide a variety of self-service support like forums, and knowledge bases, allowing consumers to find answers to their questions 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without directly contacting platform support.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Support&nbsp;</strong>- In addition to a variety of self-service support elements, there should be a handful of direct support channels like email, phone, chat, or a ticketing system.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with other areas of IT and web operations, API support will overlap with existing services. However, because of the technical nature of API integration, support should include a heightened level of technical expertise, understanding the challenges of API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Communication<br /></strong>Complimenting support, let's talk about the communication strategy for API operations. This should overlap with existing communication efforts, but if the resources are available, it can be beneficial to have a dedicated API operations strategy and presence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Channels&nbsp;</strong>- Which channels are used? Blog, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Github, Youtube, and other leading platforms should all be considered for an APIs presence.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy</strong>&nbsp;- I walk you through the common elements of a communication strategy, highlighting what an API can do, what people are doing with the resources, as well as other platform activity, providing a common heartbeat for API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Process&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about the execution of the communication strategy. What resources are available, how can it be grown over time, and possibly involve community efforts, encouraging passionate consumers to help communicate the platform message?</li>
</ul>
<p>This can dovetail with existing communication but needs to possess a focused message that speaks to a more technical audience. It helps to provide separate channels dedicated to a developer message, but take advantage of cross-pollination between mainstream and API operational efforts, keeping a message in alignment, and increasing the reach.</p>
<p><strong>Road Map / Issues / Change Log&nbsp;<br /></strong>One of the benefits of doing APIs is that they can help deal with change and shifts in the development process easier. There are many common ways in which an API helps address change, and evolution, something that is integrated with support, and communication efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved internally with road map planning, dealing with issues that arise, and the historical tracking of changes--including communication.</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved externally with&nbsp;road map&nbsp;planning, dealing with issues that arise, and the historical tracking of change--including communication.</li>
<li><strong>Process&nbsp;</strong>- What process is involved with change management, and the approval of the roadmap, and establishing of the schedule and timeline<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Communications&nbsp;</strong>- How and when are changes communicated? How transparent is the platform when it comes to issues? How is change communicated?</li>
</ul>
<p>Change management is essential to address change for not just the platform, but the many distributed applications and integrations that depend on APIs. Clarity, transparency, and communication in this area will potentially make or break a platform, determining the success of the platform, as well as partners.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring / Testing / Performance<br /></strong>Let's spend some time talking about the monitoring of API operations, their availability, performance, and assessment of whether or not they are meeting their intended objectives. Some of this will already be in place with web efforts but will need a unique set of considerations when it comes to API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management&nbsp;</strong>- How are monitoring and testing set up? What is measured, and how is it reported and communicated across operations.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted&nbsp;</strong>- What does targeted testing and monitoring look like providing regional and international coverage for all testing and monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Status&nbsp;</strong>- How is the status of operations presented, giving a single external dashboard for consumers to see the current and historical status of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Notification&nbsp;</strong>- Who is notified when there are monitoring, testing, and performance concerns, providing a hierarchy or notifications about changes.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong>&nbsp;- How are results included in internal, and partner reporting, and part of service level agreements and partner contracts for API access.</li>
<li><strong>3rd Party&nbsp;</strong>- Is there monitoring of third party providers in place, allowing for an understanding of how reliable the 3rd party services being consumed are.</li>
</ul>
<p>This are of API operations will help us understand how well we are doing executing the strategy, and meeting internal and partner expectations. Monitoring and testing should be executed as part of every API deployed, led by development groups, but should include business unit, and partner stakeholders in the conversation, notification, and discussions about changes to monitoring and testing efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability<br /></strong>Let's talk about the reliability of the platform, and what will be expected of internal and partner stakeholders. We'll take what we learned in the monitoring and testing discussions, and translate it into business terms, and understand what was promised as part of API operations and integration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assertions&nbsp;</strong>- What assertions are made regarding each API resource, as well as groups of API resources. What are the technical details, as well as the plain English explaining the business objective, and the legalese&nbsp;that will pass lawyer review of assertions made?</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreement&nbsp;</strong>- What actual service contracts are available and in place regarding API operations. These are the legal contracts that are governing the expectations of API availability and consumption.</li>
</ul>
<p>If API resources are to be monetized upstream or downstream they will have to meet the expected level of reliability. Meeting the API contracts in place for accessing and consuming data, content, and algorithmic resources, and justify the money being exchanged for services.</p>
<p><strong>Security<br /></strong>Along with reliability, security will be essential to a successful API operation. APIs leverage the web, but are far from open and available to anyone with the web address. There are many technical areas to consider when it comes to API security, but let's just talk the basics this round.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- A well defined, discoverable, and consistent API approach brings a level of security by itself. Let's discuss the other aspects of security when it comes to API operations from authentication outlined above to DNS level attacks that might disrupt operations.</li>
<li><strong>Transport-Level Security&nbsp;</strong>- Encryption by default is the norm for API operations, and we'll discuss encryption in transport, as well as other platform or client, led efforts supporting encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can expand on this area if needed, but I prefer to address a well-defined API strategy as the first step in platform security. APIs help standardizes how resources are accessed and put to use, which goes a long way to help secure valuable corporate interests and protect valuable corporate assets.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Department<br /></strong>Let's make sure and cover the legal side of operations lightly. As with security, we will lightly cover the legal department&nbsp;and stay out of the weeds. There are a handful of areas I'd like to discuss, just to make sure we have this side of operations in order.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy&nbsp;</strong>- What privacy considerations are there regarding data and content being made available, as well as the developers using the APIs, and the users of the applications that are built on the application.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service</strong>&nbsp;- We can talk through some of the ways a platform's terms of service will need to be augmented as part of API operations--discussing any concerns you may have regarding the API terms of service.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing&nbsp;</strong>- I'll walk through the layers of the licensing stack for API operations, starting with server side code, ad extending to the content and data access via API operations, and the client code being put to use across all integrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The terms of service, privacy policy, and licensing will affect the business side of API operations. This area governs all other aspects of partner, and 3rd party integrations. These areas need to be well defined, providing clear guidance for developers who are integrating with the APIs being made available.</p>
<p><strong>Branding<br /></strong>As an extension of the legal department, let's also discuss branding for API operations. This is one of the most important of API operations but is often overlooked and under invested in when it comes to execution. Let's talk about a few of the common areas I'm seeing API providers deal with branding.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about goals, and existing branding efforts in place, then we put some thought into what should be in place to not just govern branding but encourage developers to help strengthen the brand and extend the reach.</li>
<li><strong>Assets&nbsp;</strong>- What image assets are in place to help developers understand branding, and easily extend the brand in their applications. Do not make developers work in this area, there need to be a wealth of resources that help them do this right.</li>
<li><strong>Requirements&nbsp;</strong>- Provide a structured set of branding requirements for developers. Let's discuss what some of the common approaches are depending on the implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Guides</strong>&nbsp;- Does it make sense to package up the branding requirements, and assets into a single guide, that developers can share with their team, and bake into their development process.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to generating value, branding is one of the most important tools in the API toolbox. Extending the network of your retail and online presence, through consistent implementation, execution of the brand is part of the API game. When done right, you can make a significant impact, and extend the reach and strength of a platform using APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery<br /></strong>Any moderately sized company will operate potentially hundreds, if not thousands of APIs, while also depending on tens&nbsp;or even hundreds of external APIs. The discovery of available resources, no matter where they are in the development life cycle is an important area to discuss and plan for.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Inventory&nbsp;</strong>- Taking what we discussed in the data and deployment areas of discussion, let's think about these raw sources as part of the wider API discovery discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Service Inventory&nbsp;</strong>- While this is a discussion about the future of APIs, I am guessing there are already a number of existing APIs in place from existing software and infrastructure in place, as well as the consumption of 3rd party Saas and cloud services.</li>
<li><strong>Schema&nbsp;</strong>- How can APIs be discovered&nbsp;using schema, and how can the schema of all data be well defined and reused using common formats like JSON schema.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Definitions&nbsp;</strong>- Along with schema how can API specifications like OpenAPI and APIs.json be applied to help define APIs, and make them more discoverable as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Search /&nbsp;</strong><strong>Catalog&nbsp;</strong>- Discovery will involve the presence of a catalog and other solutions for search APIs and schema applied.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Public API Search Engines / Directories</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a need for being listed in public API search engines and directories, helping bring awareness to the existence of API resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of API discovery will depend on the approach we take to define and design APIs deployed as part of API operations. API discovery is critical to this working, allowing internal, partner, and public consumers to find what they need, and properly integrate into their applications.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable<br /></strong>Defining where the code meets branding, I'd like to spend some time talking about embeddable tooling available as part of API operations. These are usually JavaScript goodies that leverage the API to help extend the reach of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- What types of embeddable are there? Let's discuss the simple examples like Twitter and Facebook share buttons, to the more sophisticated commerce, payment, or other API-enabled feature.</li>
<li><strong>Tools&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about what tooling is available for defining, customizing, and extending embeddable tooling, helping API consumers build the embeddable toling they need.</li>
<li><strong>Formats&nbsp;</strong>- Building on the API definition portion of this discussion, I want to make sure and discuss some of the open formats for developing embeddable tooling from oEmbed, to common data standards that help streamline the embedding of API tooling.</li>
</ul>
<p>The embeddable portion of operations will help put the branding for the platform into action. Giving developers tools, and other assets that they can put to work in their web and mobile applications, as well as signage, and retail experiences. The goal is to extend the reach of the platform to partner web, mobile, and device properties, with just a simple copy and paste when possible.</p>
<p><strong>Webhooks<br /></strong>It is common to think of APIs as just a one-way street -- allowing consumers to make requests and get responses. A common approach to making APIs a two-way street has emerged called web hooks. Allowing API consumers to define and subscribe to events, making API calls to locations they define, as part of regular API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core</strong>&nbsp;- Let's talk about what webhooks are, and how they are being put to use my leading API platform. While this isn't a standard, there are common practices in play that can help streamline setup and usage.</li>
<li><strong>Inbound&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about allowing for inbound webhooks, defining custom services that can receive requests, based upon specific events, and further define API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Outbound&nbsp;</strong>-- Additionally we will discuss the most common approaches to outbound webhooks that make calls and may push data to external URLs, based upon the occurrence of activities and events across the platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Webhooks help in&nbsp;alleviating the strain on API resources, reducing the number of calls an application will be making. Allowing applications to define and subscribe to events, and receive webhook notifications occur, such as new product shows up in catalog&nbsp;or a purchase is made.</p>
<p><strong>Orchestration<br /></strong>Let's spend some time discussing the platform orchestration opportunities. Outlining some of the other ways APIs are enabling the synchronization, interoperability, and integration between platforms, and applications used across the enterprise and by partners. &nbsp;These are the areas I'd like to help you be more aware of when it comes to API enabled orchestration of the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iPaaS&nbsp;</strong>- Availability of next generation ETL solutions like If This Then That and Zapier, allow any user to use APIs to orchestrate business processes, defining what APIs means to their regular work.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Integration&nbsp;</strong>- The evolution of development, making the whole develop stack API driven so that developers can not just access data and content, but they can use APIs to customize their access to resources.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets&nbsp;</strong>- APIs are being used to publish data to spreadsheets, making it available in business functions and reporting, while also making valuable spreadsheet data available for use as part of API deployment and operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>These areas represent how developers and average business users are putting APIs to use as part of regular IT and business operations. By providing API resources to internal and external users, individual users can be empowered to get things done on their own, within the structure of predefined governance and data and content access strategies. Many of these areas are available by default, just by having APIs available--the connectors for moving things around the web with iPaaS, weaving into continuous integration workflows, and spreadsheets are already available out there.</p>
<p><strong>Logging<br /></strong>A structured approach to logging of all API activity is essential to management, security, and the health of operations. It can also become another layer to API operations, as well as monetization, providing access to valuable aggregate, trending, and other valuable data derived from the exhaust of API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about the logging features present with existing infrastructure, and the API management layer of this conversation. Let's talk about the other opportunities involved when logging is API driven, providing programmatic access to every aspect of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>&nbsp;- In addition to the recording, and storage of log data let's talk about the analysis and reporting objectives around this data, as well as the privacy and security implications of logging at all layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the layer where we measure everything happening across API operations. It is the awareness of how resources are being accessed and used, provide the data needed to identify where value exists and generate revenue from all aspects operations. While logging should exist at all layers, from the&nbsp;server to client, it should be done sensibly, securely, and with as light of a footprint as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics / Visualization<br /></strong>Providing the meaningful layer on top of platform logging, I want to spend time talking about the analysis, reporting, and visualization requirements around API operations. What is needed to deliver required intelligence to dashboards, dynamic, and static reporting?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analytics&nbsp;</strong>- What analysis will be required of data, providing additional algorithmic layers of access beyond just the raw data behind API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong>&nbsp;- Providing visually derived meaning from all data gathered, and the analysis provided on top of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>&nbsp;- Let's makes sure that the analytics layer is all API driven, and the visualization layer is included as part of the embeddable API aspects of operations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>With this layer is developed as part of the overall embeddable API strategy for the platform, all the analysis, and visualizations will be embeddable in emails, other web or mobile applications, delivering insight, awareness, and intelligence wherever it is needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monetization<br /></strong>Now we are really getting into the business side of this discussion&nbsp;and begin talking about the nuts and bolts of generating revenue from API operations. Before we assemble an actual plan for generating revenue from operations, we need to discuss other aspects of investment in the platform, and how value is generated, or not generated.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquisition&nbsp;</strong>- What is required to acquire data and content, tracking the costs associated with licensing, royalties, or other aspects of discovering and acquiring data or content.</li>
<li><strong>Development&nbsp;</strong>- A breakdown of the costs involved with developing APIs, making data, content, or algorithms available as APIs, and accessible via the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Operation</strong>&nbsp;- Taking a look at what it will cost to operate an API, considering not just the technical, but also the business and legal side of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Value&nbsp;</strong>- Discussing the direct value of data, content, media, and other resources being made available via APIs, exploring the tangible and known value present.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Value&nbsp;</strong>- Thinking a little about the indirect value generated by APIs, like traffic to&nbsp;website&nbsp;or maybe brand awareness, bringing value to the table, but not direct revenue generation.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting&nbsp;</strong>- What are some of the reporting requirements present around investment into API operations. Understanding and sharing awareness around what it takes to create, and operate an API platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll think about monetization from the big picture, but also down to the individual API level--understand what it takes to operate any single API, as well as how they support overall objectives. Without an awareness of what it takes to develop and operate each available API, we will never fully be able to determine the return on investment from any plan we establish.</p>
<p><strong>Plans<br /></strong>With a general awareness of what it will take to develop and operate APIs, we can start planning a little more about how access tiers will be defined, what will be charged for API access, and even what might be paid for incentivizing access to some API resources. I would like to discuss many of the common aspects of how API plans are being operated by the most successful providers like Amazon, Google, and others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Let's spend some time discussing how API plans operate. Thinking about the variety of ways APIs can be mixed, matched, and a variety of access levels can be defined to maximize access and usage, while also generating revenue in a sensible way.</li>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>&nbsp;- What are the elements of API access? What other elements are present like support, and specific features are present--further defining what is included beyond just API access.</li>
<li><strong>Timeframes</strong>&nbsp;- What timeframes impact API access plans. What considerations are there per month, day, or possibly by the second? Let's think through the timeframes that drive API plans.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics&nbsp;</strong>- What is being measured as part of each plan level? By the API call, amount of storage, or measuring bandwidth. There are many different metrics to be defined, depending on the resource available, and the monetization objective in play.</li>
<li><strong>Geo&nbsp;</strong>- With cloud computing advances there are many possibilities for additional monetization layers to API plans that include geographically deployed APIs, and in-country services depending on laws and regulatory climate.</li>
<li><strong>Limits</strong>&nbsp;- Let's look to define the limits of each plan, talking about what types of constraints can be put in place to incentivize desired behavior, and drive revenue in an appropriate direction.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>&nbsp;- Let's spend some time thinking about individual API access, and the monetization opportunities involved with different levels of access--this is widely known as service composition, providing different layers of access based upon business objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Extensions -</strong>&nbsp;What opportunities are there for an extension? Can plans be extended and overreached either by usage or possibly paying for preferred treatment--let's think about what the boundaries are.</li>
</ul>
<p>API plans aren't just for public access to APIs, they can be crafted specifically for enterprise level and partner access needs. They can also be established internal consumption, defining the access levels and usage across teams, or geographic locations. API plans aren't just for defining, and charging for API access, they should also be used to measure value created, and possibly defining cash payouts to partners, affiliates, and resellers, encouraging the desired behavior across all API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Partners<br /></strong>Beyond the basic plans, I wanted to discuss the higher levels of access, providing tiers of access that are usually not metered, or limited, providing special considerations for trusted partners. There are a number of common approaches to helping enable partner integrations, driving the overall objectives of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Program Details&nbsp;</strong>- What existing partner efforts exist? What are the details of existing data or content acquisition or consumption? Beyond the basic levels of access, what should we be thinking about?</li>
<li><strong>Access Levels&nbsp;</strong>- What are the partner level considerations to discuss? Are partners given early or exclusive access to resources? There are many ways to leverage the reading or writing of data and include them as part of partner program incentives.</li>
<li><strong>Legal&nbsp;</strong>- What are the individual legal concerns with partner levels of access. Existing contracts in place, and the existing API-related data or content partnerships that might drive API access tier considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing Activities&nbsp;</strong>- Are there a specific marketing or advertising considerations that might impact partner access, providing special promotions and other activities to drive integration and partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Support&nbsp;</strong>- What levels of support are given to partner API access levels, and support the overall program. Support is commonly given to the entire community, with an emphasis on preferred or unpaid support for partners.</li>
<li><strong>Content&nbsp;</strong>- What content opportunities are there for partners to participate in. Weaving their messaging into existing marketing and advertising activities, and demonstrate the API integration or application fueling the partnership.</li>
<li><strong>Communication&nbsp;</strong>- What are the additional layers of API operations communication strategy that are focused on partner activity? Some portions of the execution might be dedicated to partners, while others have a general focus.</li>
<li><strong>Financial&nbsp;</strong>- What are the financial reporting, and tracking needs for partner levels of access, measuring their usage of resources, revenue sharing, or collection?</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>&nbsp;- Will there be an API for the partner program? Allowing for programmatic access to program details, activities, support, content, communication, and other elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three main areas of API access companies are thinking about are internal, partner, and the&nbsp;general public. Partner tends to drive a significant portion of the efforts especially early on until providers gain the expertise and platform maturity necessary to successfully operate a fully public API platform. A well-defined partner access can provide the momentum needed to extend the platform's resources to a wider audience in a way that furthers a company mission.</p>
<p><strong>Evangelism / Outreach / Inreach<br /></strong>Last I want to discuss the evangelism, outreach, and what I like to call reach around API operations. Successful API operations have advocates, evangelists, and dedicated resources to helping spread the word about APIs, supporting the needs of consumers, and ensure there is a feedback loop around everything happening. There are some common approaches established by leading providers when it comes to API outreach.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/t-shirts/KL_InApiWeTrust-1000.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>&nbsp;- Let's start again with the basics. What are our goals in doing APIs, and wanting to take an API-first approach to internal, and partner operations?</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Outreach</strong>&nbsp;- What&nbsp;can be done to reach out to the developer community, and join the existing API community, to drive integration with the platform?</li>
<li><strong>Partner Outreach&nbsp;</strong>- What separate outreach is required for partners, maintaining relationships, and establishing a feedback loop for the future of platform operations?</li>
<li><strong>Landscape Analysis</strong>&nbsp;- What research has been done regarding existing, competitive, or possibly complementary API programs, maybe as part of existing efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Communications</strong>&nbsp;- Let's take the communication strategy and think of it in terms of reaching new users, and spreading awareness of the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Support&nbsp;</strong>- Let's also talk about how support should be woven into outreach strategies, using publicly available platforms that bring SEO exposure for the platform.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub&nbsp;</strong>- When it comes to managing code, and API operations many providers lean on Github for code management, as well as social engagement with the developer community.</li>
<li><strong>Social Management&nbsp;</strong>- Successful API efforts engage with consumers via the social channels they are already operating on, including Github, Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong>&nbsp;- What does the event landscape look like for the platform? What conferences, meetups, or hackathons can be attended, or hosted. Is there a calendar available to the community to deepen the engagement with the community.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboard</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a private, or even public dashboard for outreach to begin, providing links to all outreach across operations, all reporting, and community activity?</li>
<li><strong>Reporting&nbsp;</strong>- What regular reporting occurs around outreach, keeping stakeholders informed, and aware--let's discuss how important reporting is to keeping stakeholders invested.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outreach is about connecting the feedback loop around API operations. It all starts over again with the feedback gathered at this level. You take this back to the definition layer, enrich your approach, dial in the design of new and existing API efforts, and do it all again. It is touch to articulate and convey the cyclical aspects of API operations, and how companies get better at it with each wave, if they invest in the right areas. API operations are much more than a technical, IT, developer effort--in 2017, it is more about business and people&nbsp;than it ever is about just the data.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Strategy<br /></strong>This is the framework for an API operational strategy. I don't expect you to have all the answers for everything here. It is just meant to help guide our discussion, and provide a framework that we can organize and hang details on for you to take home and consider as part of your team's strategy. Hopefully, this outline provides you with a primer for our&nbsp;discussion. It might seem like a lot, but we should be able to get through in a couple hours, then we can think about the draft of this document for you to take back to your company.</p>

<p>There is a reason why I encourage API providers to look at not just the technology of APIs&nbsp;but also invest heavily into the business and politics of API operations. There is a reason I evangelize a more open, web-based approach to doing APIs, even if you are peddling hardware and device APIs. It is because there are a number of human-centered elements present when doing APIs, that will&nbsp;define your services, and ultimately contribute to whether or not they are a success&nbsp;or a failure.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cepro.com/article/new_sonos_api_disrupts_home_automation_integration_but_lays_solid_foundatio">One example of this from my API news curation archives is from the Sonos API ecosystem, and a pretty big blunder in communication the audio device platform made late last year, that is significantly impacting their partnerships in 2017.</a> &nbsp;Directly from the CEPro article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A collective cheer roared from home-technology installers at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/cedia">CEDIA Expo 2016</a>, when&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/article/sonos_now_integrates_for_real_iport_and_lutron_launch_new_sonos_controls">Sonos announced an API</a>&nbsp;for home-automation integration starting with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Control4">Control4</a>&nbsp;(Nasdaq:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ctrl">CTRL</a>),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Crestron">Crestron</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/iPort">iPort</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Lutron">Lutron</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Savant">Savant</a>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>These partners &ndash; and most other respectable smart-home systems providers &ndash; have integrated with Sonos for many years, albeit with unsanctioned drivers created through reverse-engineering of a fairly straightforward UPnP-based protocol.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But the new API kind of snuck up on dealers and vendors alike, with their customers waking up to a brand new&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Sonos">Sonos</a>&nbsp;experience in late December, courtesy of an auto-update by Sonos.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The new experience was inferior to the original, with users unable to access Spotify or Amazon Music from the home automation system, except to select favorites created through Sonos&rsquo;s own app.</em></p>
<p>When you are operating an API that many different businesses depend on, communication is essential. this is why I advocate that API providers always have a clear communication and support strategy, as well as the road map, issue management, and change log processes. Every single change has to be considered for its impact on the community, and you have to have a plan for how you will be communicating and supporting&nbsp;your API consumers needs around a change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also why API providers should be understanding the benefits of hypermedia when it comes to change management. Hypermedia design patterns provide you with a more honest approach to dealing change, one that helps make your partner's clients more fault tolerant. It is well worth the time learning about the handful of leading hypermedia media types. Any one of them would have helped Sonos manage change.</p>
<p>There are multiple tools in the API toolbox to help you manage change. In the en,d the most effective tools involve human to human interaction, and actually talking to your partners early on about change, and making sure you have a robust communication strategy throughout your API lifecycle. Us engineers like to think it is the API technology making the magic happen, but in the end, there is more to this than just having application programming interfaces, it is about also having the right human interfaces.</p>

<p>I am finally seeing more solutions available for API providers when it comes to publishing an portal for their API operations. <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">I've long had my minimum viable API portal definition</a>, which I recently <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/02/my-developer-portal-checklist-for-a-human-services-api/">deployed to support the Miami Open211 API</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">I also wrote about AWS serverless approach to an API portal</a>. Next up, is <a href="https://tyk.io/2017/03/01/new-wordpress-api-portal-plugin/">a WordPress solution from my API management partner Tyk</a>.</p>
<p>The WordPress API portal solution has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic developer registration on Tyk when developers sign up in WP</li>
<li>Configuration of API policies available for token registration</li>
<li>Developers may request an access token for the available API policies</li>
<li>Automatic or manual approval of key requests</li>
<li>Storage of token (references) by name and API policy</li>
<li>Revoking of tokens by developer</li>
<li>Display usage statistics per key</li>
<li>Request quota usage per key</li>
</ul>
<p>All the basics you need when standing up a basic API operation. If WordPress is your go-to content management system, then it might make sense for you to think about API portal&nbsp;in these terms. The<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/">Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS)</a>&nbsp;is already using the plugin&nbsp;in production, and you can <a href="https://github.com/liip/wp-tyk-dev-portal">download the plugin on Github</a>, or find it <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tyk-developer-portal/">over at WordPress.org</a>.</p>
<p>We need multiple versions of API portals like this, designed for every type of platform a company, organization, institution, and government agency might be already using as a default platform for their operations. This is why API management providers <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/27/the-api-definition-for-the-tyk-api-gateway/">need to follow Tyk's&nbsp;lead and make sure your solution is API driven</a>--practicing what you preach so that your API management solution can be integrated anywhere.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/grpc.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/03/google-shares-their-api-design-guide/">I have been processing Google's API design guide</a>, and an unexpected part of the work has been learning more about gRPC, which Google is&nbsp;<span>"converging designs of socket-based RPC APIs with HTTP-based REST APIs." -- something I have not seen in an API design guide until now. "<span>gRPC uses&nbsp;</span><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">protocol buffers</a><span>&nbsp;as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) for describing both the service interface and the structure of the payload messages", and is something I'm hearing more chatter about from larger providers, which I think represents the evolving world of API design beyond the old REST days.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.grpc.io/docs/">According to the site</a>, "gRPC is used in last mile of computing in mobile and web client since it can generate libraries for iOS and Android and uses standards based HTTP/2 as transport allowing it to easily traverse proxies and firewalls. There is also work underway to develop a JS library for use in browsers. Beyond that, it is ideal as a microservices interconnect, not just because the core protocol is very efficient but also because the framework has pluggable authentication, load balancing etc. Google itself is also transitioning to use it to connect microservices."</p>
<p>To help me learn anything I need an example to reverse engineer, showing me how things work--so here are the examples they provide from the site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-bigtable-client">Google Cloud BigTable Client APIs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/03/announcing-grpc-alpha-for-google-cloud-pubsub">Google Cloud PubSub APIs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech/reference/rpc/">Google Cloud Speech APIs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to add a research area for gRPC, similar to <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a>, as well as GraphQL. It helps me better keep track of the&nbsp;news&nbsp;about each approach to crafting APIs, and a single place I can go to reference service providers, and working examples. I've had gRPC / Protocol Buffers on my monitoring list for some time now, but seeing Google invest so heavily in this area gives me a signal that I should be paying attention to gRPC more, and gathering more examples that I can share with my readers.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that I will assemble some sort of toolbox area in my API design research, helping folks understand when a more RESTful approach makes sense, as well as when hypermedia, GraphQL, or maybe a gRPC approach might be more appropriate. Next, I'm going to dive into BigTable, PubSub, and Speech APIs to see gRPC in action--something I'm hoping that will help me better understand <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/03/google-shares-their-api-design-guide/">Google's approach to API design</a>, which something I'm struggling with grasping completely.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_04_at_10.46.01_pm.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://apis.guru/browse-apis/">I am building on the great work by the APIs.guru team</a>, assembling a collection of Google definitions. I will be forking their Google Open definitions and wrap them in <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json indexes</a>, so I can analyze the APIs at the 100K level, and potentially augment, and enrich the existing OpenAPIs that the APIs.guru team has worked so hard on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When APIs.guru crafts an OpenAPI for an API, they have a set of OpenAPI extensions that&nbsp;provides a snapshot of the history for each OpenAPI. They provide six OpenAPI extensions, specific to their API discovery objectives:</p>
<blockquote>x-apiClientRegistration:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://console.developers.google.com'<br /> x-logo:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/material/product/2x/blogger_64dp.png'<br /> x-origin:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;format: google<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/blogger/v3/rest'<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;version: v1<br /> x-preferred: true<br /> x-providerName: googleapis.com<br /> x-serviceName: blogger</blockquote>
<p>I like that they include the origin of thier API definitions. I want to do the same, but I would like to turn x-origin into a collection so that I can add multiple entries into it, and evolve it beyond just origin. I want to show the provenance for the API definition, that I build mine on top of APIs.guru's hard work, and that they built theirs on Google's using their discovery format. I'm going to add x-provenance to mine&nbsp;and start tracking on the source of where my API definitions originate and include anything else present when I imported.</p>
<p>It is important that we are able to have many different copies of an API's definition, in a variety of formats. There will be copies of API definitions all over Github, and the web, for a variety of different purposes. I'd like to see more stewards of API definitions include some sort of origin, provenance, and history for their API definitions. If they are yours, they are authoritative and it isn't necessary, but if they are for 3rd party APIs, try to capture as much information as you can about where it comes from, to help everyone understand it's history.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">This is a repeat story of one I&nbsp;wrote two years ago</a>, but things haven't changed so I'm going to rant about again, 2017 style. We need someone to develop an open source, visual API design editor. There is the <a href="http://swagger.io/swagger-editor/">Swagger Editor</a>, but that is more a web IDE, and I'm looking for a well designed, intuitive, visual editor for managing your OpenAPI definitions, that is embeddable and easily integrated into any web or mobile system.</p>
<p>There are examples of nice visual API design editors with some of the leading API service providers, but I'm looking for something any API service provider could put to work. I included these examples in my last story, except I'm including Stoplight this round instead of Gelato, because they gave me an upgrade my account message,&nbsp;and wouldn't let me see the interface. These are currently my favorite three API design editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://studio.restlet.com">Restlet</a>&nbsp;- A design, deployment, management service provider.</li>
<li><a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>&nbsp; - An SDK, API definition transformer, and continous integration provider.</li>
<li><a href="https://stoplight.io">Stoplight</a>&nbsp;- An API design, definition, documentation, and orchestration provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoy using all three of their API design interfaces. They are well thought out&nbsp;and provide what you need to design new APIs, as well manage the design of your existing APIs. While they are doing a good job at this, it is something I'd like to see standardized, and open sourced, so that other service providers do not have to reinvent the wheel here. We shouldn't have to use a different API design interface for each service we depend on, we need a common editor, making things more familiar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, rant over. This is something I'll keep talking about until there is a solution. Oh, I have to say, I am impressed with what <a href="http://getmateria.com">the Materia&nbsp;team</a> has done for API design on the desktop. Between them and Stoplight, there has been positive motion forward. I'm just looking to give things another nudge and help folks understand the opportunity. I'll explore possible business models for such a solution in another post, and keep beating this drum until I get what I want.</p>

<p>Everyone developing APIs struggles with API design. Ok, maybe a few of the gurus out there don't, but the rest of us need education, practice, and ideally someone or something to help guide us through the best practices when it comes to API design. I try to track what different companies are doing when it comes to API design, and <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools/design-guides/">maintain a list of any API design guides I come across in my work</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking to start getting a grasp on API design at your company, organization, institution or agency, I recommend starting on the journey to define your own API design guide--you will be surprised what you can learn along the way. You can kick things off by visiting my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design research</a>, but I strongly recommend you head over <a href="http://apistylebook.com/">to the API Stylebook</a>, and build on this important work.</p>
<p>My friend Arnaud has <a href="http://apistylebook.com/design/guidelines/">aggregated 12 of the leading API design guides out there</a> and is currently processing Google's API design guide, adding more knowledge&nbsp;to the repository. <a href="http://apistylebook.com/design/topics/">He takes each API design guide and breaks them down into common API design topics that you can consider as part of your own process, and resulting guide.</a> His work is all <a href="https://github.com/arno-di-loreto/apistylebook.com">machine readable and forkable</a> so that you can easily assemble your own guide, and get to work learning, defining, and refining--then you can submit your guide to the API Stylebook when you are ready.</p>
<p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design</a> and <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> are the top two most trafficked areas of my website in 2017, and most of 2016. API design is top of mind for API providers who are further along in their journey, and the ones who are seriously rocking it usually have some sort of guide, helping keep things consistent. If you need any help, feel free to reach out. I am not an API design expert, but I know my way around the finer details, and concepts at play, and I'm happy to help where I can. I know Arnaud is happy to answer questions as well, and if nothing else, let me help tell the story of your API design journey so that others can learn from it.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/02/dreaming-of-a-more-modular-event-driven-api-monetization/">I was dreaming of a more modular, event-driven approach to API monetization</a>&nbsp;the other day, and I found myself thinking more about the motivations behind each API call made, from the perspective of both the consumer and the provider. With this story I am just thinking about just the POST, or how we usually add something to a system via API--this is not always the case, but it is the common usage of the verb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have any numbers to support this, but the majority of APIs I encounter are GET only. The more mature API platforms have diverse stacks, using their verbs, but when companies are just getting going with their API operations, they rarely use POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. When it comes to having APIs, and incentivizing developers to generate some&nbsp;value using APIs, it seems like a company wants to encourage the creation of valuable data and content.</p>
<p>I was talking with Lufthansa Airlines the other day, and one of the things that they said to me that stood out&nbsp;when we were talking about the different APIs available, was that none of them matter if someone doesn't buy (POST) a ticket. Today, while on the phone with one of my partners, they asked if they could put my industry guides behind a lead generation form--something I allow my partners do. However, I wish more of them had a POST path for me to submit new leads, share stories, topics, and other times, for a variety of reasons--I promise would help generate value with each API call.</p>
<p>With this work I am ramping up for my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">API monetization</a> and <a href="http://plan.apievangelist.com">API plan</a> research, thinking about the bigger picture of how we generate value, as well as make money doing all of this. I guess that I am just lamenting the stagnation of how APIs are being designed, and deployed, with any sensible or even creative monetization strategies. To help me get through this I am going to think about what is important in my world operating API Evangelist. How I can create API endpoints for directly generating value in these areas. Things like adding a news article, sharing a story, asking questions, and other seeds of value in my world--then maybe I can provide some examples to help clarify what I'm talking about.</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/">Google released an API design guide recently</a>. I'll be adding the design guide to the list of examples I have in <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools/design-guides/">my API design research</a>. The Google API design guide is pretty straight forward in its purpose, with a goal of helping, "developers design&nbsp;<strong>simple, consistent and easy-to-use</strong>&nbsp;networked APIs", but I thought it was noteworthy that they were also looking to help "converging designs of socket-based RPC APIs with HTTP-based REST APIs."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC and Protocol Buffers</a> has been on my task list to learn more about for a while now, but without any projects at scale, it's probably not a task I'll find much time for anytime soon. I'll try to carve off more time to learn how folks like Google are doing it, through their guides and storytelling. One thing I did know, which Google reinforces is that"many companies use socket-based RPC APIs to carry most network traffic, which can be orders of magnitude higher than public REST APIs."</p>
<p>I like&nbsp;their approach that, "both RPC APIs and HTTP REST APIs are needed for various reasons. Ideally, an API platform should provide best support for all APIs". They also provide a note that "This Design Guide explains how to apply REST principles to API designs independent of programming language, operating system, or network protocol. It is NOT a guide solely to creating REST APIs." I like this because we are getting past the notion that API design is simply about REST--it is clearly evolving to be more about getting the work&nbsp;done&nbsp;than any single philosophy or dogma.</p>
<p><a href="http://apistylebook.com/">In addition to encouraging more API providers to craft an API design guide for their companies using API Stylebook</a>, and sharing their API design guides with the public, I will also be encouraging companies to think beyond just REST when they consider their API design best practices. I'm hoping that more companies will continue to do the hard work of getting their API design house in order&nbsp;because that means they can also begin to think about best practices when it comes to API deployment, management, testing, and the other stops along the API life cycle.</p>

<p>There have been many advances in the way that we deploy APIs in the last couple of years, but I still want more of an embeddable, push botton way to deploy generic or even more specialized APIs. This is something I've ranted about before, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">asking where the deploy to AWS and Google buttons</a>. I'm seeing more AWS solutions emerge, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">helping deploy from Github using AWS Codeploy</a>, and the regular number of deploy to Heroku buttons, but not the real growth I'd like to see occur--making it a drum I will keep beating&nbsp;until I get what I want.</p>
<p>I was working <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">on my OpenAPI toolbox</a>, cataloging <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">open source tools that put the OpenAPI specification to work</a>, and came across a deploy with Heroku button for the <a href="https://github.com/sethherr/grape-doorkeeper/">Grape Doorkeeper</a>, which helps you<em> "create an awesome versioned API, secured with OAuth2 and automatically documented"</em>. This should be the&nbsp;default for all server-side API deployment frameworks, allowing push button deployment of any open source API framework to the cloud platform of your choosing.</p>
<p>If I have my way, it won't just be API frameworks that will have deployment buttons. Specialized API designs, available in a variety of frameworks will be available for deployment with a single click of a button. We should be able to deploy a product API, or a user API, to AWS, Heroku, Google, or Microsoft, with a single click. There should be a wealth of open source templates for us to choose from on Github, with deploy buttons, and easy to follow wizards that help us set things up properly.</p>
<p>Smells like an opportunity to me. I'll have to think more about where the revenue would come from in such a model, but I'm sure it would be easy enough to upsell deployments to some premium features and services. I understand that both the areas of API design and API deployment are playing catch-up with API management at the moment, but someone needs to get to work on streamlining the API deployment button experience across all major cloud platforms&nbsp;and get to work on crafting some useful API server deployments that people can put to work instantly. #please #thankyou</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/02/my-developer-portal-checklist-for-a-human-services-api/">My Developer Portal Checklist For A Human Services API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_01_at_9.03.53_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was handed the URL for a human services API implementation for Miami. It was my job to now deploy a portal, documentation, and other supporting resources for the API implementation. This project is part of the work I'm doing with <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a> to help push forward the API conversation around the human services data specification (HSDS).</p>
<p><a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">I got to work forking my minimum viable API portal definition</a>, to provide a doorway for the <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/">Miami Open211 API</a>. &nbsp;Next, I got to work on setting up a basic presence for the human services API. I started with giving the portal a title, and a basic description of what the service does, then I got to work on each of the portal elements that will help people put the data to work.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong><br />It can be hard to cut through what you need to get going with an API&nbsp;and cut through all the information available. The portal has a <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/getting-started/">getting started page</a> providing a basic introduction, a handful of links to the documentation, code, and where to get help--<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-getting-started.yaml">the page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br />I included an <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/authentication/">authentication page</a> to make it clear that the API is publicly available, but also provide a placeholder to explain that we will be opening up write access to the organizations, locations, and services that are being made available--<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-authentication.yaml">the page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong><br />Next, I wanted to always have the most <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/frequently-asked-questions/">frequently asked questions</a> front and center where anyone can find it. I am using this page as a default place to publish any questions asked via Github, Twitter, or email. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-frequently-asked-questions.yaml">The page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br /><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/documentation/">Now for the documentation</a>, the most important piece of the puzzle. I published a <a href="https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/basics">Liquid</a> documentation driven by <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">the OpenAPI for the API</a>. With a little bit of JavaScript voodoo,&nbsp;I was able to make the documentation interactive so that you can actually try out each path, and see the JSON response--the documentation is driven by the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/apis.yaml">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">OpenAPI</a> for the API.</p>
<p><strong>Code Samples</strong><br />After completing the OpenAPI definition for the API documentation, I used the machine-readable definition to generate code samples using <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">swagger code-gen</a>. I <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/code/">published C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby code samples</a> to help developers get started with their projects. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/client-sdks">All the language samples are published to a separate Github </a><a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/client-sdks">repository</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-code.yaml">the page is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Postman Collection</strong><br />To help jumpstart integration, <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/postman_collection.json">I also generated and published a Postman Collection</a>, so that anyone can quickly import it into their client, and get to work playing with the API in their environment. You can do this with OpenAPI also, but Postman helps extend the possibilities--<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/postman_collection.json">the Postman Collection is editable via its Github page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Road Map</strong><br />Next, I published a <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/road-map/">road map</a> so we could share what is next for the project, providing a list where developers can stay in tune with what is going to happen. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22road+map%22">The road map entries are pulled from the Github issues for any entry with the road map label</a>. There is a script that can be run regularly to keep the issues in sync with the roadmap, and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-road-map.yaml">page is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Issues</strong><br />Similar to the road map, <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/issues/">I created a page for sharing any open Github issues</a>, that are <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aissues">labeled 'issues'</a>, to help communicate outstanding and known issues with the platform. It stays in sync using the same script, and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-issues.yaml">page&nbsp;is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Change Log</strong><br />In addition to a road map and known issues, when these items get accomplished or fixed <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/change-log/">they get moved to the change log</a>, keeping a complete history of everything that has changed with the platform.&nbsp;It stays in sync using the same script, and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-change-log.yaml">page&nbsp;is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Status Page</strong><br />Beyond the resources to get up and running with documentation, code samples, and a road map, issues, and change log to stay in tune with the platform, <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/status/">I wanted a status page keeping an eye on things</a>. I signed up for a monitoring service called <a href="http://apiscience.com/">API Science</a> (which I highly recommend), and imported the OpenAPI definition, and had monitors to keep an eye on things and make sure the API stays up. The page is generated from an&nbsp;embeddable JavaScript widget&nbsp;and is updated using the API Science API.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong><br /><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/terms-of-service/">For the terms of service</a>, I just grabbed an open source copy from Wikidot, providing a baseline place to start when it comes to the TOS for the API-<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/terms-of-service/index.html">the terms of service is editable via its Github page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br />Similar to the terms of service&nbsp;I just grabbed an <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/privacy-policy/">open source privacy policy from Wikidot</a>, providing a baseline place to start when it comes to a <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/privacy-policy/">privacy policy for the API</a>-<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/privacy-policy/index.html">the privacy policy is editable via its Github page</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Developer Blog</strong><br /><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/blog/">The blog for the project</a> is driven by the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll framework</a> for <a href="https://pages.github.com/">the developer portal hosted on Github Pages</a>. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/tree/master/_posts">To manage the blog entries, you just add or update pages in the _posts folder for the website</a>. All entries in the _post folder are listed in chronological order on the blog page for the developer portal.</p>
<p><strong>Github</strong><br />This developer portal runs 100% on Github and leverages the potential of Jekyll when running on Github. The API is hosted on Heroku and run by someone else, but the developer portal is a static website, completely editable via Github through the web interface, API, or locally with the desktop client. Github also provides much of the support framework for the project, driving the roadmap, issues, change log, and 1/3 of the support options for developers--the entire site is driven from the _data store, with the website just being a Liquid-driven Jekyll template.</p>
<p><strong>OpenAPI</strong><br /><a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">This developer portal is defined by its OpenAPI definition</a>. It drives the documentation, generated the code samples, fired up the API Science monitors, and is the central contract defining the APIs operation. I will be keeping the OpenAPI up to date, and using it as the central truth for the API and its operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>APIs.json</strong><br /><a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/apis.yaml">The portal is entirely indexed using APIs.json</a>, providing a single machine-readable definition of the API and its operations. All the supporting pages of the API are linked to in the index, and their contents&nbsp;and data are all machine-readable YAML and JSON. The APIs.json provides access to the OpenAPI which describes the surface area of the API, as well as providing links to all it's supporting operations.</p>
<p><strong>What Is Next?</strong><br />I'm going to put things down for a couple days. We still need some FAQs entered, and the content needs fluffing up and editing. Then we'll invite other folks to take a look at. Then I will get to work on the POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE paths, and once those are certified I will push as part of the OpenAPI, regenerate the code samples, and turn on the ability for people to get involved not just reading data, but also potentially adding and updating data in the database--making things a group effort.</p>
<p>I'm going to take what I have here, and fork it into a new project, making it a baseline demo portal for <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a>. My goal is to have a downloadable, forkable API portal that is well documented, and anyone providing an HSDS compliant API can put to use for their project. I just wanted to take a moment and gather my thoughts on what I did and share the approach I took with you.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>I used to have a Github repository dedicated to Swagger tooling and implementations, but I took it down after Swagger was donated to the Linux Foundation. I've rebooted it as <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">my OpenAPI Toolbox</a>, providing <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox">a single Github repository for managing an active list of open source tooling built on top of the OpenAPI specification</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a snapshot of my toolbox of <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>-driven solutions, as it stands today. This site is a Jekyll-driven website running on Github, using Github Pages. The tools in this toolbox are driven by a YAML file in <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/tree/master/_data">the _data folder for this repository</a>, with the HTML pages driven using Liquid.</p>
<p>Here are the tools organized by type of implementation (something that is evolving quickly):</p>

<p>This project is <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox">forkable using the Github repository</a>, and <a href="/data/tools.json">accessible as JSON</a>. If you have a tool you think should be added, or there is something that needs fixing, <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/issues">you can submit an issue on the Github repository</a>, or submit a pull request. It is meant to be a community project, designed to be forkable, shareable, and machine-readable.</p>
<p>I've just started adding the tools I have in my database. I only have 37 so far, but will be adding more as I have time. Once I have it up to date, I will start thinking about other ways to slice and dice the tools, to better understand what is being built on the OpenAPI specification, what tools are being built on the upcoming 3.0 version, as well as working to identify where the gaps and opportunities are for developing tooling.</p>
