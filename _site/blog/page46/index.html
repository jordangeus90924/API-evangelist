        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://addb.absolutdrinks.com/docs/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/absolut/absolut-vodka.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you read my blog regularly, you know I am constantly pushing the boundaries of how I see the API space, and sometimes my ramblings can be pretty out there, but API Evangelist is how I work through these thoughts out loud, and hopefully bring them down to a more sane, practical level that everyone can understand.</p>
<p>My crazy vision for the day centers around <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stack</a> composition, as beautiful as the <a href="https://addb.absolutdrinks.com/docs/">Absolut Drinks Database API</a>. Ok, before you can even begin to get up to speed with my crazy rant, you need to be following some of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">my rants around using virtual cloud containers like we are seeing from docker, AWS and OpenShift</a>, and you need to watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXk1dvLKl-U">video from APIStrategy &amp; Practice about Absolut Drink Databse API deployment</a>.</p>
<p><em>Ok, you up to speed? Are you with me now?</em></p>
<p>Today, as I was playing around with the deployment of granular API resources using AWS CloudFormations, I was using their CloudFormer tool, that allows me to browse through ALL of my AWS cloud resources (ie. DNS, EC2 Servers, S3 Storage, RDS Databases), and assemble them into a CloudFormation Templates, which is just a JSON definition of this stack I&rsquo;m going to generate.</p>
<p>Immediately I think of the presentation from Absolut, and how they spent years assembling the image and video parts and pieces that went into the 3500 drinks they wanted available via their API, for developers to use when developing interactive cocktail apps. They had 750 images, and video clips, with a combination of 30K mixing steps, that went into the generation of the 3500 drink combinations. * mind blown *</p>
<p>Now give me this same approach but for composing virtual API stacks, instead of cocktails. With this approach you could define individual API resources such as <a href="http://products.apievangelist.com/">product API</a> or <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>. These are all independent API resources, with open source server and client side code, openly licensed interface via <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, and virtual container definitions for both AWS CloudFormations and OpenShift.</p>
<p>Imagine if I have hundreds of high value, individual API resources available to me when composing a virtual stack. I could easily compose exactly the stack my developers need, composed of new and existing API resources. I wouldn&rsquo;t be restricted to building directly on top of existing data stores or APIs, I could <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/16/external-api-deployments-using-sync-one-possible-future-of-government-api-deployments/">deploy external API deployments that depend on sync to stay up to date</a>, providing the performance levels I demand from my API stack--I could mix virtual API stacks, like I would a cocktail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhoooo, that is my rant for now. I&rsquo;ll finish doing the work for deploying AWS CloudFormation and OpenShift containers for my screen capture API, rounding of all the architectural components I outlined in my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">API operational harness</a>, and then rant some more.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my rant. I hope it made some sense! ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-harness.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am evolving my own approach to deploying my API resources, and I needed an important sounding name for it, so came up with &ldquo;operational harness&rdquo; over a couple pints of IPAs. Ok, so what do I mean when I say operational harness?</p>
<p>Based upon the way that I evolve my stories, I evolve my API projects in real-time with the help of Github. For my screen capture API I will be focusing on delivering four separate architectural pieces:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Open Source Version -</strong> An open source, server implementation of my screen capture API, which will PHP initially with other languages next.</li>
<li><strong>API Service -</strong> A publicly accessible, cloud version of the screen capture API, allowing users to a certain amount of calls in a specific time frame before they are charged a per call rate, depending on their service their. </li>
<li><strong>API Containers - </strong>OpenShift and AWS CloudFormation version of the screen capture API for rapid deployment in cloud environment.</li>
<li><strong>Wholesale Service - </strong>A wholesale version of the screen capture that a partner can pay me to deploy and / or manage in mine or theirs cloud environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I call this my operational harness because I will be operating live instances of these components, scaling as I need in the cloud, but will also be maintaining the open source version, and container versions on Github, while also supporting wholesale deployment. &nbsp;My definition will act as a sort of harness holding together all the architectural pieces of the screenshot API, but also in sync with other utility APIs I will be deploying--helping guide me as I push it all forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying putting together my strategy around my own API platform. It gives me some good material to work through for stories here on the blog, and helps me push forward with new approaches to API deployment, like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">deploying and scaling in virtual containers</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">providing wholesale access to resources</a>.</p>

<p>Its nice to hear more discussion about the evolution of deploying API resources and micro services, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">use of virtual containers from Docker, OpenShift and Cloud Formations</a>&mdash;especially since its a topic <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/traffic-and-weather--virtualized-api-stacks/">Traffic and Weather and API Evangelist have discussed before</a>. ;-)</p>
<p>Seriously though, they put on a good show, forward thinking API conversation, with lots of humor and not-so-funny humor mixed in. I always recommend listening when you have time, you might learn a thing or two about APIs along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Tip: If it sounds like the show is almost over, it is. Turn off the podcast.</em></p>

<p>I look at a lot of API developers areas in my work, and the first sign I see that nobody is home behind an API, is that their blog is out of date.</p>
<p>I found myself at the <a href="http://developer.espn.com/blog">ESPN developer center</a> last night, clicked on the blog, which has a great tag line of &ldquo;API-focused musings and rambling&rdquo;, but alas hasn't been updated in over a year.</p>
<p>Your API developer blog posts do not have to be anything master planned, and should just be thoughts from the daily life of running your API. A little effort goes a long way on your API developer blog, and when it becomes out of date, it also will send a strong signal to developers&mdash;nobody is home, don&rsquo;t use this API.</p>
<p>Make sure your API-focused musing and ramblings occur more than once very year, I know that personally I need it daily, but maybe you need it a little less frequent. ;-)</p>

<p>Its not often I find myself referencing Cisco when it comes to shedding light on interesting practices for the API space, but today is not your usual day.</p>
<p>At some point yesterday, I found myself at cisco.com, and I stumbled across their <a href="http://socialmedia.cisco.com/">social page</a>, which gives equal real estate to their blog, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Youtube channel, as well as highlights from their community forum.</p>
<p><a href="http://socialmedia.cisco.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/cisco/cisco-social-page.png" alt="" width="575" /></a></p>
<p>I like the idea of having a page like this for API providers. It helps you establish a single page, that can act as a one-stop shop for getting information about what is going on within an API community.</p>
<p>From a planning perspective it also helps providers understand they need to have more than one channel when it comes to providing API support via social channels.</p>
<p>Cisco&rsquo;s social media page is a pretty basic example, but I think a potentially powerful one that API providers can follow when organizing their own social platform, for their own API communities.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-external.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just wrote up a piece about how to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/api-driven-backend-for-apps-using-orchestrateio/">deploy an API driven application backend using Orchestrate.io,</a> and wrote a piece last week on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/liberate-government-data-by-deploying-web-apis-with-solr/">API deployment using Solr and government data</a>. After writing about both of these approaches, I can't shake the thought that external, API driven approaches like this will become commonplace in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Both the approach using Solr, and the other using Orchestrate.io, identify that data is available via a machine readable data dump and even an API, but neither solution provide the simple web API access that would make application development easy.</p>
<p>In both these stroies, 18F and Orchestrate.io are both looking to just get the job done, achieving their development goals--in one case deploy an API of federal business opportunities, and the other is to build a web application that will make browsing super hero characters easier.</p>
<p>Granted these two scenarios have radically different outcomes, but both share a common approach to meeting their goals:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/api-driven-backend-for-apps-using-orchestrateio/">Orchestrate.io</a></strong> - Uses Orchestrate.io to extract, store and normalize data from the Marvel API, making it much more accessible, searchable and usable in their MarvelousDB web application</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen</a></strong> - Uses Solr to mount and index business opportunities with the federal government in an XML dump, then deliver a web API so they can build the web interface for FBOpen, but also provide an open source API that anyone can use as is, or deploy on their own infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these approaches are all about making the data and content they need for web and mobile apps, easily accessible via a simple API. Both of these projects acknowledge the data source they have to work with doesn&rsquo;t meet their exact requirements, but for very different reasons. One project uses open source software to tackle their problems, while the other uses the latest cloud services to provide a solution&mdash;both get the job done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there will be one formula for this type of development that will work in all scenarios, but I think the pattern of extracting the data you need via a data dump or an API, and deploying an external API stack, independent of where you get the data, will be a pattern that can be re-used. This is especially ture in our federal government, where I think much of the innovation needs to occur adjacent to the agency who produces and manages valuable data and content resources, estlabishing API driven, public / private sector partnerships.</p>
<p>I envision a healthier API ecosystem where the government, and the private sector both encourage the re-purposing, and wholesale distribution of content and data, opening up a much more federated approach to delivering the resources we need to build both public, and private sector web and mobile applications.</p>

<p>I'll keep tracking on other examples of hypermdia APIs in the wild, and see if we can't begin shedding light on some of the better implementations out there, and see about getting some of these providers to discuss their API developer strategies at <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/APIdaysGlobal">@APIdaysGlobal.</a>&nbsp;If you know of any other examples, please let me know.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/api-driven-backend-for-apps-using-orchestrateio/">API Driven Backend For Apps Using Orchestrate.io</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://orchestrate.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/orchestrate-io/Orchestrate_small-logo-600x124.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There is a great <a href="http://orchestrate.io/blog/2014/04/08/explore-the-marvel-universe-with-orchestrate/">post over on the Orchestrate.io blog about how they deployed a backend for the MarvelousDB app</a>, using data from the <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/">Marvel API</a>, allowing you to explore the world of Marvel comic book characters, through a simple web interface</p>
<p>As developers often face with valuable API resources, the Marvel API leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to available interfaces, data access, and rate limit restrictions. This is common with new APIs, where it takes time to understand <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">the right levers and dials to turn, that will make the API more usable</a> by developers.</p>
<p>Even with these challenges, the Orchestrate team wanted to build the <a href="http://marvelousdb.com/">MarvelousDB</a> so they could easily browse the world of Marvel comic book characters, putting the Marvel API to use, but also showing what is possible when using Orchestrate.io. The result is a great example of dynamically building a backend from API resources, in a way that delivers the access and performance you need.</p>
<p><a href="http://marvelousdb.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/orchestrate-io/marvelous-db.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>To deliver the MarvelousDB the project employs <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/orchestrate">Orchestrate.js</a>, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> for templating, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/q">Q for async operations</a>. Using the Marvel API, they pull the data they needed to drive the app, pulling it into Orchestrate.io, giving them the data model and performance they needed, but also adding in capabilities like full text search on top of the data&mdash;something that isn&rsquo;t available from the Marvel API alone.</p>
<p>MarvelousDB is an great example of what is possible via the API driven, <a href="http://orchestrate.io/">database as a service platform Orchestrate.io</a>, but is also a great model to follow when developing web or mobile applications that depend on APIs. Sometimes APIs aren&rsquo;t structured exactly as we need, and we can use platforms like Orchestrate.io, to well&hellip;orchestrate exactly the backend experience we need to get the job done.</p>

<p>I maintain an active list of online services I depend on for my business, using Evernote.  Each month I spend an hour or two maintaining this list, to make sure it is complete and actively change my logins when appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw the recent Heartbleed SSL situation as an opportunity to move forward some of my IT practices, including <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/12/downloading-1password-from-agilebits/">using 1Password to manage all of my accounts</a>, and better profiling which APIs I'm consuming. This gave me an opportunity to update my list of APIs that I depend on, adding about 4 or 5 new ones.</p>
<p>First I depend on a couple of the core Google APIs:</p>

</table>
<p>I depend on these APIs to run <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>,&nbsp;as well as support the other research and consulting that I do.  Some of these services I pay for, some of them I use for free. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I depend on a lot of APIs, partly because this is my game, I&rsquo;m an API Evangelist, but it is also because APIs provide me with the data and resources I need to operate.</p>
<p>Tracking on the APIs I depend is a regular part of my IT strategy, and eventually I am going to publish this as a public page on my websites--showcasing what APIs have done for my business.</p>

<p>I now have a pretty simple <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>. You can pass it a URL and it gives you back a PNG image file of that website. Meeting my definition of a simple utility API. I use this API in my own platform, capturing what websites and applications look like for reference in stories, and other content.</p>
<p>I want to make this valuable utility API available to a wider audience now. I need to compose some tiers of access to my screen capture API, that makes sense to my business goals and how it will be consumed by a variety of users. So far I&rsquo;ve come up with five levels of access to my API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private / Internal </strong>- This is where my API is consumer currently, internally my own systems. I need this tier to be unlimited use, no charge, but still tracking on how I am consuming the screen capture API so I can evaluate along with all my other service levels.</li>
<li><strong>Private / Partner - </strong>I have partners who can make use of my screen capture API, I want to offer them special access to my resource, but I still want to track on how they are using the resource.</li>
<li><strong>Public / Free -</strong> To help attract new developers to my screen capture API I want to make open to the public, all you have to do is sign up for a key, and you can make a certain amount of calls in an hour or day, I haven't decided how much yet.</li>
<li><strong>Public / Retail - </strong>Once a user hits a certain amount of screen capture API calls I want to be able to charge a certain rate per call, allowing consumers to use as much as they want, but cover my operational costs, while making a little money on top.</li>
<li><strong>Public / Wholesale -</strong> I also want to be able to sell wholesale instances of the API either deployed within my infrastructure or someone else&rsquo;s. A company might want access to the screen capture API as part of their stack, but do not have the time to deploy internally.</li>
</ul>
<p>That represents the five separate ways I want to allow access to my screen capture API. Now I can <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/12/moving-beyond-my-basic-3scale-api-infrastructure-plan/">configure my 3Scale API infrastructure</a>, define this exact service composition, and the API will handle the rest. When new users sign-up I will route them into one of these service tiers, and manage their access accordingly.</p>
<p>After I get my API management layer configured, I will have to craft a pricing page to educate new users about what type of access is available. In addition to being a post on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, you can find the story of my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API over at the research project</a> I&rsquo;ve setup over on Github.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apache-solr/apache-solr-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">reviewed the deployment the FBOpen API the other day</a>, which is a simple API resource of&nbsp;business&nbsp;opportunities with the U.S. Federal Government. An interesting aspect of the FBOpen implementation was that <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> used <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> to deploy the API layer.</p>
<p>Solr is an <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">open source search tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation</a>, which can take any document store and easily generate a simple, yet pretty powerful web API&mdash;opening up access to content, without costly infrastructure. I showcased how the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/20/api-search-endpoint-using-solr/">Free Law Project launched the Court Opinion API, using Solr</a>, opening up access to archives of legal documents from across the country.</p>
<p>18F took XML dumps of business opportunities from <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/">FBO.gov</a>, then deployed Apache Solr as the API layer. You can <a href="https://github.com/18f/fbopen">download or fork 18F&rsquo;s FBOpen API</a>, and deploy the API in your own infrastructure. This provides a pretty interesting blueprint for how government can easily open up data, then launch an API for developers to build on top of.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking that government data dumps, plus web API deployed using Solr, plus interactive documentation deployed via Github, combined with frictionless API access via api.data.gov or 3Scale, open licensing and terms of use&mdash;all sounds like a pretty health formula for open, reusable government API infrastructure.</p>
<p>Along with other healthy patterns for API design, deployment, management and evangelism I find out in the API space, I think what 18F has done with the FBOpen API, needs highlighting. I think government data plus web API using Solr is a recipe I&rsquo;d like to see used across all government projects.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-fist.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>After the recent heartbleed security fiasco, I&rsquo;m spending my weekend going through <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/12/which-online-services-do-i-depend-on/">my list of online services that I depend on</a>, changing my passwords, and along the way I&rsquo;m going to reclaim as much of my domain as I can.</p>
<p>I will be <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/12/reclaim-profile-for-each-service-i-depend-on/">asking some questions of each online service</a>, questions like, why do I use this service? does this service have an API? Questions that will help me establish a profile of that service, to better understand how I use it, and whether there is any valuable content or information I should be organizing in a better way.</p>
<p>I produce a lot of content each day, and on the surface it seems like I maintain control over most of this, but in reality my content resides in online services like Twitter, LinkedIn, and other places that I frequent daily.</p>
<p>I do a pretty good job of centrally managing the blog content I generate each day. I have a central CMS where I create my blog entries, and then syndicate to my network of 60+ Github repositories, that use Github Pages + Jekyll.</p>
<p>When it comes to my social media streams, I do a very poor job of maintaining control over my network. I do not store my Tweets, Facebook, Linked or other social streams anywhere. I don&rsquo;t centrally sync my network of friends and business contact, until recently. I now have a central CRM alongside my blog CMS, but I&rsquo;m just getting started there.</p>
<p>Overall, there is just a lot of content I generate on the Internet, and in addition to understanding my online footprint, to make sure it is secure, I want to make sure I maintain as much control over the intellectual exhaust I generate each day, as I can. I want all my messages, contacts, streams and media to have the widest possible reach, across the latest online services, but I also want to make sure they are organized and stored in a central place that I control.</p>
<p>You will hear me say the phrase &ldquo;<a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/index.html">Reclaim Your Domain</a>&rdquo; a lot in the future. I think this is the evolution of API Evangelist, beyond the business of APIs, and more into the politics of APIs, and helping people understand why APIs are important for orchestrating your online world, keeping yourself safe and secure, but also establishing the greatest control over the value you generate online each day.</p>

<p>Over ten years ago I learned the hard away about my domain. I purchased <a href="http://kinlane.com">kin lane.com</a> from a website hosting provider I found online, and after they drained over 1K from my bank account for a simple $10.00 website and domain purchase, they proceeded to squat on my domain for almost two years. Eventually I got my domain back, but it taught me some serious lessons about navigating this new online world we were creating for ourselves.</p>
<p>Fast-forward ten years, and I&rsquo;ve not just learned a lot more about operating online, I have generated quite a bit of content, and value within my domain, giving me even more reason to protect not just my domain, but my brand. I produce a lot of content online, in the form of Tweets, blog posts, and other online exhaust from my daily life as the API Evangelist, and it is in my best interest to control as much of this content as I can.</p>
<p>While I have my online brand to protect, and overall I have a heightened awareness around my online persona, this is something everyone should learn about. You may not have a valuable blog, online portfolio or other valuable online assets, but eventually you might. No matter who you are online, you should work to understand where your content, images, video and other assets you generate reside, and retain as much control over them as possible.</p>
<p>The business model of major companies like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Flickr, Instagram and Youtube are all based upon you generating valuable content that people want to view, which then allows these companies to generate revenue by selling advertising or access to your (their) content. It is in their best interest to retain as much control over your content as they can. In 2014 there are many ways to assert control over your online world, and this project site is about me doing it for myself, but under a larger umbrella called Reclaim Your Domain.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can learn from me, an IT and API professional doing this for my own needs, but in a way that helps you understand what is possible for your own domain.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been using <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API Infrastructure</a> to manage API Evangelis's public APIs for almost two years now. My APIs provide access to my blog posts, news I curate, and the tools I track on. I also use the same infrastructure to secure and manage various projects I work on. You can view a list of my APi deployments on my <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">API account management home page</a>.</p>
<p>In reality I haven't been all that serious about the management of my APIs until now. I have enough content I&rsquo;d like to make available via APIs, and I have a growing number of new APIs, some of which I'd like to make available for a fee, and see if I can&rsquo;t generate some new revenue streams off my research.</p>
<p>Until now I've been on the <a href="http://www.3scale.net/pricing/">3Scale base plan</a>, which is free and allows for 150,000 API transactions a day, and all the API management tools I needed to get going. This has been plenty for me to get my APIs established, but now I&rsquo;d like to be able to generate more API transactions, as well as be able to bill for API usage if I choose.</p>
<p>With this in mind I've finally upgraded beyond the basic 3Scale plan to the plus plan, which at $125.00 / month gives me up to 250,000 calls  a day, and the ability to charge for access to select APIs, opening up the possiblity to generate revenue on some of my content and programmatic resources.</p>
<p>The ability to sign up, deploy and management my APIs until I found my way, has been essential to me getting to this point. I would not have been able to play with different configurations of access to my APIs, without 3Scale. This ability to on-board into the world of APIs, experiment and iterate, before having to pay a monthly fee is essential to many companies figuring out what this whole API thing is about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited about taking some of my API ideas to the next level, and play with different ways to access my API driven resources, while being able to tell the story publicly, as I do with all of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/09/16-areas-of-my-core-api-research/">API research</a>.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner, but I pay for my own 3Scale account just like any other customer.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-evangelist-screen-capture.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Earlier this year <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/creating-my-own-screenshot-api/">I created a screen capture API</a>, filling a need I have across my network&mdash;capturing an image snapshot of any web page. Not all APIs are created the same, but I think this screen capture API represents a very fundamental layer of the API economy, the utility API. This API isn't Twitter or Google Maps, it does one thing and it does it well&mdash;something most APIs should work hard to achieve.</p>
<p>I've been using my screen capture API internally for several months now, and I think it is time to do more with it. I want to make this API available publicly, but I don&rsquo;t want to just make freely available to anyone on the open Internet, to use as much as they want. I want to create an access layer, using <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a> management that allows me to control who has access, and what they can, or cannot do with it.</p>
<p>To help me plan the next steps for my screen capture API I'm working on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Service Composition - An outline of the different ways I will sell access to my screen capture API</li>
<li>Operational Harness - An overview of how I will deliver these API services to my target customers</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal in all of this is to generate stories for API Evangelist, but I also want to push forward my own understanding of how API resources can be delivered, and what better way than providing my own APIs. I have a number of other APIs I would consider very utility in nature, that I want to launch, but I&rsquo;m going to focus on just the screen capture API for now, and try to establish a blueprint I can use across all of my APIs.</p>
<p>I will publish my screen capture API service composition and operational harness as separate blog posts. Then I will look at actually deploy the API in accordance with my service composition, and establish an operational platform in sync with my operational harness. I won't post every update here on API Evangelist about this work, you will have to visit my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API project</a> to find those updates.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.quora.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/quora/quora_logo_620px.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As the API Evangelist I spend a lot of time cheering for companies to have APIs, and in 2014 I&rsquo;m continuing a slow shift from cheerleading to calling out companies who do not have an API. If you are an older company or institution I will be a lot more forgiving about whether or not an API exists, but with newer tech companies, there is NO excuse --an API is mandatory!</p>
<p>As a digital citizen in 2014, you should not use any online service that doesn&rsquo;t allow for data portability, which starts with the ability to just download a complete file of all your account settings and data, and is fully realized when a fully read/write API exists, with the support of a healthy, vibrant API community. If a company doesn&rsquo;t provide you with these basic data portability features, you are most likely in a hostage situation where you are generating content and value for a company, with no say in how your content is used, monetized or even removed.</p>
<p>I am reminded of an example of a modern tech company, who is harvesting the knowledge and wisdom of the crowd, but offers nothing back in return to its users, by Andy Baio (@waxpancake):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 15px;" lang="en">
<p>Worth noting: Quora has no public API, no backup/export tools, blocks anonymous display of answers, and banned the Wayback Machine entirely.</p>
&mdash; Andy Baio (@waxpancake) <a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake/statuses/453958676529696769">April 9, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>After I retweeted Andy&rsquo;s reminder, one of my followers said they would like to retweet, but they want to make sure it was true. Andy said to go look for their self, and that after over 300+ retweets nobody had challenged his statement--which the reply was he didn't have time. Well I have time to go look, and verify whether or not Quora has an API&mdash;let&rsquo;s take a look, and what better way than to just ask Quora!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Does-a-Quora-API-exihttp://www.quora.com/Does-a-Quora-API-exist">Does a Quora API exist?</a> The short answer is yes. There is the <a href="http://www.quora.com/Edmond-Lau/Edmond-Laus-Posts/Quora-Extension-API">Quora Extension API</a>, which is a &ldquo;json-based data API exposing information about the currently logged-in user&rdquo;. This API is purely designed for use in a toolbar, not building apps or even extracting a users data, and the developer Edmond Lau (<a href="https://twitter.com/edmondlau">@edmondlau</a>), who posted the announcement of the API is gone from Quora, which is usually a sign that an API project has lost its leader.</p>
<p>There are plenty of questions about <a href="http://www.quora.com/Quora-API/When-is-Quora-planning-an-open-API">when is Quora planning an open API?</a>, and there are responses from Quora founders, like this one from Charlie Cheever - 9 Jun, 2010:</p>
<blockquote><em>When there are enough users and content on Quora that an API would be really useful, we'll almost certainly add one. For right now, we'll probably focus on the web interface since that's how we think most people will use the product, at least to start.  Another reason we probably won't do an API for a little while is that the interface into the product is changing frequently in big ways right now (ex. We added "thanks" a few days ago and we're not sure if we'll keep that or not,) and APIs that aren't stable are hard to use effectively.</em></blockquote>
<p>After reading the answers it is evident to me that there is no API knowledge or passionate leader at Quora. Charlie&rsquo;s response demonstrates they don&rsquo;t possess a true understanding of what is possible with a properly executed API, the agiity it will bring to their own dev cycles, but also the community opportunities that will emerge. Without a fundamental knowledge of APIs, company leaders always possess a lack of understanding how you can manage and control content in even more powerful ways than you can, with just an web interface.</p>
<p>Of course there is speculation on <a href="http://www.quora.com/Quora-API/Why-isnt-there-a-public-Quora-API">why isn't there a public Quora API?</a>. With a pretty direct response from Chuck Russell, Sr. Partner Collective Intelligence Inc.:</p>
<blockquote><em>Maybe Quora wants to own the corpus of thought on the platform. Coupled with your Twitter, FB and Linkedin social profiles they know quite a bit about you. To assume that they're not monetizing this information is naive. At this point they don't want to dilute the value of the psychometrics they've collected by creating aggregator-like competitors. The fact that they say they're "working on it" is absolute BS. Either the Quora team is incompetent or they are disingenuous. Which is more likely?</em></blockquote>
<p>Beyond the discussion about the Quora API, the conversation quickly moves into <a href="http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-way-to-backup-your-Quora-answers-and-votes">what's the best way to backup your Quora answers and votes</a>, and <a href="http://www.quora.com/Would-writing-a-Quora-scraper-in-the-absence-of-an-API-get-me-banned-for-life-from-Quora--hich">would writing a Quora-scraper (in the absence of an API) get me banned for life from Quora</a>? &nbsp;I find it very interesting, and telling that Quora hasn&rsquo;t chimed in on these threads. There is a sensible answer recommending that scrapers should adhere to the sites robots.txt, which begins with a request to email them when you are crawling the site. Is this the poor mans on-boarding process for content partners?</p>
<p>In my experience, the lack of an API and data portability is the result of two things: 1) lack of understanding of business and politics of APIs 2) lack of a healthy, creative monetization strategy. I think the responses I&rsquo;ve seen cover number one, but <a href="http://www.quora.com/Quoras-Business-Model-and-Monetization/What-could-Quoras-long-term-business-plan-be">what could Quora's long-term business plan be?</a> According to Yair Livne, Data Science Manager at Quora, which has a vote by Adam D'Angelo (Quora Founder &amp; CEO):</p>
<blockquote><em>Advertising models represent an interesting opportunity for Quora, given the nature of our traffic.Quora's traffic is 30-40% direct intent: people searching for something, asking a question, or indicating in some other way that they are looking for something specific. And given our high percentage of commercial intent traffic, I would estimate that our long-term implied CPMs for advertising would be comparable to those achieved by web search (Google, Yahoo, Bing) and vertical search (LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Yelp). With these products, people are explicit about the question they are trying to answer and the topics they are interested in learning about. This creates exciting ad opportunities because you can deliver real results for both people and advertisers.</em></blockquote>
<p>This smells like a play out of the Twitter playbook to me, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/25/lack-of-pinterest-api-is-a-lack-of-api-business-strategy/">where much like Pinterest</a>, Quora is not going make the same mistakes as Twitter by having an API and relinquishing any control over its content, in ways that might hurt monetization for their investors or just confuse operations for them. This represents a lack of understanding of the business and politics of APIs, and an inability to truly innovate when it comes to monetization.</p>
<p>Quora refelects a pretty basic Silicon Valley formula for making money. Create site that attracts users, and generates content or media, and as long as you can control all eyeballs who view this content, at some point you can monetize by placing ads along with that content. In the beginning you have to act like you care about your users, so they will sign up, return and generate content. As part of this process you pretend like an API is coming, but in reality you just want to retain as much control over the content your community has generated as you can.</p>
<p>This classic formula for extracting and controlling the value online users create, is an easy and proven formula for generating value that investors can get behind. Giving users access to their data, and providing an ecosystem for other businesses to come in an innovate takes way to much thinking, creativity and belief that your core business model is truly unique and valuable. The Quoras, Pinterests, and Twitters of the world don&rsquo;t have time to explore the future of user generated content ownership, or new and interesting ways of monetization beyond the classic advertising. It is somewhat unfair that Twitter is listed above, because they do have data portability and an API, but I include them in the group because I strongly feel they have left serious money on the table by not letting the ecosystem help them in their monetization efforts, and just focusing on Twitter advertising. I know its what your investors get, but it is sooooo shortsided.</p>
<p>The reason I write this post is that I want the average Internet user to understand the inner workings of the tech companies they are lining up to use. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You should not use any platform that doesn&rsquo;t provide data portability and an </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AP</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span></strong>. If a company doesn&rsquo;t provide this in 2014, there is either incompetency at the helm, or there are other motivations involved&mdash;usually the fact that you are the product, generating value for the platform and sharing that wealth with you is not in the business plan. Shouldn&rsquo;t you go somewhere else with your contribution, somewhere that values what you bring to the table, and gives you a vote and ast least ownership over your work?</p>
<p>I have a <a href="http://www.quora.com/Kin-Lane">Quora profile</a>, but if you follow me, you notice I don&rsquo;t answer many questions or participate in any meaningful way&mdash;this is because I do not have any control over my knowledge that hand over to Quora. I will up vote, or maybe provide a short answer now and then, but if I want to share some wisdom I will do it on a platform that I have some control over like my blog, or even Twitter. Why would I hand over my content for Quora to own, monetize without any sort of nod to the value I bring to the table?</p>

<p>I am playing with different ways of explaining the 100K view of how companies, and ultimately governments will participate in the API economy. As with APIs themselves, visualizing something like how an API platform can position itself in the emerging API economy, is very difficult to do&mdash;something that takes refinement, something I do by blogging, so here we go...</p>
<p>Much like developers are looking into the details of each API call, using API integration tools like <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">RunScope</a> and <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a>, to better understand how their applications are consuming APIs, API providers need to understand all the moving parts involved with successfully executing an API strategy.  To help me articulate to API providers, I try to break things down into small digestible modules that will help me demonstrate &nbsp;how they all work in concert to orchestrate the delivery of digital resources inside and outside the firewall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of these modules represent the levers, dials and switches you will use to define your participation in the API economy. How you position yourself in all of these areas, will define how your API will ultimately operate. API consumers will never use an API if they can't on-board efficiently, the price is too high or licensing to strict, while they will flourish in a more balanced, carefully planned configuration.</p>
<p>APIs aren't just about making data, content and digital resources available publicly. APIs are about optimizing access and consumption of these resources, encouraging access in ways that benefit owners and stakeholders. While there is no perfect configuration that will ensure success in all business sectors, there are some blueprints we can follow that set the right tone, and the levers, dials and switches listed above can be adjusted and tuned in real-time for optimal performance.</p>

        <p><a href="http://api.data.gov/docs/regulations/#!/regulations.json/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/regulations/regulations-gov-swagger-docs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just published a post <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/developer-portals-on-github-example-from-socrata/">showcasing Socrata's use of Github to deploy their new open data and API developer portal.</a> There are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">numerous reasons for using Github as part of your API management strategy</a>, with one of the main reasons being the collaborative features that Git, and the social coding platform Github introduce.</p>
<p>I've had the news about Socrata&rsquo;s new developer portal open for over a day now, and what triggered that story was seeing a link to the <a href="http://api.data.gov/docs/regulations/#!/regulations.json/">regulations API on data.gov</a>, which not only just uses Swagger for the API definition, it employs a simple portal that is deployed using Github pages.</p>
<p>Deploying API developer areas on Github, using Github pages is nothing new, we've been doing it a while now. However there is a groundswell within federal government recently, so I think its worth noting&mdash;hoping other open data and API folks in government jump in too!</p>
<p>I like the basic layout of the regulations API portal. It is a simple overview, changelog, terms of service and interactive API documentation using Swagger. Then demonstrating one of the biggest benefits of deploying your developer portal on Github, it simply says: <strong><em>&ldquo;Help Improve This Content&rdquo;</em></strong>, directing users to edit, fork and submit a pull requests on the portal&rsquo;s Github repository&mdash;enabling anyone to improve the portal content, with the approval of the API administrator of course.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://deo-data.github.io/green-button-api"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/green-button/green-button.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The end of last year I was asked to spent time thinking about three things: 1) <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">An API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA</a>)  2) Next steps for the Green Button API 3) <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">API strategy for the overall United States Government</a>. I managed to find the bandwidth to get two of the three projects active, but neglected to spend time on the Green Button API.</p>
<p>To support my research I established a <a href="http://doe-data.github.io/green-button-api/">Green Button API repository on Github</a>, where  will track all my work. My goal is to pull together all the existing pieces of the Green Button API into one place, and evolve a strategy for taking Green Button API the next step. Like I did with the FAFSA API, I just want to explore what is possible, and jump start a conversation either within government and outside with other 3rd parties.</p>
<p>I've spent a few hours gathering what elements I could find about Green Button&mdash;existing sites, APIs, code, documentation, etc. Over the next couple of weeks I will spend more time connecting the dots, and tell the story via my Green Button API project blog.</p>
<p>If you have any resources I should consider, or would like to provide any feedback, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/doe-data/green-button-api/issues">Github issue management for the Green Button API repository</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.socrata.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/socrata/socrata-data-experience-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Civic data platform <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> has launched a <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/">new developer area</a> to support developers who are building apps on top of city, county, state and federal data, as well as the publishers of this data. A release of a new developer area is always worthy of note in my tracking of the API space&mdash;anytime I see a tweet or blog post about the release of new developer area, I will visit to see what is going on.</p>
<p>The first thing I find particularly interesting about Socrata&rsquo;s approach is that they published as a Github repository, using Github Pages. We are seeing more government developer areas move onto Github, because of the easy site hosting with Github Pages, and the benefits of managing your projects with Git, as well as social benefits of Github and its underlying API.</p>
<p><strong>Application Developers</strong><br /> Socrata provides a wealth of information for application developers, including a getting started guide, robust API documentation, client libraries, and D3.js assistance for those looking to build visualizations on top of government data.</p>
<p><strong>Data Publishers</strong><br /> On the other side of the coin, Socrata also provides data publishers with what they need to get started, clean and organize their data, and the ability publish or sync with the Socrata platform, providing R, Ruby and Java libraries that really jumpstart integration.</p>
<p>The second thing I really like about the new Socrata portal is that it is more educational than it is technical, and tailored to onboard the next generation of government data publishers and consumers. Socrata doesn&rsquo;t just provide details about API endpoints, they provide information on what is JSON and HTTP verbs. From years of experience, Socrata has a firm grasp of the amount of education the space needs to get up to speed, and it shows in their developer portal.</p>
<p><a href="http://dev.socrata.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/socrata/socrata-developers.png" alt="" width="450" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>To provide some critique of the implementation, the formatting of the text wasn&rsquo;t the easiest to consume. For some reason the font-size, density and layout made it hard to spend too scan and spend time with. I&rsquo;d recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.fullcontact.com/developer/docs/">FullContact API</a> in separate browser tab, then flip back and forth, to demonstrate what I mean. Next I think Socrata could go further with contrasting things between developers and non-developers&mdash;the potential is there to really onboard people who don&rsquo;t write code, an <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">example of this in action is over at Dwolla</a>.</p>
<p>As part of my API monitoring, I think I will have to add some sort of tag for APIs that deploy their developer area via Github, so I can keep track of interesting implementations. When your developer area is published on Github, I just think it invites collaboration, and participation from the community.</p>

<p>The mission of API Evangelist is all about bringing awareness of APIs to the masses. The biggest challenge I face in doing this, is that API Evangelist is primarily a blog, which means a chronological listing of content I produce.  When you are new to the API space, you can start with home page, but then you have to start sprinting to keep up with what I'm dish'n up on the blog. I have been working to address this by deploying other static research sites like <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">monetization</a> for API providers, and <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a> and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a> on the API consumption side&mdash;however, even with this work its not enough.</p>
<p>This is why its great to see other resources emerge that help new API providers and consumers get up to speed on the space, while still remaining informative for the advanced users, or anywhere on the API proficiency spectrum. In this case I&rsquo;m talking about <a href="http://apicodex.3scale.net/">API Codex</a> , the curated site for API news from <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>--if you want to find the best articles from the API space, addressing all levels of expertise, API Codex is the resource you are looking for.</p>
<p>The first thing you see when you land on API Codex:</p>
<blockquote><em>Just getting started? Check out our <a href="http://apicodex.3scale.net/content/API101">API101 page</a>!</em></blockquote>
<p>Then you can browse the best articles from the space, by level of expertise, and by tag, as well as find the best API stories organized by author. This isn&rsquo;t just a random stream of articles from the API space, it is the best of the best from the API space. There is also an API tools section along with the API news, showcasing the best in tooling for both API providers and consumers.</p>
<p>As the API universe expands we are going to have to get better at organizing the most valuable educational API resource, and making them accessible to users. It makes me happy to see API Codex emerge, augmenting what ProgrammableWeb has been doing for the last 9 years, and API Evangelist has been doing for the last 4 year, delivering the valuable curation of essential API industry content.</p>
<p>If you need an introduction to APIs or need to find the best technical articles on APIs, visit <a href="http://apicodex.3scale.net/">API Codex</a>.</p>

<p>Scraping has been something I&rsquo;ve done since I first started working on the web. Sometimes you just need some data or a piece of content that isn't available in a machine readable format, and the only way is to get it scrape it off a web page.</p>
<p>Scraping is widespread, but something very few individuals or companies will admit to doing. Just like writing scripts for pulling data from APIs, I write a lot of scripts that pull content and data from websites and RSS feeds. Even though I tend to write my own scripts for scraping, I&rsquo;ve been closely watching the new breed of scraping tools like Scraperwiki:</p>

<p>Kimono and Import.io provide scraping tools for anyone, even non-developers to scrape content from web pages, but also allow you to deploy an API from the content. While it is easy to deploy APIs using data and content from the other scraping providers I track on, the new breed of scraping services focus on API deployment as end-goal.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, the final panel of the event was called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhbm_MtSYlg">toward 1 million APIs</a>&rdquo;, and scraping came up as one possible way that we will get to APIs at this scale. Sometimes the stewards or owners of data just don&rsquo;t have the resources to deploy APIs, and the only way to deploy an API will be to scrape data and content and publish as web API--either internally or externally by 3rd party.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="http://scraping.apievangelist.com/">research site setup to keep track of scraping news I come across, as well as any companies and tools I discover</a>. Beyond ScraperWiki, Kimono and Import.io I&rsquo;m watching these additional scraping services.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2014</span>
        <p>When I first started API Evangelist, I wanted to better understand the business of APIs, which really focused on API management. Over the course of four years, the list of companies delivering API management services has expanded with new entrants, an evolved with acquisitions of some of the major players. Visit my API management research site for more news, companies, tools and analysis from this part of API operations.</p>

<p>In 2011, people would always ask me, which API management company will help you with deployment? For a while, the answer was none of them, but this soon changed with new players emerging, and expanding of services from existing providers. To help me understand the expanding API lifecycle I started two new separate research areas:</p>

<p>Once you design, deploy your API, and you get a management plan in place, you have to start looking at how you are going to make money and get the word out. In an effort to better understand the business of APIs, I setup research sites for researching the monetizationand evangelizing of APIs:</p>

<p>As the API space has matured, I started seeing that I would have to pay better attention to not just providing APIs, but also better track on the consumption of APIs. With this in mind I start looking into how APIs are discovered and what service and tools developers are using when integrating with APIs:</p>

<p>In 2013, I saw also saw a conversation grow around an approach to designing APIs, called hypermedia. Last year things moved beyond just academic discussion around designing hypermedia APIs, to actual rubber meeting the road with companies deploying well designed hypermedia APIs. In January I decided that it was time to regularly track on what is going on in the hypermedia conversation:.</p>

<p>There are other research projects I have going on, but these area reflect the core of my API monitoring and research. They each live as separate Github repositories, accessible through Github pages. I publish news, companies, tools, and my analysis on a regular basis. I use them for my own education, and I hope you can find useful as well.</p>

<p>I stumbled into a pretty interesting use of Github yesterday, which I&rsquo;m seeing as part of a greater push from our government to use the popoular social coding platform. The government blog <a href="http://govfresh.com/">Govfresh</a> held a live chat session with FCC CIO David Bray (<a href="https://twitter.com/fcc_cio">@fcc_cio</a>), where some really interesting questions were asked of the very progressive CIO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to break up a few of the questions into separate blog posts, what I wanted to highlight in this post was the use of Github as a chat forum, showing once again that the platform isn&rsquo;t just about managing code, but can be used to openly manage a multitude of collaborative government technical operations.</p>
<p>Luke Fretwell (<a href="https://twitter.com/lukefretwell">@lukefretwell</a>) opened up the discussion which ran for about an hour, asking Bray several questions, and then Steve Spiker (<a href="https://twitter.com/spjika">@spjika</a>), myself and the infamous Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile)</a> chimed in with further questions&mdash;making for a pretty interesting discussion.</p>
<p>Govfresh used <a href="https://github.com/gitrun/chat">Gitchat</a>, a way of turning Github Issue Management + Github APIs into a chat thread, for the conversation. I like this approach to managing and controlling a live conversation, with the ability to archive for future use. I think it is also a great way to help people in government understand that Github is more than just code, it is also about being very social and collaborative around technical ideas.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/18f/18F_logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There has been some <a href="http://e-pluribusunum.com/2014/03/12/at-18f-in-gsa-u-s-seeks-to-tap-the-success-of-the-u-k-s-government-digital-services/">great coverage of the new group of tech specialists out of the GSA</a>, dubbed <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. According to their own home page, 18F:</p>
<blockquote><em>...builds effective, user-centric digital services focused on the interaction between government and the people and businesses it serves. We help agencies deliver on their mission through the development of digital and web services.</em></blockquote>
<p>I know most of the team members from my work with the GSA, and my own time (albeit short) as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and I am extremely optimistic about the potential of the team. This optimism is being seriously validated after looking through the groups recent release of the <a href="http://docs.fbopen.apiary.io/">FBOpen API</a>, which is a simple API resource to get access to opportunities to do business with the U.S. Federal Government.</p>
<p><strong>Use Existing Tools</strong><br /> The 18F demonstrates their tech chops by not re-inventing the wheel when it comes to designing and developing the FBOpen API. After they downloaded the existing business opportunity XML dumps from <a href="http://fbo.gov">FBO.gov</a>, they employed <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> to develop a thin API layer on top of the files. Solr does two things well, it provides a REST interface on top of document stores, and supports the Lucene query syntax, which provides a powerful query interface on top of the simple API. Beyond Solr, 18F also used <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a> and <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>, to cobble together a platform for API operations, demonstrating their dedication to agility and speed.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity Rules</strong><br /> The FBOpen API interface adheres to API simplicity by providing logical, versioned URI for accessing the government business opportunities, with a query and data source parameter allowing you to tailor the source of your query. Then you can filter by noncompetes or closed opportunities, as well as controlling the number of results returned, including common pagination controls developers are used to when working with APIs. FBOpen API does one thing, and does it well--the calling card of successful APis.</p>
<p><a href="https://fbopen.gsa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fbopen/fbopen-pilot-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Modern Design Lifecycle</strong><br /> Again, demonstrating their grasp of modern technology, 18F employs Apiary to model and design the FBOpen API interface--using <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> allowed them to define the API interface in markdown, then deploy a mock interface, interactive API documentation and code samples in a variety of languages. This approach to designing APIs in government is the future for not just providing a machine readable definition of the API, but delivers the documentation and code necessary to onboard any developer in minutes&mdash;increasing the chances the API will be integrated with.</p>
<p><strong>Open By Default</strong><br /> The FBOpen API sets the bar for all government APIs, by making sure not just the API is public and accessible, but so is the API design, source code and underlying tooling&mdash;allowing anyone to deploy an instance of the FBOpen API. Since FBOpoen is built on Solr, publicly available XML data source, and published on Github, anyone can download or fork, and deploy their own instance of the FBOpen API. This is the definition of an open API.</p>
<p><strong>Central Key Management With api.data.gov</strong><br /> Before you can make calls on the central FBOpen API instance, you must obtain an API key from <a href="https://api.data.gov/">api.data.gov</a>. This should be standard business operations for ALL federal government APIs. Developers shouldn't have to manage separate accounts with each agency, they should be able to request credentials in a single location, and use across all APIs they consume within in the federal government. api.data.gov uses <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella">API Umbrella</a>, an open source API management solution developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and is employed by the GSA in the common API infrastructure available to all agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Read / Write APIs in Government (kindasorta)</strong><br /> I started to cry when I saw that there was not just a GET method for FBOpen, but here was a POST method, allowing for users to add or update opportunities via the API&mdash;then I saw it was disabled, and the tears dried up. The option is only available if you deploy your own instance of the API, which in my opinion actually represents the future of read / write APIs in government. I just don't think government can move fast enough, and manage the responsibility of write APIs in all scenarios, and providing open source APIs like FBOpen, that anyone can download, install and allow for adding and updating data can bridge this canyon. If enough trusted instances of the FBOpen can be established outside the federal government firewall, agencies can make their own decision around which sources they want to trust and pull opportunities back into internal systems. With proper certification of API deployments by our government, APIs lie FBOpen can share the load of managing data with private sector, without the risk that comes with doing it all internally.</p>
<p><a href="http://gsa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/gsa/gsa-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Examples Of What Is Possible With FBOpen API</strong><br /> Along with all the essential technical building blocks, 18F provides three examples of what you can build with the FBOpen API, stimulating the imagination of would be developers. While developers are very innovative when it comes to APIs, they often need stimulation when it comes to understanding what is possible within specific domains&mdash;the FBOpen examples achieve this, planting seeds of what developers can do, increasing the chance that meaningful integrations with the API will occur.</p>
<p><strong>Using Their Own API</strong><br /> The ulitmate example of what is possible with the FBOpen API, is the fact that they use it for driving the <a href="https://fbopen.gsa.gov/">FBOpen website</a>. Nothing shows developers the value that an API delivers, and that it is a resource that they can depend on, than seeing an API provider use their own API. When government agencies use their own APIs it sends the right signal to developers, while also helping agencies see what developers face when putting government API resources to use.</p>
<p><strong>Telling The Story Behind FBOpen</strong><br /> Via the <a href="https://github.com/18f/fbopen">FBOpen Github repository</a>, 18F tells the story behind the API. Walking us through where the idea came from, what technology went into its development, and demonstrates how to get started, examples of how it can be used, where there are limitations, and what is on the roadmap. This type of storytelling behind an API, especially APIs that are open at every level (which should be default for all government), helps developer put these valuable, open government resources to work&mdash;without the story, the API will still be a black box, no matter how open the source code is.</p>
<p><strong>Humble And Honest</strong><br /> As part of the FBOpen documentation and story, 18F is open and honest about their work, stating <em>"This project is brand new and very incomplete. No guarantees of data completeness or functionality are implied or should be assumed. There is lots to do!&rdquo;.</em> This is soooooooo important! APIs will never be perfect, and government agencies should never wait until things are perfect to release in the public sphere--APIs are about iteration and learning, and setting expectations with developers will help them iterate and learn, but also will assist agency owners in iterating and learning as well.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Licensing</strong><br /> The policy restrictions and licensing around government open data and APIs can be confusing. Not all government resources are openly licensed by default, despite what you might think. 18F clearly lays out the license for FBOpen, <em>"This project constitutes an original work of the United States Government. This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain. see the LICENSE file for more.&rdquo;</em> This is critical to setting the tone for how developers will integrate with an API, and publishing this front and center is the right way to get it out of the way, eliminating friction with new developers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying hard to find some critical feedback for the 18F team, and I really can&rsquo;t. Sure there are more building blocks I could suggest, but the essential ones are there. FBOpen provides clear value (access to government business opportunities), simple interface, documentation, code samples, on-boarding, and licensing. I guess the only thing I'd recommend is clearer contact and support info&mdash;do I go to api.data.gov, 18F or publish issues via the Github repository? Maybe providing a simple block that lays this out for developers on the Github README page.</p>
<p>FBOpen is a model for all government APIs, and shows that 18F the real deal. This approach to deploying API resources in government, one that allow you to use as is in the cloud, or deploy your own instance, IS THE FUTURE OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES! As I stated above the opportunities for establishing federated networks around government resources, that give birth to new public and private sector partnerships, similar to what is available within the IRS modernized e-file system, is the future of government and the API economy&mdash;one where we all share the load.</p>
<p>Nice work 18F, if you can continue this type of work across agencies, you will be the change we've all been talking about in government.</p>

<p>I was just having another conversation about virtualized cloud containers like <a href="http://docker.io">Docker.io</a>, and the approaches from leading cloud providers like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">Amazon with Cloud Formations</a>, and <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">RedHat with OpenShift</a>. This is a subject that seems to be coming up more and more, and is definitely something you&rsquo;ll see more of on API Evangelist, as well as being discussed at future <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> and <a href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a>.</p>
<p>John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>)&nbsp;of <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> put it best, a couple weeks back during a similar conversation:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 25px;" lang="en">
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> containers will do for APIs what APIs do for companies.</p>
&mdash; John Sheehan (@johnsheehan) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan/statuses/444211751471431681">March 13, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Virtual containers will make API driven resources even more agile, nimble and scalable--not just for providers, but also for consumers. Everything we have right now I&rsquo;d consider to be a retail API market&mdash;where even though APIs are sold b2b, they are generally a one-size fits all API solution. Think about when API resources become modular, customizable, scalable, wholesale resources that can be bought and sold, and deployed anywhere, making all digital assets into commodities that are ready for use in the API economy.</p>
<p>In preparation for some research on the subject, I pulled together my stories on this subject from the last couple months:</p>

<p>Last week at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">#APIStrat Amsterdam</a>, I moderated, and presented in a session that was called API service descriptions. I gave the talk for the first 15 minutes, then Sumit Sharma (<a href="https://twitter.com/sumitcan">@sumitcan</a>), Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>), and Ruben Verborgh (<a href="https://twitter.com/RubenVerborgh">@RubenVerborgh</a>) followed me-- the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqQxM6PAuh0">full video is on Youtube</a> if you are interested.</p>
<p>Over the last couple months I've been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">doing a deeper dive</a> into the area of <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, with a specific look at API definition formats from <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="/admin/blog/RAML">RAML</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger</a>, so the session was intended to help me continue the conversation, in person, on the stage at #APIStrat Amsterdam.

<p>Ole provides a nice overview of the three leading API definition formats, giving API providers a good side-by-side summary that can be used when deciding which format to support. I will work with Ole to help keep the numbers up to date, and include in my final research white paper for API design when finished.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.evercam.io/">Internet of things (Iot), and security camera API platform evercam.io</a> has submitted the API definition for their camera API to the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API Commons</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been impressed with the amount of leadership that is coming out of this new startup in a potentially very political, and inevitable aspect of the API economy&mdash;cameras.</p>
<p>Marco Herbst (<a href="https://twitter.com/marcoherbst">@marcoherbst</a>) of evercam.io approached me during <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">#APIStrat in Amsterdam</a> and expressed interest in submitting their <a href="https://api.evercam.io/v1/swagger.json">Swagger API definition</a> into the commons, and this last weekend we created the API Commons manifest and published to the commons.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc" target="_blank"><img style="border: 0px solid #000;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When I spoke with Marco several months ago about API Commons, he took the importance of submitting an API definition to heart. By doing so evercam.io is saying that their API definition is significant in their industry, and something that others in the industry should follow.</p>
<p>This type of stance in an industry like Iot is going to become crucial in encouraging not just manufacturers to adhere to a common format, but also saving application developers and data scientists time when their are building Iot solutions.</p>
<p>Thanks evercam.io for sharing your API definition with the world, and taking your role and responsibility in defining an interface to a very important layer of the API economy, so seriously.</p>

<p>Here at developer.apievangelist.com you will find APIs that give you access to the content I curate and turn into stories, the analysis I provide on the API space, and companies, tools and other resources that I use make API Evangelist go around.</p>
<p>Sometimes I will roll out APIs as separate projects, and other times I will roll them out here, the central API area for API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m working to separate out some of my resources, much like other companies do in the space, and allow my internal systems to read / write, while also providing public and partner access to these resources. I am even working to create premium, pay for use API resources, but most of the time you will find my APIs are free.</p>
<p>If there is anything you&rsquo;d like to see me publish, let me know. You can use the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/developer-api-evangelist/issues">issue management for the Github repository</a> that houses this project to share any comments, thoughts or issues. Thanks for tuning in!</p>

<p>Last week at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">#APIStrat in Amsterdam</a>, I had the pleasure of watching a keynote by Romain Huet (<a href="https://twitter.com/romainhuet">@romainhuet</a>), Developer Advocate at Twitter, aptly titled &ldquo;connecting to the pulse of the planet&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of watching Romain give this talk twice now, and he really delivers&mdash;you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ" target="_blank">watch the whole video on Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>Romain used Twitter as a conduit for not just one, but two live Internet of things (Iot) demos. First he took a live selfie of him and the audience with a Raspberry Pi camera he had developed, and second he made a drone take off on stage using commands he sent via Twitter.</p>
<p>When talking to Romain earlier in Amsterdam, we were discussing APIs and Iot, and I said that Twitter seems to be a wonderful gateway for developers, when it came to connecting devices to the Internet. As an API driven messaging channel, developers just get Twitter and its APIs, so it makes sense we&rsquo;d use this familiar channel for exploration communication in the Internet of things.</p>
<p>Twitter works well as a gateway API to Iot for developers because of its familiarity and ease of use, but it also immediately makes it social, allowing us to open up Iot communications to a trusted network, or even the public. While we don&rsquo;t want every device in our lives immediately social, it works well for us to learn new thing, allowing us to learn using tools we are already familiar with, and have a network of established friends.</p>
<p>Like it or not, I think many Iot devices will come pre-configured to work with our common social networks, and as the Iot world matures, we will find more logical ways to communicate with these devices in our lives&mdash;realizing that not everything needs to social and on the web, but in the early days we&rsquo;ll depend on these characteristics to understand how to make devices and sensors communicate.</p>

<p>As I go through the management of my 60+ research sites that make up my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>, I can't help but think about how I can automate specific aspects of the process. This is the way my custom built platform works, I have workflows and tasks I accomplish each day, and as I have time, I will write scripts and automate where I can.</p>
<p>In an ordinary week I will process hundreds of blog feeds, tweets and new APIs, and sometimes I&rsquo;m tempted to automated my curation, sorting, tagging and other aspects of what I do, but then I find valuable nuggets on company sites, blog and other places. Valuable insight that my algorithms wouldn't necessarily find, things that I can use in stories across the API Evangelist network, as well as expand my own knowledge.</p>
<p>Each day I work to strike this balance between manually monitoring the API space, and automating what I do. I am constantly re-evaluating whether something is better automated, and at what point does something need my critical eye.</p>
<p>As I write this post, I can't help but think about all the talk of automation via the web, mobile apps and Internet of things (Iot) each day, and hope that we all can find restraint, and apply critical thinking around how we best use Internet enabled technology in our lives&mdash;minimizing what we lose by automating our worlds.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-handshake.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a wave of blog posts about additions to the developer and partner programs, of some of the leading APIs in the industry, making me think its time for some more research into the area. Partner programs come in several shapes and sizes, and go by different names, and are something I would like to understand better. I have several Evernote folders full of research on API partner programs, now I just need to polish it and publish it here on the blog, and possibly give it its own research repository on Github.</p>
<p>Many companies consider their API partner programs, a type of partner all by itself. However when I talk about partner or developer programs, it is about establishing multiple tiers of API access, within an API developer ecosystem.  When most think of APIs, a vision of an open, public API comes to mind&mdash;when in reality, many APIs will have multiple levels of access, with public just being the first rung of the partner ladder.</p>
<p>Some APIs start with signing up to be a partner, and require developers share details of their integration idea, before they can gain access to an API. <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/form_ecosystem.html?cmp=usbrb&amp;cm=s&amp;csr=watson.site_20140319&amp;cr=deveco&amp;ct=usbrb301&amp;cn=sec3partnerapp">IBM does this with their Watson platform</a>, requiring developers to share their idea, and wait for approval before they can access resources.  I always recommend providing a open access version of API resources, something that is self-service, and can be accessed 24/7 by developers, but this won&rsquo;t be applicable with all APIs.</p>
<p>To find solid examples of API partner programs, I wanted to start with the API pioneers, as they have been doing this a while, and have a great deal of experience managing very large, mature developer ecosystems.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/salesforce/salesforce-logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Salesforce</strong><br /> This early pioneer in the API space crafted their <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/partners/overview/">AppExchange Partner Program</a> to have two separate models that developers can take advantage of: ISVforce allowing developers to build, market, and sell apps only to salesforce.com customers at 15% cut, and Force.com Embedded which allows developers to build, market, and sell apps to any customer, with a 25% cut for Saleforce. They know how to do it right, with a dedicated partner community, complete with events and news for software vendors and consultants to tap after joining, then being approved for the Saleforce AppExchange Partner Program.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong><br /> To meet the demand for quality technical talent, Amazon provides the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/certification/">AWS Certification Program</a>. Amazon provides training and certification of three types of partners: solutions architect, developer and sysops administrator&mdash;allowing for an associate, professional and master levels of each certification. Amazon&rsquo;s focus is on identifying the best quality developer talent to support the demand within its cloud ecosystem, and less about providing access to API resources, which it's business model manages just fine.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ebay/ebay.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>eBay</strong><br /> The king of online auctions, eBay is up next with their <a href="https://www.ebaypartnernetwork.com">partner network</a>, which is all about developers, registering and getting a revenue share in the commerce they bring to the network. The bar is pretty low for being an eBay partner, which requires your web site to be functioning, have a phone number and bank account.  Of course you have to agree to their <a href="https://publisher.ebaypartnernetwork.com/PublisherRegPSA">network agreement</a>, adhere to their code of conduct, and respect their <a href="https://publisher.ebaypartnernetwork.com/PublisherRegPP">privacy policy</a>. While eBay is looking to qualify their developers, they are motivated by growing their network, and generating more revenue.</p>
<p>After looking at the early API pioneers, the next place to look is amongst the leading social networks, who also have experience in managing very large developer ecosystems, yet establishing their own approaches to successful API partner programs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/facebook/facebook-logo.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong><br /> First up in the social realm is <a href="http://www.facebook-pmdcenter.com/">Facebook with their preferred marking developers (PMD)</a>, which allows developers to apply for three types of PMD: Strategic, Facebook Exchange (FBX), and Mobile Measurement.  Facebook provides PMD with a badge to demonstrate their certification, and program updates, case studies, white papers and other resource they will need to be successful. Facebook PMDs are showcased in a directory, allowing any business to search and find the resources they need to build apps, tools and features on top of Facebook APIs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/linkedin/linkedin-logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong><br /> After Facebook, the business social network LinkedIn has invested heavily in their <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/certified-developer-program">certified developer program (CDP)</a> lately. CDPs are certified by LinkedIn as the best developers available on the LinkedIn platform. As part of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1J8EnvfY9HeuuYPlW53y2FZ3PlO-ltsrn9szkwXUnaD0/viewform">CDP application process</a>, developers have to adhere to the linked in <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/linkedin-platform-guidelines">platform policies and guidelines</a>, and await LinkedIn approval that a company meets their approval. CDP is one of <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/partner">10 separate partner programs</a> that LinkedIn has.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/twitter/tweet-bird-blue-white.png" alt="" width="90" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong><br /> Next up, Twitter is looking to establish the best products and services, that help business thrive on Twitter, using their <a href="https://business.twitter.com/partners">Twitter Partner Marketplace</a>. Twitter if focused on developing product partners with superior apps built on Twitter API, and marketing partners who can deliver the vital services Twitter users need.  To<a href="https://business.twitter.com/partners/twitter-certified-program-application"> apply to become a partner</a>, you must swear to be a good partner to Twitter, follow the guidelines, rules, and the &ldquo;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms">developer rules of the road</a>&rdquo;, which is Twitter&rsquo;s API terms of use, as well follow all trademark guidelines dictated by the platform.</p>
<p>After looking at the early API pioneers, as well as the leading social APIs, and each of their approaches to delivering partner programs, you start seeing the possible motivations behind the leading partner programs&mdash;not all partner and developer programs are created equal. While all these API leaders have been working on their own version of their partner programs, one company came along and forever changed how developer programs could work.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apple/apple-logo.gif" alt="" width="90" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Apple</strong><br /> To meet the demand for mobile applications, Apple developed their own&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">developer program</a>, allowing developers to select an enrollment type of individual or organization, submit their applications, then purchase and activate their developer accounts&mdash;allowing them to develop, test then distribute apps via the App Store. The Apple Developer Program doesn&rsquo;t just give developers ability to publish in the App Store, then generate revenue for Apple through app purchases, it open up access for developers to be ability to partake in in-app purchases, iAd rich media ads, volume purchases and take advantage of custom B2B app opportunities. Apple's approach gave us all the app marketplace model to apply in our own API ecosystems, and also provides a model for partnership that is less about just developers, apps and API access, and more about distribution to a leading mobile app ecosystem.</p>
<p>This post was triggered after me reading blog posts from Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn about changes to their partner programs. But after diving into more research, I ended up having a conversation about potential blueprints for API partner programs within our federal government. Unfortunately there are very few models for this new type of API driven partnerships in our federal government, but two existing programs I think come close, are from the USPS and IRS.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/become-an-integrator.htm" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/usps/usps-logo.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>USPS<a href="https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/become-an-integrator.htm" target="_blank"></a></strong><br /> As with other API providers, the <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/become-an-integrator.htm">United States Postal Service (USPS) Web Tools Integrator program</a> is more about identifying quality developer talent, than it is about access to API resources. To be part of the USPS Web Tools Integrator program, developers just need to read the policy guide, agree to all the terms and conditions, register, request to be listed, then await verification and approval by USPS developer program staff. With the USPS example we are getting closer to the precedent I&rsquo;m looking for, but really falls short in all the characteristics I&rsquo;m hoping to see in a federal government API partner program.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/e-File-Providers-&amp;-Partners/Become-an-Authorized-e-file-Provider" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/bw-irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>IRS</strong><br /> The only model for API partnerships between the federal government and the private sector is the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/e-File-Providers-&amp;-Partners/Become-an-Authorized-e-file-Provider">IRS, Authorized e-File Provider program</a>.  The IRS provides developers with planning tools to help them determine their eligibility, the ability to submit an application, which before approval must pass an application suitability check, business background check, as well as individual background checks, which requires being fingerprinted by a trained professional.</p>
<p>Like the USPS example, the IRS partner program still isn't 100% of what I&rsquo;m looking for, but for now it is the best we have, and is something that really resonates within government circles. My goal in continuing this research is to provide my audience with leading examples of API partner programs from the private sector, but I also am looking to stimulate conversation within the federal government about what API partner programs might look like.</p>
<p>Looking through the approaches by Salesforce, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and even USPS and the IRS, give me a good idea of the common motivations for deploying a partner program within an API developer ecosystem, as well as some of the building blocks that are necessary to be successful. the partner programs I've reviewed are primarily about identifying the best developers and applications within API ecosystems, that businesses can leverage when integrating with these platforms. Apple and Salesforce brings some interesting audience reach, and distribution opportunities for developers, but the IRS is the only one that comes close to what I&rsquo;m looking for, in that they use partner program to control who has access to API resources, including the ability to write data to the platform--I think this will be key to other federal government APis.</p>
<p>Overall I think there are things to be learned from all of the APIs listed above. This is why I spend time going through their programs, in hopes of understanding all the best practices available in deploying successful API partner programs. Hopefully you can use my research in your own API partnership efforts, whether your are looking to deploy an API partner program in the public or the private sector.</p>

<p>Last week at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">#APIStrat Amsterdam</a>, I moderated, and presented in a session that was called API service descriptions. I gave the talk for the first 15 minutes, then Sumit Sharma (<a href="https://twitter.com/sumitcan">@sumitcan</a>), Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>), and Ruben Verborgh (<a href="https://twitter.com/RubenVerborgh">@RubenVerborgh</a>) followed me-- the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqQxM6PAuh0">full video is on Youtube</a> if you are interested.</p>
<p>Over the last couple months I've been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">doing a deeper dive</a> into the area of <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, with a specific look at API definition formats from <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="/admin/blog/RAML">RAML</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger</a>, so the session was intended to help me continue the conversation, in person, on the stage at #APIStrat Amsterdam. I'm happy I did, because Ole came to the table with some valuable data on API definitions, that save me some valuable research hours.</p>
<p>I'm breaking up his work into several smaller posts, you can find his <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/SmartBear_Software/api-strat-2014metadataformatsshort">full deck on slideshare</a>, first up is a comparison overview of each API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger:</p>

<p>Ole provides a nice overview of the three leading API definition formats, giving API providers a good side-by-side summary that can be used when deciding which format to support. I will work with Ole to help keep the numbers up to date, and include in my final research white paper for API design when finished.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time looking through the websites of API companies, trying to understand not just the way they do business, but their role in their overall industry, or possibly how they influence other industries.</p>
<p>I have been spending more time looking through the <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com/index.html">payment API space</a> lately, and recently pulled together a list of <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com/companies.html">key players</a> in this space, as well as the <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common building blocks</a> being used across the sector.</p>
<p>Much like other significant areas of APIs like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/11/common-building-blocks-of-cloud-apis/">cloud computing</a>, messaging, geo, and social, I can&rsquo;t help but consider the impact these payment APIs will have across all business sectors, and our government.</p>
<p>The 50 building blocks I identified as part of my payment API research will not just be the essential components of the payment API space, but will ultimately be some of the building blocks of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2010/09/25/the-api-economy/">API economy</a> itself--take a look.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1higNDr" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/apitools-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API Infrastructure provider 3Scale</a> has moved beyond just API management, with a launch of a new API integration service called <a href="http://bit.ly/1higNDr">APITools</a>. 3Scale, one of the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/">original API management providers</a>, is moving out of just providing tools for API providers, and now targeting developers who are depending on API services for their web and mobile applications&mdash;catering to both sides of the API infrastructure coin.</p>
<p>As developers depend on more API driven resources for their web and applications, the need to be in tune with the inner workings of an API is increasing. We don't just need access to the results of an API anymore, we need to understand the composition, performance and overall availability of the web APIs we depend on. The number of tools and services dedicated to assisting developers with <a title="API Integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/">API Integration</a> is one of the fastest growing API areas, right along with <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Getting In Front Of The APIs You Depend On</strong><br /> APITools allows you to add all the APIs you depend on, whether they are public APIs like Twitter and LinkedIn, or the homegrown services of your own company and your partners. Once connected, APITools does all the work to profile communication with APIs, and how applications are consuming them.</p>
<p><strong>Establish Middleware Between Your Apps and APIs</strong><br /> Without API integration tools, the inside of API calls are a black box. APITools doesn't just profile API transactions, it allows you to establish a middleware platform between your apps and the API they depend on. This middleware allows you to transform and inject elements into API transactions, allowing you to not just understand API operations, but force them to execute as you desire.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1higNDr" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apitools/apitools-monitor-home-page.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Evolved Awareness Of How Your APIs Operate</strong><br /> Once web API services are connected with APITools, and the middleware configured, the learning begins via a visual dashboard, providing you with intelligence on all API operations. This awareness of API operations can become real-time, with notifications of API events, staying in tune with operations beyond the dashboard&mdash;shining a real-time light on what used to be a black box.</p>
<p>API integration services like APITools will do for developers, what API management tools have done for API providers. Before there were API infrastructure tools like 3Scale, API providers had very little insight into how APIs were being consumed, and API management services work to provide valuable insight into how they are truly being consume. As developers depend on more APIs, they need insight into how APIs perform, and the bottlenecks and errors that impact their applications&mdash;providing a much needed awareness, which is essential to successful applications.</p>
<p>Its nothing new for API infrastructure providers to deliver services for both API providers and consumers, but <a href="http://bit.ly/1higNDr">APITools</a> from 3Scale represents the maturing of the API integration space, and both sides of the API coin needing control, and insight into API operations. APIs aren't just hobby mashups anymore, and we need tools that help us ensure a higher quality of service across our APIs, and applications that depend on them.</p>

        <p>I was reading the news about "<a href="http://blog.bandpage.com/2014/03/31/bandpage-raises-funds-to-help-musicians-reach-and-monetize-billions-of-fans-worldwide/">BandPage raising $9.25M to help musicians reach and monetize billions of fans worldwide</a>" today, which in itself isn't all that exciting. Sorry, while VC investment in companies that have APIs is a relevant data point, I just don't think its newsworthy enough to warrant its own blog post, usually just a tweet.</p>
<p>One thing that I did find interesting in this post, was the image depicting the distribution via the BandPages platform:</p>

<p>This image provides a very simple and clear way to articulate the value delivered via an API driven platform--showing users what BandPages does in a single image.</p>
<p>I wish every API I came across had an image like this, demonstrating what value the API delivers, in a very visual way.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/03/31/should-government-provide-download-or-api-of-government-data-resources/">Should Government Provide Download Or API Of Government Data Resources?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-download-vs-api.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just got an email from an open data, API evangelist, working on a "New Zealand cross government program that is set up to deliver better public services for businesses and providing more and better APIs is a core vehicle that we have identified for that&rdquo;, who asked a question I see a lot, and thought I should do another post on:</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>Should government provide the full download of datasets or encourage API access of data assets?</em></strong></blockquote>
<p>The answer is both, but only if you have the resources to properly design, deploy, manage and evangelize the APIs, and you should always start with providing the full download of datasets.  Many open data folks feel APIs are unnecessary when you have the full data download, but in reality this is a narrow view of the world&mdash;not everyone has the resources to consume entire data downloads, and there are so many lessons for government to learn from when providing APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Always Provide Raw Data Downloads</strong><br /> Publishing of government data assets in machine readable formats like CSV, XML and JSON should be default for all government agencies. Period. If a dataset is not classified or contains personably identifiable information (PII), it should be available in a central location on government web sites for download.  This is where ALL government agencies should start, before embarking on any API.</p>
<p><strong>Deploy APIs When Resources Are Available</strong><br /> APIs should only be deployed by government agencies when they have the resources to do so properly. At the very least you should be able to properly design, deploy and respond via email requests around APIs in a timely manner. Nothing is more frustrating than integrating with an API where nobody is home. Also remember that EVERY API operations is short handed, even companies like Twilio and SendGrid could use more resources, so don&rsquo;t wait for the perfect resource levels before you launch, however you should make sure and give your APIs enough investment so that they will be successful.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Provide A Valuable Feedback Loop</strong><br /> A properly deployed API provides indirect and direct support channels which open up valuable feedback loops for API providers and their consumers, that just do not exist with downloads. APIs will bring government agencies and the consumers of their valuable data resources together, making data acquisition, and stewardship cycles much more meaningful and valuable to everyone involved.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Provide Valuable Analytics And Insight</strong><br /> With a data download you can only see how many times it was downloaded, with APIs an agency has the opportunity understand exactly how data assets are used. Modern API management solutions like <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a> provide very granular level measurement, accompanied with meaningful analytics that provide essential insight that can be used in the roadmap of how data will be gathered, organized and made available to the public.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Make Valuable Resources Accessible to All (Not Just Developers)</strong><br /> Every person I talk to who feel that government should only provide full data downloads and not APIs is a skilled data scientist or programmer. APIs make data assets available to EVERYONE, not just those who possess the skills. Not everyone has the time and resources to download, process and work with data downloads, and APIs go a long way to make valuable government resources available in ways that even non-developers can access, and put to use in even small ways that can make a big impact.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Keep Government Data Fresh And Up To Date</strong><br /> Sometimes by the time a developer downloads and integrates government data it can be already out of date. If government is looking to provide the highest quality service level agreement (SLA) or at least service accord with the public, they should look at providing APIs. With APIs developers can focus on what their applications do best and not become stewards of the data, leaving this role to those within government who are already closest to the acquisition and management of data&mdash;making government data much more real-time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.census.gov/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/digital-strategy/logos/census.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The only thing to prevent any government agency from deploying APIs is the available resources to deploy, manage and support properly, a bar that is getting lower and lower with the wealth of cloud based services available for designing, deploying, and management your API data assets that are locked up in spreadsheet, databases or even an existing agency website.  You don&rsquo;t have to be a developer or have investment from your IT to launch an API in 2014.</p>
<p>The poster child for this discussion that I use is the US Census Bureau, who struggled with this <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">same question of whether to provide download or API</a>, and is committed to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/08/22/delivering-value-for-developers-is-first-when-it-comes-to-the-census-bureau-apis/">delivering value to its data consumers</a>.  While there are other datasets within the US federal government that are just as valuable as census data, I&rsquo;ve yet to meet an agency who has the valuable data, technical skills, and the outward, public facing mission to truly internalize the value of both full data downloads and APIs.</p>
<p>This is a question I&rsquo;m sure I will answer numerous times each month for the next 10 years, but now I&rsquo;ll have this post to reference when responding to emails and tweets.</p>

<p>I am back in Los Angeles, after being in Amsterdam last week for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>. It's Monday morning, with the event ending Friday, and rather than being drained and exhausted, I'm still glowing and very charged and excited for APIs, after all the amazing discussions.</p>
<p>First off, thank you to <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> for making API Strategy &amp; Practice possible. Without 3Scale, not only would the event not exist, it would not have the tone that it does. 3Scale is investing in the conversation happening, with the priority being an open, inclusive community discussion around APIs&mdash;products, brands and companies are not the focus, API strategy and practice lead.</p>
<p>Second, thank you to all the sponsors, WSO2, IBM, Mulesoft, Pearson, BladeRunnerJS, Context.io, NGINX, Node1, API Days, Apiary, Application Developers Alliance, Amsterdam Marketing, Nordic APIs, SendGrid, and WIP. Without these company&rsquo;s support, the conversation wouldn't happen.</p>
<p>Third, thank you to the 96 speakers who elevated the API conversation at #APIStrat, bringing the stories of their API efforts to the event. There are already three of the talks up on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">APIStrat Youtube channel</a>, and the rest will be going up over the next couple weeks&mdash;if you weren't there, you have an opportunity to hear the talks.</p>
<p>I know <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> shares my vision of the event, and once again we nailed it! #APIStrat was the open and inclusive discussion of APIs I feel is critical for moving the industry forward. It is this type of open, vendor neutral discussion occur regularly around the globe, otherwise we just operate within our silos, and will never achieve the interoperability, integration and reciprocity that is needed to make the API economy work in a healthy way.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for making such an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apistratams&amp;src=typd">#APIStratAMS</a>!</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time each week reading the blog feeds, and twitter streams from the best API providers in the space. In my opinion this represents the lowest hanging fruit in my API monitoring, where the stories just land in my lap, delivered to me by my feeds&mdash;then once I've picked all this fruit, I find myself looking through the Twitter followers of many of these APIs.</p>
<p>The Twitter followers can contain some really interesting gems from across the API sector that I wouldn't find through my normal channels. By manually browsing the Twitter followers for APIs I&rsquo;m looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>People</strong> - Interesting folks doing innovative stuff across the API space.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Companies</strong> - New startups that have trouble cutting through the noise in space.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Stories</strong> - The lesser known stories that I see when looking through my unique lens.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong> - API related services that might be shifting from the norm, pushing the API space forward.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong> - Developers are notoriously bad at marketing their work, and I find some cool tools on Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have tools that I have developed that help me filter, search and easily look through thousands of Twitters followers, but I also find manually looking through them allows me to find the gems that my algorithm can&rsquo;t always find. A balance of programmatic and human approach to scanning the followers seems to work best.</p>
<p>Some of my best companies, individuals and stories I&rsquo;ve written, have come from trolling through Twitter followers. While I focus on my core feeds to understand the space daily, each week I try to remember to expand my network, adding new users, and blogs to my network, and Twitter followers is a great place to do this.</p>

<p>The first day at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> is always workshops that expose you the world of APIs, and #APIStrat in Amsterdam next week is no different. We had four workshops, but successful development and deployment best practices to secure, monitor and manage APIs, by Isabelle Mauny, Director of Product Management at <a href="http://wso2.com/">WSO2</a> is already sold out.</p>
<p>That leaves us with three workshops currently available:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API-First Development with RAML from Daniel Feist, Architect @ <a href="http://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a></li>
<li>Introduction to APIs from Kirsten Hunter and D. Keith Casey</li>
<li>CitySDK APIs Boosting Civic App Development from Hanna Niemi-Hugaerts, Project Manager at Helsinki, Forum Virium</li>
</ul>
<p>I know most of them are getting full and I see emails coming with regularly with new registrations, so if you are interesting in participating in any of these workshops head over to the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/workshops.php">workshops page #APIStrat</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that #APIStrat isn't just for the seasoned developer, there are many sessions to get you up to speed on APIs, including Kirsten&rsquo;s and Keith&rsquo;s Introduction to 101, and the workshops on Civic API hacking is meant for everyone looking to make a change in our government works.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you there next week.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.brandwatch.com/api/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/brandwatch-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Content and data aggregation provider Gnip just <a href="http://blog.gnip.com/brandwatch-api/">announced a new API from their &ldquo;Plugged In Partner&rdquo; Brandwatch</a>, who launched the Brandwatch API, giving developers access to social data, filtered through their a brand lens, so they can build custom tools, visualizations and other apps around Twitter data.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.brandwatch.com/api/">Brandwatch API</a> itself isn't that groundbreaking, there are plenty of other social analysis APIs offering similar features, but the fact that it was an API built on top of Gnip, one of the only approved Twitter firehose providers remaining, I found to be interesting.</p>
<p>Gnip is trusted Twitter provider, with firehose access to Twitter data, and Brandwatch is a trusted Gnip partner, providing an API with access to Twitter data. At this point I can't tell if I&rsquo;m in a dream, or a dream within a dream?</p>
<p>I feel like we've moved into a strange post Twitter API apocalypse land where turmoil in the Twitter ecosystem has died down, Gnip and other Twitter partners are thriving, and we are even seeing new APIs being built on Twitter data. I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about this, to be honest I can't tell if I&rsquo;m awake anymore.</p>

        <p><a href="http://apiratings.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/api-rating-agency-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adding the <a href="http://apiratings.org/">API Rating Agency</a> to my stack of companies who deliver in the area of <a title="API discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a>.  The API Rating Agency helps API consumers understand each API provider on a whole list of metrics, ranging from terms of service to platform uptime.</p>
<p>Rating of APIs has been a nut I&rsquo;ve been trying to crack for a couple years now, resulting in a ranking system that is more human, than algorithm&mdash;so I know how hard  it is to go through hundreds of APIs, and develop some sort of coherent ranking system.</p>
<p>The API Rating Agency is a work in progress. I know they are hard at work reviewing API providers, so if you have an API make sure and contact them and see how you can put together a package that will help them understand your API.</p>
<p>To achieve the scale we need in the API economy, we will have to have an unbiased, 3rd party ranking, kind of sorta like Moody&rsquo;s or Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, but hopefully more neutral. Developers have to be able to understand which platforms they can depend on.</p>
<p>You can catch Jonathan Bourguignon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jon_bou">@jon_bou</a>) of the API Rating Agency at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice next week in Amsterdam</a>, participating in the discovery and trust session&mdash;I hope to see you there!</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.strandbeest.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/strandbeest.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm going through the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">schedule for API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> next week in Amsterdam, getting intimate with each keynote, panel, and session, and their speakers.    On day one we have a keynote from Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), API Architect at Layer7 titled, "Self-Replication, Strandbeest, and the Game of Life What von Neumann, Jansen, and Conway can teach us about scaling the API economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have not seen this talk by Mike, so I have no idea what he is planning, but I have to share an epiphany I had when I first contacted Mike about speaking at #APIStrat Amsterdam. Mike had responded to my initial email asking me what I was interested in having him talk about, which I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Mike&rsquo;s approach to storytelling, so I&rsquo;m leaving it up to him. However Mike responded with a link to <a href="http://www.strandbeest.com/">Strandbeest</a>, simply stating he would like to incorporate this into a talk.</p>
<p>As I watched Strandbeest I had a realization, this was a physical manifestation of what I envision as API driven application architecture for the API economy. Over the years I had built up visualizations in my mind of what architecture will look like when you are building applications with not 1 or 2, or 10 or 20 API, but hundreds of API driven resources, all working together in concert for a single outcome. The Strandbeest is the first physical object I've seen to come close to what i was seeing in my minds eye, and even more telling was that it was Mike Amundsen who introduced me to this object.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-mind-blown.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you watch the <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">Strandbeest video</a>, imagine each tube as a single API, and each resulting "beest" as a system or application you intend to build with APIs. Imagine being an architect at this scale, orchestrating hundreds of APIs into a workflow, or series of workflows that produces a virtual "strandbeest" that doesn't just run on the beach, but operates within the API economy at a global scale.</p>
<p>Ok, I know this is pretty deep shit. I hope you can follow my groove, and see the same future. If you are like me, I&rsquo;m beside myself with anticipation of Mike&rsquo;s talk in Amsterdam. Mike is not just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE DOMAIN EXPERT</span> who is going to visualize architecture at this level, this far into the future--he&rsquo;s got the storytelling chops to help the rest of get up to speed, steering us towards a healthier version of the API economy.</p>
<p>I hope you are going to join us in <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">Amsterdam next week for API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>. The ability to not just hear stories like Mike&rsquo;s, but actually join him in a conversation about how we visualize, and ultimately orchestrate an API economy that flows like Strandbeests on the beach, is why <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist produce #APIStrat.</p>

<p>I use both <a href="https://bitly.com/">Bitly</a> and <a href="http://goo.gl/">Google</a> shortened URLs to track activity across my networks. I don&rsquo;t just track click throughs, I also track image impressions for many of my projects and partners. This usage of shortened URLs lets me quantity the scope of my network, and understand interest across the network in the form of impression and click-throughs.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/i-always-want-to-see-the-data-behind-and-so-does-plotly/">talking with Plot.ly about their embed strategy for API driven data visualizations</a>, the topic of a sensible API branding has floated to the top of my story list again. I consider an APIs branding strategy to be an important building block that contributes to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">politics of an API</a> and its ecosystem (both internal and external). If an API branding strategy is too strict, it can turn developers off from using your API, but a well planned branding strategy that includes a healthy suite of embeddable tools can be a serious asset, and go a long way in satisfying internal concerns about brand integrity--which is major concern for companies when it comes to API deployment.</p>
<p>What is a branding strategy? At its simplest it is about providing your API developers with a set of simple links and / or images that they should publish on their site, providing attribution for API resources consumed. A complete branding strategy provides the links, images and possibly JavaScript tools, as well as guidance on how they should be published on websites and within apps, providing proper attribution.</p>
<p>In the context of a basic API branding strategy, URL shorteners can provide a wealth of data about the scope of your API ecosystem, as well has help measure specific activity across deployments by your developers.  You should be able to quantity the impressions and click throughs everywhere your API resources are put to use. Of course, a healthy API partner structure also allows for developers to opt out of tracking and possibly deploy white label solutions.</p>
<p>What does your branding strategy look like, and how to you measure the reach and activity across your API ecosystem?</p>

<p>Speakers for the API discovery and trust session are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Bruno Pedro (<a href="https://twitter.com/bpedro">@bpedro</a>), CTO at <a href="https://cloudwork.com/">CloudWork</a></li>

</ul>
<p>It will be tough to decide between the API design and development and this one in the first session, on Day 1 for me. Thankfully that everything is recorded!</p>
<p><a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a> is an area we have a lot of work to do to prepare for the explosive growth in the space. It is tough to find quality APIs, understand the differences between APIs, and know who you can really depend on after you&rsquo;ve integrated into your applications.  This will be an important session.</p>

<p>In preparation for a <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">fireside chat with Tyler Singletary at API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> next week I&rsquo;m reviewing many of what I consider the political API building blocks, and reading some of my past stories to refresh my thoughts on the most pressing topics in the space.</p>
<p>The technical building blocks of APIs are pretty clear at this point, and the business of APIs has been being hammered out over the last five or so years, by <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API infrastructure providers like 3Scale</a>, but the politics of APIs are an aspect of the API economy we are going to see become more and more of a hot topic as the space continues its growth.</p>
<p>There are a handful of building blocks that are clearly driving how APIs are used (or not used):</p>

Branding Guidelines set the tone for how partners and developers can use the resources and assets made available via an API. The branding guidelines will provide a framework for attributing the API owner, how resources can be displayed and provide visual assets to support the company brand. As with terms of use and privacy policies, branding guidelines need protect the API owner but also provide developers with enough freedom to innovate.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Terms of Use / Conditions</strong>&nbsp;- Terms of Use provide a legal framework for developers to operate within. They set the stage for the business development relationships that will occur within an API ecosystem. TOS should protect the API owners company, assets and brand, but should also provide assurances for developers who are building businesses on top of an API. Make sure an APIs TOS pass insepection with the lawyers, but also strike a healthy balance within the ecosystem and foster innovation.</td>

<p>These building blocks are the acting as the control valve for API ecosystems, setting the tone for how much access, control and influence both developers and end-users wil have when it comes to API operations.</p>
<p>There are other elements that will affect an API, and its community, like the amount of transparency a provider embraces, and externally from laws and regulation from the government, but these seven building blocks will have the biggest impact on what is possible when integrating with an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the politics of APIs is the overlap with the business and tech of APis. There are political building blocks that are more technical:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/tech-business-politics-03-2014.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<ul>
<li>oAuth</li>
<li>Rate Limits</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Stability</li>
<li>Error Codes</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are building blocks that have more to do with business, than the tech, but go along way in influencing the politics of an API:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-Service</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Roadmap</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Changelog</li>
<li>Budget</li>
<li>Revenue-Share</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all related to busines operations but will all play important role in the internal and external politics of API operations. While every API building block contributes to overall politics in some way there are a small group that I think truly overlap the tech, business and politics of APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Security</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why Github plays such an important role in API operations. It isn't just about code anymore, it is about the operations, reaching and supporting customers, and defining the licensing around API operations--all critical elements vital to achieving a political balance that necessary for a thriving API community.</p>
<p>As with the business of APIs, it will take us years to figure out all the finer points of the politics surrounding APIs, and with each new business sector that APis evolve into, we will find new struggles. Some of the issues we've seen emerge between API providers and consumers in ecosystems like Twitter, security challenges like Snpachat, and legal battles like Oracle vs. Google are just the tip of the iceberg. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to have more tools, services, and open resources to help API providers and consumers navigate terms of service, as well as more open dicusssions around content, data and even API interface licensing. This is why we do <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>--to have open conversations between API leaders, and discuss the biggest challenges we face in the space.</p>
<p>I'm stoked to have Tyler come to Amsterdam and continue conversations with me on the main stage, around the politics of APIs. Like me, Tyler is extremeley passionate about the legal and political challenges we face, but even though we don't always see eye to eye, I thoroughly enjoy our exchanges because of his passion and understanding of the space. Tyler has some <a href="http://apivoice.com/2013/11/25/early-thoughts-on-robotsjson/">pretty important ideas like robots.json</a>, that we we need to explore, and some serious experience in the space from running Klout, that we can all learn from.</p>
<p>As always let me know if there are any issues you'd like to see me cover from the politics of APIs, it is why I started <a href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a>, and I am happy to even bring it up on stage as we discuss the politics of APIs in <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">Amsterdam next week at #APIStrat</a>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/job-postings-provide-view-into-internal-api-efforts/">Job Postings Provide View Into Internal API Efforts</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bluejeans.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bluejeans/bluejeans-video-conferencing.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The API space has been pretty easy to monitor until recently, with most API efforts being public, but lately everything is trending is towards internal APIs, making it a lot harder to track on what some companies are up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for new signals I can use to track on what companies are up to when it comes to their API strategy. A signal I&rsquo;ve been using for a while, but is an increasingly important part of my monitoring, is the job posting for API architect, developer and evangelists.</p>
<p>An example of this is the posting for an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/12704834" target="_blank">API platform engineer from video collaboration platform BlueJeans</a>. We know that <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/09/18/leveraging-apis-in-the-cloud-to-make-video-conferencing-truly-ubiquitous/" target="_blank">BlueJeans gets APIs when it comes to integration</a>, but there isn&rsquo;t much public discussion about their internal API initiatives or any publicly available developer program.</p>
<p>According to the job posting <a href="http://bluejeans.com/" target="_blank">BlueJeans</a> is looking for a developer to help in, "building and scaling the API platform of our cloud application". It is pretty clear that APIs is what make the video collaboration platform operate, and I will add BlueJeans to my list of companies using APIs, just not into showcasing it publicly.</p>
<p>In the future, job postings will be just one of many signals we use to understand how companies are using Apis. I&rsquo;ll do what I can to get companies to share stories publicly about their APIs, but in some cases I don&rsquo;t think that companies are ready, and not used to talking about their operations in this way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2014</span>

<p>Its always funny to come across the hyperbolic folks that exist in technology, that blindly believe that technology will save us. I seem to get attract a lot of these people with my API Evangelism (its the name), which on the surface I can imagine seems like I'm advocating use of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">APIS BY EVERYONE</span>, in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL SITUATIONS</span>--when in reality, this is furthest from the case.</p>
<p>At API Evangelist, I focus on having <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conversations about APIs in all situations</span>, but not necessarily the deployment or consumption of APIs. I don't think APIs by themselves are a solution. I think APIs employed by a savvy business and technology team, providing access access to valuable data, content and other resources to consumers, are a good idea. My missions is for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>businesses to understand how APIs can potentially benefit them, and change how they operate internally, with partners and the public at large and even influence how an entire industry operates</li>
<li>government of all shapes and sizes to know that APIs can help democratize access to public resources, empowering the public to help share the load of governing cities, counties, states / provinces and countries</li>
<li>every individual to realize the messages, photos, banking, location, and other information they depend on via their cell phone travels through APIs, and that they, the end-user has an important role to play</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not want every business and object in our life to have an API and be connected to the Internet. I evangelize an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">awareness and healthy understanding of APIs by everyon</span>e, as well as sensible approaches to designing, deploying, managing and evangelizing APIs.</p>
<p>This is what happens at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>. If we were just pushing APIs for everything, the name would be something like APIs - Do It!  In reality the conference in Amsterdam next week will be a mix of business and technical folks, listening to the stories from API leaders, about their strategy and practices from their company trenches--taking what they learn back home to apply in their own businesses and organizations.</p>
<p>It makes me very happy that so many folks are waking up to the conversation, and it isn&rsquo;t just happening in the US. We will be talking <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">APIs in Amsterdam next week</a>, as well as <a href="http://apidays.io/">Berlin and Barcelona in May at API Days</a>--spreading the conversation.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://plot.ly/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/plotly/plotly-logo.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a love of infographics, mostly because they more graphic, than info, and <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/17/2013-is-year-the-infographic-comes-out-of-closet/">I&rsquo;ve stated before that all infographics should have the data behind them</a>. I&rsquo;ve been working with data of over 20 years, I thoroughly believe in its importance when used right, but it seriously pisses me off when it is distorted in support of any argument&mdash;whether I agree with the argument or not.</p>
<p>This sentiment is shared by a startup I was introduced this last week, called <a href="https://plot.ly/">Plot.ly</a>. I had a great conversation Nolan Browne the co-founder &amp; chief business officer at Plot.ly, and he conveyed to me about how serious Plot.ly is about providing embeddable, API driven data analysis and visualizations tools that really empower data stewards.</p>
<p><a href="https://plot.ly/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/plotly/plotly-visualizations.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>First, I really like Plot.ly because it is JSON driven. Next they provide you with all the web-based tool you need to import, manage and share data in a way that lets you collaborate and publish along the way.  Plot.ly even provides an API to help you manage everything about your data analysis and visualization work.</p>
<p>The most important thing about Plot.ly is that each visualization is embeddable, like a Youtube video, allowing you to share not just the visualization, but also the data behind it. Each embeddable Plot.ly visualizations contains the entire story behind it, allowing you to understand the credibility of the author, and how the data has evolved, and potentially adding your own stamp on its history with the ability to save, reverse engineer, and edit in your own Plot.ly account.</p>
<p>Plot.ly has some pretty impressive tools for importing, analyzing and visualizing data, but I think its samples and gallery, with the ability to save and fork the works of others which will make it work for the masses. Data stewards across the government, and private sector need not just the tools, but simple blueprints they can reverse engineer, helping them understand how they can better analyze and visualize their own data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with Plot.ly more, and I can tell I will have even more stories that will come from data analysis and visualization platform. Platforms like Plot.ly are going to play an ever increasing role in the API economy, unlocking valuable data resources across the public and private sector.</p>
