I have done a lot of research lately on the [API service provider][2] landscape. My goal is to understand who provides API delivery and management services, what they offer and help API owners understand the differences.

I wrote a [roundup of 11 of the API service providers on ProgrammableWeb][3] last week. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of all the providers, but of course a new one came out of the woodwork.

It wasn't a new API service provider like [Mashape][4] or [Apiary.io][5], it is a veteran player in the space, [Vordel][1]. Vordel has been around for almost 10 years and I would consider them part of the old guard of service oriented architecture (SOA) and web services providers, that existed before web APIs were cool.

Vordel provides a range of products we recognize with enterprise API deployments including [API Gateways][6], [XML firewalls][7] and [accelerators][8]. Vordel specializes in the legacy system connectors that are needed to bring existing enterprise systems into the new web API game.

The Vordel API Gateway compares to what I've seen from [Layer7][9] and [SOA Software][10], with the following key features:

  * Protocol translation for REST and SOAP
  * Versioning and lifecycle management
  * Caching of frequently used calls
  * Monitor, log and audit usage
  * Secure API from threats
  * Service level agreements (SLA)

Vordel has an impressive client list including the FBI, Coast Guard and Dunn
