<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2019/10/29/20-open-source-landing-pages-from-leading-api-providers/">After looking through 20 separate open source pages for leading API providers</a>, here are the building blocks of an open source page I&rsquo;ve identified.</p>

<h3>Innovation:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incubator</strong> - Providing details on a project incubation program.</li>

<li><strong>Podcast</strong> - Offering a regular podcast series covering open source.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Talent:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Careers</strong> - Providing a listing of available jobs involved with organization.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong> - Showcasing the team behind the open source offering.</li>
<li><strong>Apply</strong> - Publish a form that users can submit to apply for jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legal:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terms of Service </strong>- Publishing terms of service governing open source.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong> - Publishing a privacy policy governing open source.</li>
<li><strong>Code of Conduct</strong> - Publishing a code of conduct governing open source.</li>
</ul>
<p>That provides a pretty robust list of the elements any organization can consider when publishing their own open source page supporting the platform, and showcasing the contributions being made back to an organization&rsquo;s own community, as well as the communities of existing open source offerings. Helping improve the brand image for an organization, and encourage more participation in helping move forward individual open source projects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend companies showcase the open source projects they are putting to work in their platform, even if they aren&rsquo;t moving forward their own projects. The open source tools you depend on will appreciate the attention, and it will help you think about the bigger picture when it comes to the tooling you depend on. If you do have your own open source projects, it helps elevate the conversation to aggregate all of your projects onto a single page, and link prominently from your website. There are numerous benefits to having an organized open source effort, but the top two reasons I&rsquo;m seeing are to help improve the overall brand image, and for talent acquisition&mdash;two things that almost every API provider will benefit from.</p>
