<p>Here we are, wrapping up 2011.  I concluded my first full year immersed in the <a title="business of apis" href="/business_of_apis.php">business of APIs</a>, which started back in September 2010 with my <a title="first blog post on API Evangelist" href="/2010/09/25/hello-world/">first blog post on API Evangelist</a>, then by December I was the <a title="API Evangelist for Mimeo" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">API Evangelist for Mimeo</a>.</p>
<p>In 2011, I spent the entire year evangelizing for <a title="Mimeo" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a>, while also paying attention to the wider business of APIs, while writing for <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/profile/kinlane">ProgrammableWeb</a> and <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.  It&rsquo;s been an amazing year and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot, but it has left me wanting even more in 2012.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that focusing my evangelism on a single API is important, it helps put into practice, what I write about as an analyst in the API space.  In 2011, I was exposed to a lot, but in 2012 I need a more high profile, active API to evangelize if I'm going to achieve what I want.</p>
<p>So, to set the stage for 2012, this month I&rsquo;ve been making the transition from being the API Evangelist for Mimeo to the API Evangelist for <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid</a>.  As I see it, CityGrid has a lot more opportunity around their two very distinct APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Local Places API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Content+by+CityGrid">Local Places APIs</a></strong> - Information about business listings including location, website, business hours, offers, reviews, maps, images and other rich content.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Local Advertising APIs" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">Local Advertising APIs</a></strong> - Mobile and web app advertising network that allows developers get paid for displaying local content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hyperlocal and mobile are both fast growing areas in our society, and I see a huge opportunity to make an impact with a high value API like CityGrid in this space.  After reviewing CityGrid, I saw several of the key characteristics I look for in an API:  clear value, ease of use and a clear revenue model for both the company and the developer.</p>
<p>Based upon success I&rsquo;ve seen around Hackathons in 2011, I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out how to step up my involvement in the hackathon space in 2012.  As the API Evangelist for CityGrid I have an opportunity to step up my sponsorship and participation in hackathons across the United States.  So, in 2012, I&rsquo;ll be taking CityGrid APIs on the road and seeing what developers and I can do with them in cities across the country.</p>
<p>After meeting everyone behind CityGrid and seeing the un-tapped potential of their APIs I couldn't say no when they asked me to be their API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m extremely excited to be working with <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a>--I see a lot of potential.  Stay tuned for 2012, its going to be another great year for APIs.</p>
