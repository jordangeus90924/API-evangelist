    	        <h2>API Lifecycle Research</h2>
<p>I spend most of my time studying how API providers are approaching the technology, business, and politics of their API operations. This work began understanding mostly the technology and business of API management in 2010, but after seven years it has spread to over 70 areas of what I see as the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>This research reflects what API providers should be considering, but is extracted from the best (and worst) practices of the leading API providers out there. Because this is APIs, most of the services I cover as part of my API life cycle research also have APIs, allowing API infrastructure to be managed using APIs, adding an entirely new dimension to the conversation.</p>

            <p>This is the most important research in my stack in my opinion, focusing on the API definitions, schema, and standards that are being used across the API sector to define every aspect of API operations. These definitions are being used across every stop along this cycle as a sort of central truth, and often providing a contract that defines operations.</p>

            <p>This is the oldest area of my research, and the first aspect of APIs I started studying in 2010. It has spawned every other area of the API lifecycle I track on, so there are many overlaps and linkages to other stops along the way. API management has matured to include service composition, establishing analysis and awarness, as well as reporting and billing on top of that activity. I'm looking to track on what is happening to API mangement now that it is being commoditized.</p>

            <p>This is my research to understand how APIs can allow for the migration of data, content, media, and other digital bits around the web. I'm also looking to see how infrastructure can be migrated in addition to the data, content, and other things it is producing and consuming. You can find news I've curated, organizations doing interesting things, some of the common building blocks I've identified, and open source tooling in this research report.</p>

            <p>I've seen enough movement in the area of Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheets being used with APIs to warrant closer monitoring. To support this I've started publishing most of my research to an API Evangelist spreadsheet research site, which will allow me to better track, curate, tag, and tell stories around spreadsheets and APIs. As I do with my 60+ API research projects, I will update this site when I have time, publishing anything I've read, written, and companies I think are doing interesting things spreadsheets and APIs. I'm pretty convinced that spreadsheets will be another one of those bridge tools we use to connect where we are going with APIs, with the reality of where the everyday person is, just trying to get their job done.</p>
