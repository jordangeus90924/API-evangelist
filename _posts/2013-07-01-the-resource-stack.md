I've been organizing much of my research around APIs into groupings that I call "stacks". The term allows me to loosely bundle common API resources into meaningful "stacks" for my readers to learn about.

I'm adding a new project to my list of 30 stacks, that is intended to bring together the most commonly used API resources, into a single, meaningful stack of resources any web or mobile developer can quickly put to use.

So far I have compiled the following APIs in 29 separate groups:

  * Compute
    * Amazon EC2
    * Google AppEngine
    * Heroku
  * Storage
    * Amazon S3
    * Dropbox
    * Rackspace Cloud Files
  * Database
    * Amazon RDS
    * Amazon SimpleDB
  * DNS
    * Amazon Route 53
    * Rackspace Cloud DNS
    * DNS Made Easy
    * DNSimple
  * Email
    * SendGrid
    * Amazon SES
    * Rackspace Email
  * SMS
    * Twilio
    * AT
