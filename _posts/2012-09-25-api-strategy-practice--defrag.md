{% include JB/setup %}<p>When you spend a lot of time going to conferences, hackathons and events, you start really getting picky about which events you go to.To disrupt my regular routine, I need an event that will always add value to my professional career, but also be a good time!When it comes to the latest in Internet technolgy, I always make time each year for the Gluecon and Defrag conferences.Gluecon is usually in the spring and Defrag is in the fall--both occurring at the Omni Interlocken in Broomfield, CO.Defrag is coming up November 15th and 16th--right after November 1st and 2nd for theÂ API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC.</p>
