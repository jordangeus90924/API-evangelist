			<p><em>30 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Amazon sent me an email about the recent signing of the online sales tax law by California Governor Brown, which would force online retailers who have no physical presence in California, to collect the same levies as bricks-and-mortar stores. As a result of this, contracts with all California residents participating in the Amazon Associates Program are terminated effective, June 29, 2011. As I was writing up the story of this on kinlane.com, ad it got me thinking about the impact of this on API affiliate programs. I'm tracking on various monetization strategies for APIs, and affiliate sales is one of them. California has broadened their definition regarding who has to pay sales tax, to include theaffiliatesof online retailers. But from what I can read it all still goes back to the sale of "tangible personal property". The tax code defines what type of merchandise is subject to use tax as: Generally, the same types of items that are subject to sales tax are subject to use tax. Sales and use tax applies to the sale or use of tangible personal property in California. Section 6016 of the Revenue and Taxation Code defines tangible personal property as "personal property which may be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched, or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses." I'm no lawyer, but my interpretation of the assembly bill 28, is that if your API is not faciliting the sale of tangible goods, you are safe. If your selling access to bits and bytes, and you want to share revenue with developers and / or affiliates who drive traffic and sales to your API, you are not subject to any online sales tax for California. I haven't read New York, Illinois or other states bills. I will some night when I need help going to sleep, and update in the future.

			<p><em>30 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>The Mashape API Proxy is an open-source version of the same proxy that allows APIs to integrate with the Mashape Platform andhandles authorizing users, billing, rate limiting and other features.
Version 1.1 is whats available for download on Github, and Mashape is testing the private version 1.2 of the proxy with a small set of API providers, and they will push it to Github after its been tested.
The new version dramatically improves the performance and the security of the proxy, while reducing latency.
The API Proxy version 1.1 is an extremely early version and Mashape recommends waiting for version 1.2 before deploying.
The open-source Mashape API Proxy is written in JavaScript and runs on the latest version of node.js
This is the first open-source API proxy that I know of, and in my opinion, opens up a lot of possibilities for the API industry.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/30/new-pricing-for-genability-energy-api/">"New Pricing for Genability Energy API"</a></h3>
			<p><em>30 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Energy pricing data provider Genability just announced the roll-out of more flexible pricing for their API.
The new pricing structure gives Genability API developers more options with no long term commitments, when accessing the Genability tariff and electricity pricing database.
Genability API pricing starts with a free plan which offers 10 unique tariff credits per month, and will serve up 1,000 calls per hour.
Genability bulk paid plans range from $89.99 / month to $1499.99 a month:

     
          Bronze for 89.99 / month, with 100 unique tariff credits per month, and 5,000 calls per hour
     
     
          Silver for 299.99 / month, with 350 unique tariff credits per month, and 20,000 calls per hour
     
     
          Gold for $799.99 / month, with 1000 unique tariff credits per month, and 50,000 calls per hour
     
     
          Platinum for $1499.99 / month, with 2000 unique tariff credits per month, and 100,000 calls per hour
     
The call per hour portion is pretty straightforward, but whats a tariff credit?
A tariff credit is when you request a full tariff (including all its rates, bands and properties), or request a price, or a calculation on a tariff. Genability keep track of each tariff you request, and keep a count of the unique ones, with subsequent calls for previously requested tariffs being free.
All of Genability's API plans both, both free and paid, include LSE data, season &amp; time of use data, and zip codes, and geo-location data.
Genability also offers custom pricing plans, if one of their doesn't fit your needs, just contact them and they'll negotiate additional services, flexible usage policies or volume pricing.
It's interesting to see pricing for an API that provides access to energy utility pricing, take on a very utility pricing model for consumption.

			<p><em>30 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm exploring the Mashape API Platform, trying to break things down and understand everything in more detail. Blogging about a topic does this for me. So let's start with deploying an API with Mashape. With the Mashape PHP Library you can deploy an API on your infrastructure. You download the library from Github, deploy on your server, and then add the methods for your API by extending the Mashape PHP component class. If you already have an API that returns JSON responses, you can just register it as a Mashape API for distribution, without deploying the Mashape PHP Library. If you've deployed your API without the Mashape PHP Library you will need to accomplish one more step. You will need to implement the Mashape Connector by adding one line of code to your API, which is required to connect your API to the Mashape Platform and handle user authorization, billing, and rate-llimiting. Whichever way you deploy your API, you can now distribute it using Mashape. The first step for distributing an API is to create an XML file that describes what the API does. This XML file gets deployed on your server and needs to be updated as your API evolves. Once your API is deployed and published to Mashape, the platform distributes your API to the Mashape Marketplace and provides a detail page with title, description, documentation, test console and PHP, Python, Ruby, Java and Objective C client libraries. Mashape then provides a way for developers to sign-up and start hacking on any API in the Mashape Marketplace with a single developer account and key. There are also social features allowing users to follow and contact other users. All APIs that are published using Mashape will connect and communicate with Mashape through an API Proxy. This is the proxy that handles the authorization of users, implementation of billing, rate limiting and other functions described above. Right now the proxy is primarily available via the...[<a href="/2011/06/30/mashape-provides-tools-to-distribute-discover-and-hack-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

The event focused on the growing need to distribute information to a multitude of Internet connected devices using APIs, andMashery invited four leaders in the API space to showcase their experience:

     
          Daniel Jacobson, Director of Engineering forNetflix API
     
     
          Kumar Kandaswamy, Director,Open API Platform Business for Best Buy

			<p><em>29 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Facebook just officially launched the Graph API Explorer, a tool allowing developers to quickly explore the social graph of people, photos, events, pages and the relationships between them, via the Facebook Graph API.
Like other API explorers, the Graph API Explorer allows developers to make requests against the API and see formatted results in-line.
The Graph API Explorer interface allows you to obtain an access_token with the specific permissions necessary to access data, navigating the same permissions dialog users will see when permissions are requested in a production app.
The Graph API Explorer then allows developers to switch between HTTP GET, POST and DELETE to get, create, update or delete objects.  When POSTing to the API, you can also provide a list of fields and values that you want to send as parameters to the API.
For every request the Graph API Explorer provides formatted results, allowing developers to move between objects in the graph by click their Ids, showing the details of each object on the social graph. Just like the real Facebook application, the Graph API Explorer only shows you the objects and data you have acess to see, and that you give the Graph API Explorer permission to access on your behalf.
The Facebook Graph API Explorer was originally deployed by a Facebook employee, and now is being officially as part of the Facebook developers program, and is part of a growing trend of RESTful API explorers like Apigee Console and Google API explorer.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/29/apigee-delivers-api-pcidss-compliance/">"Apigee Delivers API PCI-DSS Compliance"</a></h3>
			<p><em>29 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Apigee justannounced their Apigee Enterprise Cloud PCI, a new offering that enables organizations to deliver transactional APIs, securely deployed in a private or public cloud.
Apigee's new Enterprise Cloud PCI supports full compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), while taking advantage of the compute resources of the cloud to support transactional API traffic and sensitive customer data.
To fully protect critical customer credit card information, there's an increased focus on compliance, especially as more e-commerce services shift to cloud computing and APIs, said Chet Kapoor, Apigee CEO. ...The Apigee Enterprise Cloud API also protects and screens sensitive data flowing between an application and an API residing on a public cloud, so businesses can now confidently broaden their e-commerce network with transactional APIs.
The Apigee Enterprise Cloud PCI solution is deployed in PCI-compliant data centers, allowing customers to:

     Build and deploy transactional APIs
     
     Maintain PCI compliance and data protection of all API traffic
     
     Tap the scalability of the cloud for secure transactional APIs
     
The Apigee Enterprise Cloud PCI can also be deployed on-premise, delivering the same capabilities for in-house PCI-DSS compliant deployments.
PCI-DSS is associated with e-commerce, and financial transaction security, but can be universally applied to securing any online transactions. The availability of this type of API security will go a long way in convincing IT departments to deploy their API infrastructure in the clouds.

			<p>Mobile is hot. Everyone is talking about thegrowth in mobile payments this year.
Forrester Research predicted that mobile commerce will hit $6 billion in 2011 - and reach up to $31 billion by 2016.
PayPal just raised their 2011 Mobile Total Payments Volume (TPV) projections to $3 billion. Paypal first predicted $1.5 billion in 2011 mobile payments volume, then in February, they upped that to $2 billion, and now they've adjusted to $3 billion.
Paypal is running $10 million in mobile TPV a day, up from the $6 million they reported in March.
It shows that mobile users are actively purchasing products and services online using sites and applications on their mobile devices.
Just like with social media and cloud computing, APIs are a silent force behind the mobile revolution. APIs drive the applications and sites that mobile users are puting to use.
The growth in mobile payments is a sign of the overall growth in the mobile market, as well as massive growth in API deployment to support the mobile demand.

			<p><em>26 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Amazon recently sent an email to all developers notifying them of upcoming changes to the Alexa Top Sites API.
On November 25, 2011 Amazon will deprecate the Alexa Top Sites SOAP API. The SOAP interface has had repeated security issues over the last couple of years, and since only a small percentage of users actually use the API, they decided to decommission it.
Alexa will also be enforcing that all requests to the API must be signed using signature version 2.  Version 2 is significantly more secure that the version, and all Amazon Web Services are being required to migrate to it.
I wonder if Amazon is having similar security issues with other SOAP APIs?   Maybe the other SOAP APIs just have more users and it was worthwhile for them to fix.
Makes you wonder how many SOAP users vs. REST users Amazon Web Services has.

			<p>This is one story I'm sure I will be telling over and over. Its about providing self-service registration to your API, and access to your documentation. I'm working my way through 78 travel APIs right now, reviewing each of them for a series of travel industry API stories. I'm only halfway through, and about 25% of them require me to email them or submit a contact form to get access to their API. I can understand doing this if your goal is to only work with partners and vendors, but all of these APIs came from the ProgrammableWeb API directory. So I assume your goal is to target a wider public audience. Here is how your approach is hurting you: As a developer I need instant gratification. I need to make sure your API has what I need. I need to quickly get at your documentation, see your endpoints, and potentially be able to grab a code sample and see some results. If you can't provide this for me, someone else will. As an API blogger and writer I need immediate access. If I'm going to include you in my story for the travel industry APIs, and showcase what you offer. I need access, without waiting or talking to you, to see the value you deliver, and where you fit in. Now I've submitted the contact forms and emails for each of these APIs. I've gotten a couple responses, 24 or 48 hours later (some no response). I've already moved on, I see the name in an email, realize its from my travel research, but I don't remember anything else. Even though I have access now, its unlikely that I will return. The moment to make your mark has passed. What would be the reason for limited access to your API? Maybe you don't have staff or time to manage the potential spammers or other probing type of users that will come through?

			<p><em>23 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>When managing an API and its ecosystem, we are all making this up as we go along. We have to constantly try new things, build them out, test, measure, and readjust. Measuring being the most important, and when considering your API analytics, it shouldn't be just about tracking usage of your API. You should measure every aspect of your API ecosystem. Applying metrics, gathering data, and reporting on this should be easy, and be part of your development DNA. Your metrics should be flexible and change as your ecosystem evolves. Any engineer, evangelist or other team member should be able to implement, gather and measure as the need arises. I was introduced to StatsD and Graphite reporting last week, by Flip from Infochimps, while at the O'Reilly Velocity Conference. StatsD is a dead simple NodeJS daemon that listens for messages over a UDP port. When a message is received, it parses the messages, and extracts metrics data. Graphite is a highly scalable real-time graphing system. Data can be sent to Graphite's processing back-end, carbon, which stores the data in Graphite's specialized database. The data can then be visualized through graphite's web interfaces. StatsD lets you define what you want to track, throw it at the StatsD over a UDP port, once processed you can schedule it to dump to Graphite for further processing and visualization. Using StatsD + Graphite, you can provide any metric you wish, and Graphite will just report on it, with no management overhead. This type of flexibility provides the perfect agile environment measuring anything in an API ecosystem. For example you can introduce new tracking for each deployment of an account sign-up widget using: StatsD::increment("widget.accountsignup.deploy"); StatsD will accept and process the new data, where Graphite will begin receiving, processing and provide a visualization for this new data set. Since the StatsD interface is over UDP you don't have to worry about what this will do to your API or application performance,...[<a href="/2011/06/23/api-ecosystem-tracking-with-statsd-and-graphite/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>There are many tools out there for working with Web APIs, but the one I am seeing used more and more is an API explorer. API explorers allow users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a Web interface -- all without writing code. These API explorers are making it a lot easier for developers to discover, learn, and integrate with Web APIs. I also think they have a lot more potential, beyond the developer community. Non-developers can use an API explorer to make calls against an API, retrieve JSON, and then use tools like Google Spreadsheets to process responses, building visualizations, and so on. There is a huge opportunity for API explorer providers to tap into the larger, non-developer community, and one of the easiest ways to do this may be by adding a widget layer to their applications. An API widget builder would have similar features to the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for APIs I proposed last week: API Discovery - Allowing users to discover and select pre-defined selection of RESTful APIs Authentication - Enable HTTP Basic and oAuth authentication with APIs Services - Render full list available services for selected API Request / Responses - Allow for building requests, manually sending, and seeing fresponses for selected API Github Integration - Allow adding and connecting to both private and public Github repositories Then I would add a new layer to the environment: Widget Builder - Provide tools for widget discovery, creation, connecting to APIs, configuration, sandbox, and copy / paste embeddable code for syndication. Export Tools - Ability to export any API responses to Google Spreadsheet, Microsoft Excel, Comma Separate or Tab Separated values. With this type of environment, non-technical users could easily connect to APIs, mash-up responses and build widgets for embedding in their presentations, web sites, applications, and mobile devices. There are a couple of widget building platforms out there like Sprout Inc or Widgetbox, but I'm picturing something more...[<a href="/2011/06/22/widget-builder-environment-for-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>APIs are hot right now. With the success of Twitter, Twilio, Facebook and others -- due in no small part to their APIs -- the enterprise space is taking notice. The demand for enterprise API services is increasing, with a number of services providers stepping up to compete for the business. As this happens, there are three major areas that may prove challenging for API service providers targeting the enterprise space: Developers: Wide range of vendor, partner, and public developer needs and expectations. Open and Accessible - A public, self-service and accessible API ecosystem, with less of an enterprise feel Documentation - Simple, yet complete API documentation Common Tools - Forums, Mobile SK, explorers and other tools developers have grown accustom to. Monetization - The ability to make money from their work. Business Interests: Wide variety of business interests wanting to deploy and manage APIs Legal - Whole new worlds of legal concerns for some companies Transparency - Struggles with what transparent means? And how much is too much? Branding - What happens to the brand? Where are pitfalls? Where are opportunities? Non-IT - More engagement from non-IT decision makers when deploying APIs. Tools - Reports, widgets and other GUI tools that allow decision makers to put APIs to work. Enterprise IT: Sector that has high expectations when it comes to software. Secure - Mission critical security in all areas. Scalable - Scalability has to be baked in. SLA - Service levels have to be guaranteed. On-Premise - Ability to deliver behind the firewall. Private Cloud - Deploying in their private cloud infrastructure. Public Cloud - Deploy on public cloud infrastructure. When it comes to providing API services to the enterprise, you have different public, vendor and partner-developer expectations -- which all may be quite different. To complicate things, you may have decisions around APIs increasingly coming from non-IT departments, bringing a whole bunch of business related concerns. Lastly, this is the enterprise.

			<p><em>22 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Two API service providers have brought their products together to deliver a more robust enterprise API solution. 3Scale API management platform now integrates with Layer7 Technologies XML security gateways.
3scale's API Management suite includes an API portal for developers and partners on-boarding and support, API access control, policies management, analytics and billing and payments features.
The Layer7 XML Gateway provides high performance traffic filtering, API security and attack protection, traffic routing, API transformation services and caching.
Enterprise API providers can use 3scale's plugin to issue API keys, policies and access rights that can be pushed and pulled between security gateways and 3scale's management dashboards.
Layer7 XML Gateway can be deployed on-premise, in a private or public cloud. With this new partnership 3Scale offers the same deployment flexibility for their API management solution.
The partnership gives 3Scale a leg up with the enterprise with a more robust, secure enterprise API gateway, and Layer7 gains a management suite to offer their API customers. It's a win for both of them, creating a very strong enterprise API solution.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/19/hapi-hackathon-wrapup/">"HAPI Hackathon Wrapup"</a></h3>
			<p><em>19 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>The HAPI hackathon wrapped up June 12th in San Francisco. The event brought developers together to hack on over 9 APIs in order to build something cool over the course of a weekend.
The event started out Friday night with TokBox, Ebay / Paypal, Foursquare, Box.net, Twilio, Genability, Factual, and Mashery showcasing their companies and their APIs to developers.
Next, developers lined up to pitch their ideas and generate interest amongst other participants. 10 ideas were pitched, then developers formed groups and got to work.
Developers spent all weekend drinking coffee, eating pizza and bagels, and hacking away. Everything culminated Sunday afternoon when developers presented their hacks.
Over sixteen hacks were presented, with prizes going to the best:

     
          FourSquare2Go won a Foursquare prize for their offline Foursquare application.
     
     
          Energy Dashboard won both the Mashery APIs and Genabiity API prizes for their energy insight, and prediction tool.
     
     
          Congress Connector won multiple Twilio API, Factual API and Ebay / Paypal API prizes for their tool that made connecting with your congressional rep easier.
     
     
          Chat Living Room won a TokBox API prize with their group Youtube video chat room.
     
     
          Hapidocs won a Box.net API prize for their location based file storage application.
     
     
          SoshoWise won a Ebay / Paypal API prize for their expert driven how to video application.
     
TokBox who organized the event, wanted to bring the developers together into an environment where they could make whatever they want, and offer support and prizes from nine different APIs.
Overall the hackathon was a success, with developers going home with cash and schwag, and the APIs involved generated more awareness of the services they provide.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/19/apis-are-key-to-industry-growth/">"APIs Are Key to Industry Growth"</a></h3>
			<p><em>19 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>At the Glue Conference this year in Colorado, I sat on a panel called, Whats Next for APIs?. In my talk, one area I focused on, was how industries would organize and put APIs to work.
There is a growing trend within specific industries. They are coming together and pushing for standards, interoperability, and ways to work together.
I'm seeing evidence of this within the customer service industry. An industry association called NetworkedHelpDesk.org is using APIs to connect together customer service applications and establish a seamless way to communicate among industry partners and vendors.
Customer service applications are in high demand, and potentially connected with many other applications, so it is critical that they communicate and inter-operate efficiently.
NetworkedHelpDesk.org has brought together other applications such as Twilio, SugarCRM, Freshbooks, Atlassian and Zendesk, with different types of applications including ticketing systems, bug trackers, development trackers, knowledge bases, and CRM software.
The goal of NetworkedHelpDesk.org is to deliver on the promise of the cloud, and enable disparate systems to collaborate with each other, using a standardized API format for the customer service industry.
I think we'll see more industries coming together like this, to establish ways they can work together more efficiently using APIs.

			<p><em>18 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>I recently moved my IDE off my desktop and onto the web. I'm test driving two separate web-based integrated development environments (IDE): Akshell - I like environment, its smooth and has Github integration. But its primarily a JavaScript IDE. I met the developers and like where they are going with it. ShiftEdit - This is the one I'm using the most, because I work 70% of the time in PHP. I like the FTP access, but only has SVN for its repositoring integration. As I was working with the Dropbox API, Posterous API, and Tumblr API today, and was thinking how nice it would be to have an IDE dedicated to APIs. There are several API explorers popping up out there, that let you play with one or multiple APIs and generate requests and display responses. This is a start. I would like a full-blown IDE that I can add RESTful APIs to my libraries and would have all the capabilities of an explorer, but also have access to client libraries, code samples, and other features of an IDE for the APIs I use the most. I could integrate both my public and private Github repositories, and I could leverage the social coding available in the Github community. Switching between APIs can be a bitch, remembering what I did last time I worked with an API, where the code is, the syntax, and more. I'm also spending a lot of time using multiple APIs, in a single script. Like pulling bookmarks from Instapaper API, generating a PDF with PDF Crowd, then sending to Mimeo to have printed. That is 3 separate API calls. I see a lot of potential for an IDE that is dedicated to the API space, an IDE that helps us developers efficiently integrate with the APIs we use most...as well as discover new APIs.

			<p><em>17 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Two new API management platforms were launched this month. Layer 7 technologies launched the Layer 7 API Portal, and SOA Software launched their Atmosphere API platform.
These new platforms show the API space is really heating up in 2011. The enterprise is taking notice of the value of APIs, and service providers are lining up to compete for the business.
These new platforms offer asimilarset of services as Mashery, Apigee, 3Scale including:

     API Provisioning
     
     Metrics and Billing
     
     Security and Control
     
     Reporting and Analytics
     
     Developer Registration and Accounts
     
     Developer Support
     
Some of them deploy their solutions on-premise, while others deploy in the cloud, and a couple of them will do both. Each provider has their own approach to API management, but essentially accomplish the same end goal.
I'm going to work on a better side by side comparison of Layer 7, Atmosphere, Mashery, Apigee, 3Scale and Mashape. Hopefully to help people understand what each API service providers delivers.

			<p><em>17 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Posterous recently launched a new API giving users access to all the functionality available through the Posterous web interface.
Instead of just delivering documentation for the Poserous API, they went a step further and made the documentation smarter, and more interactive.
Think API explorer meets API documentation. The Posterous API documentation provides a list of all API services, endpoints, and methods, but it doesn't stop there.
When logged into your Posterous account, the API documentation automatically includes your api_token, which is necessary for making API calls.
Once authenticated you can make any call against the API right in the documentation. Each endpoint allows entry of necessary fields, displays a request URL, and a JSON response message.
This type of interactive API documentation allows developers to learn and explore how an API works in a live environment, making real calls.
This approach to delivering API documentation steps up the game a little bit, and the same old type of documentation may not do anymore.

			<p>SOA Software just launched a new API management platform called, Atmosphere.
Atmosphere provides a secure, platform that companies can deploy to manage their APIs for either a private or public developer community.
The Atmosphere platform gives API providers a management interface to define APIs using a wide range of messaging types and formats including REST/XML, REST/JSON and SOAP. The platform also provides paging and caching mechanisms to improve app performance.
Atmosphere also provides security capabilities that allow API providers to control and monitor app's usage of the APIs. While also protecting internal applications from overload, as well as provide customers with service-level guarantee through QoS management for SLAs and quotas.
These tools for monitoring and managing consumer contracts and traffic can also be applied to enable monetization of APIs.
The Atmosphere API Management can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud, or a combination of the two. Providing the flexibility and scalability needed by many providers.
The Atmosphere API Management platform is one of the newest players in the API management space, a growing playing field of providers targeting the enterprise.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/14/the-usa-today-api-matures/">The USA Today API Matures</a></h3>
			<p><em>14 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Back when I first started doing API reviews on API Evangelist, I did a review of USA Today's API.
At first I almost didn't post the review.  It was such a simple API, with nothing innovative to speak of.  It just didn't seem worth covering.
When they first launched the USA Today API, it provided services for best-selling books, and sports salaries.  It wasn't very exciting.
Fastword 10 months, and their API is looking much more robust.  Now they also offer Articles, Book Reviews, Breaking News, Movie Reviews, Music Reviews, and Snapshots.
Most recently, USA Today also addedUS census data to their API offerings.
Looking back it was easy for me to criticize the big media company for releasing such a simple API, but in reality they are doing what I feel everyond should do, start simple.
USA Today looks like they are getting their footing with packaging up data sets and making available via their API.  This data is probably very usable by their internal teams as well as makes USA Today a potential integration partner with other applications.
I think other news and media organizations can learn a lot by following in USA Todays footsteps, and deploy very simple APIs, learn, and slowly tackle more as you find the right approach to your API community.
Also, I'm sure USA Today was able to tackle so successfully with the help of Mashery.

			<p><em>13 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Many API owners depend on their APIs for identifying new types of business models, turning their API ecosystems into research &amp; development platforms.
Edwin Aoki of Paypal and Ebay APIs also feels they can also be used by human resources(HR), to nurture and identify new developer talent. At the Mashery Evolution of Distribution event, Aoki mentioned how Ebay and Paypal use their API ecosystem for talent acquisition.
If you think about it, your API provides a fertile ground for developer to learn about your APIs, how to code with them, and understand your companies way of doing business.
Hopefully within your API area there are ways for developers to excel and showcase their work. Submitting code samples, applications and forum participation all give them an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge.
And If your company, eats your own dog food and uses your APIs internally, hiring developers from your API community can provide immediate benefit to internal projects.
Beyond internal projects, developers can also be identified and used for partner projects. Identifying rockstar developers you feel comfortable referring to your partners, is another great use of your API community.
Another place to look for talent, is at Hackathons. Hackathons can also be fertile ground for identifying fresh new developer talent. It is place to watch developers in action, showing their skills in real-time, and demonstrate how well they work with other people.
An API provides many ways to attract, groom, and identify talent for your company. Have you ever hired someone from your API community?

			<p><em>13 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Having a privacy policy on your API is an important part of making it clear to developers and end-users, where your company stands in regard to their data and personal privacy. Just having a privacy policy is not enough, make sure it truly reflects your companies values, whats important to your users, and is in line with how you deploy your technology. One shining example of this in the API space, is Hunch. Hunch's provides a 'Taste Graph' of the entire web, providing information on what people like; anything, from books to electronic gadgets to fashion or vacation spots. Hunch is combining algorithmic machine learning with user-curated content, with the goal of providing better recommendations for everyone. The information they provide through their web application and API, is extremely valuable, as well as potentially very private. Hunch's API privacy policy articulates their position very clearly: Hunch takes our users' privacy very seriously. When using the API, Hunch returns predictions for users within the Taste Graph. Certain API calls can be made for any user, while other calls require the user to Hunch Connect before predictions will be returned. Our guiding principle for this distinction is whether the user's likes or facts about themselves are already made public on the internet. Obviously the privacy of their users is very important, and they back this up by using OAuth as it is meant to be used. Giving users granular level control over who has access to their sensitive data, while still providing other, non-sensitive, rich data without authentication. Hunch has a clear vision of API and data privacy in a space, where there is a lot of potential for abuse. An example that many other API providers should follow. Also make sure and check out the privacy policy for their main site, they really lay it out honestly, and in plain english. I wish more technology providers would approach privacy this way.

			<p><em>13 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>When I review a new API, I take a look at the technology they provide, but I tend to focus on the business of their API. One area I look at, is what tools they use to deliver the building blocks that make up their API. Did they build it themselves? Did they use Mashery, Apigee or 3Scale? Are they using other open-source tools or a software as a service (SaaS) provider? I'm always on the look out for new open-source tools or services providers that can be leveraged for APIs in this way. My goal is to find an open-source solution or service provider for each one of the building blocks I have defined. Some examples are: API documentation with SDK Bridge API forums with Get Satisfaction Application Showcase with AppStores.com I like to have an open-source tool available for each building block, but having a solid company that can deliver specialized services for a API, and have them up and running instantly is even better. Some characteristics I look for in a service provider are: Self-service - Instant registration and activation of services. Branding - The ability to brand and make look like your API area. Tiered Pricing - A pay as you go model allowing small companies to try out first, then grow as needed. DNS - Ability to point subdomain at service, to keep with a single company domain. Support - Quality support from self-service forum to someone you can talk to. Focus - Delivering a high quality service ina single area, and not trying to be everything to everyone. Data Portability - The ability to take ALL of your data with you when you are ready to leave is critical. These are just a few of the key strengths I look for when finding API tool and service providers. As an example, take a look at AppStores.com, they have almost everything I look for in a building block service provider....[<a href="/2011/06/13/api-tools-amp-service-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm working through some 100K views of the API service provider arena, and trying to evolve my perspectives of Whats Next for APIs. This is all a work in progress, so I'm publishing here on kinlane.com instead of on apievangelist.com. I wrote the other day about the Battle for Your API Proxy between the API service providers. This included a tier of "proxy" API service providers that run all your APIs through proxy before hitting your API. Next there are the group of "connector" API service providers that provide you with a connector to put in your API and provide the same services that a proxy would. Based upon what I'm seeing with Mashape and other indicators, I tried to show the playing field in a slightly different, and evolved way. My vision of the future of APIs involves several key areas of evolution. These are based upon movements I'm already seeing, and where I'd like to see things go. In this vision API service providers don't just provide proxy, connector, management, developer area tools, and API marketplaces. They also provide actual API frameworks for APIs like Mashape provides, as well industry wide developer opportunities. Developers can build code against a single API, or multiple APIs, they can build tools for API owners to deploy in their own management, developer areas as well as within the "proxy" or "connector" layer too. Service providers will provide developers with distribution opportunities to other marketplaces and API owners. API Owners will not be locked into a single API service provider for their API, Management, Proxy, Connector, Developer or Marketplace needs. They will have a buffet of add-ons they can choose from to enhance every aspect of their API ecosystem. One key difference is that API owners can choose to proxy or connect their API, or both if necessary for different services. This model provide sadd-ons at every layer of the API ecosystem.

			<p><em>11 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Every Web API is designed to receive requests from and respond to the outside world. Every day an API can receive thousands or potentially millions of calls. Before the API can process these requests and returns a response, it has to potentially tackle a huge laundry list of functionalities: Identity / Authentication Traffic Controls Rate Limiting Performance Security Scalability Filtering Encryption Logging Once all these items are handled, then the API can do what it is designed to do -- process its payload and return a response. Many API owners tackle all these layers of the API themselves. But there are also several service providers out their looking to do this for them. The first group of API service providers in this area use what I call the Proxy Flow Through, and this includes Mashery and Apigee. Mashery and Apigee deliver these service by routing all calls to an API through their proxy. Each call actually is made to Mashery and Apigee, then they route the request to the actual API for a response. The second group of API service providers in this area, use what I call the Proxy Connector, and this includes 3Scale and Mashape. 3Scale and Mashape deliver these services by providing a connector your API can use to communicate with the proxy during each call. All of these service providers end up delivering a similar set of services. This proxy, whether flow through or connector tackle the needs listed above, but then also provide much needed data on API operations. Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale provide you with tools for monitoring and analyzing this operational data. There is a lot at stake here. The next wave of Internet growth will pass through these proxies. More API owners are turning to these providers to deliver this layer, where all usage of the API from web apps, mobile apps, and other devices developed internally, by partners and the public will pass through these proxies....[<a href="/2011/06/11/the-battle-for-your-api-proxy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/10/why-is-your-restful-api-separate-from-your-website/">"Why is your RESTful API Separate From Your Website?"</a></h3>
			<p><em>10 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>I was having a beer with Dr. Alexandre Passant of Seevl the other day, we were talking about music, APIs and the Seevl API.
A while back I wrote a piece about Seevl titled, With Seevl Music Discovery, the Website is the API. When building the Seevl API, instead of providing a separate API to access information, Seevl relies on content negotiation principles to deliver alternative representations of web pages.
As I was talking with Passant, I kept thinking about how RESTful APIs are often deployed separately from the web site or application. Both are using HTTP, and often deliver the same information, they are just intended for two different audiences and potential uses.
This is not a new idea. Flickr delivered the Flickr API this way in the early days, and web applications like Tumblr offer their API and application side by side.
You can visit my Tumblr blog at: http://kinlane.tumblr.com/
Simple add /api/read to the same URL: http://kinlane.tumblr.com/api/read/
And you you get back an XML representation of my Tumblr blog.
Add /JSON to that URL: http://kinlane.tumblr.com/api/read/json
And you get back a JSON representation of my Tumblr blog.

     In most cases, it does not makes sense for a web site or application and its RESTful API to be separated, for some reason many developers still see them as two completely separate things.
     In my opinion, if the HTML, XML, and JSON representations of information are deployed side by side. And users know they can simple adjust the URL to get other formats, the type of users that hack on, embed, and redistribute information from APIs will grow beyond the developer community.

			<p><em>10 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>In a single announcement yesterday, the blogging service Posterous went from Software as a Service (SaaS) to Platform as a Service (PaaS), with the introduction of a full set of APIs.
The new set of RESTful APIs give developers access to methods and actions that were formerly available only to the core Posterous engineering team including the ability to create new sites, manage users, posts, comments, custom themes and other data for those sites.
Beyond just exposing the core posterous technology via as a simple set of RESTful APIs, Posterous has delivered their API documentation as an interactive set of tools allowing developers to see every available method, interface with these methods and experiment bydynamicallychanging the paramaters and inspecting responses, all within the browser.
Posterous has merged the concept of API documentation and API explorer into a single set of interactive developer documentation. This steps up the game, in that not only should your documentation be simple and complete, but also functional.
The new Posterous APIs have evolved Posterous from a service where users can come and setup blogs, to a platform that companies can use as a backbone for their own blog and site managment systems.

			<p><em>10 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>I've heard this story several times now, but I think its a story worth telling over and over. It is the story of the Netflix API and the lessons they learned along the way. Not every API owner will be operating at the scale of Netflix, but the lessons are universal. It all started when Netflix set out to build an API, where the original charter was: Expose Netflix metadata and services to the public developer community to "let 1,000 flowers bloom". That community will build rich and exciting new tools and services to improve the value of Netflix to our customers. The concept of 1,000 flowers refers to the public community Netflix was targeting with the API, where ideas and applications would flower from each developer. Fast forward a couple years, and the API has been successful, with growth looking something like this: However the innovation did not come from where the original charter identified. The API delivered the greatest value from these groups (in order of importance): Internal Engineering Teams Netflix Product Owners Netflix Developers Partner Relationships External Device Manufacturers Public Developer Community 1,000 Flowers Even with over 18K public developers using the API, it accounts for less than .5% of the traffic to the API. With internal teams and external device manufacturers accounting for the largest consumption. With these lessons in mind, the new charter for the Netflix API goes something like this: Build and maintain an infinitely scalable data distribution pipeline for getting metadata and services from internal Netflix systems to streaming client apps on all platforms in the format and / or deliver method that is most optimal for each app and platform. And moving forward, any future architecture will focus on supporting the key target audience first with a trickle down of features to the other audience segments.

			<p><em>08 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>The Dwolla payment service just launched a new payment API called Grid. Before you can understand grid, you need to understand Dwolla'sphilosophyon payments. Every time you want to do seemingly simple things, like buy a coffee, pay for lunch, or buy gas, current providers are requiring you hand over your name, credit card number, and expiration date, leaving trail of personal and financial data behind you. With an opportunity to start fresh, Dwolla wanted to change this, and thats what they are doing with Grid. Grid provides third party developers tools to create a seamless in-app purchasing experience with no more credit card numbers. Creating a new kind of payment network, one that doesn't leave behind personal information. Why is this huge for consumers? This new network puts consumers, not networks, in control of who can access, their payment information, allowing users to revoke and modify who can access their payment network. Why this is huge for merchants? Merchants can get paid online without the recurring costs associated with other networks, and accept payments with Dwolla's regular merchant account and pay no special account fees. Why this is huge for developers? For the first time ever, developers will have access to a payment network to innovate and build on top of, that removes a lot of liability that is typically associated with credit card networks. I tend to only focus on stories around innovative approaches to the business of APIs, which usually means how an API is delivered. Another area that I enjoy covering is how businesses are using APIs to change entire industries. Dwolla fits this profile. Dwolla is taking on an industry that is extremely complex, full of holes and was not build with the Internet in mind. Providing a simple web interface, an API, and flat pricing model, they are reinventing how we do payments from the ground up. Dwolla provides a REST and SOAP API, and employ OAuth for authentication.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/08/icloud-storage-apis/">"iCloud Storage APIs"</a></h3>
			<p><em>08 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>iCloud storage APIs allow IOS application developers to store documents and other data to a central location so userscan view or edit from any device without having to sync or transfer files.
There are two ways that applications can take advantage of iCloud storage:

     Document Storage - Enabling storage and sharing of information in document form.
     
     Key-Value Data Storage - Enabling storage and sharing small amounts of data.
     
Most applications will use iCloud document storage to share documents, which is a feature that users think of when they think of cloud storage. Users care about whether photos, videos, and documents are accessible across devices while the key-value data store is not something a user would never see.
Key-value storage will be used for small amounts of data such as storing application state, settings, and other important information that delivers a better user experience. Although not as apparent to the end-user, key-value storage will be just as important as document storage.

All iCloud storage is managed centrally by the iCloud service, which handles coordination of documents and key-value stores. The iCloud service handles storage searches, change notifications, version control, conflicts, and security for applications that integrate with a user's iCloud storage account.
Neither document storage or key-value storage in the cloud are anything new. But when it is implemented as part of the IOS platform, it becomes much bigger. Apple is solving everyday problems users face when using their smart phones, by storing data centrally in the cloud.
ICloud APIs will enable developers to build rich applications on the IOS platform, and continue to grow IOS market share.

			<p><em>08 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>The goal of any API evangelist is to encourage its community to build mobile and web applications around their API. When you and your community have several web apps, mobile apps, plugins or other tools you are proud of, showcase them. Whether you call it a showcase, directory, gallery or store...having an area that highlights the applications built upon your API is critical to continued API adoption and success. Application showcases do several things: Show developers love by showcasing their work and giving them the exposure the need Emphasize the work of your partners and the value they add to your platform Highlight the best apps your company has developed internally Show, not only do people use your API, they have delivered actual applications Demonstrates your API is easy to use and has value There are two ways to deploy an app store for your API. 1) build it yourself or 2) use a private label App Store solution like AppStores.com. I can speak from experience, your time is better spent evangelizing, and not building your own app store. AppStores.com provides a white-label / private-label solution for deploying an app store for your API. Here is a little of what AppStores.com bring to the table. They help with developer acquisition: Self Service App Submission - Enable developers to submit apps on their own, using a process you control Developer Dashboard - Developers are provided with a dashboard to monitor approval status, manage and update their own apps App Marketing - Developers will get the exposure they need being featured in your ecosystem They provide a complete set of management tools: Approval Process - Accept, reject or request changes to developers apps using approval dashboard Customizable UI - Complete control over the design of your AppShowcase ContentManagementSystem (CMS) - Add custom pages to your AppShowcase They encourage application discovery: App Categorization - Create categories to organize applications and feature the very best App Details - Provide...[<a href="/2011/06/08/a-whitelabel-api-app-store-platform/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Google Calendar has a new feature for managing "Appointment Slots". These appointment slots are a great way to let others know preferred times when you are available.
Open office hours are becoming a common way for API providers to communicate times when developers can connect with someone in person or online via chat for support. Google Calendar appointment slots area great way to manage API office hours.
Creating API Office Hours
To get started, set up blocks of time you'd like to offer as API hours. Simply click anywhere on your calendar and then on "appointment slots. From there, create a single block of time or automatically split a larger block of time into smaller appointment slots if applies.

Publishing API Office Hours
Every Google Calendar has its own personal appointments sign up page; you can embed it on your website or give the URL directly to registered API developers. You can find the URL for your appointment page at the top of the set-up page, which you can access via the edit details link.

Signing Up for API Hours
When someone visits your sign up page, their calendar is overlaid for convenience and they can sign up directly for any available appointment slot.

When they sign up, Google Calendar conveniently creates a new shared event on both of your calendars.

Making yourself available to developers is important.  API office hours can be used for premium support, limited time support, or just open time to share a pint with your developers and other people in the industry.

			<p><em>06 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     Lots of big news coming out of Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC2011) in San Francisco today.


     There were major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion. What really stood out was their new iCloud.


     iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for all music, photos, books, documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.


     Although this line of thought is nothing new, with Apple going all in…it means the cloud has gone mainstream.


     Get ready for some major growth in the cloud as Apple pushes it further, and other existing cloud providers try to compete.

			<p><em>03 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Kumar Kandaswamy, Director of Open API Platform Business for Best Buy, spoke at Mashery's The Evolution of Distribution event today.
Kandaswamy offered some practical advice for retail companies that are deciding how and where to start with their API deployments.  His suggestions included the following areas:

	Product APIs- Make your product catalog available via your API is fundamental.
	Store APIs - Give local store information including location and product availability is powerful.
	Review APIs - Deliver practical product reviews in a usable way to help consumer make purchasing decisions.
	Commerce APIs - Provide seamless purchasing and product fulfillment through at-home delivery, in-store pick-up, partner e-commerce sites, and web-based applications.

Those four areas just make sense, as they seamlessly bridge the physical retail and online retail consumer experience and extend the Best Buy brand in entirely new ways.  While there may be other innovative ways that retailers can utilize APIs, these are a great place to start.

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/02/mashery-evolution-of-distribution/">"Mashery - Evolution of Distribution"</a></h3>
			<p><em>02 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>Providing some real-world examples, Mashery invited four leaders in the API space to speak:

     
          Daniel Jacobson, Director of Engineering for Netflix API who walked us through how APIs are allowing them to stream video to over 200 devices, resulting in Netflix dominating in their space.
     
     
          Kumar Kandaswamy, Director, Open API Platform Business for Best Buy showed us how APIs have enabled them to extend their brand with the help of partners in ways they never could have done on their own.
     
     
          Adam Kleinberg, CEO of Traction and Mashable.com Tech Writer demonstrated why brands need to focus on having an open API for developers and not get lured into distractions like building apps for single devices.
     
     
          Edwin Aoki, Chief Architect of PayPal/eBay explained how APIs enable you to be more agile, and accelerate new forms of business development, even when your building a global commerce platform where 18% of the worlds online transactions are conducted.
     
I would say the one point I heard repeated over and over was the importance of understanding who the target audience of your API is. Designing and delivering your API in a way that caters to this audience will help keep development costs focused, network overhead as low as possible, and deliver exactly the tools and resources the most important segments of your audience will need.
These were just some of the interesting insights given, into how some of the most successful brands in the space, are using APIs to enable better distribution to consumers, partners and expand their brands globally.

			<p><em>01 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm processing all my notes from the 2011 Glue Conference, which has been one of the most thought provoking events I've been to this year.
The best part of events like Gluecon is you get to hang with some really smart and extremely experienced people.
I'm working to understand a new perspective I was exposed to while listening to Mark Suster talk about the Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years.
In his talk, he outlined three potential types of platforms:

	Platform as a Service - Platform around core application or business as an API, allowing others to build businesses on top of, and make money.
	Platform as an Extension - Platform around a core application that offers APIs as an extension for others to build on bringing value back to the core business.
	Platform as a Trojan Horse - Platform that allows others to build on, taking the risk, and the core business benefits from any value created.

As I work my way through the hundreds of available APIS I will definitely be applying what I'm learning...
What is the motivation of each of these API platforms?

			<h3><a href="/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">"Open vs. Closed APIs"</a></h3>
			<p><em>01 Jun 2011</em></p>
			<p>With all the buzz around APIs these days, its easy to get swept up in all the hype around open APIs, and miss the mark with your own API deployment.
So what do I mean by Open APIs? Open APIs are like Twitter, Twilio and many of Google APIs that are available for anyone to register for a key, and start programming against.
Discussions around APIs tend to start here. People often hear about the popularity of these APIs and want to emulate that.
If you don't directly have experience with API deployment, I recommend getting your feet wet with a more closed API deployment.
Immediately, calling APIs closed sounds bad. Sounds like you are being selfish or exclusive and don't want anyone touching your APIs. Because of this closed APIs don't get the press coverage and discussion they deserve.
In reality very few APIs find success in being open. Most API projects will get traction in sharing data and resources with business partners, and even internally between departments within a company.
Closed APIs enable you to serve a very limited audience, maintaining control over your data and resources, which is a common concern with API deployment.
Within this closed or controlled environment you can get your feet wet with API deployment, gain some experience, then maybe someday the right opportunity for an open API will come along.
It's not about Open vs. Closed, its about doing what makes sense and possibly doing both in the long run. I would also like to see more open discussion around best practices with closed API deployment in the press an blogosphere.

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/30/api-forums-using-get-satisfaction/">API Forums Using Get Satisfaction</a></h3>
			<p><em>30 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Get Satisfaction is one way to build API forums that enable productive conversations between an API owner and the developer ecosystem.
Simply engaging your customers in conversation won't earn you the respect of your community  and make your customers happy. Conversations are just a start, it's what you do with them that matter. Get Satisfaction was built on the idea of not simply creating conversations, but creating value from conversations.
Get Satisfaction focuses on outcomes in order to create value, as opposed to the confusing and ineffective taxonomy of traditional forums, it is focused on conversations around four simple, outcome-oriented topic types. This helps keep conversations focused and productive.
Working together with an API community to build a dynamic, social knowledge-base helps developers find answers to their questions on their own time, and often times much faster through traditional support channels. Every answer is publicly searchable, so there's never a need to answer the same question twice. This results in a dramatic reduction in the cost of API support, while greatly improving customer satisfaction at the same time.
Different topics inside of forums are full of opinions, wishes and wants. Opening a community conversation about your API roadmap can help you gather valuable market data you can quickly fold into your API development cycle, communications strategy or program schedule.
Another area often overlooked, is that opening an forum and inviting discussion about your API deepens user engagement, increases the amount of user generated content, and benefits your  search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. (Hopefully you have one?)
Direct interactiion with your developers through open and transparent forums increases satisfaction, loyalty and builds community. This community will give prospective customers a peek behind the curtain of how your API treats developers, make them feel like they belong, and creates a 2-way street of communication your entire ecosystem will benefit from.

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/29/api-technology-odata/">"API Technology - OData"</a></h3>
			<p><em>29 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>There is an ever growing amount of data available today and much of this data is now being collected and stored across a wide variety of system, locked into specific applications or formats, making it difficult to access, integrate and share.
The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a Web protocol for querying and updating data that provides a way to unlock data and free it from silos that exist in many applications.
OData frees data by applying and building upon existing web technologies like HTTP, Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) and JSON to provide access to information from a variety of applications, services, and stores.
OData emerged from experiences implementing AtomPub clients and servers in a variety of products over the past several years. OData is currently used to expose and access data from relational databases, file systems, content management systems and custom websites.
OData works to be consistent with the way the World Wide Web works, adhering to HTTP standards just like RESTful APIs. This reuse of core Web principles allows OData to provide data integration and interoperability across a broad range of clients, servers, services, and tools.
OData is released under the Open Specification Promise and allows anyone to be involved with OData implementations.

			<p><em>28 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>We are in the middle of an era of unprecedented growth in the number of available web APIs. In March 2011 ProgrammableWeb hit 3000 APIs in its directory, and is already up to 3,287 APIs as of today.
This is nothing. If you want a glimpse into the future of APIs, take a look at Evrythng.
Evrythng allows you to create online presence for any sort of object - products, business assets, vehicles, trees, buildings, and beyond.
Evrythng then gives you a management system to organise and operate an online presence forobjects, storing active profiles and updates, controlling access, and tracking usage. Evrythng creates a unique online identity for every object, providing a presence on the Web through a globally accessible URI.
Now this is where it really gets good. Evrythng also provides a RESTful API toolset and secure software �infrastructure' to share, manage and access real-time information about physical things.
Using the Evrythng API, you can directly connect real world objects and databases to Evrythng, allowing developers to mashup object information, add and exchange information with other objects, then combine and coordinate information and interaction across multiple applications and interfaces.
Evrythng wants to be the �Facebook for Things', giving physical things an individualdigital profile, and share real-time object information in a managed way.
If you think there are a lot of web APIs now, wait until every object on earth can potentially be accessed through APIs.

			<p>I'm reading all the starred items in my Google Reader about Google's latest closing of APIs, most notably Google Translate API. There are some pretty sensational headlines: Google pulls the rug out from under web service API developers, nixes Google Translate and 17 others GOOGLE IS NOT YOUR DADDY (OR LONG TERM RELIANCE ON APIS IS AS BAD AS OUTSOURCING) Google Translate API to Go Kaputt in December I don't feel the need to defend Google here, I wish to only defend APIs against people blaming them for what is the fault or responsibility of developers and API owners. I see this same line of attacks on APIs anytime an API company makes a change in their strategy, and developers freak out! First, let's start with the claims that developers are having the rug pulled out from under them, and you can't build a business on APIs! This week I was fortunate enough to hear Mark Suster of GRP Partners talk at Gluecon on Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years. One important point he made about business platforms and startups (ie. TweetDeck) is you need to have multiple data sources. Without expanding to LinkedIn, Buzz, and Facebook TweetDeck would have been left with only a single data source, and left completely vulnerable. This is a pretty basic concept when it comes to business. If I start a corner deli, and buy my food from a single food distribution company that delivers every Thursday by truck. Then one Thursday the truck doesn't come, and i'm left for the weekend without any food for my restaurant. Is it valid for me to claim that food distribution companies are no way to build a restaurant? Even in the case of TweetDeck, using a very unique API (ie. Twitter), they had to diversify with other services.

			<p><em>27 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Seevl, a music discovery service that provides anew way to explore the cultural and musical universe of various artists, just launched an API with the assistance of 3Scale.
When deploying the API, Seevl approached it a little differently than most. Instead of providing a separate API to access data, Seevl relies on content negotiation principles to deliver alternative representations of web pages.
This means the entire Seevl website is the API and you can get JSON representations of almost every page in the site.
Seevl relies on HTTP headers to let developers request data using a particular content-types, and authenticate using three parameters:

     
          Accept - The content-type required
     
     
          X_APP_ID - Developer application ID
     
     
          X_APP_KEY - Developer application Key
     
Here is an example search results for beatles using curl:

This approach is meant to make it easier for to developers focus on the development and let the Seevl client libraries handle the content-negotiation.
The Seevl API provides everal methods to search and pull specific data about individual bands and artists and related information.
While this approach is nothing new, its an interesting way to provide users with HTML views and developers with the JSON representations of information stored in a database.

			<p><em>26 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Loggly recently changed the structure for their cloud-based logging service from a tiered pricing, to a user-defined variable pricing structure.
Users can define their own pricing tier using two key variables:

     Daily Log Volume - 200MB to 8 GB
     
     Log Retention Time - 1 Week to 180 Days
     
The pricing change was in response to a growing user base, and demand for volumes greater than 2GB/day.
Loggly still offers a free plan which supports 200MB/day and retention of 7 days. There is also a beginning paid plan that starts with 200MB/day, but has retention of 15 days, starting at $8/month.
Loggly is also adding support for secure syslog (TLS), HTTPs on web inputs, and log archives on all account levels including the free plan.
This is a great example of Software as a Service (SaaS) and API service providers innovating around monetization and trying to find the best approach that fits their customers needs and the services they offer.

			<p>Tomorrow I'm participating in a session at Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers.
Justin Tormey of Alcatel-Lucent will be talking some about segmentation of API developers to focus on the different types personalities wtihin an API ecosystem.
Focusing outside of Gluecon for a moment, Facebook has been doing a good job of this type of platform segmentation. Yesterday they launched Facebook + Games, a page created for the the Facebook games partner and business community. The Facebook Page will focus on social gaming innovation, directly from the Facebook Games Partnerships Team.
I wrote about the the Journalist on Facebook page last month, and how Facebook is targeting media and journalist with a similar Facebook Partner Platform page. This was another example of their API platform segmentation.
This type of segmentation is key to success within a growing developer ecosystem, not all developers are created equal. Make sure you identify the differences within your community, and provide resources targeted to these gorups.

			<p><em>24 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>The modern Web API got its start in CRM with Salesforce, and in E-commerce with Ebay and Amazon, but it really found traction with social platforms like Flickr, Twitter, and Facebook. If we want a glimpse of whats next for APIs we need to look at the areas where web APIs have been applied for the longest. We need to look at examples likeAmazon's integration of their affiliate program with their Product API, and Qwerly's aggregation of social media profiles into a single API. The social space is an area where the future of APIs is being played out right now. Since the social arena has reached a critical mass in the number of platforms, users, mobile apps, and available Web APIs, the sector has matured beyond other industries, and offers great insight into what the future holds. I've talked about unified APIs that allow you to work with multiple APIs through a single interface, and the potential of API discovery services for industry or common API areas, but Qwerly's approach offers another view. Qwerly aggregates social profiles across many networks into a single dead-simple data API for the social web. With Qwerly you can get data about a user by querying the API with an email address or a social identifier, like a Twitter handle, a Facebook username or a Facebook ID, and the Qwerly API returns: the person's name their location a short description, like a Twitter bio their social networking profiles and usernames across the web, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks a score of their online influence among their peers, like Klout Qwerly API responses are delivered in JSON, and you only pay for what you use. The API combines information from web crawling, public web directories, other APIs with powerful heuristics and spam-detection algorithms, delivering high quality results. Other industries and sectors can benefit from such data and service discovery APIs, deployed in a RESTful way, using a...[<a href="/2011/05/24/whats-next-for-apis-learning-from-social-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>I was writing a story for ProgrammableWeb tonight on the enhancements Google made recently to its API console. I hadn't properly covered the API Console, API Explorer here on API Evangelist, so I took the time, played with more, and wrote up overviews for each. I noticed something while reviewing Google's recent efforts to organize their family of 88 APIs, and make it easier to discover, integrate, and manage for developers. Google is taking a similar approach to managing their APIs, as Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale does for other API providers. Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale provide a wealth of knowledge when it comes to API deployment that very few companies can touch. Beyond expertise, they provide a set of common building blocks every API should offer. These are tools like forums and blogs you can find elsewhere, but these API service providers deliver in a neat bundle ready to go for your API. But the real value they bring to the table, that you can't really find anywhere else is: API Billing API Traffic Controls API Metrics &amp; Analytics And Apigee has one other piece that Mashery and 3Scale do not. They have an API Explorer. Google provides an API Explorer, and they have open sourced the code, and made it available at Google Code. Next the Google API Console delivers billing and traffic controls, if this set of tools were made open source, this would be huge for the API community. I've been a big proponent of the need for open source API building blocks. I say this not to devalue what Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale bring to the table. Their stuff rocks. However there are many other API owners out there who aren't ready for a service like theirs, or can't afford, and a set of open source building blocks is needed. That leaves metrics and analytics. I think an open source set of API analytics would be the biggest benefit to the...[<a href="/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google APIs Explorer</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>The Google APIs Explorer is is a tool that helps you explore various Google APIs in a web interface without writing any code.
Google APIs Explorer allows you to:

	Browse quickly through available APIs and versions
	See methods available for each API and available parameters
	Execute API requests for any method and see actual responses in real time.
	Make pubic or authenticated API calls

The GoogleAPIs Explorer currently supports only JSON for responses and request payloads, even though some APIs support other data formats like XML and AtomPub.
The Google APIsExplorer provides an quick access tool for developers to discover what APIs Google offers, and enables users to immediately start using.
This type of discovery and instant visualization can be the difference between API adoption or choosing to go with an alternative.
Google APIs Explorer supports the following APIs:

	Buzz
	Custom Search
	Diacritize
	Moderator
	Search API for Shopping
	Language API
	URL Shortener

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google APIs Discovery Service</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>TheGoogle APIs Discovery Service provides a set of web APIs for discovering metadata across Google APIs. The discovery service delivers a JSON-based API that provides a directory of supported Google APIs, and a machine-readable discovery document"for each of the supported APIs that includes: List of API resource schemas based on JSON Schema List of API methods and available parameters for each method Available OAuth 2.0 scopes for each API Inline documentation of methods, parameters and available parameter values Developers can use the Google APIs Discovery Service to build client libraries, IDE plugins and other tools that interact with supported Google APIs. The Google APIs Discovery Service delivers two things for each supported API: APIs Directory Resource Identification and description information, including name, version, title, and description. Documentation information, including icons and a documentation link. Status information, including status labels, and an indication as to whether or not this is the preferred version of the API. Discovery document link, the URI of the discovery document for this API Discovery Document Resource Schemas, which is a list of API resource schemas that describe the data you have access to in each API Methods, including a list of API methods and available parameters for each method. OAuth scopes, which identifies the list of OAuth scopes available for this API. Inline documentation, which provides brief descriptions of schemas, methods, parameters and available parameter values. The Google APIs Discovery Service is part of a larger effort by Google to get a handle on their growing number of APIs. Developers find themselves potentially using multiple Google APIs across many application or client projects. The Google APIs Discovery Service allows developers to find new APIs available in the directory and programmatically discover how the API authenticates, what methods, and parameters are available. Not many companies have the number of APIs that Google has, and would need an API discovery service. But with the recent growth in web APIs there will be more...[<a href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google APIs Console</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>The Google APIs Console is an interface for developers to manage and view traffic data, authentication, and billing information for up to 15 Google APIs, and more coming soon.
Developers can bundle a collection of APIs into a project, and manage the following project information:

	Activated APIs - APIs can be activated to enable traffic monitoring, filtering, and billing, and API-specific project pages.
	Traffic information - Console reports show traffic information for each activated API, and allow for capping or filtering of usage for each API.
	Billing information - APIs now can have billing activated, allowing them to exceed the courtesy usage quota. Usage fees are billed using Google Checkout and charges are invoiced monthly.
	Project keys - Each project can be identified by either an API key or an OAuth 2.0 token. Using this key/token in API requests will identify the project, and enable the recording of usage data, filtering restrictions, and bill usage to the proper project. Within the Console developers can  generate or revoke API keys or OAuth 2.0 certificates for specific application.
	Team members - Team members can be established with read, write, or ownership access to each project's Console page.

The Google APIs Console supports fifteen separate Google APIs:


	Books API
	Buzz API
	Custom Search API
	Diacritize API
	Latitude API
	Moderator API
	Page Speed Online API
	Places API
	Prediction API
	Search API for Shopping
	Site Verification API
	Storage
	Tasks API
	Translate API
	URL Shortener API

The Google APIs Console provides a pretty comprehensive set of tools for developers and companies to manage their projects that integrate with various Google APIs.
The traffic control and billing tools provide a peek into the future of how billing and monetization will occur for APIs as they become more of a utility in our every day lives.

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/21/discovery-services-for-common-apis/">Discovery Services for Common APIs</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>I just wrote about the potential ofopen source API billing and traffic control building blocks, if Google would open source their Google API Console, like they did with the Google API Explorer.
I started bundling in thoughts on Google APIs Discovery Service into that post, but then realized it is a separate issue, needing its own blog post.
First, Google isn't about to open source Google API Discovery Service.  They issue developers of the Google APIs Discovery Service a patent license.  I couldn't find any more details tonight, but I'm assuming it puts this service in a different category than the rest.
I wrote an overview of Google APIs Discovery Service, but essentially it is a way to discover and describe Google APIs using an API.  Think Web Application Description Language (WADL), with a API to access, and focused only on supported Google APIs.
As the number of web APIs grow, the need for a discovery APIs and a standard description language will only grow.  We wil see services like Google APIs Discovery Service popup within specific industries and API areas.
You see potential for this with Mashsery's API Network, and even more evidence with Mashape's Marketplace.
There aren't many companies with the number of APIs that Google has, so you won't see any single company building an API discovery service like that.
However, I'd like to see API discovery services for cloud computing, social media, location-based, and telcommunication APIs appear making it easier for developers to discover, build code libraries, and integrate with common APIs.

			<p><em>18 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>With the growing number of 3D models used in 3D printing there is a building need for warehouse space to store these virtual products, and parts.
Of course this is virtual warehouse space, but it has a lot of the same characteristics of warehousing for physical products.
Google provides a 3D Warehouse for users of its SketchUp softare, and Shapeways provides a marketplace and warehouse in the form a gallery for its creators.
Cloud Storage will definitely have a role to play in warehousing the growing number of 3D modeling files using platforms like Google Docs, Box.net, and Dropbox.
3D Warehouses need to provide search-able, sharable and collaborative spaces that are affordable for designers to store and retrieve their work.
As 3D printing becomes a larger part of the global manufacturing supply chain, virtual warehousing across the globe will also become necessary to provide localized storage solutions.
3D printing offers significant advantages over traditional manufacturing when it comes to warehousing, but it still will be a critical part of the 3D print and manufacturing supply chain.

			<p>3D printing starts with someones idea.  Someones idea to recreate an existing object, or a vision of an object they hold in their head.
The evolution of 3D modeling software and 3D printers is creating a whole new generation of designers and creators.
These 3D creators come from many walks of life; architects, product designers, graphic designers, artists. and beyond.
Creators can build entire finished products, ranging from dinnerware to architectural components.
Creators can also build parts and pieces of finished projects from nuts and bolts to replacement parts.
3D designers and creators are often independent hobbyists and freelancers, but there are also a growing number of agencies and larger shops that are evolving along with 3D printing.
Creators are just the first link in an evolving 3D print and manufacturing supply chain.

			<p><em>18 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Once in production, a 3D model will be printed layer by layer using one of four potential 3D printing processes and corresponding materials:

Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) - SLS is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired 3-dimensional shape.
Stereolithography (SLA) - Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process using a vat of liquid UV-curable photopolymer resin and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin.
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) - FDM works on an additive principle by laying down material in layers. A plastic filament or metal wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which can turn on and off the flow.
Laminate Object Manufacturing (LOM) - LOM is a rapid prototyping system that layers adhesive-coated paper, plastic, or metal laminates are successively glued together and cut to shape with a knife or laser cutter.

These are four of the common 3D printing methodologies and since the introduction of metal, 3D printing has moved past prototyping and art and has become a viable manufacturing technology.
3D printing processes and materials are the link that  allows virtual to become physical in the 3D print and manufacturing supply chain.

			<p><em>18 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Marketplaces are necessary to showcase and make 3D printing products and parts accessible by the public and other potential customers.
Shapeways and Google SketchUp provide integrated warehousing and marketplaces for 3D designers to showcase their work.
As 3D printing grows, public and private marketplaces will evolve to provide services to showcase 3D products and parts to potential consumers.
Marketplaces will also go beyond showcasing 3D models, and actually act as marketplaces where items can be bid upon, creating virtual economies around 3D manufacturing.
These 3D economies will allow consumers to buy individual or bulk printed versions of 3D models.
3D marketplaces will provide competitive arenas, that creators and designers can find success by offering cheaper, unique and innovative 3D print products.
Marketplaces will represent a re-invented way of buying and selling products that feed an  evolving 3D print and manufacturing supply chain.

			<p><em>18 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Just like it takes creators to develop 3D models of physical objects, it takes makers, who are people that actually bring these virtual representations into the world.
3D printers do most of the work, but it takes someone who knows the machine, materials and process to bring these 3D models to life.
Many industries will adopt 3D printing, increasing the need for specialized talent understanding the needs of each sector, and how the printers, process and materials serve these sectors.
Creators will understand objects in a virtual format, and makers will understand them in a physical form.
3D printing is still a relatively new technology and will require constant improving as it evolves, makers will feed this evolution, and provide the knowledge to move the industry forward.
Makers are are another important human link in the evolving 3D print and manufacturing supply chain.

			<p><em>18 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>3D models used in 3D printing are stored in files.  These files can be a wide range of standard or specialized file formats.
File formats often depend on the type of 3D modeling software used, but there are many common formats:

.stl - STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems.
.iges - The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) (pronounced eye-jess) defines a neutral data format that allows the digital exchange of information among Computer-aided design (CAD) systems.
.obj - OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted by other 3D graphics application vendors. For the most part it is a universally accepted format.
.3ds - 3DS is one of the file formats used by the Autodesk 3ds Max 3D modeling, animation and rendering software.

There are many things to consider when selecting a 3D modeling file format for 3D printing.
3D file formats are a central part of the evolving 3D print and manufacturing supply chain.

			<p><em>18 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>3D printing is about delivering a virtual object as a physical object, on demand.
This is where our current shipping industry steps in;  UPS, Fedex, USPS, DHS and other shipping providers will make sure we receive our 3D printed objects.
With growing fuel costs, the need for localized delivery will grow, and here is another area where 3D printing will excel.
3D printers can be localized and deliver parts and products locally, with only the need to ship raw materials.
As the green revolution continues, 3D printing will become a key player providing localized manufacturing, and potentially printing made of more sustainable raw materials.
Delivery logistics will be a final and decisive link in an evolving 3D print and manufacturing supply chain.

			<p><em>18 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>3D printing doesn't always start with a human designer or creator. There are wide variety of 3D scanners that can be used in the 3D printing process.
A 3D scanner is a device that analyzes a real-world object to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance. The resulting data can then be used to construct 3D models.
3D scanning is no replacement for a human designer, but can offer a good start creating a 3D representation.
Each 3D scanner has its benefits and limitations, and resulting data will always need much work before it can be used in 3D printing.
3D scanners can offer a lot of benefit in rapid prototyping, and reverse engineering of existing objects.
Just like 3D printers you will find a wide range of 3D scanners, in both functionality and price.
You can also find innovative hobbyists employing tools like the Xbox Kinect for generating 3D scans.
3D Scanners are just the one possible link in an evolving 3D print and manufacturing supply chain.

			<p>When it comes to creating 3D models for 3D printing there are many types of software to choose from.
3D software solutions range from commercial to free, and can be desktop or part of a newer evolution of web-based applications.
Popular 3D modeling software includeds 3DTin, Tinkercad and complete 3D printing solutions like Shapeways.
One major player that was acquired by Google, is SketchUp.  SketchUp is building a large following of amateur and professional 3D designers and creators.
Many software solutions like Sketchup and Shapeways are finding success by simplifying the 3D modeling process and making it accessible by anyone.
As many software solutions move online it opens up the possibility for data portability, collaboration and many other aspects that will fuel growth in 3D printing.
3D modeling software is a critical link in the evolving 3D print and manufacturing supply chain.

			<p>A 3D printer works by taking a 3D model, then by making a series of slices that are printed one on top of the other to create a 3D object of the model.
Since 2003 there has been large growth in the sale of 3D printers, due to the decline in their cost.
You can find 3D printing used in jewellery, footwear, industrial design, architecture, engineering, construction, automotive, aerospace, dental, medical and a wide variety of other industries.
There are different types of 3D printers from low cost Makerbot printers for around $1500 to higher end ZCorp printers running around $60,000.
There has even been buzz around 3D printers being able to print most of their own parts, enabling 3D printers to recreate themselves.
Companies offering the the services of 3D printers range from hobbyists to publicly traded companies like Stratasys.
3D printers are just the golden piece of technology, making the entire 3D print and manufacturing supply chain possible.

Apigee, Salesforce,  Google, Microsoft, and Infochimps have all deployed REST API Explorers to support developer integration.
Facebook has now joined in....well a sort of.  Facebook employee Simon Cross developed a Facebook Graph API explorer for developers to use when working with the Facebook Graph API.
The explorer lets developers specify and endpoint, and generate a JSON response, with or without an user login access token.
Developers can also use the Facebook Graph API explorer for working FQL, which is the Facebook Query Language.
Interesting that a Facebook employee was the one to develop and deploy the explorer, I'm sure its something Facebook will officially integrate into the Facebook developer area soon enough.

			<h3><a href="/2011/05/16/yellowapi-com-and-the-future-of-api-monetization/">"YellowAPI.com and the Future of API Monetization"</a></h3>
			<p><em>16 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Canada's Yellow Pages Group (YPG) launched a new developer ecosystem to support their local search and location based services (LBS) API, YellowAPI.com.
YPG sees their developer ecosystem much differently than many other companies, they view the YellowAPI as a direct extension of its core business model, and the API dramatically extends the reach of its business network.
Within many API communities, the API owners can often seem distant from developers, or even view the development community as a problem.
As a developer I've experienced the limitations imposed by Twitter and Facebook, and I often feel ignored by Google when using their APIs.
I see YellowAPI's strategy as the future of API ecosystem management.
Developers can apply to be part of the YellowAPI.com developer community, once approved they gain access to a wealth of resources, including consultation on application design, quality assurance, legal guidance, technical assistance and can receive funding assistance to take their applications live.
In addition to these resources, YellowAPI.com provides opportunities for developers to monetize applications in the following ways:

     
          Paid Search - Paying for volumes of high quality traffic from applications
     
     
          Wigets - Group buying solutions in Canada and "Deal of the Day" widgets
     
     
          Advertising - Platform specific digital ad network provided by Mediative
     
     
          Placement - Premium paid search using mobile placement products
     
These aren't side opportunities invented just for the API, they represent YPG's core business.
Since YPG sees the API and its ecosystem as an extension of their core business, they are opening up revenue sharing opportunities for approved developers within its community.
If the YellowAPI community is successful in building sustainable business applications, YPG benefits. And because of the forward thinking API ecosystem strategy, when YPG makes money, the API developer community shares in this revenue.
How do you monetize your API, and where do your developers fit in?

			<p><em>11 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Google has had a busy year when it comes to APIs. So far this year they've launched 6 new APIs:

     
          Tasks API
     
     
          Books API
     
     
          Pagespeed Online API
     
     
          Places API
     
     
          Prediction API
     
     
          Fusion Tables API
     
As they add APIs to their directory they have also provided Google Discovery Service to help developers find APIs, Google Explorer to start working with APIs, and Google Console for developers to manage the APIs they integrate with.
With the addition of new APIs, some of the older APIs are rendered obsolete with new versions of the API, while others are just shutdown for not getting traction.
The following APIs are now deprecated but have no scheduled shutdown date:

     Code Search API
     
     Diacritize API
     
     Feedburner APIs
     
     Finance API
     
     Power Meter API
     
     Sidewiki API
     
     Wave API
     
While these APIs will be shut down per the deprecation policies outlined in their documentation:

     Blog Search API
     
     Books Data API
     
     Books JavaScript API
     
     Image Search API
     
     News Search API
     
     Patent Search API
     
     Safe Browsing API (v1 only)
     
     Translate API
     
     Transliterate API
     
     Video Search API
     
     Virtual Keyboard API
     
Google provides lengthy deprecation periods as long as 3 years in some cases, along with alternative APIs in other situations. The move is part of a larger effort to free up resources for other projects and make the overall Google API ecosystem a much more organized world.

			<p><em>10 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>Publisher and ed-tech company Pearson announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content.
Pearson's Plug &amp; Play Platform claims to unlock the company's large content bank which ranges from Dorling Kindersley (DK) Publishing's illustrated guides to Pearson Education textbooks.
The new API platform will allow developers to mash up Pearson content with other content and data to derive entirely to types of web, mobile and tablet products.
Pearson's Future Technologies Group Product Manager, Diana Stepner, says:
We recognise the world has changed and our content needs to be available for innovative uses outside Pearson. Plug &amp; Play opens up opportunities for DK and Pearson to connect with developers who are seeking the rich content we can share.
Pearson will be running initial platform tests using DK's Eyewitness Travel Guide material, then moving on to a wider range of subjects from science and natural history to gardening, parenting and early learning.
While it sounds promising that the world's largest education technology company is opening up its content via an API platform, Pearson doesn't reveal much information about just what this will entail.  What sorts of content will developers have access to?  What will access cost?  How will developers be able to monetize and license their projects that are based on the API?
More details will be forthcoming, as Pearson says the Plug &amp; Play Platform is slated for launch in early 2012.

			<p>The Amazon Associates Program allows web site owners to make money by marketing Amazon products on other their sites.
Users can market products using links and widgets they create by using the site stripe, a tool Amazon provides that builds code for links and widgets as they browse the Amazon web site.
Affiliate members can earn up to 15% in commission for referrals to the site that result in a purchase.
Amazon also provides a Product Advertising API for its more tech savvy affiliates to take advantage of.
The Product Advertising API allows affiliate developers to programmatically access Amazon's product catalog so that they can integrate Amazon products directly into their web sites and applications.
In addition to having access to the millions of products in its catalog, the Product Advertising API lets developers leverage Amazon's other features such as customer reviews, similar products, accessories, and listmania lists.
The most important aspect of Amazons approach to its affiliate and API offerings is that it automatically formats the URLs returned by the API to include the associate tag, which is the piece that links a referral and purchase to a developers affiliate account.
Amazon has been doing this a while, and they obviously have a solid vision of how an API and affiliate program can work together.

			<p><em>05 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm working to make it easier to get up and running using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.
One concept that is tough to understand at first, is that all printing starts with a Mimeo document.
Then using the API you can either order that document as is, or merge one or many PDF documents with it, generate a dynamic document, then order this new document.
As part of our API, we have a Document Listing Service, except it only pulls documents from a central account I have control of.
So if you want to pull one of the documents you created, you have to actually pull the Document ID from your My Mimeo account.
Sounds easy right?  Well its available in the URL, and in a properties screen for the document.
The Document ID is a GUID, for those of you who don't know what a GUID is:
A globally unique identifier or GUID (pronounced /??u??d/ or /??w?d/) is a unique reference number used as an identifier in computer software
So a Document ID looks like this:
3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301
Except for some reason the one that shows in My Mimeo is missing the dashes, and doesn't work when you pass through the API.
So I ask my API developer, where is the easiest place to get the Document ID?
He says, "In the URL or as property of document".
I explain it doesn't work without dashes.
His response is, Developers will understand, and know to put dashes back in.
And that is a hazard of putting developers as the public face of your API.
They make a lot of assumptions based upon what they know.
API Evangelists and developer advocates should definitely have programming skills, but ideally they should have a balance of proramming, business and marketing skills.

The Shapeways widgets is a classic example of why RESTful APIs are so powerful.
Shapeway employs an iFrame widget where users can enter their shop name, and customize the number of rows and columns, and the height and width of the widget.
These embeddable widgets allow Shapeways shop owners to extend their presence beyond the Shapeways marketplace across the World Wide Web.

			<p><em>03 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm starting to see more API providers working together to attract developers to their platforms.
As an API Evangelist I look for other APIs that enhance the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API, and try to figure out how I can leverage this, or at least tell the story.
Google Cloud Print Services Interface and the Box.net API have been two of my favorites so far. I also just finished a blog post about creating classroom training materials with Crocodoc and Mimeo Connect.
Today I saw thatRdio, the social music service announce their partnership with The Echo Nest, a music intelligence platform.
They are partnering behind the scenes, but I'm sure the API is the driving force behind this relationship.
APIs enable new types of partnerships, and even allow API providers to work together and offer a more collective value.
What other APIs do you think compliment each other, and should consider partnering?

			<p><em>03 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>In 2006, Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase Biz Dev 2.0 in a blog post explaining how several small companies had approached Flickr wanting to provide services that the photo-sharing site didn't feature. She noted that Flickr executives had little time in their schedules to arrange meetings to hash out these partnerships, and instead encouraged companies to feel free to apply for a Commercial API key and build something off the API. Biz Dev 2.0, she called it. Fast forward to 2011, APIs are a common part of the technology and business landscape. Some API providers have evolved their API offerings into platforms, and introduced self-service application development environments. From the pubic side, these are seen as service or application marketplaces where users can find add-ons they can use as part of the core web application. Think Google Marketplace, Facebook App Directory, and Box.net OpenBox. From the developers point of view these offer environments where they can easily build applications that integrate with an existing platform and user base. From the business perspective this is Biz Dev 2.5. Let me give you an example. When I started as API Evangelist for Mimeo.com a project that was already in the works was commercial print integration with Scribd.com. After serveral months of negotiations Mimeo was able to get a button within Scribd, Print to Mimeo. This happened before I was around, but right before I was hired Scribd updated their application to HTML5 and the Print to Mimeo disappeared. To get back on Scribd's development radar would take another round of outreach, discussion and integration into their development schedule. Next on my list of cloud storage provider integration after Scribd, was Box.net. Box.net has an API and a self-service application development environment called OpenBox. I can add my application and integrate it into Box.net without coordinating with Box.net staff. Once ready I can submit for approval in the OpenBox directory, or keep private and just send...[<a href="/2011/05/03/an-example-of-bizdev-2-5/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 May 2011</em></p>
			<p>With the recent explosion in the number and usage of APIs, the Internet technology industry is well aware of the value of the application programming interface.  It recognizes that APIs drive much of the Internet from social media and cloud computing to mobile applications.
But while there is plenty of information to get the developer community up and running with APIs, there is a shortage of information that can serve to educate the business community about the business of APIs.
The necessity of having that sort of outreach is one reason why I use the term API Evangelist instead of Developer Advocate.  While yes, developers do still need advocates, I also feel that there needs to be more evangelism to the business community about APIs and their benefits as well.
So I've partnered with my girlfriend Audrey Watters to develop a series of guides targeting the business community.  These aim to educate businesspeople about the coming API economy.
We have just published our first guide:  The Business of APIs.
Here is the table of contents:

Introduction
What is an API?
Who uses APIs?
What type of technologies go into an API?
History of modern Web APIs
Where some APIs stumble
Building blocks for a successful API
Fostering an API ecosystem
BizDev 2.5

An introduction to APIs, the book is aimed at a business audience, not the developer audience.  I believe that there are a lot of business owners, executives and decision makers out there considering APIs -- they've heard that it's "the thing to do" -- who need to be educated about how APIs work.&nbsp;The Business of APIs is a primer for just that sort of person.

Box.net provides a complete cloud storage platform, with a powerful developer platform and application directory called OpenBox. Mimeo.com provides commercial web to print services, and with Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API you can integrate print file management from Box.net *** Heads up!! This requires basic understanding of box.net and programming with PHP *** To do this I sign up for a Box.net developers account and add new OpenBox application: Give Application Name and Description Assign a description page for the application that tells about my printer. An important part of this application is a callback URL for when users first add the Box.net application. This has to be a page you host that handles the Box.net oAuth, which gives this print file manager access to a users account. Another important part of each application are whats called service actions. Service actions which will show up for any user who adds this application to their Box.net account from OpenBox. For my Open Box Application I create a new service action: Give Application Service Action a title like, Send Print File toMimeo Choose which document extensions my print file manager supports, PDF for now Enter a callback function which Box.net will send user when printing document Enter callback parameters such as URL, Title, Extension of Box.net file to be printed. Save your service action, fill out any other relevant parts of your application and hit save as well. This creates your application at Box.net.

			<p>Facebook has been accused of not caring about, or communicating with its developers, an image that can be hard to shake.
Recently they made a huge effort in turning this around, with a campaign called Operation Developer Love.
Each week they recap whats happened within the development community and provide some other nuggets of information:

	Code Samples
	Forum Activity
	Bugzilla Activity

This week they also provided an overview of how they are improving their documentation.
They also provide some insight into some developer site latency, and how they've move the site to some new servers and show a graph of significantly improved performance.

Operation Developer Love is a great example of actively trying to engage your API developer community.
I'm impressed by Facebooks efforts to open up and engage.

			<p><em>28 Apr 2011</em></p>
			<p>When it comes to APIs, and who uses them, we often think about partners. Sharing data and resources with partners has long been the number one reason for deploying APIs.
With the increased popularity of web APIs, many companies are opening up their APIs to the general public and freelance developers as well.
In addition to partner and public developers, there has been a recent trend in APIs being adopted internally, within a company. Many companies are finding success in eating their own dog food and building web and mobile applications using the same API infrastructure offered externally.
As an API evangelist, there can be a lot of value in encouraging API adoption by internal users.
Internal usage of APIs can increase efficiencies by sharing data and resources between departments and separate company locations.
However you can also increase overall company support and resources available to API efforts through internal adoption.
With increased internal usage, decision makers within a company see the value first hand and are more willing to approve budgets needed to develop more APIs, tools and resources that can be used by partners, public developers, as well as within the company.
Lack of budget and business resources are the number one reason API efforts fail or find limited success.
Remember to evangelize internally within your company, not just to partners and the public.

A couple months ago he also shared his thinking behind providing a full read / write API for paid Instaper subscriber accounts.
There is a lot of value in both his posts regarding monetization of APIs and mobile applications, but there is another story here.
Arment is an innovator in the web, mobile, and API development space. His openess to sharing the thoughts behind his strategy in all these areas is extremely valuable to our industry.
This insight, experience and the surrounding discussion provides potential models for other startups to follow, and could be the difference between success or failure.
Arment doesn't claim his strategy is the solution, admits to many mistakes, and states he will course correct as necessary in the future.
There is a lot of value in thought leaders like Arment openly blogging about their mobile, web app, and API strategy, as well asopening up for discussion in other communities.

			<h3><a href="/2011/04/28/a-unified-approach-to-delivering-apis/">"A Unified Approach to Delivering APIs"</a></h3>
			<p><em>28 Apr 2011</em></p>
			<p>Not all APIs are the same. Even with RESTful approaches to delivering APIs they can be quite different.
As APIs grow and as we want to be able to connect apps to multiple inputs and endpoints, there's an increasing need to make the process easier, more streamlined, and interoperable.
One example of this is within the cloud computing industry. When using AmazonEC2 and Rackspace, developers have to write separate code to integrate with each platform.
Another example is with social networks, when pulling social streams from Facebook and Twitter, developers have to develop separate code for each provider as well.
An new approach to solving differences between APIs that deliver similar functionality, but use different approaches, is to build a unified API.
Unified APIs bring together multiple APIs into a single interface. Two examples of this are:

     
          DeltaCloud API - With the Deltacloud API you can start an instance on an internal cloud, then with the same code start another on Amazon EC2 or Rackspace.
     
     
          Windsoc API - Using Windsoc API developers can access Facebook, Twitter, GoogleBuzz and other social APIs using a single interface.
     
Unified APIs do a lot of the work for developers, by providing a single interface to build against, as well as compensating for changes between APIs, and different versions of an API.
Cloud computing APIs and social network APIs have been around for a few years now, it makes sense that there is a need for a unified interface.
What other industries or types of APIs are in need of an unified API?

			<p><em>27 Apr 2011</em></p>
			<p>As I'm identifying common building used by various API service providers to build their APIs and communities, there are two innovative tools Im seeing show up more often.
API contestsand hackathons.
API providers like Twilio and Netflix are using them to attract new users, and to generate buzz and innovation around their API.
When I'm out at events, educating business users about APIs, I often get asked about the viability of contests and hackathons to generate free code and applications for an API community.
I think there is a common misconception amongst the business community that API owners can get away with not paying developers to build code and applications, by just framing what they want in the form of a contest or hackathon, and developers will all rally, and work for free.
While you can potentially develop usable code and applications in this environment, its not always the case, and definitely should not be the focus of an event.
API contests and hackathons are purely a marketing vehicle for generating attention around an API. Sure there are some secondary effects, like innovative code, apps, ideas, and developer talent, but these aren't a given.
Focus on a healthy, innovative reason for your API contest or hackathon. Apply the resources to make the sure event gets heard about across all relevant developer circles, and when the event happens, make sure it is all about the developers.
Envision your API contest or hackathon as the marketing vehicle it is, and the rest take care of itself.

			<p><em>26 Apr 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm doing a lot of researching and thinking about the future of commercial printing, 3D printing, and manufacturing.
Yesterday I was brainstorming on 3D printing and manufacturing with Google.
Tonight I'm learning more about Google SketchUp,which Google added toGoogle Apps in December of 2010.
Google SketchUp allows anyone to build 3D models to the STL file format, a standard for the 3D print industry.
3D printers like Shapeways lets you upload your STL files, print and order them in their physical form..
Google SketchUp provides a free and professional version of the modeling software.
They also provide a 3D Warehouse where you can find a collection of 3D models that are free to use.
There is a community of resources as well as training and education materials to learn about the platform.
Everything is there to build models to be used in 3D printing and manufacturing.  The only missing link right now is integration with Google Cloud Print.
Maybe Google will support STL file printing in the Google Cloud Print  (GCP) Services Interface soon.
3D printers like Shapeways could register their 3-D printers with GCP like I'm doing with Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API for commercial printing.
Lots of possibilities for 3D printing and manufacturing with Google Sketchup, Google Cloud Print, and 3D printers like Shapeways.

			<p><em>25 Apr 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm watching the future of manufacturing and printing unfold slowly in front of us. I'm paying attention to 3D printing solutions evolving from companies like Shapeways, MakerBot, Materialise, ZCorp, and Objet. At the same time I'm involved with the rollout of Google Cloud Print Services Interface, an API for managing printing to any printer over the Internet. I'm using Google Docs as a publishing platform, integrating Google Cloud Print with the Mimeo Connect API and evolving whats possible with commercial cloud printing. Google has added support for many more native file formats in Google Docs. Now all they need to do is add support for common 3D printing file formats: .stl - STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems. .iges - The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) (pronounced eye-jess) defines a neutral data format that allows the digital exchange of information among Computer-aided design (CAD) systems. .obj - OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted by other 3D graphics application vendors. For the most part it is a universally accepted format. .3ds - 3DS is one of the file formats used by the Autodesk 3ds Max 3D modeling, animation and rendering software. To support 3D printing file formats I'm sure they will have to introduce a new app to the Google Apps suite or evolve Google Drawings. Google Drawings only supports importing of .wmf files and exporting of .jpg, .pdf, .png, and .svg formats. I'm working on some modifications to the Google Cloud Print capabilities definition via .ppd or .xps for commericial cloud printing, I think we could also bend this definition to support 3D printing and mnufacturing. We have a ways to go, but I see the future of cloud 3D printing and manufacturing unfold in front of us with 3-D printing and cloud...[<a href="/2011/04/25/research-3d-printing-and-manufacturing-with-google/">Read More</a>]</p>
