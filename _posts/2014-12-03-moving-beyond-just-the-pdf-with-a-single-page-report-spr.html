<p>I&rsquo;m playing with more visualizations lately, trying to establish a base set of dynamic visuals I can use in my storytelling, and across the API Evangelist network. I've been focusing on using D3.js, Google Visualizations, and other JQuery plugins I've gathered over time.</p>
<p>Over Turkey Day, I turned a subway map JQuery plugin I had found into an API, and building a handful of ways I can easily use in my Hacker Storytelling format of publishing all of my research as Github repositories, using the master branch as a private file and data store, and the Github Pages as the public face of the project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adding the submit map to my visualization toolbox of JSON driven components I can use to publish my stories, and research to Github, adding to my other tools like jekyll posts &amp; data, mustache templates, reveal.js slideshows. I've identified a handful of visualizations that I want to add to my toolbox, providing a rich set of tools I can use to publish research reports, that have a rich, interactive, visualization layer.</p>
<p>In reality, my approach is just my own approach to lightweight app delivery, similar to single page apps, except I don't always adhere to a single page, or use a single framework&mdash;I try to keep lightweight, and a decoupled set of tools that I can mix and match to accomplish different objectives. As of this weekend the API Evangelist network is not over 100 separate Github repositories working in concert (or isolation), to achieve my mission to better understand the API space, and help others along the way.</p>
<p>As I work to assemble my API driven visualization toolkit, I&rsquo;m thinking I will start calling it a Single Page Report (SPR). While it won't be entirely true, as some reports could span multiple pages, I think the term still applies. Essentially an SPR can act much like the PDF gets used today when publishing reports. In this scenario rather than flattening the data, and resulting report, you would publish all the rich data, and visualizations to a Github repository.</p>
<p>If you wanted to flatten an SPR, you could still publish as PDF, but it could also be interactive, forked, and have pull requests made to update data, correct any problems, and further enhance the visualizations. I just wanted to get this idea out there. I will work on generated a couple of single page reports, to help demonstrate my vision. And hopefully I won't actually call it an SPR&mdash;I think I can do better.</p>
