{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im adding some new BaaS features I found in a recent press release from BaaS provider AnyPresence titled, AnyPresence Launches 4th-Generation Mobile Backend-as-a-Service Platform with Unparalleled Enterprise Capabilities, to my list of BaaS features. As Im processing them I notice they are some pretty significant features: Application Cloning - For organizations looking to build multiple apps that have common core functionality with only minor variations, this powerful feature allows them to create a copy of an existing app along with all data source, object, and user interface definitions, saving significant development effort.Automated App UI Testing - Developers who use AnyPresence to generate a starter mobile app user interface (UI), now get the added benefit of functional test scripts for native iOS, native Android, and jQuery Mobile web apps.These test scripts can be run to ensure the app is interacting with backend functionality as expected, saving time in testing and improving reliability.Custom Server Extensions - While developers have always been able to add custom code to objects within AnyPresence, they can now create re-usable “Extensions” that can be shared across teams or lines of business.</p>
