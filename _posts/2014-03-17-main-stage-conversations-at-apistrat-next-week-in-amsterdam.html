     We are getting close to the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in Amsterdam</a> next week. With less than one week left, I’m going to be really turning up the volume on API Evangelist about the conversations that will be going on at #APIStrat.
</p>
<p>
     Last week I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/the-15-sessions-at-api-strategy-and-practice-in-amsterdam/">took a look at the 15 sessions that are happening</a>, and today I’m taking a look at the keynotes, chats and panels that will be happening on main stage.
