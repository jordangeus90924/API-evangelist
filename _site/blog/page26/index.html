	<p>This blog is dedicated to understanding the world of APIs, exploring a wide range of topics from design to deprecation, and spanning the technology, business, and politics of APIs. <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist" target="_blank">All of this runs on Github, so if you see a mistake, you can either fix by submitting a pull request, or let us know by submitting a Github issue for the repository</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/aggregation-trend.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are two distinct types of APIs I keep an eye on. One is what I call my life cycle APIs, which are the APIs of the service providers who are selling services and tools to API providers and developers. The second category is what I call my stack network, and these are the individual API providers, who offer a wide range of API resources--<a href="http://apievangelist.com">you can find both of these types on the home page of API Evangelist</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 50+ life cycle APIs I track on can be used by companies to manage almost every stop along a modern API life cycle. In theory, all of these service providers have APIs. In reality, they do, but they do not practice what they preach&nbsp;and often do not make their APIs easily discoverable. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/27/which-api-service-providers-across-the-20-areas-i-track-on-have-apis/">I have said it a thousand times before--if you sell online services to API providers, you should have an API</a>. Period.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, I will have profiled all of the companies included in my API life cycle research, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/04/look-across-my-api-monitoring-api-methods-by-grouping-them-using-tag/">like I did for API monitoring</a>, and be able to provide a comprehensive API stack across all the providers for all stops along the life cycle. Ideally, each provider would have their own OpenAPI spec, but I'm still getting many of them to make their APIs public, convincing them of the importance of also having an API definition for their API will come next. Then I'll <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/14/modern-api-service-providers-need-to-speak-common-api-definition-formats/">continue pushing on them to allow for the import / export of API definitions</a>, so their customers can more easily get up and running with their services--if you need an example of this in the wild, <a href="https://getsandbox.com/">take a look at Sandbox</a>, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/08/example-of-api-service-providers-making-onboarding-with-services-easier-using-api-definitions/">over at API Metrics</a>.</p>
<p>I'd love to see someone take this idea and run with it beyond what I'm able to do as a one-man act. There are <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">numerous API aggregation solutions already out there</a> for financial, healthcare, images, documents, and more. What about an aggregated API across providers in the name of DevOps or microservices orchestration? An aggregated solution would allow you to automate defining of your APIs in multiple formats with API Transformer, deploy them using Docker or Heroku APIs, manage with 3Scale APIs, deploy sandboxes with Sandbox, monitor with Runscope, and almost every other stop along the life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure I've written this one up before, but I couldn't find it, so I wanted to get a fresh post up on the subject. With all the agile, orchestration, DevOps, microservices, continuous integration goingz on, having a coherent, cross-vendor API stack, and a suite of the usual analytics, billing, and other vital middleware services just makes sense. Let me know when you get up and running, and I'll send over my bank account information for the royalty payments. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-layers-opening.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wrote the other day <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/08/overlay-api-data-on-satellite-imagery-then-make-available-again-via-api/">about the interesting opportunity opening up within the satellite imagery API layer</a>, and earlier about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/05/airmap-is-positioning-itself-to-be-a-critical-api-broker-for-the-drone-industry/">similar opportunity that is being expanded within the fast growing dimension of our world being opened up with drones</a>. Layers within maps are nothing new, and is something that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/20/history-of-apis/">Google has pushed forward early on in the history of APIs with Google Maps</a>, but I feel is further being expanding on as APIs open new dimensions like satellites and drones. Then being further expanded on by adding API access to each layer for augmenting, and injecting other valuable API resources into these newly created API dimensions.</p>
<p>Let's see if I can successful describe the multiple API dimensions being opened up here. APIs are providing access to maps of our physical world, whether it is on the ground, from the air with drones, or from space with satellites, and these API-driven maps have layers, which are also made available via APIs, allowing other API driven resources like weather, forest fires, restricted spaces, and temporary or permanent elements are being injected. Once injected, these API-driven mapping resources with API injected resources are also being made available via APIs, providing entirely new, and specialized resources--that is a lot of APIs!</p>
<p>I am not even touching on the physical devices who put these maps to work also possessing APIs, like the drones, GPS units, cars, etc. This is just the expanding layer that is opening up via the multitude of API driven mapping resources&nbsp;and is further expanded when you look at the video layer which drones, mobile phones, automobiles, security cameras, and other Internet-connected devices are opening up. Drones, automobiles, and others will share layers with the mapping resources, but other video resources also will possess their own layers for augmenting the experience on the web, mobile, and television.</p>
<p>The part of this that is really striking to me isn't just the overlapping layers between mapping, video, and other channels, it is the overlap between our physical and virtual worlds. Think what Pokemon Go has done for gaming, but now consider drones, consumer automobiles, as well as commercial fleets. It can be very difficult to wrap your mind around the different dimensions&nbsp;of opportunities opening up, but it doesn't take much imagination to understand that there is a growing opportunity for APIs to thrive in this expanding universe.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2016</span>

<p>Sharing your platform's road map with the public, and your community is an often overlooked aspect of API operations&nbsp;but is one that can go a long way to communicate your plans for the future with your community. This is why <a href="http://road-map.apievangelist.com/">I carved the concept out into its own research area, to help me better understand how the successful API providers</a>, as well as API service providers are publishing, sharing, and communicating around their road map.</p>
<p>One example of this recently is out of the API documentation service provider Readme.io, who didn't just <a href="http://readme.io/roadmap/">publish a nice, simple, and clean road map for their platform</a>, they also <a href="https://blog.readme.io/our-new-public-product-roadmap/">told the story of the process</a>. This is a great way to announce that you have a road map for the platform but is also something you should repeat as often as possible, telling the story of what you just added to the road map and as much detail on why.</p>
<p>Sharing your road map, and the story behind goes a long way in lowering the anxiety around what the future holds for your API consumers, something that lets them know that you care about them enough to share what you have planned. In my opinion, a road map for an API platform shows that you have empathy for your community, and is something I like to encourage and support, by showcasing the process of your road map storytelling here on my blog when I can.</p>

<p>I was reading the post from <a href="https://socrata.com">open data service provider Socrata</a> about "<a href="https://socrata.com/blog/putting-citizens-first/">putting citizens first</a>"&nbsp;when it comes to opening up city, county, state, and federal government data. One of the headlines they showcased was <em>"Texas overhauls open data portal, prioritizes commonly requested info"</em>--which is a pretty sensible thing to consider for not just government, but also companies thinking about what to open next.</p>
<p>First, let me emphasize that I am talking about open data that is already published on the web in another format (or should be). What the State of Texas is doing is <a href="http://low.hanging.fruit.apievangelist.com/">what I call the low-hanging fruit for API deployment</a>--if it is on your website, it should also be available in a machine-readable&nbsp;format. Ideally, you offer HTML, as well as JSON, XML, and other relevant formats side by side within a single domain using <a href="http://restlet.com/blog/2015/12/10/understanding-http-content-negotiation/">content negotiation</a>, but no matter how you accomplish it, the priority is making sure that commonly requested information is accessible to those who need it.</p>
<p>It is a shame that Texas is only now considering this with the latest revision of their portal, ideally government agencies and companies would be applying this way of thinking by default. If it is on your website as HTML, most likely it has already been deemed important, which is why it was made self-service on the open web in the first place. If you are planning on deploying an API or open data portal, and you are just wondering where you should start, make sure to learn from the State of Texas, and prioritize the commonly requested information.</p>

<p>I am coming across more API providers who have carved off specific "skills" derived from their API, and offering up as part of the latest&nbsp;push to acquire new users on Slack or Facebook. Services like Github, Heroku, and Runscope that API providers&nbsp;and developers are putting to work increasingly have bots they employ, extending their API driven solutions to Slack and Facebook.</p>
<p>Alongside having an application gallery, and having an iPaaS solution showcase, maybe it's time to start having a dedicated page to showcase the bot solutions that are built on your API. Of course, these would start with your own bot solutions, but like application galleries, you could have bots that were built within your community as well.</p>
<p>I'm not going to add a dedicated&nbsp;bot showcase page until I've seen at least a handful in the wild, but I like documenting these things as I think of them. It gives me some dates to better understand at which point did certain things in the API universe begin expanding (or not). Also if you are doing a lot of bot development around your API, or maybe your community is, it might be the little nudge you need to be one of the first APIs out there with a dedicated bot showcase page.</p>

<p>I'm pretty skeptical about many of the reasons behind why companies are connecting devices to the Internet using APIs--I am just not convinced this is the best idea when we already have so many security issues with the standard, and mobile web. Regardless, I'm constantly working to understand the motivation behind a company's motivation to do APIs, as well as what they are telling their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I published a story last week about&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/16/defining-the-industrial-programmable-automation-controller-pac-strategy-using-an-api/">defining the industrial programmable automation controller (PAC) strategy using an API</a>, which focuses on the approach by Opto 22. To support their efforts the industrial automation provider <a href="http://info.opto22.com/snap-pac-rest-api-thank-you">offers up a dedicated page to educating their customers</a> on why you would want to use REST, providing some bullets:</p>

<p>Each of the industrial controllers "includes&nbsp;an HTTP/HTTPS server and RESTful API, compatible with any programming language that supports JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)". In my opinion, this reflects the wider API space that is serving the web and mobile objectives, allowing for integration using any programming language, as well as opening up the devices to API orchestration solutions using <a href="http://ipaas.apievangelist.com">iPaaS</a>, and the variety of other API service provider solutions available in the market.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think using web technology is inexpensive, and avoids the usage of proprietary, vendor specific solutions. As the ability to offer up a web server on any physical object becomes easier and cheaper, the usage of web APIs to interact, integrate, and orchestrate around physical objects will only increase, for better or worse.</p>

<p>The APIs which have seen the greatest adoption across the API space, always provide the functionality that developers are needed in their applications. It is either because the platform is already in use by their users (ie. Twitter, Facebook), or just provides the core feature that is required (ie. SMS, Email). There are an unprecedented number of high-value APIs out there, but I think many API providers still struggle when it comes to defining them in a way that speaks to the needs that web, mobile, and device app developers will be needing.</p>
<p>I have explored this topic before, discussing the importance of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/23/exposing-the-meaningful-skills-our-apis-possess-for-use-in-the-next-gen-messaging-and-voice-apps/">exposing the meaningful skills our APIs possess for use in the next generation of messaging and voice apps</a>, as well as asking <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/14/do-my-apis-have-the-skills-they-need-to-compete-in-a-voice-and-bot-enabled-world/">whether or not our APIs have the skills they need in a voice and bot enabled world</a>. I am not 100% behind the concept that voice and bots are the future, but I am 100% behind defining our API resources in a way that immediately delivers value&nbsp;like they are doing in these environments.</p>
<p>The approach used by Alexa, when it comes to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit">developing "skills"</a> is an important concept for other API providers to consider. Even if you aren't targeting voice enablement with your APIs, the model provides many positive characteristics you should be emulating in your API design, helping you deliver more meaningful APIs. For me, thinking in terms of the skills that your APIs should be enabling, better reflects the API journey, where we move beyond just database and other very technical resources, and providing the meaningful skills developers need for success, and end-users (aka humans) are desiring.</p>

<p>My "fellow"&nbsp;<a href="https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/fellows">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>&nbsp;Mollie Ruskin (<a href="https://twitter.com/mollieruskin">@mollieruskin</a>), was doing some work with veterans recently and stumbled across a pretty disturbing example of how racial bias is being baked into the algorithms that are driving our online, and increasingly offline worlds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This morning I was searching #&lrm;Google for images of #&lrm;Veterans for a project. I stumbled upon a photographer who had taken hundreds of beautiful photographs of Veterans all in the same style.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I clicked on a few striking portraits...I quickly noticed something very troubling.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When doing image searches, I often use the 'related images' feature to uncover more pictures relevant to what I'm hunting for, as was the </em>case this time<em> around. Where most of the photos returned related images of other veterans, one photo of a smiling black male vet in his uniform fatigues, garnered a series of related images that were all mugshots of CRIMINALS.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The tools we use to fuel our </em>21st century<em> lives are not the seemingly neutral blank slates we imagine them to be. They are architected and shaped by people, informed by our conscious and unconscious biases. Whether this is reflecting back a dark mirror on what people click on or surfacing a careless design in an algorithm, this random search result shines a little more light on the more subtle and insidious ways racism is baked into our modern lives.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>For my friends who work at the big tech giants which are increasingly the infrastructure to our lives, please help make sure your institutions are addressing this stuff. (And thanks to those of you who already have been.)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>#&lrm;BlackLivesMatter</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>PS: Recently saw a great talk about this idea of 'oppression' in our algorithms. Def worth a watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRVZozEEWlE</em></p>
<p>This isn't some edge weird case, this is what happens when we craft algorithms using development teams that lack diversity. Racial bias continues to get baked into our algorithms because we refuse to admit we have a problem, or unwilling to actually do anything about it. Sadly, this is just one of many layers in which bias being built into our algorithms, which are increasingly deciding what shows up on your Facebook wall, all the way to which criminals will commit crimes in the future.</p>
<p>You will hear more stories like this on API Evangelist as I push forward my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">APIs and algorithm research</a>, working to identify ways we can use open source, and open APIs to make these often black box algorithms&nbsp;more transparent, so we can potentially identify the&nbsp;bias&nbsp;inside. Even with this type of effort, we are still left with having to do the hard work change the culture that perpetuates this--I am just focusing on how we crack things open, and more easily identify the illness inside.</p>

<p>Technology evangelists are nothing new, but are something I think is continuing to expand as the Internet continues to crack open more of the core areas of the tech sector. I specifically chose the term API Evangelist to define what I did evangelizing for all APIs, but all I was really doing is following the lead of evangelism pioneers like Amazon, Google, and even Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has long been discussion around evangelism vs advocates, and I've seen companies also choose to adopt an ambassador format. I have also been interested to see the evolution of <a href="https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains">Docker's Captain's</a>&nbsp;program--who are "<span>Docker experts and leaders in their communities who demonstrate a commitment to sharing their Docker knowledge with others".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I also stumbled across a post out of the <a href="https://www.compose.com/articles/compose-view-say-hello-to-the-database-advocate/">MongoDB as a service provider Compose showcasing what they call the database advocate</a>, whose "<span>job is not to guard the database from the world but to advocate the best ways to use it and offering the tools to optimize that usage". In their view, the outdated DBA is going away, with the database advocate emerging as a much more friendly, outward facing, pragmatic gatekeeper for databases within the enterprise.</span></p>
<p>It makes me happy to see the open ethos brought to the table by web APIs spreading to all the layers of the tech stack, making the world of virtualization and containers more accessible. As an old database guy, it makes me really, really happy to see it also spread to the world of databases--I am hoping that it is something that continues to spread to all layers.</p>

<p>I have been talking with&nbsp;Nick Houghton over at <a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview">Sandbox</a>&nbsp;about the state of OpenAPI Spec driven API documentation, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">the lack of a machine-readable core when you deployed Slate driven documentation</a>. He was wanting the same thing--a good looking, dynamic API documentation that was OpenAPI Spec driven.</p>
<p>He recently got back to me&nbsp;and found a solution that worked for them: <em>"<a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview">Ended up just templating the Swagger JSON myself rather than relying on Slate etc to do it. So model/resources are Swagger annotated, CI pushes out Swagger JSON and Angular UI </a></em><a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview">parses</a><em><a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview"> in the browser, works quite well I think</a>".</em></p>
<p>Nick is on a similar path that I am, as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/08/playing-with-concepts-around-simplifying-the-api-docs-that-are-generated-using-api-definitions/">I work to simply API documentation using OpenAPI Spec</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/09/providing-specialized-views-of-an-api-surface-area-dynamically-with-openapi-spec-and-liquid/">provide specialized views of APIs using Liquid</a>. We are looking for the simplicity, control, and beauty of Slate, but the machine readable core of OpenAPI Spec--allowing us to keep the core specification for the API up to date, and the documentation is always the latest.</p>
<p>They are going to write up their journey on their blog (as all API service providers should), and share with us. I'll probably&nbsp;do another write-up once I get more details on how they created the templated API docs using OpenAPI Spec and Angular. I also like how they have the OpenAPI Spec JSON pushed out as part of the CI life-cycle--something I'll cover more as part of my <a href="http://orchestration.apievangelist.com/">API life-cycle orchestration research</a>.</p>

<p>I saw that the <a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/blog/fullcontact-acquires-conspire/">contact API solution FullContact recently purchased the professional network management solution Conspire</a>. Thankfully FullContact is good about blogging about the move, and the details of the motivations behind their decision -- without this type of storytelling I wouldn't even have known it happened.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed in the blog post was that <em>"Paul, Alex, and the entire&nbsp;<a href="https://www.conspire.com/">Conspire</a>&nbsp;team have been fabulous partners with FullContact, having utilized our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/developer/person-api/">Person API</a></em><span><em>&nbsp;as a part of the Conspire offering"</em>. Acquisitions from within an API ecosystem is not new. It is why many companies do APIs in the first place, to help identify talent within their ecosystem like Paypal does, and complimentary companies and teams like FullContact has done.</span></p>
<p>There are many mating rituals you can perform as a startup these days, and building an interesting product, service, and company on top of an API is a pretty cool way to accomplish this. Obviously, it is easier said that done, but if you can identify a real-world business problem, and develop a solution to solve this problem on top of an API, and get some real traction--it can lead to some pretty interesting outcomes.</p>

<p>I was going through the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com">Cisco Devnet ecosystem</a> and stumbled across their <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/">sandbox environment</a>. I thought it was worth noting that they provided several different types of sandbox environments, with a rolling list of available sandbox instances at any point in time.</p>
<p>Cisco provides seven different types of sandboxes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/available-labs/networking">Networking</a>&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;<span>The Networking Sandbox allows you to remotely access Cisco Networking technologies. Each Sandbox contains either simulated or physical network elements as well as access to developer tools. Some Sandboxes also provide for the creation of synthetic traffic.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/available-labs/comm-collab">Collaboration</a>&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;<span>The Communication and Collaboration Sandbox allows you to remotely access Cisco Collaboration technologies in a cloud lab. Labs contain Cisco UC services: Unified Communications Manager, Unified Presence, and Unity Connection. In these labs you can build and test integrations to support features such as Instant Messaging/ presence, voicemail, and conferencing services into your application or using e.g. the Jabber Web SDK.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/available-labs/ivt">Compatibility Testing</a>&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;<span>The DevNet Sandbox IVT program allows users to complete Interoperability Verification Tests (IVT) in our labs with your engineer as an option to using an authorized Cisco IVT partner services lab. Cisco Solution Partner Program members will be eligible for a Cisco Compatible Logo once testing is complete and deemed passed. The labs contain the architecture, configuration and products needed to complete an IVT for supported products and categories.</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/available-labs/iot/index.gsp">IoT</a>&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;<span>The DataCenter Sandbox allows you to remotely access Cisco Iot technologies remotely. Labs contain architectures with products from the DevNet Iot product portfolio. The labs contain simulated and actual hardware elements as well as access to tools or synthetic traffic.</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/available-labs/cloud/index.gsp">Cloud</a>&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;<span>The Cloud Sandbox allows you to remotely access Cisco Cloud technologies remotely. Labs contain architectures with products from the DevNet Cloud product portfolio.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/available-labs/security/index.gsp">Security</a>&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;<span>The Security Sandbox allows you to remotely access Cisco Security technologies remotely. Labs contain architectures with products from the DevNet Security product portfolio. The labs contain simulated and actual hardware elements as well as access to tools or synthetic traffic.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/available-labs/data-center/index.gsp">Datacenter</a>&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;<span>The DataCenter Sandbox allows you to remotely access Cisco DataCenter technologies remotely. Labs contain architectures with products from the DevNet DataCenter product portfolio. The labs contain simulated and actual hardware elements as well as access to tools or synthetic traffic.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I like the diverse number of environments represented here. I've been seeing more virtualized environments&nbsp;show up in support of device-based API integrations--you just can't expect everyone to develop and test against the real thing. The significant area represented here for me is the compatibility and security testing sandbox environments--important areas of if we are going to harden integrations.</p>
<p>API definitions like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint, combined with recent advances in virtualization (aka containers), makes for a pretty rich environment for pushing forward the number of available sandbox environments that developers can take advantage of. I'd like to see more API providers offer sandbox environments, build up the capacity in this area, and get to the level where Cisco is already operating, and offer a rich variety of virtualized environments for developers to test their integrations against.</p>

<p>I was playing around with the free and the now paid layers of Stoplight.io, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/19/i-know-it-is-hard-when-you-are-just-getting-started-but-please-make-your-pricing-page-public/">wrote a previous piece about their lack of a public pricing page</a>, and I noticed they provided an anonymous&nbsp;layer to their API modeling service--<a href="https://app.stoplight.io/requests/">without logging in, you can play around with their HTTP client tool, and make requests to an API.</a></p>
<p>The anonymous version is super limited compared to their full solution, but I think the presence of an&nbsp;anonymous edition opens up an interesting discussion. It appears Stoplight.io has done a lot of work lately to separate the layers of v2 of their service, and provide a public, free, as well as paid, and enterprise editions of their API modeling solution.</p>
<p>With the shrinkage of freemium these days in the API space and the tightening down on free trials, an anonymous layer is compelling. It isn't something that would work for all API service providers, but it is at least something to consider as you are working to define the layers like Stoplight.io has been doing.</p>

<p>I received an email from <a href="https://stoplight.io/">Stoplight.io</a> about their version updates, which included the phasing out of the free beta period--makes sense. I clicked on the "you can view pricing, and setup billing, on your <span class="s2"><a href="https://via.intercom-mail.com/e?ob=Fzn1KX8qpL4Tj%2Bdj7ZqP4%2BlJKxWc1o2l%2BxKdttdR9g2KcFuIc3J7XXtd8SOATo00&amp;h=f74d2415ba4e11a5e1feb8d86c27010cced7c5c4-5693065993">account billing page</a>" in the email, and was taken to the register page.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To clarify a little bit, I have an account with Stoplight.io, which I registered using my @kinlane Github account. I'm logged in as my @apievangelist Github account presently as I'm doing some work with multiple repos, and I really didn't want to log out of @apievangelist and log in with my @kinlane just to see the pricing.</p>
<p>So I head directly to the public website of Stoplight.io to look for pricing--which I can't find within 30 seconds (standard approach). When this happens I will then Google for the [API name] + "pricing"--nothing. Ultimately I did log with my @kinlane Github so that I can see the pricing because I genuinely want to keep my account, as Stoplight.io made it into the highly useful tool category for my world.</p>
<p>I just wanted to articulate the friction I experienced, so Stoplight.io can consider, but also so that the rest of you can consider. My preference is that you always make your pricing page public. I understand that this is difficult for startups that are just getting going, are in beta phase, etc., but I feel like in 2016 it should be the default practice for API providers, as well as service providers.</p>
<p>Even if your service is in beta, and you aren't charging for it yet, you should have a dedicated page to explaining this, and keep it updated as you evolve. Please do not make me log in just to review your service, understand what it does, and find your&nbsp;pricing. This is bad for helping analysts like me understand what you are up to (no I don't want a briefing), and is bad for your customers who are trying to understand where their accounts stand, and whether we can afford to move forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've been an&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/27/merging-api-automation-and-interoperability-into-api-reciprocity/">advocating for API providers to embrace integration platform as a service provider&nbsp;(iPaaS) for three years now</a>, encouraging them to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">make sure their API is accessible via popular platforms like Zapier</a>. While I don't push these as a required building blocks for all providers, they definitely are what I'd consider as the common building block across many of the successful APIs I keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Making sure your API is available on iPaaS platforms, and you are showcasing these opportunities is becoming more and more important. Another positive move you can make when it comes to&nbsp;iPaaS,&nbsp;is to tweet out what is possible on a regular basis like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mailjet.com/">#mce_temp_url#</a>the transactional and marketing email API provider Mailjet does--here are a couple examples of this in the wild:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/mailjet/status/765944031188844544"><span>Connect </span>@Mailjet<span> + </span>@send_with_us<span> to leverage email marketing with awesome deliverability</span></a></li>

</ul>
<p>I may add this type of activity to my list of common <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">API evangelism</a> building blocks. It is something that I think compliments the fact that you have iPaaS integration solutions, and you are showcasing them within your API portal. It just makes sense that you should also be regularly tweeting out these opportunities, and making it known to your followers, and hopefully your API consumers.</p>
<p>Tweeting out the iPaaS opportunities available for an API is a great to reach beyond just the developer API consumer, and potentially reach the actual business consumer, who is probably going to have a real world problem that they hopefully will be able solve using your API--opening up a whole other dimension to how your API can be put to work.</p>

<p>It always bums me out that the cool kid startup APIs always get the lion share of the attention when it comes to APIs in the tech news. Which I guess makes it my responsibility to show the ACTUAL cool kid APIs, like <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/">the&nbsp;Chronicling America API from The Library of Congress</a>, which provides access to information about historic newspapers and select digitized newspaper pages.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress provides APIs for&nbsp;<a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#search">searching</a>&nbsp;the newspaper directory and digitized page contents using <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Home">OpenSearch</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#autosuggest">auto suggesting</a>&nbsp;of newspaper titles, <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#link">links</a>&nbsp;using a stable URL pattern, and&nbsp;<a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#linked-data">JSON</a>&nbsp;views of all newspaper resources. They also provide&nbsp;<a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#linked-data">linked data</a>&nbsp;allowing you to&nbsp;<span>process and analyze newspaper information with "conceptual precision" (oooooh I like that), as well as&nbsp;</span><a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#bulk-data">bulk data</a>&nbsp;for your deeper research needs.</p>
<p>I wish that ALL newspapers had APIs like the <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://open-platform.theguardian.com/">The Guardian</a> do, and information was available to the public by default, and that everything was automatically synced to any archive or collection that was interested in it, like the Libary of Congress. I know that newspapers are having a hard time in the digital age, and I can't help but feel that APIs would help them evolve, and shift until they find their voice in the digital age.</p>

<p>As I was writing up a story on Mailjet tweeting out the iPaaS opportunities around their&nbsp;email API, <a href="https://twitter.com/mailjet/">I noticed their Twitter bio</a>. It is subtle, but having spent a great deal of time looking for the support channels for an API, this is a potentially huge time saver. It is what I do best, discovering these simple, subtle things that the successful API providers are doing.</p>
<p>I always encourage API providers to use Twitter as a support channel&nbsp;because it doesn't just provide support, it also is a public demonstration that you give a shit about your API consumers, and will actively work to help them solve their problems. I've seen APIs who offer no support, or a minimal number of support channels, while also seemingly&nbsp;working very hard to hide them--leaving you feeling like you will never get help when you need it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mailjet.com/">Mailjet</a> provides links to their status page, as well as a link where you can submit a trouble ticket in their Twitter bio. I would consider their Twitter bio pretty well crafted with the first half explaining what they do(for new users), and the second half providing information on how to get support(for existing users). It is a subtle, positive thing that all API providers should consider doing--thanks for the lead Mailjet.</p>

<p>In September of 2015, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/08/when-are-we-going-to-get-a-save-as-json-in-our-spreadsheets/">I asked when are we going to get a save as JSON in our spreadsheets</a>? I was doing a lot of work saving spreadsheets as CSV files, something I can easily do programmatically, but I was doing it manually as part of a workshop. After I downloaded each CSV file, I then <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/csv-converter/">converted to a JSON file</a>--leaving me asking, "where is the save as JSON"?</p>
<p>As I've been reviewing new <a href="https://dev.office.com/excel/rest">Microsoft's Excel API</a>, I got to thinking about the need for a save as JSON option, and now I think that this line of thought was not forward thinking enough. A "save as" just does not speak to the future of machine readable spreadsheet interactions in an online world. Save as CSV, TSV, are very desktop oriented visions of using Excel, and in 2016 we need more.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.office.com/excel/rest">Microsoft's Excel API</a>&nbsp;plus OAuth&nbsp;opens up an endless number of opportunities for working with data available in spreadsheets. Microsoft will have to open up the navigation in the online version of Microsoft Excel to the API developer community, allowing for users to subscribe to 3rd party API driven&nbsp;solutions like, save as JSON, open in Github as CSV, visualize with D3.js, and anything else that developers dream up via the Microsoft Excel API.</p>
<p>Maybe this is already possible in the Microsoft Excel online navigation, regardless, there will also be opportunities for extending these options via browser add-ons, as well as integration directly within 3rd party solutions, that use OAuth and the Microsoft Excel API to access valuable data that is locked up in spreadsheets. I enjoy that APIs are constantly pushing me to re-evaluate my legacy ways of thinking, and help me look more towards the future.</p>

<p>I work as hard as I can to understand every sector being opened up using web APIs, and the network level is one that I need to push my awareness&nbsp;of, partially because I find it interesting, but mostly because of the impact it can have on every other aspect of how the Internet works (or doesn't).</p>
<p>To get started I went over to Cisco Devnet, and <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/pxgrid/">took a look at their pxGrid solution</a>, which is a "multivendor, cross-platform network system that pulls together different parts of an IT infrastructure such as security monitoring and detection systems, network policy platforms, asset and configuration management, identity and access management platforms", which provides "you with an API that will open up a unified framework that will enable you to integrate to pxGrid once, then share context with any other platform that supports pxGrid".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd categorize pxGrid as&nbsp;network&nbsp;API aggregator in my world, providing a single, seamless API to access resources at the network level. Of course, all the network endpoints have to speak pxGrid, but the platform provides me with an introductory blueprint for how web APIs are being applied to network resources, for device configuration and management, as well as identity and security services. I'm not a network professional, but I do know that Cisco devices are pretty ubiquitous, and with the company historically having over 50% market share, I'm betting it is a&nbsp;good place to kick off my learning.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-reciprocity2.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/27/merging-api-automation-and-interoperability-into-api-reciprocity/">Early on in 2013, I started a research project to keep an eye on a specific type of API driven service provider, like IFTTT and Zapier, who were enabling individuals and businesses to move data around in the cloud</a>. This new wave of startups was moving from what we traditionally called ETL in the enterprise, which was about extracting, transforming, and loading data between various systems, into the cloud era.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm an old enterprise database guy, and ETL has been an essential tool in my toolbox for quite some time--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">according to Wikipedia ETL</a> is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) refers to a process in database usage and especially in data warehousing that performs: Data extraction &ndash; extracts data from homogeneous or heterogeneous data sources.</em></p>
<p>The IT teams that I have historically been a part of have employed ETL to make sure data was where it was needed within the enterprise. As IT began its evolution to the web, the need to migrate data between systems outside the firewall increased. We were increasingly extracting, transforming, and loading data via FTP, web services, and web APIs outside the firewall, and even migrating data between systems that exclusively existed in the cloud.</p>
<p>Increasingly the data we were migrating was using web APIs&nbsp;and began employing a more granular approach to how authentication occurred for each "extract and load"--oAuth. With the growth of shadow IT, and the adoption of software as a service (SaaS) solutions, individuals, and businesses were needing to move documents, media, and other vital data or content between the cloud services which we were increasingly depending on.</p>
<p>APIs were enabling savvy tech users to migrate and sync their data between systems, and startups like IFTTT and Zapier saw the opportunity and jumped in with their new offerings. I do not talk about IFTTT, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/why-i-am-continuing-to-integrate-zapier-in-my-business-workflow/">as they choose to not pay all of this forward by offering an API</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/hello-pinboard-customers-from-linden-tibbets-the-ceo-of-ifttt/">also opt to ignore the transparency that APIs bring to the table</a>--so I will simply refer to Zapier as my example of this new breed of service provider. ;-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to evolving beyond FTP and ODBC as the primary channels, and being about the migration of information in the cloud, the other significant characteristic that stood out for me, is this new approach was also paying attention to the individual needs of stakeholders, owners, and the people who the migration of information was important to. This information was also increasingly being migrated between multiple systems&nbsp;and adhering to the terms of service, as well as the privacy of each party involved.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/27/merging-api-automation-and-interoperability-into-api-reciprocity/">When I launched my research back in 2013, I called it reciprocity</a>, which the dictionary defined as:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>the quality or state of being reciprocal : mutual dependence, action, or influence</li>
<li>a mutual exchange of privileges; specifically : a recognition by one of two countries or institutions of the validity of licenses or privileges granted by the other</li>
</ul>
<p>When I looked in the thesaurus, reciprocity also had a definition of "interchange" with synonyms of cooperation, exchange, mutuality and reciprocation. Reciprocity is also a synonym of connection with a definition of &ldquo;person who aids another in achieving goal&rdquo;. With synonyms being an acquaintance, agent, ally, associate, association, contact, friend, go-between, intermediary, kin, kindred, kinship, mentor, messenger, network, reciprocity, relation, relative, and sponsor.</p>
<p>All of these terms apply to what I was seeing unfold with this new generation of ETL providers. ETL was moving into the clouds, and out from behind the firewall, using the open web, cloud platforms and APIs, and now we have to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">rethink ETL, and make it accessible to the masses</a>--putting it within reach of the everyday problem owners.</p>
<p>After three years, as I've seen this area continue to grow, but the growth in my website traffic to this research was not in alignment with what I saw in other areas. Over time I realized the area had been dubbed integration platform as a service (iPaaS), and while I have resisted using this term for a while, as I was wanting to emphasize the human aspect of this, I am now giving in. Reciprocity was the only term I have ever tried to push on the API community&nbsp;and have to admit it will be the last term or phrase I ever try to brand in this way.</p>
<p>Sadly iPaaS has become the leading acronym to talk about this evolution, and because IT vendors and analysts couldn't give a shit about the users who's information is being moved around, they have defined it simply as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) is a suite of cloud services enabling development, execution and governance of integration </em>flow<em> connecting any combination of on premises and cloud-based processes, services, applications and data within the </em>individual<em> or across multiple organizations.</em></p>
<p>In classic IT fashion, no emphasis has been placed on the humans in this equation. In the early days of web APIs, startups had focused on what the people who were using their solution needed. Then with each wave of VC investment into the space,&nbsp;with enterprise vendors shifting their focus to this new world, and the industry analyst pundits realizing the value that lies in this new era, we are going back to the old ways of thinking about IT--one that rarely ever focuses on the human aspect of the bits and bytes we are shuffling around.</p>
<p>I am losing this same fight in almost every area of the API space that I keep an eye on. I'm not naive to think I can cut through the noise of the space, and truly take on the IT and developer class's obsessive belief in technology, and the blindness that comes from a focus on the money, but I do believe I can at least influence some of the conversations. This is why I'll keep trying to make sure there is reciprocity across the API space, and iPaaS pays attention to the human aspect of integration, migration, and keeping our increasingly online world in sync.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Aug 2016</span>

<p>I have been finding quite a few nuggets of wisdom out of <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2016/08/03/announcing-the-general-availability-of-the-microsoft-excel-api-to-expand-the-power-of-office-365/">the&nbsp;recent release of the Microsoft Excel API</a>. This is what I enjoy doing as the API Evangelist, evaluate and gather any positive or negative activities performed by the leading API players, craft blog posts in hopes that other API providers will read, enabling them be more successful in their own API operations.</p>
<p>As part of my monitoring, I am also looking for significant trends that may reflect other wider industry opportunities, beyond any individual API. I am always telling API providers to think about integrating iPaaS solutions like Zapier into their operations as early as possible, and I think Microsoft's acknowledgment in their release emphasizes the importance of iPaaS.</p>
<p>Here is the language, directly out of Microsoft's release post:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-223825" src="https://blogs.office.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/zapier.png" alt="zapier" width="150" height="68" /><span>Zapier lets users easily automate tedious tasks. Zapier recently announced a new&nbsp;</span><a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/excel/" target="_blank">Excel integration</a><span>, powered by Excel REST API, with near-infinite use cases, like simplifying a data collection process. Users can now build zaps where data is automatically added into Excel from other services, like emails and surveys, making Excel the data repository for all your connected services.</span></p>
<p><span>I am guessing that Microsoft Excel API team did their homework, and saw the number of Google Sheet integrations available on Zapier. When it comes to integration platform as a service, being able to take data, content, and other resources and put it into a spreadsheet, has to be in the top 10 of use case scenarios. Moving the bits and bytes we are creating on the web daily, and making available via the familiar spreadsheet UI, is increasingly how business gets done on the ground at the average organization.</span></p>
<p>I guess there are two nuggets here for my API provider audience: 1) iPaaS, and specifically Zapier integration is growing important 2) Making sure your API is available as Zapier integration with Excel and Google spreadsheets might be something else you will want to consider too!</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.office.com/2016/08/03/announcing-the-general-availability-of-the-microsoft-excel-api-to-expand-the-power-of-office-365/">I am pretty impressed with the casual release of the Microsoft Excel API</a>, which I think is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/10/the-release-of-the-microsoft-excel-api-is-a-pretty-significant-milestone/">a pretty significant milestone for the world of APIs</a>. One of the subtle elements of their API release that I think is worth noting, is the support flow they provide. Here is the actual text from the release blog post for the Excel API:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Give us your feedback on the API and documentation through&nbsp;<a href="http://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/excel" target="_blank">GitHub</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/microsoftgraph" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>, or make new feature suggestions on&nbsp;<a href="http://officespdev.uservoice.com/" target="_blank">UserVoice</a>."</em></p>
<p>This is the most open, and casual I think I've seen Microsoft ever be. They are allowing the community to suggest edits to their API documentation using Github, encouraging the conversation on their own forum, as well as outside their ecosystem, on Stack Overflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know. Maybe I'm reading too much into it. They just seem like they are getting better with each API they have released, and the Excel API release was much more casual, natural, and less rigid than I'm used to from Microsoft.</p>
<p>I can't speak to the technical design of each endpoint yet, as I haven't played with enough, but the overall experience of <a href="https://dev.office.com/">the Microsoft Office Dev Center</a> is surprisingly modern, simple, and intuitive. There are still a lot of places where it feels like a knowledgebase&nbsp;and not an API community, but overall it exceeds what I'm used to from Microsoft when it comes to APIs.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I didn't hold out much hope for Microsoft when it came to catching up on cloud and APIs--something that is changing with each API they release.</p>

<p>I regularly come across organizations who have blogs without RSS feeds. Sometimes I will drop people a line and ask if they have one, or let them know it would be very useful to have an RSS feed easy to find. This is also a topic I write about regularly to help remind folks that RSS is&nbsp;not dead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost every time I write about the topic I get a handful of people who tell me you don't need RSS anymore, you just tweet out your blog posts--nobody uses RSS readers after Google Reader went away. While it might be true that some folks have abandoned their feed readers, I think they were casual readers in the first place, and serious analysts still very much depend on RSS.</p>
<p>I wish I could help folks understand the power they are giving away to Twitter by thinking like this. I am happy to share a piece of my digital self with Twitter, but as with all platforms I use, I will be considering at every turn the benefit or damage to my own brand. RSS from your blog, at your domain, strengthens your brand and puts you in control of the syndication.</p>
<p>You can still use services like Zapier to take each new RSS entry and automatically Tweet out--you don't have to relinquish control of distribution to Twitter. This is the dangers of these platforms, every platform wants you to spend as much time generating content and media on their platform. This is how they make money, off your activity and hard work--please don't give it up for free, or at the cost of your own brand.</p>
<p>If you are a professional, and expect to make a living from your business, products, services, and brand--you need to maximize the control, licensing, and distribution of your content--give up only what you need. There is no reason to make a deal with Twitter that exclusively gives them full control over your syndication.&nbsp;RSS and API should always be your primary content distribution channel, and Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and others should follow after that.</p>

<p>I've heard of numerous API providers shutting down their API programs after a couple months because they didn't see the number of new users, and integrations they had hoped for. It is so easy for us technologists to shoot for the moon, while also simultaneously shooting ourselves in the foot&nbsp;when it comes to defining where the bar should be for our operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, we are not all Twilio. For most of us our API will never be our primary product, and operating it will be less than a glorious affair--meaning you will never be written up in Techcrunch ;-). We are entering into the really mundane, business as usual phase of the API industry, and things will not be as exciting or sexy as they have been, and we need to make sure our APIs stay real, and reliable amidst all of the tech delusions we have on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if your API is not the next amazing tech sensation, it doesn't mean you can't operate following the lead of the giants like Twilio, Amazon, and Google. You can run a first class shop, even if you don't make the front page of Reddit for the launch, and get all the hacker kids building amazingly cool stuff in the first weeks. To do this you need to set some realistic goals for operations, that aren't based on the often fantasy world of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>It is likely your company's website wasn't a major hit when it first launched either, and you didn't ditch it because it was underperforming. I'm guessing your goals were probably a little more realistic, and in alignment with your primary business objectives. Your API is no different than your web efforts, it will take time to do it properly, and probably require a few adjustments along the way--do not give up before you have a chance to find success.</p>

<p>At any point in time, there are numerous emails in my inbox, LinkedIn messages, and DMS, asking me if I would "just jump on the phone to discuss the latest" about an API. I get a regular stream of these, which makes it pretty impossible for me to actually make time to do, and if I did make time to talk to each of these API providers, I wouldn't have time to actually write up stories and guides for my site.</p>
<p>I'm sure it can be frustrating for folks who just want to share the latest with me, but I hope you will understand that I am just a one man show, and I have to prioritize. I recommend that you also get better at managing your time, and write up each of the things you wanted to talk to me about as a blog post, and then share out via your API platform's Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook (you have all those right?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not a fan of being the recipient of embargoed or top-secret information, as EVERYTHING I do tends to be very public. If you publish your&nbsp;information&nbsp;as a blog post, it is much more likely that I will see it, and read it, than I will if it is an email. Plus you get the bonus of me being able to share out the link, and the wider API community getting to learn about it as well. It is just way more efficient for you to tell your story publicly&nbsp;than it is for us to jump on the phone--for both of us.</p>
<p>Handling yourself this way will continue to pay dividends, as the chances, I will write about something in the future increases if I have the link bookmarked--something that will rarely happen if we talk about on the phone. This played out in my story on the role API definitions are playing with API integrations, where I linked to&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.clearbit.com/introducing-the-run-in-postman-button/">Clearbit</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cronofy.com/blog/how-adding-the-run-in-postman-button-changed-our-api/">Cronofy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/best-buy-developers/building-api-lists-with-the-run-in-postman-button-53c8a22c1d9c#.r0amcganq">Best Buy</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/how-to-run-sparkpost-postman/#.V7NDpJMrKuU">SparkPost</a>&nbsp;stories on their release of Run in Post Buttons. If they didn't tell the story on their blog, I would never have had a link to share in that story, and now this story--bonus two separate posts on API Evangelist, just because they had the forethought to tell the story of what they did.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.opto22.com/static/generated/pac-rest-api/swagger-ui/index.html#/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/pcbased_io_320x224.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was learning more about <a href="http://developer.opto22.com/static/generated/pac-rest-api/swagger-ui/index.html#/">the Programmable Automation Controller (PAC) API</a> from <a href="http://www.opto22.com/">Opto 22</a> and fouind myself intrigued by their usage of the word strategy to describe the role a web API can play when it comes to making the industrial automation process more programmable. I'd say the over API design is still very rough and represents the engineer's view of a PAC, but the potential for industrial IoT strategy orchestration is still present.</p>
<p>I'm learning about PAC APIs through the lens of my drone API research, where the role an API can play in the devices strategy creation, as well as execution. Meaning, with a drone, I can use the API to get at the data from one or many drone flights, as well as use the data, then the API again, to help me execute on the strategy. When this line of thought is applied in an industrial setting, the potential for an API driven strategy increases pretty dramatically.</p>
<p>A PAC API takes this strategy concept further down the road for me than it did with the drone alone. Each PAC can have its own DNS, and its own API, and the overall&nbsp;industrial process I am building a strategy for might contain many different PACS--allowing me to orchestrate in&nbsp;an unlimited number of industrial scenarios. I guess the API surface area for a PAC-enabled industrial workflow expands, contracts, and communicates very differently than it has for a single drone or even a drone fleet. I will have to take what I've learned from PACs and apply to drones.</p>
<p>This is the part of my API Evangelist existence I enjoy the most--the cross-pollination between the different sectors I am learning about.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As the debate over <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png">whether you need an SDK for your API or not</a>&nbsp;has rumbled over the last couple of years, API specification formats like OpenAPI Spec, Postman, and API Blueprint have been gaining traction. As this has progressed, I've asked myself several times whether or not API providers even need SDKs anymore. Not just because of the complexities of developing and maintaining, but because more developers are using web clients like Postman and DHC to evolve their integrations.</p>
<p>Apigee Explorer and Swagger UI documentation demonstrated that many developers needed to play with an API as they were learning about what resources were available, and how to use them. I think the evolution of API clients like Postman, DHC, PAW, and others have shown that this phase of playing, exploration, and non-code integration can go well beyond just integration&nbsp;and should actually be neverending across stops along the API life cycle.</p>
<p>It is just anecdotal at the moment, but looking at the API providers who have embedded the Get Postman Button on their sites like <a href="http://blog.clearbit.com/introducing-the-run-in-postman-button/">Clearbit</a>, <a href="https://www.cronofy.com/blog/how-adding-the-run-in-postman-button-changed-our-api/">Cronofy</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/best-buy-developers/building-api-lists-with-the-run-in-postman-button-53c8a22c1d9c#.r0amcganq">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/how-to-run-sparkpost-postman/#.V7NDpJMrKuU">SparkPost</a>, it seems to me that having your API definition available for your developers is growing more important than having SDKs. Developers are getting more traction by loading the Postman Collection, and other common specification format into their client, testing, and other tooling, than they are cracking open the language library of their choice.</p>
<p>This is something I'll further validate through my research. One critique I have on this, is I'm seeing the benefits of this approach focus around Postman, which I'm a big fan of, and a user, but represents just a handful of stops along the API life cycle (client, testing), and not the wider spectrum that OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint would offer. I have yet to see any of these formats <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/19/button-to-run-this-api-in-the-http-api-client-of-my-choice/">follow my advice like Postman </a><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/19/button-to-run-this-api-in-the-http-api-client-of-my-choice/">did</a>&nbsp;and get to work on an embeddable solution for OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint--giving Postman a significant headstart.</p>
<p>API providers need to be openly sharing their API definitions, API service providers need to be allowing for the run in, and import using the common API specification formats, and developers need to be fluent in these formats and functionality, as they will play an important role in the evolution of the space--one that I think will be more significant than the role SDKs have played, after this plays out.</p>

<p>When you hear about the Internet of Things (IoT) you often hear about the hopeful consumer side of thing, like with Nest thermostat, and the next wave of Internet-connected devices that will change our personal worlds forever. Personally, when I think about the concept of Internet-connected devices actually seeing adoption, and getting traction, I think of it being applied in an industrial setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://info.opto22.com/snap-pac-rest-api-thank-you">The RESTful&nbsp;programmable automation controllers (PACs) APIs out of Opto 22 resemble this vision of IoT which I have in my head</a>. APIs making everyday objects used in a variety of industrial processes, programmable, and accessible over wired or wireless networks. Making everything from manufacturing&nbsp;to water and energy facilities more automated and efficient, while potentially generated data that can be used to monitor, and optimize these industrial workflows--this is IoT.</p>
<p>The dream of home automation just doesn't do it for me. I just don't buy the Jetsons vision of the home, but I can buy into the potential for IoT making the industrial processes which we depend on to make our world operate more efficient. Consumer IoT seems like a bandwagon to me, but proven industrial equipment manufacturers like <a href="http://info.opto22.com/snap-pac-rest-api-thank-you">Opto 22 realizing the potential of web API infrastructure</a>, and baking it into the devices they manufacture, seems like real world IoT business to me.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of the concept of <a href="http://serverless.apievangelist.com">serverless</a> APIs and <a href="http://microservices.apievangelist.com">microservices</a>, but not so much of the name. I get it, the space needs new concepts to rally around, and I'm the first to admit even the concept of an API is bullshit, but when people say serverless, it always makes me chuckle--especially when people work so hard to sell it (who am I to make fun of that).</p>
<p>Often when I come across a serverless solution, it is often bundled with the phrase "100% serverless", a description which usually then contains the 2-6 vendor solutions used to deploy said serverless solution. I know there is no use in pointing out there are always servers behind serverless solutions, but can I at least point out the vendor dependencies involved? Are the vendor dependencies better or worse than our dependencies on servers (that never went away)? IDK. WTF. BBQ.</p>
<p>In support&nbsp;of this&nbsp;line of thinking, I want to start promoting the concept of vendorless&nbsp;APIs and microservices. You know the ones that employ web, and open source technology?

<p>Being able to provide different levels of access for a single API has been one of the telltale characteristics of any modern web API. Savvy API providers know they don't just make their valuable API resources publicly available for anyone to use, they know you can craft a logical set of plans that are in alignment with your wider business objectives, outlining how any developer can put an API to use--this is the essential&nbsp;business of APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/10/history-of-apis-mashery/">Mashery was the first API management provider to standardize this approach to API access</a>, something further evolved by 3Scale, Apigee, and others. Amazon's release of their API gateway wove API management into the fabric of what we call the cloud, and the introduction of usage plans, does the same for API service composition. Making the identification, metering, limiting, and monetization of resources made available via APIs, a default function of operations in the cloud.</p>
<p>Being able to take any digital asset, whether it is data, content, or an algorithmic resource, and make available via a URL, and control who has access, while also metering their usage, and charging different rates for this usage, is where the business of APIs rubber meets the road. API service composition lets you dial in exactly the right levels of access, and usage, required to fulfill a business contract, delivering precisely the service that customers are wanting for their&nbsp;web, mobile, and device apps.</p>
<p>It's taken a decade for this key element of doing business on the web to mature beyond just a handful of vendors, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">then into an assortment of open source solutions</a>, and now something that is just baked into what we know as the cloud--allowing us to plan API access consistently and universally across all the digital resources we are increasingly storing and operating in the cloud.</p>

<p>I was going through the getting started pages for the APIs that I keep an eye on, pulling together an outline of what I'd consider to be some of the best elements across all the API providers.

<p>Constant Contact's approach to their getting started page has given me a good start for my outline, including essential links to setup your account, create a new application and get your keys. Constant Contact also provides required documentation, an API tester, and supporting code libraries. Additionally, they encourage you to certify your integration as a partner and get published in their integration marketplace--providing a pretty well thought out getting started page in my opinion.</p>
<p>I am going to take what I've learned here, and craft a sample getting started page for my minimum viable API portal definition. I'm sure some of you are snickering at me paying attention to API operations at this level of detail, but I wouldn't underestimate the ability of a well crafted API getting started page to reduce friction with developers. I want to give API providers with a simple template they can follow when publishing a getting started page.</p>
<p>With the next release of my API portal, I'll have a good example of a getting started page, which will be heavily influenced by <a href="http://developer.constantcontact.com/">Constant Contac</a>t.</p>

<p>I am all about marking down the important milestones that help define the API sector. It is what I've been working to define as my <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of the web APIs</a>&nbsp;for the last six years. An API has to make its mark in pretty big way before I'll add as an official milestone in my version of the last 17 years of the web APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll give it some time, but I'm thinking the recently released <a href="https://dev.office.com/excel/rest">Excel API from Microsoft</a> is going to get added pretty quickly. I think the next five years of API evolution is going to be much less exciting than the previous five years, with numerous small businesses publishing their valuable data, content, and <a href="https://xkcd.com/1667/">complex algorithms</a> via the Excel API.</p>
<p>This stage of API deployment won't be filled with API heroes like Amazon, and Twilio, but will still make a seismic shift in the landscape just through the pure volume of data that is made available--we won't be able to keep up. I don't think all the DB to API connectors collectively add up to the number of spreadsheet-driven data, content, algorithmic, and visualizations that will be driving business decisions out there in the future.</p>
<p>I am not a diehard fan of the spreadsheet, as I'm a database guy, but in my 25+ year career, there is no single more important business tool out there than the spreadsheet. <a href="https://dev.office.com/excel/rest">Giving Excel native API capabilities by default</a> will dramatically increase the number of high-value APIs available. It will be something that I cannot ignore, and will have to do some playing around with the API, to see what is possible.</p>

<p>The messaging platform&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/launch-platform-114754258b91#.kd3av5fl2">Slack made waves when they launched</a> their <a href="https://slack.com/developers/fund">Slack Fund</a> as part of their API release, putting up $80M to invest in developers who were interested in building cool things on the API. <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/investing-in-the-future-of-work-d4ffb87f985#.qhvdsad0h">Slack has continued telling their story</a>, talking about how they have invested some of the fund and are being pretty transparent about which API integrations made the cut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading about the Slack Fund I wanted to see which other APIs were investing in their communities like this. Next, I came across the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-fund">Alexa Fund where Amazon is investing in developers building voice-enabled apps</a>, giving their Echo platform the boost of applications it will need to find success. After poking around the AWS platform, you also find they have also had their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/grants/">AWS Grants program</a>, investing in the best of breed projects that use the AWS platform to give back to the world.</p>
<p>I came across a number of other fund announcements about available funds, only to find the pages gone, but MailChimp had an interesting accounting of their fund which they started in November of 2010, pledging $1M to "provide developers with funding assistance to build integrations on our email platform". I also found <a href="https://developer.ciscospark.com/fund/- https://developer.ciscospark.com/fund/">another fund developer fund out of Cisco</a>, to encourage development with&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.ciscospark.com/">Cisco Spark</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tropo.com/">Tropo</a>, and the other APIs they provide at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/">Cisco DevNet</a>, that was noteworthy.</p>
<p>There are not enough examples of API investment funds out there for me to add the concepts as what I'd consider being a common API building block, but there are enough out there, especially from leading pioneers, to keep me paying attention. API developer funds don't seem like something you have to go as big as AWS or Slack did, but it seems to me, if you provide a small fund like MailChimp did, it could incentivize development significantly--at least make your launch be fewer crickets.</p>

<p>I am always looking for simple advice I can give to API providers to make their developers and would-be developers integration as friction-less as possible. When it comes to making the code available for your API I recommend providing a wealth of samples, libraries, and full blown SDKs for your developers. Also make sure these code resources are as easy to find within your developer portal, as well as being openly licensed and available on your API platform's Github profile.</p>
<p>Adding to this advice I would also recommend that you take the top 10 programming languages and platforms out there, and perform a quick Google search for the key phrase, and see what comes up, on a regular basis. I tend to find interesting conversations around an API when I do this. Inversely it can also provide some interesting signals that an API isn't very active within specific communities, and there probably isn't much existing support.</p>
<p>For me, searching for API [name] + [programming language] or [platform name] = some interesting reflections of activity around an API. I can also imagine that this would provide a way for API providers to learn where the gaps in their outreach are, and give them another way to reach their developers or potential developers--demonstrating that SEO plays a significant&nbsp;role in successful API operations.</p>

<p>I am still learning about the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sirikit/">recent API release out of Apple</a>, and working to keep up with <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">the volume of resources coming out of the Amazon Alexa ecosystem</a>, but one thing I know for sure is Amazon is way ahead of the game, and Apple will have to invest a lot more resources if they expect to catch up. Apple may have the device advantage, but Amazon is leaps and bounds ahead when it comes to how you develop a community in support of voice-driven applications.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's release was in response to the waves Amazon is making with their voice platform. When it comes to the platform battles between tech giants, they can throw the necessary resources at things to play catch up, but it is something that other smaller players will not be able to always navigate. I'm reviewing a number of device-focused API efforts lately, and the ones who launched with an API are always ahead in the game.</p>
<p>Learning to do APIs well takes time, and learning to grow your API community of developers and partners will always take time to do properly--you just can't throw resources at it to make things scale properly. You might as well kick things off with an API and platform approach, even if it is in beta, and limited--at least you are getting going in a limited environment. Siri has been out there for a while now, but not as a platform, and I'm going to wager this will be a significant handicap.</p>
<p>What is your approach to technology? Is it more like Siri, or is it more like Alexa?</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-safety.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/darpa-cgc-safety-protocol">a post from the Electronic Frontier Foundation asking some great questions about having a safety protocol for things like the DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge</a>. It is good to see EFF leading this conversation, providing us with some important things to consider as part of any security related work, whether it's in the cyber theater&nbsp;or just guiding your ethics as a small business, analyst or freelance hacker (I happen to be all three).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To hopefully contribute somewhat to the conversation, I wanted to think through some of the questions I ask when defining and helping folks secure their slice of the API landscape. There are two distinct portions of the conversation I wanted to chime in on, speaking to the areas that I find the most friction with when mapping out, and securing infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>The Dangers Of Being An API Cartographer In The Shadows Behind Mobile And Internet of Things</strong><br />Only a small fraction of web APIs available today are intentionally open to the public. The majority of web APIs out there are developed to support web, mobile, or device-based apps, delivering resources on the open Internet, but not meant to be viewed, accessed, and documented by 3rd parties.</p>
<p>API developers and architects heavily focused on the end deliverable, the web, mobile, system, or device integration, they do not consider the API to be open to the public--thus perceived as a private API, even though it uses public infrastructure. Many people frown on even mapping out this shadow API world, let along making and API definition or documentation publicly available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I can publicly get access to a website, application, or device, I can map out the APIs, simply by routing traffic on my computer through a proxy. Before we can ensure this portion of our public infrastructure is secure, we must map it out, and we must change popular opinion to view this infrastructure as public, and begin securing it like it is, sharing maps of the infrastructure, and having an "open" conversation about it--not creating friction for those who do.</p>
<p><strong>A Fine Line Between Scanning For API Vulnerabilities And Executing a DDoS Attack On A Domain</strong><br />Once I have a map of the landscape, &nbsp;I can begin looking for vulnerabilities. Establishing the map (<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition</a>) is a grey zone for me, but actually scanning that map looking for even the most common of vulnerabilities is black, and a no-go zone for me. Before I can scan any domain used as part of API infrastructure, I will need the approval of the domain owner. Even a low-level security scan for the most common vulnerabilities will come across as a potential DDoS attack--requiring deeper considerations before doing it.</p>
<p>Much like the EFF sis looking to encourage a conversation around a safety protocol for cyber challenge related activity, I'd like to encourage a conversation about mapping and scanning of publicly available API infrastructure. I'd like to discuss the importance of having public maps be available, much like we do with physical infrastructure, both public and private. Then I'd like to also talk about how we can collectively ensure this infrastructure is secured properly, and have a sensible conversation about this, on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not suggesting anything wild here. I do not get in trouble for driving by our local hospital, my child's school, or the local water plant. I shouldn't get in trouble for reporting a hole in the fence, or suspicious activity that I see when I drive or walk by either. I should also be able to be reassured that the hospital, school, and local water utility have a solid security plan, and have my best interest in mind when it comes to my healthcare data, student information, and water usage and billing information. Why is the virtual space so different?</p>
<p>I am just putting this out there, as I do. I walk this ethical line on a daily basis as I monitor the API space, and wanted to make my stance known. &nbsp;I am going to keep mapping out the known API universe, I feel comfortable pushing the boundaries of this grey zone. I will also be scanning, and helping secure API infrastructure using my <a href="https://sapience.io/">API security service Sapience</a>, but of course only when a customer asks me to. ;-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">in mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform a calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks</a>. These often very abstract inventions are increasingly guiding our personal and professional worlds from <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/cover_story/2016/01/how_facebook_s_news_feed_algorithm_works.html">deciding what we read on Facebook</a>, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2016/05/12/twitter-periscope-real-time-video-scannning/">scanning the videos uploaded to your Twitter and Vine feed</a>, to whether or not <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">you might commit a crime again</a>, and even <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-now-have-algorithms-to-predict-police-misconduct/">predict potential police misconduct</a>.</p>
<p>I see the concept of an algorithm applied in many different ways, some are very simple and easy to understand, and some are not so easy to understand, and operate as black boxes. One of the reasons I like APIs so much is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">the possibility of introducing some transparency into how algorithms work</a> (or don't). APIs do not give visibility into the inner workings of algorithms by default, but when they are done right they can significantly contribute to a&nbsp;wider understanding of how they work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with <a href="http://apievangelist.com">other areas of the API space that I research</a>, I'm intrigued with algorithms, how they are being used, and the role APIs can play in the wider conversation. <a href="http://algorithms.apievangelist.com/">I added an APIs and algorithms research project</a>, to help be understand how algorithms are being wielded, the news, companies, and code and schemas which are framing the conversation. The information I aggregate here will fuel my overall perspective of <a href="http://algorithms.apievangelist.com/">the intersection of API and algorithms</a>, and maybe yours too.</p>

<p>When I talk about how much I believe in APIs, all I am really saying is how much I believe in the web. The web is how humans are consuming and sharing data, content, and algorithms with each other using the Internet, and APIs are how systems, applications, and devices are doing this via the Internet.</p>
<p>I do not advocate for any single API, company, tooling, or technology. I am evangelizing for an open web. This is why I am always a little ashamed at how incomplete my understanding is of the core concepts that make up the web&nbsp;and the specifications that are driving it. Thankfully there are people like&nbsp;Erik Wilde (<a href="https://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>) who work tirelessly to help us understand them, and make available in a simple way&nbsp;like he did <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">with his Web Concepts project</a>.</p>
<p>Erik has <a href="http://webconcepts.info/concepts/">organized&nbsp;13 Web Concepts for use to learn about</a>, detailing&nbsp;<span>445 distinct specifications across the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/ISO">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/JCP">Java Community Process (JCP)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/W3C">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>. There are a number of these specifications I'm already aware of, but there are numerous others I am not, and that just isn't right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help me increase my awareness and hopefully yours as well, I'm going to regularly tweet out individual concepts, and their specifications, linking to Erik's work. I encourage you to bookmark his work and get to work improving your web literacy where possible, and consider <a href="https://github.com/dret/webconcepts">forking his work and sharing within your organization</a> as well. It is important that we are all aware of these core building blocks of the web, and are reusing existing concepts and specifications across our work, wherever possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/05/airmap-is-positioning-itself-to-be-a-critical-api-broker-for-the-drone-industry/">I wrote a story last week about how Airmap is positioning itself to be an API broker within the fast growing Drone industry</a>. I also stumbled across <a href="https://www.astrodigital.com/api/">the satellite imagery API out of Astro Digital</a>, and specifically their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.astrodigital.com/api/">3rd Party Real-Time Data API</a>&nbsp;which is designed "to combine mass amounts of data, like adding live weather data on top of imagery"--resembling the layer of the drone industry which Airmap is investing in.</p>
<p>Airmap&nbsp;is delivering geo-intelligence for applications used when flying drones, Astro Digital has an API which injects geo-intelligence at the satellite image layer--I guess the satellite layer would be one layer up from the drone layer when it comes to APIs providing access to our physical world. Which leaves me considering all the other potential layers of our physical world being opened up using APIs.</p>
<p>Security cameras, sensors, and other Internet-connected devices are rapidly opening up our physical world using APIs. The API solutions being opened up by Airmap and Astro Digital are allowing us to access, inject, remix, and make decisions in real time. I find this intriguing because there are so many dimensions present beyond just a single resource being made available via an API, and allows for true multi-API integration, while also employing APIs to direct physical activity like drone flights.</p>
<p>Beyond the myriad of API implementations that are available within this new landscape, I feel it is also is something that demonstrates the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/03/31/weather-means-business/">opportunity surrounding weather data</a>, government open data (<a href="http://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.html">FAA situation data</a>), and other relevant data, content, media, and algorithms being opened up today. I find it endlessly fascinating to try and&nbsp;keep up with the different ways that API-driven resources are being used to open up and generate revenue, taking advantage of opportunities that are emerging as this new API landscape expands both digitally and physically.</p>

This was when web APIs went from the hobby level (ie. photos, social, links) workbench, and became a tool I could actually use in my business toolbox. Web APIs weren't just used or fun and games anymore, opening up my eyes to the endless possibilities when you make the web programmable using APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, I see a number of APIs show up on my monitoring radar, and honestly, most of them are not that notable--then you come across the solutions like the dead simple <a href="https://www.astrodigital.com/api/">satellite imagery API from Astro Digital</a>. I'm increasingly finding myself tracking on the collision APIs are having with our physical world, so I see a lot of interesting (and some not so) APIs, but I find the notion that you can get the latest picture of a specific place on earth is a pretty significant milestone for web APIs.</p>
<p>For me the Astro Digital satellite imagery API demonstrates for me the power of the&nbsp;Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)--I can get a snapshot of any location on earth, and manipulate my view of it using a single URI, from within any web or mobile application. This is just one of many APIs available to the average developer today, providing access to a wealth of high-value resources, that used to only be accessible to larger companies who could afford it.</p>
<p>I just wanted to pause for a moment, and take notice of some of the important resources that are being made available via APIs today, because I feel like the landscape is shifting pretty quickly with the introduction of these valuable resources. When companies small companies can work with the same resources as large enterprises and institutions, interesting things are possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-broken.png" alt="" width="32%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have done a lot of reading in the last week, catching up on my monitoring of the API space. I have read a couple of posts about the reliability of APIs, and the overall viability of building applications, and businesses based upon them. A couple of the posts were focusing on <a href="https://medium.com/@anildash/the-end-of-thinkup-e600bc46cc56#.9dhazj3vf">the shuttering of ThinkUp</a>, but a couple others were just part of the regular flow of these stories that question whether we can depend on APIs or not--nothing new, as this is a regular staple of bloggers and the wider tech blogosphere.</p>
<p>My official stance on this line of thinking is that I would not want to be building a business, and application that depends on leading API platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others, but I will happily build a business, applications, and system integration on APIs. You see, this isn't an API issue, it is a business and vendor viability issue. As with other sectors, there are badly behaved business, and there are well-behaved businesses--I try to choose to do business with the well-behaved one's (can't always achieve this, but I try).</p>
<p>I find the ongoing desire of the startup culture to point out how unreliable APIs are, while simultaneously&nbsp;supporting the overall business tone set by venture capital investment, often delusionally blind levels of support, is just not reconcilable. I'm not saying all VC investment is bad, so don't even take this down that road. I am saying that the quest for VC investment, and the shift in priorities once VC investment is acquired, then further shift with each additional round, and the final exit is setting a tone that is completely at odds with API reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem really begins when APIs become the front-end for this blame. If I depend on vendors for my brick and mortar store, and the delivery trucks don't reliably bring my products, I don't talk about how you can't depend on trucks--I find new vendors. Of course, I can't find new vendors if they can't be replaced like Twitter and Facebook, but this is a whole other conversation, although it is also one that is a symptom of the tone being set by the VC currents (this is a business conversation). Blaming APIs instead of raising questions about the business ethics bar being set by venture capital shows the blinding power of greed, as the tech community refuses to blame VC $$, and shifts this to being about the viability of APIs, because I will get my VC $$ some day too bro!</p>
<p>I am not saying APIs are always good. I'm just saying they aren't bad. Hell, they aren't neutral. They are a simply a reflection of the business behind them, as well as being a reflection of the industry they operate in. Stop blaming them for businesses not giving a shit about developers, and the end-users. Maybe we could start changing the tone by admitting the #1 priority is always set by VC $$, and not by our API community, or even our end-users and customers, and all this shit is out of whack.</p>

<p>I've seen quite a few&nbsp;incomplete&nbsp;API efforts in my time as the API Evangelist. It is why I aggregate the most common building blocks I see across successful API providers like Twilio and organize them into blueprints anyone can follow like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/my-minimum-viable-api-footprint-definition/">my minimum viable API footprint definition</a>. It doesn't take much effort to pull together a basic API presence like this&nbsp;and is something that can go a long ways to help onboard new API consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of interesting APIs out there like <a href="https://dl.ubnt.com/aircontrol/aircontrol-api-alpha.pdf">the AirControl API</a>, which gives you <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/products/">programmatic access to enterprise-grade wifi and wireless network solutions from Ubiquiti Networks</a>, but then quickly reduces a pretty robust API effort to being just a PDF document. I still keep an eye on these APIs like this because they offer value, and give a look at how ubiquitous web APIs are becoming. It also demonstrates how much more work I have ahead of me when it comes to educating the coming wave of device API providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing this demonstrates for me&nbsp;is that this wave of Internet-connected device APIs will also suffer from many of the same illnesses that API providers have had when deploying APIs for mobile applications. These APIs are often hastily designed and deployed, where documentation, authentication, and security are often an&nbsp;afterthought or not even a thought at all.</p>
<p>I am working on reworking some of my forkable Github templates for deploying API portals. I am going to c<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/my-minimum-viable-api-footprint-definition/">reate a minium viable API portal solution</a> that can be easily&nbsp;forked, helping API providers quickly launch a more coherent presence&nbsp;without much effort. I'm going to also create a complete API portal solution that takes into consideration <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/07/i-have-an-api-now-i-need-some-help-to-identify-what-is-needed-to-manage-my-api-presence/">the complete list of building blocks for an API presence</a> that I've gathered from across the API landscape.</p>

<p>As the number of available <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> out there grows, I am increasingly coming across variations of APIs that I already have included in my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>. It can be tedious to try and sync these with existing copies, so I wanted to take a look and see if there was anything already available out there, that would help provide a diff for either OpenAPI Spec, RAML, or API Blueprint.</p>
<p>The most common one I found referenced was <a href="https://github.com/civisanalytics/swagger-diff">a Ruby one for OpenAPI Spe</a>c from&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/civisanalytics">Civis Analytics</a>. Next, I found a pretty <a href="https://zallek.github.io/swagger-diff/">interesting web tool</a>, which provides its <a href="https://github.com/zallek/swagger-diff/">Node.js source code on Github</a>, including a CLI edition. After these two solutions, I only found <a href="https://github.com/myexpr/raml-diff">one more for RAML</a>, but couldn't find anything for API Blueprint.</p>
<p>I wanted to think beyond just the common API definition formats&nbsp;and look for diff tools that would work just for JSON. I found <a href="https://github.com/andreyvit/json-diff">Diff</a> which was pretty interesting, as well as <a href="https://github.com/janmonschke/diffsync">DiffSync</a> which provided a real-time&nbsp;diff for JSON. I haven't tried any of them out, I am just trying to compile a list of what is out there&nbsp;before I dive into what their capabilities are.</p>
<p>I have a master database of API definitions where I can just import API definitions that I find, and it will add any new paths, parameters, and schemas it comes across. I would much rather have the ability to just run each version through a diff tool, and be able to select which elements I want to have merged. For now, I will just implement a custom layer to my API monitoring system, but I would like to see API diff move forward similar to we saw the conversation evolve with the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>.</p>

<p>I first came across Airmap as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/02/direct-government-connection-into-internet-of-things-devices-like-we-are-seeing-with-drones/">I was learning about them acting as the middle man for DJI drone updates via the Department of Interior</a>. After this story, I added them to my database of companies that I track on. Then as I was monitoring my feeds I saw <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFWN1AK0VL?type=companyNews">they were now working with IBM to get weather information</a> for use by drone manufacturers, operators, and those impacted by drone activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.airmap.com/">Airmap</a>&nbsp;positions themselves as "airspace Intelligence", offering low-altitude airspace management solution for unmanned aircraft. When you consider the drone as just one of many devices being connected to the Internet, the role intelligence providers like Airmap will play when it comes to system to system integrations, and web or mobile application development in each space--the company seems to be well-positioned for success in the drone industry.</p>
<p>Airmap is working hard to define the physical space, the constants, as well as some of the most ephemeral layers of our physical world like weather, forest fires, and events that are increasingly impacting our online reality via the web and our mobile phones. Airmap is aggregating valuable data, like the <a href="http://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.html">updates they get from the Department of Interior (open data)</a> to the partner data like they will be ingesting like the weather data from IBM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Airmap provides access to their&nbsp;<a href="https://sdk.airmap.io/">flight conditions and other airspace data from Airspace via API(s)</a>, and has established&nbsp;some pretty significant manufacturer relationships, as well as open and partner data sources--providing the beginnings of a pretty interesting Internet of things business blueprint for what I'd consider to be a sort of API broker. When you consider the influence some of these API brokers have in the&nbsp;governance of airspace around nuclear power plants or even the Olympics, and govern an assortment of&nbsp;Internet-connected devices--the API opportunity appears to be pretty interesting.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.bbb.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bbb.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was happy to stumble across the <a href="https://developer.bbb.org">Better Business Bureau API</a> the other day. I was working on a piece about "the API economy", and looking for real world examples of how APIs could actually contribute positively (or negatively) to the actual economy, and found the useful API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Better Business Bureau&nbsp;provides five API endpoints for consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/organization-search/">Organization Search</a></strong> - This endpoint will allow you to search for Organizations that are known to the BBB. &nbsp;Organizations may include businesses or charities.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/organization-collections/">Organization Collections</a> -</strong> BBB Partners will need to be able to identify collections of Organizations that they care about and be able to manage those collections and receive Organization info and updates on them as needed.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/bulk-retrieval/">Bulk Retrieval</a> -</strong> This section defines the message specification that will be sent back to the API partners who request a bulk data transfer. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/push-notifications/">Push Notifications</a> - </strong>BBB Partners have the need to be notified when BBB data updates occur for the records or a collection of records they are currently subscribed to.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/bbb-investigation-application-for-accreditation/">BBB Investigation/Application for Accreditation</a></strong> - This endpoint allows submission of organizations for BBB investigation and application for BBB accreditation.</li>
</ul>
<p>They provide&nbsp;a pretty valuable service, which is significantly amplified when there is an API present. Being able to find out which companies are accredited or have complaints against them in real time has endless potential for impacting real world decisions that may influence the economy one way or the other. Being able to automate this process for a digital age, convinced me that this should be in the list of APIs that reflect my thoughts on the wider API economy.</p>
<p>I will be including the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.bbb.org">Better Business Bureau API</a>&nbsp;in my overall API ranking research, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">which is something I've explored in the past</a>, but will be spending some more time thinking in the&nbsp;context of the API economy. I will also profile the BBB API, to contribute to the design patterns I will be considering when it comes to designing business and API ranking, investigation, and accreditation&nbsp;resources.</p>

<p>I was reading some of the blog posts, Reddit&nbsp;and Hacker News threads about <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines">Microsoft's release of their API design guid</a>e. While many of the comments are technically correct, the tone in which they are delivered, and the intent behind their delivery is one of the biggest contributing factors to why we have such wild inconsistencies in API design across the landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>API Evangelist was born in 2010 out of frustration with the Restafarian pundit class. I made it my mission to help tell stories of the technical, business, and politics of APIs in an inclusive way, that didn't make people feel stupid for what they didn't understand. Even after six years of doing this, I am still learning things about APIs and being regularly reminded that there are few absolutes when it comes API design, definition, deployment, management, or any of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the other 50+ stops along the API life cycle that I track on</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stopped sharing my blog posts to Hacker News, Reddit, and DZone (reversed after they invested in change) because of hostile responses to my thoughts. I cannot imagine what it is like to work hard on your API design strategy at a company, then share publicly, only to get flamed because it wasn't REST compliant. Many folks will never even attempt this for fear of being flamed, and those that do, will often never make the mistake twice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the opposite of what we want. We want EVERYONE organizing, publishing, and sharing their API design patterns so that we can all learn from each other. We don't want to make people feel stupid for what they do not know. We want to encourage everyone to learn, grow, evolve, and build on each other's design patterns and work from across the API sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's work to encourage more companies to craft, publish, and share their API design patterns. Let's please stop REST shaming folks, it didn't work in 2010, and it doesn't work in 2016. Making people feel dumb will never get us to a place where API developers and architects are truly HTTP&nbsp;literate, and well informed of existing patterns, let alone actually putting them to work across their organizations.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithmic-transparency-2.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I saw the potential for collaboration when it came to using web APIs back around 2004 and 2005. I was seeing innovative companies opening up their digital assets to the world using low-cost, efficient Internet technology like HTTP, opening things up for potentially interesting approaches to collaboration around the development of web and mobile applications on top of valuable digital resources. This approach has brought us valuable platforms like Amazon Web Services and SalesForce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Common API discussions tend to focus on providing APIs to an ecosystem of developers&nbsp;and encouraging the development of&nbsp;web and mobile applications, widgets, visualizations, and other integrations that benefit the platform. In the course of these operations, it is also customary to gather feedback from the community&nbsp;and work to evolve the APIs design, available resources, and even the underlying data model--extending collaboration to also be about the APIs, and underlying resources, in addition to just building things on top of the API.</p>
<p>This approach to designing, defining, and deploying APIs, and then also web and mobile applications on top of these APIs is nothing new, and is something that I have been tracking on for over the last six years. The transparency that can be injected into the evolution of data, content, and potentially the "algorithms behind" with APIs is significant, which is how it became such a big part of my professional mission, and fueling my drive to spread the "gospel" whenever and wherever I can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, so how can APIs contribute to algorithmic transparency? To fully grasp where I am taking this, you need to understand that APIs can be used as an input and output for data, content, as well as algorithms. Let's use Twitter as an example. Using Twitter and the Twitter API I can read and write data about myself, or any user, using the /account and /users API endpoints--providing the content and data portion of what I am talking about.</p>
<p>When it comes to the algorithm portion, Twitter API has several methods, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline">GET statuses/user_timeline</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/home_timeline">GET statuses/home_timeline</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/search/tweets">GET search/tweets</a>, which return a "timeline of Tweet data". In 2006 this timeline was just the latest Tweets from the users you follow, in sequential order. In 2016, you will get "content powered by a variety of signals". In short, <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/164083">the algorithm that drives the Twitter timeline is pretty complicated</a>, with a number of things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your home timeline displays a stream of Tweets from accounts you have chosen to follow on Twitter.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You may see suggested content powered by a variety of signals.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Tweets you are likely to care about most will show up first in your timeline.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You may see a summary of the most interesting Tweets you received since your last visit</li>
<li>You may also see content such as promoted Tweets or Retweets in your timeline.</li>
<li>Additionally, when we identify a Tweet, an account to follow, or other content that's popular or relevant, we may add it to your timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of considerations that would go into any one timeline response--this is Twitter's algorithm. While I technically have access to this algorithm via three separate API endpoints, there really isn't much algorithmic transparency present, <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/164083">beyond their overview in the support section</a>. Most companies are going to claim this is their secret sauce and their intellectual property. That is fine, I don't have a problem with y'all being secretive about this, even though I will always push you to be more open, as well as leave the API layer out of your patents you use to pretect your algorithms.</p>
<p>Algorithmic transparency with APIs is not something that should be applied to all APIs in my opinion, but for regulated industries, and truly open API solutions, transparency can go a long way, and bring a number of benefits. All Twitter (and any other API provider) has to do is add parameters, and corresponding that open up the variables of the underlying algorithm for each endpoint. What goes into considerations about "what I care about", constitutes "interesting", and what makes things "popular or relevant"? Twitter will never do this, but other API providers can.</p>
<p>It is up to each API provider to decide how transparent they are going to be with their algorithms. The ideal solution when it comes to transparency is that the algorithm is documented and shared along with supporting&nbsp;code on Github, like <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation">Chicago, did for their food inspection algorithm</a>. This opens up the algorithm, and the code behind for evaluation by 3rd parties, potentially improving upon it, as well as validating the logic behind--potentially opening up a conversation about the life of the algorithm.</p>
<p>There are a number of common reasons I have seen for companies and developers not opening up their algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>It truly is secret sauce, and too much was invested to just share with the world.</li>
<li>It is crap, and the creator doesn't want anyone to know there is nothing behind.</li>
<li>There are malicious things going on behind the scenes that they do not want to be public.</li>
<li>Insecurities about coding abilities, security practices and logic applied to the algorithms.</li>
<li>Exist in competitive space with lots of bad actors, and may want to limit this behavior.</li>
<li>What is accomplished isn't really that defensible, and the only advantage is to keep hidden.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no problem making an argument for algorithmic transparency when it comes to regulated industries, like financial, healthcare, and education. I think it should be default in all civic, non-profit, and other similar scenarios where the whole stack should just be open sourced, and available on Github. You won't find me pushing back to hard on the startups unless I see some wild claims about the magic behind, or I see evidence of exploitation, then you will hear me rant about this some more.</p>
<p>Algorithmic transparency can help limit algorithmic exploitation&nbsp;and the other shady shit that is going on behind the scenes on a regular basis these days. <a href="http://apievangelist.com">I have added an algorithm section to my research</a>, and as I see more talk about the magic of algorithms, and how these amazing creations are changing our world--I am going to be poking around a bit, and probably asking to see more algorithmic transparency when I think it makes sense.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://terms-of-service.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-terms-of-use.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I find myself thinking about what the terms of service we agree to for online services are doing to our lives. Whether we see the effects or not, they are guiding almost everything we do in our personal and professional worlds. They are something that began on our desktop computers, migrated to our more mobile laptops, then deeper into our personal lives via our mobile smartphones.</p>
<p>We rarely understand what we are agreeing to when we check the box for these terms of service, which leaves me really surprised to see us accept the application of terms of service to everyday objects we depend on, as part of the Internet of Things movement. As physical objects in our lives get connected to the Internet, they begin to generate valuable data, requiring software to manage--all being directed by the terms of service set forth by the manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see this playing out as manufacturers like <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/203913-general-motors-john-deere-want-to-keep-tinkering-self-repair-illegal">GM and John Deer are limiting what you can do with their physically connected equipment</a>. These terms of service are changing the meaning of ownership, and evolving te physical things we purchase into subscriptions, instead of outright ownership. Following the tone of the conversation set by terms of service which is guiding software, this new breed of terms of service being applied to physical objects in a way that heavily benefits manufacturers, shifting as much the risk as possible to the consumers, leaving many of the benefits as possible for themselves.</p>
<p>In the rapidly expanding online and mobile worlds we (consumers) have almost no tools that help us manage the terms of service we are agreeing to, and almost no leverage when it comes to how these are crafted, changed, and applied. Why the hell would we keep this rapid pace continuing into the physical world, as well as our online worlds? It just doesn't pencil out? Especially when you consider how we give up so much of our privacy, security, and ownership as in agreeing to these terms of service.</p>
<p>How terms of service are applied to virtual and increasingly physical objects that are being connected to the Internet are much like algorithms, as they are often coded black boxes that we do not always understand. I will keep tracking on them the best I can, but as a community, we need a lot more resources if we are going to shift the balance of all of this more in the favor of the average consumer.</p>

<p>I am working on each portion of this and considering how I can add. I do not see any reason why this can't be applied to other areas of our information, like social, electricity, and beyond. I get that health care information has been granted a special place in our digital worlds, but I think we need to asking ourselves where else this might also apply.</p>
<p>It is tough to digest this in its full legal form. This is why I work to break them down as plain English building blocks that I can include alongside my research. If we can make turn this into an easy to read checklist that any data steward could use as best practices when crafting their own approach tot he disclosure of our information, maybe more companies will step up to the plate.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-science-api.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had heard about the <a href="http://labs.pathology.wisc.edu/oconnor/index.html">Zika virus research</a> that was going on at the&nbsp;University of Wisconsin listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/08/469653715/scientists-report-in-real-time-on-challenging-zika-research">an NPR episode this last spring</a>. I finally had the time to dig into the topic a little more, and learn more about where the research is at, and some of the software behind the sharing and collaboration around the research.</p>
<p>The urgency in getting the raw data and results of the research out to the wider scientific community caught my attention and the potential for applying API related approaches seems pretty huge. When it comes to mission-critical&nbsp;research that could impact thousands or millions of people, it seems like there should be a whole suite of open tooling that people can employ to ensure sharing and collaboration are real time and frictionless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I dug into the <a href="https://zika.labkey.com/project/home/begin.view">Zika virus research</a>, I was happy to find the <a href="http://www.labkey.com/">LabKey technology</a> employed to publish the research. I do not know much about them yet, but I was happy to see the <a href="http://www.labkey.com/products-services/labkey-server/download-community-edition/">open source community solution</a>, <a href="https://www.labkey.org/home/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=dev">developer resources</a> including a <a href="https://www.labkey.org/home/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=dev">web API for integrating with research that is published using the platform</a>. There are plenty of improvements I'd like to see added to the API and developer efforts, but it is a damn good start when it comes to making important scientific research much more shareable and collaborative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll spend more time learning more about what LabKey currently offers, and then I'll work to establish some sort of next steps blueprint that would employ other modern API approaches to help ensure important research can be&nbsp;made more real-time, aggregated, interoperable, and shareable using technology like <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com">Webhooks</a>, <a href="http://ipaas.apievangelist.com">iPaaS</a>, and other common areas of a modern API effort.</p>
<p>When it comes to research, scientists should&nbsp;have a wealth of open tooling and resources that make their work a collaborative and shareable process by default, but with as much control as they desire--something modern web API solutions excel at. I added LabKey to a new research area dedicated to science. I will spend more time going through space, and see what guides, blueprints, and other resources I can pull together to assist researchers in their API journey.</p>
