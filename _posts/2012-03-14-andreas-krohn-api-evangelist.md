{% include JB/setup %}<p>Andreas Krohn (@andreaskrohn) first saw the potential of APIs when he in 2005 started working with enterprise web scraping solutions at Kapow Technologies (now Kapow Software).Conceptualizing the web as one big database and creating APIs to get to that data is not that different from the REST APIs used today.When leaving Kapow to start his own company it was a given that the focus would be on APIs and open data.Andreas API work is focused in Sweden where he regularly speaks at conferences.Mostly he focuses on the non-technical side of APIs since APIs are doomed to fail without a good business strategy and long term marketing plan.</p>
