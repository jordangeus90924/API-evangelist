[<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-logo-blue.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][1]I'm working my way through all the [API management providers][2], making sure I'm up to speed on what service each provider is offering these days. As part of this work I've been playing with the [Apiphany][1] platform, using a demo site the Apiphany team was so kind to setup for me.

Using Apiphany I can manage my APIs, and launch a portal which allows me to hang all my APIs, then manage all aspects of their operations. Apiphany focuses on the three main components of API deployment
