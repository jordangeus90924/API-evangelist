{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just got off the phone with a recruiter of a major API management company, looking to recruit me as a developer evangelist, and last week I talked with two companies looking for developer evangelists.My profile comes up in a lot of searches on Google, LinkedIn , and with the growing number of APIs, the number of companies looking to fill the role, grows as well.It makes sense that I come up in searches and get a regular stream of calls.Most recruiters I decline, as Iâ€™m looking to pay attention to the bigger picture, beyond just a single API--and tell them I will put out a signal to my network, about the role.I do this knowing, there really is nobody to fill the role.</p>
