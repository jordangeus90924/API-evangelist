        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>My friends over at Social Health Insights, <a href="http://socialhealthinsights.com/2014/06/openfda-api-launch-success/">wrote about their experience being one of the beta users for the new OpenFDA API</a>, and what they thought contributed to the success of the API launch from the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>What I found interesting about their post, is that contributing factors were not technical:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Getting Feedback Early -</strong> The openFDA team solicited feedback early on in the API development process from end users and consumers of the API. This feedback was listened to and ultimately helped shape a very nice API at launch.</li>
<li><strong>Being Collaborative - </strong>If you are going to do #1 then you must be willing to be collaborative. From the get-go, the openFDA team collaborated with a number of stakeholders and was open all the feedback that streamed in. This ultimately resulted in a great product at release. Beyond the initial collaboration they are still listening and we bet they will be open to the feedback that comes in.</li>
<li><strong>Being Responsive -</strong> Send a tweet or message to the team and see what you get. You will be shocked at how fast they get back with you to answer your question. We saw questions over Twitter being answered by the community and openFDA team members within minutes (pretty cool)!</li>
<li><strong>Explaining Use Cases Well -</strong> Go to the openFDA website and you will see several queries tied to real wold questions about the data exposed by the new adverse event API. This helps consumers understand the possibilities and content of the API quicker and simpler. Beyond this, they solicited private beta testers to build solutions on top of the API which also provided additional sample use cases of solutions that could be created using the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am present on the backchannel for the OpenFDA rollout, so I saw some of the back and forth on the technical aspects of OpenFDA, and there was definitely lots of tech talk, but ultimately the success depended on providing use cases, getting early feedback, while also being collaborative and responsive.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said a thousand times before, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how technically perfect your API is, without the business and politics of your API dialed in, you will fumble the ball. Always keep in mind, that the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">reasons why this whole API thing is working</a>, goes well beyond just the technology.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/gluecon">#Gluecon</a> in Colorado the other week, I have API design on the brain. A portion of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/23/keeping-the-api-conversation-moving-forward-at-the-gluecon-apistrat-unworkshops/">#APIStrat un-workshops were dedicated to API design related discussion</a>, and <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API Design</a> is also the most trafficked portion of API Evangelist this year, according to my Google Analytics.</p>
<p>At #Gluecon, 3Scale and API Evangelist announced our new <a href="http://apisjson.org">API discovery project APIs.json</a>, and associated tooling, <a href="http://apis.io">API search engine APIs.io</a>. For APIs.json, APIs.io, and API Commons to work, we are counting API providers, and API consumers creating machine readable API definitions.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I wanted to do some exploration--what would be possible incentives for creating machine readable API definitions?</p>

<p>The importance of having an API definition of available resources, is increasing. It was hard to realize the value of defining APIs with the heavy, top down defined WSDL, and even its web counterpart WADL, but with these new approaches, other incentives are emerging&mdash;incentives that live throughout the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>The first tangible shift in this area was when Swagger released the Swagger UI, providing interactive documentation that was generated from a Swagger API definition. Apiary quickly moved the incentives to an earlier stage in the API design lifecycle with design, mocking and collaboration opportunities.</p>
<p>As the API design world continues to explode, I&rsquo;m seeing a number of other incentives emerge for API providers to generate machine readable API definitions, and looking to find any incentives that I&rsquo;m missing, as well as identify any opportunities in how I can encourage API designers to generate machine readable API definitions in whatever format they desire.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://editor.swagger.wordnik.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-editor.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In January I started taking a closer look at the world of API design, by reviewing the top movers in the space, <a href="http://bit.ly/1kFrKF0">Swagger</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1kFrINy">Wordnik</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/16ZTZYt">RAML</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtmiF9">Mulesoft</a>. My goal was to quantity the world of API design, and help me understand where it might be going, or where there are opportunities for new tools and services.</p>
<p>My intention is to write a white paper on API Design, but haven&rsquo;t reached this point, with the crazy amount of events and travel I&rsquo;ve had in the last couple months. Looking back, at where I left off in my research, the major difference between providers was that Swagger was JSON, and didn't have all the tooling that was available with API Blueprint and RAML.</p>
<p>Fast forward 60 days, and I find myself at Gluecon, hanging out with Tony Tam of Reverb, creator of Swagger. On the last day of the conference,Tony shows me the new Swagger editor, with a new focus on YAML, as well as JSON Swagger definitions.  With one release Tony addresses any gap in the space, leveling the API design playing field between API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML.</p>
<p>While there are many differences between each providers, which you can see in my reposting of  <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/api-definitions-how-do-they-model-rest/">Ole Lensmar of SmartBear explored in his talk at #APIStrat Amsterdam with how they model REST</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/03/api-definitions-what-is-behind-the-name">what is behind the name</a>, each of these top API design solutions will get you there, it just depends on your preferences.</p>
<p>60 days ago I would say that RAML and API Blueprint had a leg up on Swagger because of markdown / YAML focus, and with the amount of tooling they had. With one release Swagger has closed the gap, and with the traction they have amongst developers with a first mover advantage, this could put them squarely in the lead for adoption.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m predicting I&rsquo;ll have more time this month to finish up my API design research, and produce the first draft of the white paper. API design is proving to one of the most talked about areas of the API sector in 2014, and one I&rsquo;m enjoying tracking on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://apispark.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/api-spark/apispark-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still playing catch up on many of my stories from over the last month, and one of them is the ability to publish your API definition straight from your API deployment using <a href="https://apispark.com/">APISpark</a>. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with APISpark, it is a cloud-based API deployment service built on the <a href="http://restlet.com/">open source RESTlet framework</a>.</p>
<p>Using APISpark you can deploy APIs from existing Google Spreadsheets, machine readable files on Amazon S3, or directly from a fresh datastore. APISpark gives you all the control you need over generating your endpoints, securing and monitoring the resulting APIs&mdash;all without any programming or back-end infrastructure.</p>
<p>For me, the best part is that once you have your API deployed with APISpark, it automatically generates an <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> manifest, and serves up the URL you need to publish into the commons.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/api-spark/apispark-api-commons.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>It means a lot that APISpark understands the importance of publishing your APis to the commons, allow users to publicly showcase their API designs, acknowledging that API definitions should be interoperable, and licensed for re-use. Thanks for baking this feature directly into your API platform, and ensuring all your users play healthy role in the API economy.</p>

<p>There are numerous reasons for API designers to follow hypermedia patterns when crafting their internal, partner or publicly available APIs. One of the most fundamental reasons for offering hypermedia is to help developers understand what to do next, once receiving a response from your API.</p>
<p>Hypermedia APIs mimic the default characteristics of the web, and how you always know what do next with a web page, because there are many available links either in the form of navigation, in the body or footer. Reflecting this behavior, each hypermedia API resources comes with a set of related links giving developers clear actions to take once the response is received.</p>
<p>It can be easy to get lost in the numerous hypermedia debates online, not quite understanding all of the benefits of this fast growing API design pattern, but one clear reason is to help developers understand what to do next. Without clear instructions, developers can make obvious mistakes, misuse or misrepresent API resources, and be out of alignment with your own business goals in providing the API resource in the first place.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://heroku.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/heroku/heroku-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am playing around with deploying APIs using multiple cloud platforms, and using popular container solutions. Next up is quickly deploying one of my utility APIs, to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, complete with access control, traffic reports, and supporting analytics with <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Application - Simple Screen Capture API</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ve been working through an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">operational harness</a> for deploying all my APIs, and the API I use to push forward my approach to API deployment, is a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/creating-my-own-screenshot-api/">screen capture API</a>. This is what I will be deploying on Heroku, creating a simple application, that will take screen captures of web pages that I pass to it.</p>
<p><strong>3Scale Heroku Add-On</strong><br /> To make API deployment on Heroku easier, <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/threescale">3Scale has created a Heroku add-on</a> that you can easily deploy for any application you have running on the PaaS platform. With just a single click I added the 3Scale Heroku add-on to my screen capture API--now I can apply 3Scale API infrastructure to my API.</p>
<p><strong>API Access Control</strong><br /> Using 3Scale I can control who has access to my screen capture API, by setting rate limits and quotas, and if I want I can even charge for access. I can compose any type of service levels for my API that I want. I will create tiers for internal access, external partners, and a public tier where I charge a fee for each API call.</p>
<p><strong>API Traffic Report and Analytics</strong><br /> With all of my screen capture API traffic managed with 3Scale, I can now see traffic analytics and reports, broken down any account, application or for specific service. Any developer who signs up for my screen capture API, will get access to the reports for their account usage as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.heroku.com/threescale"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-heroku-add-on.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Ready-To-Go Developer Portal</strong><br /> One of the benefits of using 3Scale for deploying your API on Heroku, is that you get a developer portal to go with your APIs. This is where developers will to learn about your API, register for API keys, and view reports on their usage.</p>
<p><strong>Free To Get Started</strong><br /> One of the main reasons I use 3Scale to mange my APIs, is that even though I&rsquo;m on the paid tier now, 3Scale allows me to fire up new APIs, manage access and receive reports at no charge.  I don&rsquo;t pay until my APIs start generating traffic, and if my business model is sound, I should be covered. You get up to 250 user accounts with a traffic volume 150,000 API calls per day before you have to move up to the next tier.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-lingual APIs In Cloud</strong><br /> 3Scale provides <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/threescale#deployment-overview">instructions for deploying APIs using Ruby, Node.js, and Java</a>, allowing you to the language you prefer for API deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Drive API Code From Github</strong><br /> I will be driving the development of the code for my screen capture API using Github. Heroku allows me connect my application to a specific Github repository, allowing me to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/05/github-as-the-central-presence-definition-configuration-and-source-code-for-your-api/">manage all my API deployment centrally using Github</a>.</p>
<p>I already have a PHP version of my screen capture API, that uses the Slim REST framework, which wraps around PhantomJS, which does the actual screen capture. Now I can take my standard utility grade, screen capture API and easily deploy on Heroku, for my own internal use, for a partner, or to any wholesale customer who would like to deploy a screen capture API in their own Heroku account.</p>
<p>Next I&rsquo;m going to look at various ways to deploy the same screen capture API using Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are several options for deploying APIs on AWS, and hopefully I can find the easiest, lowest cost way to get an API deployed, by playing with several approaches.</p>

<p>I started beta testing a new JavaScript library, combined with API, that I&rsquo;m calling linkrot.js. My goal is to address link rot across my blogs. There are two main reasons links are bad on my site, either I moved the page or resource, or a website or other resource has gone away.</p>
<p>To help address this problem, I wrote a simple JavaScript file that lives in the footer of my blog, and when the page loads, it spiders all the links on the page, combining them into a single list and then makes a call to the linkrot.js API.</p>
<p>All new links will get a URL shortener applied, as well as a screenshot taken of the page. Every night a script will run to check the HTTP status of each link used in my site&mdash;verifying the page exists, and is a valid link.</p>
<p>Every time link rot.js loads, it will spider the links available in the page, sync with linkrot.js API, and the API returns the corresponding shortened URL, or if a link shows a 404 status, the link will no longer link to page, it will popup the last screenshot of the page, identifying the page no longer exists.</p>
<p>Eventually I will be developing a dashboard, allowing me to manage the link rot across my websites, make suggestions on links I can fix, provides a visual screen capture of those I cannot, while also adding a new analytics layer by implementing shortened URLs.</p>
<p>Linkrot.js is just an internal tool I&rsquo;m developing in private beta. Once I get up and running, Audrey will beta test, and we&rsquo;ll see where it goes from there. Who knows!</p>

<p>Even with the risk of possible creating some sort of API wormhole, I just added the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API Commons API to the API Commons</a>. The API for adding and searching for APIs that are in the commons, now has an <a href="http://apicommons.org/api-commons-manifest.json">API definition</a> that is publicly declared as part of the commons, with a CC-BY license.</p>
<p>It just makes sense to have the API for the commons in the commons, so anyone can establish their own commons, complete with common API. 3Scale and API Evangelist are taking a particular stance on the API copyright discussion, and if our approach doesn&rsquo;t match your vision of the API economy, we encourage you to fork and establish your own commons.</p>
<p>We only launched the API Commons API two months ago, so the definition is still fairly new, and we would love to hear your thoughts on the API definition, and the underlying format of the API Commons Manifest. It is up to all of us to help keep the surface area of the API economy as open, accessible, reusable and interoperable as possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/romainhuet/twitter-apis-connecting-to-the-pulse-of-the-planet"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/romain-huet-twitter-slide-twitter-pulse-of-planet.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of watching Romain Huet (<a href="https://twitter.com/romainhuet">@romainhuet</a>), developer evangelist at Twitter, give his very entertaining talk three times now, and if you haven&rsquo;t seen it, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ">looking it up on the APIStrat Youtube channel</a>. Romain walks us through the world of Twitter, showing us the power of the platform and its API, but the really entertaining part is the two Internet of things (Iot) demos that he executes during his talk.</p>
<p>The first demo Romain does, is taking an audience selfie using a Raspberry Pi driven camera, triggered by a Tweet. The second demo involves flying a quadcopter drone on stage, that uses <a href="http://nodecopter.com/">NodeCopter</a>&nbsp;as the&nbsp;interface, and Twitter as the communication layer. Both demos are crowd pleasers, which makes for not just an entertaining talk, but shows the potential of Iot + APIs, while also making the audience part of the experience.</p>
<p>I think the demos that Romain delivers are important, because they offer a unique learnng gateway to both Iot and APIs. While Twitter as a communication layer for the Internet of things may not be a scalable, production ready solution for talking to devices, I think it is a great learning platform for individuals to learn not just about APIs, but how APIs can be used to communicate with the devices in their world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/romain-apistrat-ams.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Simple Communication</strong><br /> Twitter is a simple communication platform, which posseses a social graph that is easy to understand by people who are new to the world of APIs. When individuals are  experimenting with both APIs and Iot, Twitter provides a great 101 level sandbox to learn from fun, simple, meaningful IoT + API tutorials.</p>
<p><strong>Simple API</strong><br /> The Twitter API is very mature, providing a simple, yet robust communication API to jumpstart their education. The overhead to get up and running on Twitter API by new users is very low, and with simple tutorials based upon demos like Romain&rsquo;s selfie photo, and drone, the platform provides a great sandbox for experiencing these IoT + API interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Public And Social By Default</strong><br /> Twitter is a public communication channel. Sure you can use DM&rsquo;s between users, but Twitter is open and social by default, and excellent introduction to the importance of security and privacy in the world of Iot. Users will immediately be faced with questions of messages being public, who will see, and how your devices will have to communicate in this open environment.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter As Stepping Stone</strong><br /> When it comes to Iot communication, Twitter is not a scalable solution, however it is an excellent stepping stone. Not all users who engage with Iot + API tutorials will need to scale their implementation. This approach to learning about IoT and APIs is just be a stepping stone, giving new users an API 101 introductory course on how devices like Raspberry Pi, Nodecopter and other IoT devices operate&mdash;where they go next is up to them.</p>

<p>As part of the API 101 work I&rsquo;m doing with 3Scale, I will be exploring other API 101 tutorials for consumers, hoping to provide easy to follow resources that can help anyone understand how APIs work.

        <p><a href="http://tosdr.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/terms-of-service-didnt-read/tos-didnt-read-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the work of <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a> for some time now. In my opinion this work is some of the most important legal work out there right now, which is guiding all of our activity not just online, but increasingly in our offline worlds. If you aren't familiar with Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read, I think their slogan sums it up well:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;I have read and agree to the Terms&rdquo; is the biggest lie on the web. We aim to fix that.</em></blockquote>
<p>More clarity and balance in the terms of service that online services employ is critical to the future of society and the web, this single checkbox is deciding our fate, whether you realize it or not. One of the projects I&rsquo;m working on in coming months, is forking and extending the Terms of Service Didn't Read work into the world of APIs.</p>
<p>While I was aware that the Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read work is openly licensed, I wasn't aware of the degree of openness, until I started digging through their <a href="https://github.com/tosdr/">Github account</a> and found <a href="https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org/tree/master/topics">machine readable inventory of the questions they ask of TOS</a>. This is huge!</p>
<p>To achieve their rating of each online service, TOS Didn't Read asks questions of each service providers TOS. This list of questions is critical to making sense of the complex legalese that TOS contain, allowing for them to derive a rating for each service, and provide a list of plain english description of what you face when signing up for each online service.</p>
<p>In coming months, I will be working on a forked version of TOS Didn't Read, applying their machine readable questions specifically to APIs, and hopefully contributing cycles to the central TOS Didn&rsquo;t Read. My intention is to make machine readable API definitions for this critical building block of the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-surveillance-camera.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an advisor to the camera API platform, <a href="https://www.evercam.io/">EverCam</a>. I don&rsquo;t advise the startup because I&rsquo;m super excited about the opportunities for APIs for security cameras. I'm involved because I believe in the Evercam team, and I want to be aware of this fast growing aspect of the Internet of things and API economy. Security cameras are not going away, and I want to help lend some critical thought to how we use security cameras, and apply APIs to help introduce transparency and accountability into this easily abused layer of our society.</p>
<p>One of the things I learned from Evercam, is that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/request-cctv-footage-of-yourself">in the UK you can request any photos of you taken on the vast closed circuit television</a>, that is ubiquitous across the UK landscape. You can submit a request for a time, day and location and request any photo or video footage taken of you. Its kind of like a visual FOIA request for the surveillance layer of our society. This concept intrigued me, and I wanted to explore in relationship to other layers of convergence between the API economy and our increasingly digital society.</p>
<p>Imagine if there was FOIA process for data. I could submit a request to a single organization that would then make requests to leading technology, and big data companies, asking them for a copy of all data they possess about me, and disclose any partners that they have shared this data with. I know portions of this exist from companies like <a href="http://www.acxiom.com/">Acxiom</a>, but I would like to see a more coherent, intra-company solution that could better serve individuals who wish to understand how companies are using their data.</p>
<p>A concept like FOIA for data across any company will not please corporate america, especially in a landscape where exploitation of users data is the predominant business model. However we are in the early years of the Internet, and things are very much the wild wild west, and it is only a matter of time before government regulations are needed to ensure the privacy of all citizens, and reduce exploitation and abuse by the bad apples.</p>
<p>This concept isn't far fetched. With modern, API driven systems, it is easy to track all of a users data, and where and how it is used across a company&rsquo;s network. If all data access is required to occur via APIs, it will be easy to pull a history of which users were accessed, by which internal or external consumers. Each company could be required to have an API allowing a 3rd party auditor to pull data on behalf of users, allowing independent organizations to make FOIA style data requests across multiple companies on behalf of users.</p>
<p>I know that business owners will cry foul at such an idea, claiming it is just more unnecessary regulation that they will have to deal with, but we need a way of making all this more accountable. The API driven systems that would make this possible would also give companies all the other benefits APIs afford, in making company assets more accessible. APIs would allow companies to rapidly deploy web and mobile applications, while also providing assurances to every citizen that their privacy was being respected, and all of our vital personal information was not being exploited.</p>

<p>I've been tracking on the <a href="http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-135.html">API from the US Census Bureau since they launched in 2012</a>, and even <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KinLane/posts/4suNfHBWfUE">met with them to discuss their strategy</a> over the last couple years. The team at the Census Bureau has slowly integrated an external API into their operations, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">opening up conversations around census survey data</a>, that is harder to achieve from just downloads only.</p>
<p>I recently saw a <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/blog/2014/06/03/research-2020-census-continues-%E2%80%93-census-bureau-opens-temporary-office">post that Census Bureau is gearing up for the 2020 census</a>. As I was reading the post, I couldn't help but think about how the Census API will influence how the 2020 census is executed. Additionally I wonder if any other APIs will be used during the census process, such as Twitter or other social platforms.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the census, and its resulting data will continue to be a cornerstone of the API and open data space. Census data adds a lot of value to other websites, mobile apps, and data visualizations and analysis, and is critical in providing context for both our online and offline worlds. I will continue to keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/">US Census API</a>, and look for signs of how APIs are influencing the 2020 census.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">Another Strong API Implementation In Federal Government With OpenFDA</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am really impressed with the quality of API deployments coming out of the federal government recently. I wrote about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen API from 18F</a> a couple months ago, and the latest is the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html">OpenFDA API from the Food &amp; Drug Administration</a>. I&rsquo;ve been watching the rollout of the API from behind the scenes for a while now, but with all my travel and speaking I haven't had time to write about or participate, but now that they've officially launch publicly, I wanted to help showcase what they've been up to at the FDA.</p>
<p><strong>Meaningful First Impression</strong><br /> When you first land on OpenFDA, you immediately understand what it does, thanks to the interactive visual on the homepage introducing OpenFDA, letting you know that it contains more than 3 million adverse drug event reports, with frequently reported indications for drug use among women, 55 to 90. This simple simple description, combined with an interactive visual that demonstrates the value contained within this government API resource, leaves a meaningful first impression upon arrival.</p>
<p><strong>Not Just Talk Of Being Open</strong><br /> We&rsquo;ve misused the word open when it comes to APIs, so that I&rsquo;m always skeptical when I see it use, but not in the case of OpenFDA. At the top of the home page, it gives three distinct examples of how OpenFDA embraces open, with data, code, and in community, and through making the API openly accessible, simply by requesting a key, in exchange for your email address.</p>
<p><strong>Explaining What It Is All About</strong><br /> OpenFDA explains what the OpenFDA is all about with a detailed about page, telling what the API does, who worked on the project, and how you can get involved. This type of background is often overlooked by API providers, requiring API consumers to have to piece together what the big picture is around an API&mdash;not with OpenFDA. On-boarding with the API starts with an overview of the project, and resulting API, then dropping you into what is needed to get signed up and begin using the API.</p>
<p><strong>Key Based Authentication</strong><br /> All that is required to get up and running using the OpenFDA API, is a valid email address, which in return you get an API key that you can use to make all API calls. Of course there are terms of service (TOS) and rate limit restrictions on each key, but this is standard operating procedure for APIs, especially one still in beta.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/elasticsearch/elastic-search-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Deployed Using ElasticSearch</strong><br /> Where the FBOpen from 18F used <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr to deploy their API</a>, OpenFDA uses <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">search and analytics platform ElasticSearch</a> to deploy their API. I think both of these approaches reflect an interesting trend in government, which deploys APIs from existing, an sometimes messy data stores, allowing a more meaningful and useful layer to be added with very little effort.</p>
<p><strong>Powerful Search Capabilities</strong><br /> One of the benefit of using existing search solutions like ElasticSearch, is that you get some pretty sophisticated search tools, with very little work. OpenFDA starts with providing the basic query parameters for search, then also adds in query syntax, exact matches, grouping, dates, and ranges&mdash;providing very powerful search capabilities out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>Necessary Terminology To Get Started</strong><br /> When using the OpenFDA API, you are accessing drug events, which will require some necessary terminology to get up to speed on the world of pharmaceuticals, unless of course this is the world you already live in. OpenFDA provides the necessary, to get anyone up to speed on the terminology needed to understand what is contained the 3 million drug event reports.</p>
<p><strong>Interactive API Documentation With Visuals</strong><br /> Interactive API documentation, allowing API consumers to make live API calls while learning about an API, is fast becoming essential for any API. OpenFDA provides interactive documentation, making learning about the OpenFDA API a hands-on experience, but takes this ones step further by providing supporting data visualizations. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of interactive API documentation, and I don&rsquo;t believe I've ever seen real-time visualizations to go with documentation&mdash;something I will explore further in a separate story.</p>
<p><strong>Essential  Communication Channels</strong><br /> OpenFDA doesn't miss a beat in establishing the required communication channels for the API, providing updates on the platform in a blog format, available directly from the home page. Additionally OpenFDA employs Twitter, providing a real-time conversation around the valuable API resource, between the FDA and 3rd party consumers. Open, active communication channels, providing two-way communication between a platform and its consumers, is one of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">essential ingredients that make this whole API thing work</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/introducing-open-fda.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Essential Support Framework</strong><br /> Building on top of OpenFDA platform updates, and Twitter communication channels, OpenFDA provides a multi-tiered support framework, allowing API consumers to ask questions on StackExchange, report bugs via Github, and send feedback via email. The OpenFDA support framework plus the open communication channels, establishes a robust feedback loop for the FDA around drug event report data.</p>
<p><strong>Active Github Presence</strong><br /> Github is an essential building block for all government APIs in my opinion, and OpenFDA agrees. You can find code samples for OpenFDA in a Github repository, submit bug reports via the Github issue management, and even the developer portal for the OpenFDA API runs using Github Pages, and underlying repository--nice start for your <a href="https://github.com/fda">Github account OpenFDA</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Realizing This Is More Than Just Tech</strong><br /> Showcasing the idea that APIs are way more than just the underlying tech is what API Evangelist is all about, and in my opinion OpenFDA gets this 100% with their API implementation. The OpenFDA technical implementation is built using existing technology, on top of valuable open government data, providing the necessary technical building blocks to be considered a modern web API. However, OpenFDA is so much more, delivering the best first impression possible, fritctionless on-boarding, and the required education you will need to put OpenFDA to work. OpenFDA also provides the necessary feedback loop to ensure an APIs success, with updates, Twitter, StackExchange, Github, and good ol email, there will be the necessary discussion around OpenFDA that is required move things forward.</p>
<p>The OpenFDA API is in beta, but already posses many of the essential building blocks for a successful API. I&rsquo;m sure with some hacking I could find room for improvement in the API, and supporting operations. Something I will do as I have time, adding to the existing feedback I've been seeing from other beta users.  For now, I&rsquo;m impressed with the release, and when you bundle alongside other API initiatives like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/03/significance-of-the-we-the-people-api-being-first-modern-read--write-web-api-in-government/">We The People</a>, it makes me very optimistic about what APIs are going to be able to accomplish in federal government.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/we-the-people/we_the_people.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I finished up <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/02/my-response-to-how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">my response to the Department of Education RFI focused around the use of APIs</a> at the government agency, a place where I&rsquo;m not just advocating for APIs, but pushing very hard for read / write APIs. I finished up my response to the RFI while waiting for my flight out of Barcelona where I spoke at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">API Days Mediterranea</a>, where I the heard echoes of the importance role that write APIs will play in government, during a talk from Xavier Badosa (<a href="https://twitter.com/badosa">@badosa</a>).</p>
<p>All of this primed the pump for me thinking about write APIs in government, while on my flight back to Los Angeles. This will be one of the biggest challenges API evangelists in government will face in coming years, something that scares the shit out of government leaders and their legal advisors, but will also be essential to government assuming its role in the API economy.</p>
<p>A read and write strategy for some government APIs, will evolve government resources from being just a download, to being a conversation with private sector interests that are putting those resources to use. As I highlighted in my Department of Education RFI response, allowing reading and writing to government resources, combined with development of sensible service composition around these resources, and establishment of trusted access tiers, will be the connector between the public and private sector, in the API economy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not API delusional enough to believe that deploying of APIs, or even read / write APIs will automatically be a good thing in all scenarios. However the opportunity to increase access to government resources by the private sector, in a secure and controlled way, should be considered by all government agencies. When appropriate, the design and deployment of read / write APIs is bundled with all the essential <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/tools.html">building blocks for API management</a>, it has the potential to allow for a new, real-time, two way partnership to emerge between the public and private sector.</p>
<p>With this vision in mind, I can&rsquo;t help but think about the significance of the first, modern read / write web API in the United States federal government, being the We The People API. While there are other write API resources in government like the<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint"> IRS modernized e-file system</a>, the <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers">We The People API</a> is the first read / write API with al the hallmark characteristics of a modern web API.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy into all the bullshit rhetoric Silicon Valley and the API industry (sometimes me) spouts about APIs democratizing everything, I think they can just as easily be used in dictatorships, and efforts to lock up resources&mdash;APIs just reflect their owners objectives. Even with this, I couldn&rsquo;t think of a better read / write API initiative than the We The People platform, which provides a way for citizens to petition the White House, potentially &ldquo;giving all Americans a way to engage their government on the issues that matter to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While APIs does not automaticaly equal democracy, I think APIs will play a central role in the future of government. I will be closely watching, and hopefully even participating in the<a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/write-api-beta-testing"> We The People Write API beta initiative</a>. I&rsquo;m not sure what the outcome will be, but I think the effort is worth supporting, and if we can pull off, will be a shining example of read / write APIs in government, providing a precedent that other agencies can follow in their own efforts, hopefully opening up the floodgates for read / write APIs in government.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/romain-apistrat-ams.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working my way through the collection of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">talks from API Strategy &amp; Practice Amsterdam that are available on Youtube</a>, and I'm reminded of what an amazing lineup of speakers we've managed to assemble at not just #APIStrat Amsterdam, but also in San Francisco and New York.</p>
<p>Today I re-watched three videos which I think reflect not just #APIStrat, but also where we are at in the industry:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOjESChb0sU">Mike Amundsen</a> </strong>- In an effort to understand where we are going with the API economy , Mike looks back at the history of computing, trying to understand how we got here, uncovering some interesting patterns, while weaving it all together into a compelling story worthy of a Ken Burns PBS documentary.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ">Romain Huet</a></strong> - When selecting talks for #APIStrat we don't just select big brands, we look for the most compelling speakers, and the #APIStrat audience got both with a walk through the Twittersphere and bonus look at the convergence of Internet of Things and APIs, by taking an audience selfie, and flying a drone on stage, from Romain Huett of Twitter.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXk1dvLKl-U">Eva Sjokvist</a></strong> - Eva from Absolut Vodka wowed the #APIStrat audience with the story of their cocktail database API, which went beyond tech, and internally changed culture at the leading vodka manufacturer, teaching them how to look outside the company walls and realize the benefits of external partnerships.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working my way through other talks, but these three stand out as examples of what we look for from presenters at #APIStrat. Our speakers tell stories, wow the audience with entertaining demonstrations of the power of APIs, while showcasing how APIs have made an impact at companies, and within industries around the globe.</p>
<p>If you have an idea for a talk that you would like to share at #APIStrat in Chicago, something that you think will not just benefit the 700+ attendees, but will also push the API space forward, we want to hear from you. The only thing is you have 48 hours left to submit, before the call for papers closes. Don't miss out on being part of the conversation at #APIStrat, as well as making your mark on moving things forward&mdash;<a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/contact-call-for-papers.php">submit your talk before Thursday 5PM PDT to get in on the action</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/images/logos/ed.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spent considerable time going through the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/04/how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">Department of Education RFI</a>, answering each question in as much detail as I possibly could. You can find my full response below. In the end I felt I could provide more value by summarizing my response, eliminating much of the redundancy across different sections of the RFI, and just cut through the bureaucracy as I (and APIs) prefer to do.</p>
<p><strong>Open Data By Default</strong><br /> All publicly available data at the Department of Education needs to be open by default. This is not just a mandate, this is a way of life. There is no data that is available on any Department of Education websites that should not be available for data download. Open data downloads are not separate from existing website efforts at Department of Education, they are the other side of the coin, making the same content and data available in machine readable formats, rather than available via HTML&mdash;allowing valuable resources to be used in systems and applications outside of the department&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p><strong>Open API When There Are Resources</strong><br /> The answer to whether or not the Department of Education should provide APIs is the same as whether or not the agency should deploy websites&mdash;YES! Not all individuals and companies will have the resources to download, process, and put downloadable resources to use. In these situations APIs can provide much easier access to open data resources, and when open data resources are exposed as APIs it opens up access to a much wider audience, even non-developers. Lightweight, simple, API access to open data inventory should be default along with data downloads when resources are available. This approach to APIs by default, will act as the training ground for not just 3rd party developers, but also internally, allowing Department of Education staff to learn how to manage APIs in a safe, read-only environment.</p>
<p><strong>Using A Modern API Design, Deployment, and Management Approach</strong><br /> As the usage of the Internet matured in 2000, many leading technology providers like SalesForce and Amazon began using web APIs to make digital assets available to 3rd party partners, and 14 years later there are some very proven approaches to designing, deploying and management APIs. API management is not a new and bleeding edge approach to making assets available in the private sector, there are numerous API tools and services available, and this has begun to extend to the government sector with tools like API Umbrella from NREL, being employed by api.data.gov and other agencies, as well as other tools and services being delivered by 18F from GSA. There are many proven blueprints for the Department of Education to follow when embarking on a complete API strategy across the agency, allowing innovation to occur around specific open data, and other program initiatives, in a safe, proven way.</p>
<p><strong>Use API Service Composition For Maximum Access &amp; Control</strong><br /> One benefit of 14 years of evolution around API design, deployment, and management is the establishment of sophisticated service composition of API resources. Service composition refers to the granular, modular design and deployment of APIs, while being able to manage who has access to these resources. Modern API access is not just direct, public access to a database. API service composition allows for designing exactly the access to resources that is necessary, one that is in alignment with business objectives, while protecting the privacy and security of everyone involved. Additionally service composition allows for real-time awareness of how all data, content, and other resources at the Department of Education are accessed and put to use, allowing new APIs to be designed to support specific needs, and existing APIs to evolved based upon actual demand, not just speculation.</p>
<p><strong>Deeper Understanding Of How Resources Are Used</strong><br /> A modern API service composition layer opens up possibility for a new analytics layer that is not just about measuring and reporting of access to APIs, it is about understanding precisely how resources are accessed in real-time, allowing API design, deployment and management processes to be adjusted in a more rapid and iterative way, that contributes to the roadmap, while providing the maximum enforcement of security and privacy of everyone involved.  When the Department of Education internalizes a healthy, agency-wide API approach, a new real-time understanding will replace this very RFI centered process that we are participating in, allowing for a new agility, with more control and flexibility than current approaches. A RFI cycle takes months, and will contain a great deal of speculation about what would be, where API access, coupled with healthy analytics and feedback loops, answers all the questions being addressed in this RFI, in real-time, reducing resource costs, and wasted cycles.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Open Up Synchronous and Asynchronous Communication Channels</strong><br /> Open data downloads represents a broadcast approach to making Department of Education content, data and other resources available, representing a one way street. APIs provide a two-way communication, bringing external partners and vendors closer to Department of Education, while opening up feedback loops with the Department of Education, reducing the distance between the agency and its private sector partners&mdash;potentially bringing valuable services closer to students, parents and the companies or institutions that serve them.  Feedback loops are much wider currently at the Department of Education occur on annual, monthly and at the speed of email or phone calls , with the closest being in person at events, something that can be a very expensive endeavor. Web APIs provide a real-time, synchronous and asynchronous communication layer that will improve the quality of service between Department of Education and the public, for a much lower cost than traditional approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Building External Ecosystem of Partners</strong><br />The availability of high value API resources, coupled with a modern approach to API design, deployment and management, an ecosystem of trusted partners can be established, allowing the Department of Education to share the workload with an external partner ecosystem. API service composition allows the agency to open up access to resources to only the partners who have proven they will respect the privacy and security of resources, and be dedicated to augmenting and helping extend the mission of the Department of Education. As referenced in the RFI, think about the ecosystem established by the IRS modernized e-file system, and how the H&amp;R Blocks, and Jackson Hewitt&rsquo;s of the world help the IRS share the burden of the country's tax system. Where is the trusted ecosystem for the Department of Education? The IRS ecosystem has been in development for over 25 years, something the Department of Education has to get to work on theirs now.</p>
<p><strong>Security Fits In With Existing Website Security Practices</strong><br /> One of the greatest benefits of web APIs is that they utilize existing web technologies that are employed to deploy and manage websites. You don&rsquo;t need additional security approaches to manage APIs beyond existing websites. Modern web APIs are built on HTTP, just like websites, and security can be addressed right alongside current website security practices&mdash;instead of delivering HTML, APIs are delivering JSON and XML. APIs even go further, and by using modern API service composition practices, the Department of Education gains an added layer of security and control, which introduces granular levels of access to all resource, something that does not exist for website. With a sensible analytics layer, API security isn&rsquo;t just about locking down, it is about understanding who is access resources, how they are using them, striking a balance between the security and access of resources, which is the hallmark of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>oAuth Gives Identity and Access Control To The Student</strong><br /> Beyond basic web security, and the heightened level of control modern API management deliver, there is a 3rd layer to the security and privacy layer of APis that does not exist anywhere else&mdash;oAuth. Open Authentication or oAuth provides and  identity and access layer on top of API that gives end-users, and owner of personal data control over who access their data. Technology leaders in the private sector are all using oAuth to give platform users control over how their data is used in applications and systems. oAuth is the heartbeat of API security, giving API platforms a way to manage security, and how 3rd party developers access and put resources to use, in a way that gives control to end users. In the case of the Department of Education APIs, this means putting the parent and student at the center of who accesses, and uses their personal data, something that is essential to the future of the Department of Education.</p>
<p><strong>How Will Policy Be Changed?</strong><br />I'm not a policy wonk, nor will I ever be one. One thing I do know is you will never understand the policy implications in one RFI, nor will you change policy to allow for API innovation in one broad stroke--you will fail. Policy will have to be changed incrementally, a process that fits nicely with the iterative, evolutionary life cyce of API managment. The cultural change at Department of Education, as well as evolutionary policy change at the federal level will be the biggest benefits of APIs at the Department of Education.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>An Active API Platform At Department of Education Would Deliver What This RFI Is Looking For</strong><br /> I know it is hard for the Department of Education to see APIs as something more than a technical implementation, and you want to know, understand and plan everything ahead of time&mdash;this is baked into the risk averse DNA of government. &nbsp;Even with this understanding, as I go through the RFI, I can&rsquo;t help but be frustrated by the redundancy, bureaucracy, over planning, and waste that is present in this process. An active API platform would answer every one of your questions you pose, with much more precision than any RFI can ever deliver.</p>
<p>If the Department of Education had already begun evolving an API platform for all open data sets currently available on data.gov, the agency would have the experience in API design, deployment and management to address 60% of the concerns posed by this RFI. Additionally the agency would be receiving feedback from existing integrators about what they need, who they are, and what they are building to better serve students and institutions. Because this does not exist there will be much speculation about who will use Department of Education APIs, and how they will use them and better serve students. While much of this feedback will be well meaning, it will not be rooted in actual use cases, applications and existing implementations. An active API ecosystem answers these questions, while keeping answers rooted in actual integrations, centered around specific resources, and actual next steps for real world applications.</p>
<p>The learning that occurs from managing read-only API access, to low-level data, content and resources would provide the education and iteration necessary for the key staff at Department of Education to reach the next level, which would be read / write APIs, complete with oAuth level security, which would be the holy grail in serving students and achieving the mission of the Department of Education. I know I&rsquo;m biased, because of my focus on APIs, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">read / write access to all Department of Education resources over the web and via mobile devices, that gives full control to students, is the future of the agency</span>. There is no "should we do APIs", there is only the how, and I&rsquo;m afraid we are wasting time, and we need to just do it, and learn to ask these questions along the way.</p>
<p>There is proven technology and processes available to make all Department of Education data, content and resources available, allowing both read and write access in a secure way, that is centered around the student. The private sector is 14 years ahead of the government in delivering private sector resources in this way, and other government agencies are ahead of the Department of Education in doing this as well, but there is an opportunity for the agency to still lead and take action, by committing the resources necessary to not just deploy a single API, but internalize APIs in a way that will change the way learning occurs in the coming decades across all US institutions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>A. Information Gaps and Needs in Accessing Current Data and Aid Programs</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. How could data sets that are already publicly available be made more accessible using APIs?  Are there specific data sets that are already available that would be most likely to inform consumer choice about college affordability and performance?</strong></p>
<p>Not everyone has the resources download, process and put open datasets to use. APIs can make all of the publicly available datasets more available to the public, allowing for easy URL access, deployment of widgets, visualizations as well as integration with existing tools like Microsoft Excel. All datasets should have option of being published in this way, but ultimately the Dept. of Ed API ecosystem should speak to which datasets would be most high value, and warrant API access.</p>
<p><strong>2. How could APIs help people with successfully and accurately completing forms associated with any of the following processes: FAFSA; Master Promissory Note; Loan Consolidation; entrance and exit counseling; Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) programs,ï¿¼ 15 such as Pay As You Earn; and the Public Student Loan Forgiveness program?</strong></p>
<p>APIs will help decouple each data point on a form. Introductory information, each questions, and other supporting resources can be broken up and delivered via any website, and mobile applications. Evolving a form into a linear, 2-dimensional form into an interactive application that people can engage with, providing the assistance needed to properly achieve the goals surrounding a form.</p>
<p>Each form initiative will have its own needs, and a consistent API platform and strategy from the department of Education will help identify each forms unique requirements, and the custom delivery of just the resources that are needed for a forms target audience.</p>
<p><strong>3. What gaps are there with loan counseling and financial literacy and awareness that could be addressed through the use of APIs to provide access to government resources and content?</strong></p>
<p>First, APIs can provide access to the content that educates students about the path they are about to embark on, before they do, via web and mobile apps they frequent already, not being required to visit the source site and learn. Putting the information students need into their hands, via their mobile devices will increase the reach of content and increase the chances that students will consume.</p>
<p>Second, APIs plus oAuth will give students access over their own educational finances, forcing them to better consider how they will manage all the relationships they enter into, the details of loans, grants and with the schools they attend. With more control over data and content, will come a forced responsibility in understanding and managing their finances.</p>
<p>Third, this process will open up students eyes to the wider world of online data and information, and that APIs are driving all aspects of their financial life from their banking and credit cards to managing their online credit score.</p>
<p>APIs are at the heart of all of the API driven digital economy, the gift that would be given to students when they first leave home, in the form of API literacy would carry with them throughout their lives, allowing them to better manage all aspects of their online and financial lives&mdash;and the Department of Education gave them that start.</p>
<p><strong>4. What services that are currently provided by title IV student loan servicers could be enhanced through APIs (e.g., deferment, forbearance, forgiveness,  cancellation, discharge, payments)?</strong></p>
<p>A consistent API platform and strategy from the department of Education would provide the evolution of a suite of verified partners, such as title IV student loan services. A well planned partner layer within an ecosystem would allow student loan services to access data from students in real-time, with students having a say in who and how they have access to the data. These dynamics introduced by, and unique to API platforms that employ oAuth, provide new opportunities for partnerships to be established, evolve and even be terminated when not going well.</p>
<p>API platform using oAuth provide a unique 3-legged relationship between the data platform, 3rd party service providers and students (users), that can be adopted to bring in existing industry partners, but more importantly provide a rich environment for new types of partners to evolve, that can improve the overall process and workflow a student experiences.</p>
<p><strong>5. What current forms or programs that already reach prospective students or borrowers in distress could be expanded to include broader affordability or financial literacy information?</strong></p>
<p>All government forms and programs should be evaluated for the pros / cons of an API program. My argument within this RFI response will be focused on a consistent API platform and strategy from the department of Education. APIs should be be part of every existing program change, and new initiatives in the future.</p>
<p><strong>B. Potential Needs to be Filled by APIs</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. If APIs were available, what types of individuals, organizations, and companies would build tools to help increase access to programs to make college more affordable?</strong></p>
<p>A consistent API platform and strategy from the department of Education will have two essential components, partner framework, and service composition. A partner framework defines which external, 3rd party groups can work with Department of Education API resources. The service composition defines how these 3rd party groups can can access and ultimately use Department of Education API resources.</p>
<p>All existing groups that the Department of Education interacts with currently should be evaluated for where in the API partner framework they exists, defining levels of access for general public, student up to certified and trusted developer and business partnerships.</p>
<p>The partner framework and service composition for the Department of Education API platform should be applied to all existing individuals, organizations and companies, while also allow for new actors to enter the game, and potentially redefining the partner framework and add new formulas for API service composition, opening up the possibilities for innovation around Department of Education API resources.</p>
<p><strong>2. What applications and features might developers, schools, organizations, and companies take interest in building using APIs in higher education data and services?</strong></p>
<p>As with which Department of Education forms and programs might have APIs apply, which individuals, organizations and companies will use APIs, the only way to truly understand what applications might developers, schools, organizations and companies put APIs cannot be know, until it is place. These are the questions an API centric company or institution asks of its API platform in real-time. You can&rsquo;t define who will use an API and how they will use it, it takes iteration and exploration before successful applications will emerge.</p>
<p><strong>3. What specific ways could APIs be used in financial aid processes (e.g., translation of financial aid forms into other languages, integration of data collection into school or State forms)?</strong></p>
<p>When a resource is available via an API, it is broken down into the smallest possible parts and pieces possible, allowing them to be re-used, and re-purposed into every possible configuration management. When you make form questions independently available via an API, it allows you to possible reorder, translate, and ask in new ways.</p>
<p>This approach works well with forms, allowing each entry of a form to be accessible, transferable, and open up for access, with the proper permissions and access level that is owned by the person who owns the format data. This opens up not just the financial aid process, but all form processes to interoperate with other systems, forms, agencies and companies.</p>
<p>With the newfound modularity and interoperability introduced by APIs, the financial aid process could be broken down, allowing parents to take part for their role, schools for theirs, and allow multiple agencies to be engaged such as IRS or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). All of this allows any involved entity or system to do its part for the financial aid process, minimizing the friction throughout the entire form process, even year over year.</p>
<p><strong>4. How can third-party organizations use APIs to better target services and information to low-income students, first-generation students, non-English speakers, and students with disabilities?</strong></p>
<p>Again, this is a questions that should be asked in real-time of a Department of Education platform. Examples of how 3rd party organizations can better target services and information to students, is the reason for an API platform. There is no way to no this ahead of time, I will leave to domain experts to attempt at answering.</p>
<p><strong>5. Would APIs for higher education data, processes, programs or services be useful in enhancing wraparound support service models? What other types of services could be integrated with higher education APIs?</strong></p>
<p>A sensibly design,deployed, managed and evangelized API platform would establish a rich environment for existing educational services to be augmented, but also allow for entirely new types of services to be defined.  Again I will leave to domain experts to speak of specific service implantations based upon their goals, and understanding of the space.</p>
<p><strong>C. Existing Federal and Non-Federal Tools Utilizing APIs</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What private-sector or non-Federal entities currently offer assistance with higher education data and student aid programs and processes by using APIs?  How could these be enhanced by the Department&rsquo;s enabling of additional APIs?</strong></p>
<p>There are almost 10K public APIs available in the private sector. This should be viewed as a pallet for developers, and something that developers use as they are developing (painting) their apps (painting). It is difficult for developers to know what they will be painting with, without knowing what resources are available.  The open API innovation process rarely is able to articulate what is needed, then make that request for resources&mdash;API innovations occurs when valuable, granular resources are available fro multiple sources, ad developers assemble them, and innovate in new ways.</p>
<p><strong>2. What private-sector or non-Federal entities currently work with government programs and services to help people fill out government forms? Has that outreach served the public and advanced public interests?</strong></p>
<p>Another question that should be answered by the Department of of Education, and providing us with the answers. How would you know this without a properly definitely partner framework? Stand up an API platform, and you will have the answer.</p>
<p><strong>3. What instances or examples are there of companies charging fees to assist consumers in completing otherwise freely available government forms from other agencies? What are the advantages and risks to consider when deciding to allow third parties to charge fees to provide assistance with otherwise freely available forms and processes? How can any risks be mitigated?</strong></p>
<p>I can't speak to what is already going on in the space, regarding companies charging feeds to consumers, I am not expert on the education space at this level. This is just such a new paradigm made possible via APIs and open data, there just aren&rsquo;t that many examples in the space, built around open government data.</p>
<p>First, the partner tiers of API platforms help verify and validate individuals and organizations who are building applications and charging for services in the space. A properly design, managed and policed partner tier can assist in mitigating risk in the evolution of such business ecosystems.</p>
<p>Second API driven security layers using oAuth give access to end-users, allowing students to take control over which applications and ultimately service providers have access to their data, revoking when services are done or a provider is undesirable. With proper reporting and rating systems, policing of the API platform can be something that is done within the community, and the last mile of policing being done by the Department of Education.</p>
<p>Proper API management practices provide the necessary identity, access and control layers necessary to keep resources and end-users safe. Ultimately who has access to data, can charge fees, and play a role in the ecosystem is up to Department of education and end-users when applications are built on top of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>4. Beyond the IRS e-filing example, what other similar examples exist where Federal, State, or local government entities have used APIs to share government data or facilitate participation in government services or processes - particularly at a scale as large as that of the Federal Student Aid programs?</strong></p>
<p>This is a new, fast growing sector, and there are not a lot of existing examples, but there area few:</p>
<p>Open311<br /> An API driven system that allows citizens to report and interact with municipalities around issues within communities. While Open311 is deployed in specific cities such as Chicago and Baltimore, it is an open source platform and API that can be deployed to serve any size market.</p>
<p>Census Bureau<br /> The US Census provides open data and APIs, allowing for innovation around government census survey data, used across the private sector in journalism, healthcare, and many other ways. The availability of government census data is continually spawning new applications, visualizations and other expressions, that wouldn&rsquo;t be realized or known, if the platform wasn&rsquo;t available.</p>
<p>We The People<br /> The We The People API allows for 3rd-Party integration with the White House Petition process. Currently only allowing for read only access to the information, and the petition process, but is possibly one way that write APIs will emerge in federal government.</p>
<p>There are numerous examples of open APIs and data being deployed in government, even from the Department of Education. All of them are works in progress, and will realize their full potential over time, maturation and much iteration and engagement with the public.</p>
<p><strong>D. Technical Specifications</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What elements would a read-write API need to include for successful use at the Department?</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous building blocks can be employed in managing read-write APIs, but there are a couple that will be essential to successful read-write APIs in government:</p>
<p>Partner Framework<br /> Defined access tiers for consumers of API data, with appropriate public, partner and private (internal) levels of access. All write methods are only accessible by partner and internal levels of access, requiring verification and certification of companies and individuals who will be building on top of API resources.</p>
<p>Service Management<br /> The ability to compose many different types of API resource access, create service bundles that are made accessible to different levels of partners. Service management allows for identity and access management, but also billing, reporting, and other granular level control over how services are composed, accessed and managed.</p>
<p>Open Authentication (oAuth 2.0)<br /> All data made available via Department of Education API platforms and involves personally identifiable information will require the implementation of an open authentication or oAuth security layer. oAuth 2.0 provides an identity layer for the platform, requiring developers to use token that throttle access to resources for applications, a process that is initiated, managed and revoked by end-users&mdash;providing the highest level of control over who has access to data, and what they can do with it, by the people who personal data is involved.</p>
<p>Federated API Deployments<br /> Not all APIs should be deployed and managed within the Department of Education firewall. API platforms can be made open source so that 3rd party partners can deploy within their own environments. Then via a sensible partner framework, the Department of Education can decide which partners they should not just allow to write to APIs, but also pull data from their trusted systems and open API deployments.</p>
<p>APIs provide the necessary access to all of federal government API resources, and a sensible partner framework, service management layer in conjunction with oAuth will provide the necessary controls for a read / write API in government. If agencies are looking to further push risk outside the firewall, federated API deployments with trusted partners will have to be employed.</p>
<p><strong>2. What data, methods, and other features must an API contain in order to develop apps accessing Department data or enhancing Department processes, programs, or services?</strong></p>
<p>There are about 75 common building blocks for API deployments (http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html), aggregated after looking at almost 10K public API deployments. Each government API will have different needs when it comes to other supporting building blocks.</p>
<p><strong>3. How would read-only and/or read-write APIs interact with or modify the performance of the Department&rsquo;s existing systems (e.g., FAFSA on the Web)?  Could these APIs negatively or positively affect the current operating capability of such systems?  Would  these APIs allow for the flexibility to evolve seamlessly with the Department&rsquo;s technological developments?</strong></p>
<p>There are always risks with API access to resources, but a partner framework, service management, oAuth, and other common web security practices these risks can be drastically reduce, and mitigated in real-time</p>
<p>Isolated API Deployments<br /> New APIs should rarely be deployed and directly connected to existing systems. APIs can be deployed as an isolated interface, with an isolated data store. Existing systems can use the same API interface to read / write data into the system and keep in sync with existing internal systems. API developers will never have access to existing system and data stores, just isolated, defined API interfaces as part of a secure partner tier, only accessing the services they have permission to, and the end-user data that has been given access to by end-users themselves.</p>
<p>Federated Deployments<br /> As described above, if government agencies are looking to further reduce risk, API deployments can be designed and deployed as open source software, allowing partners with the ecosystem to download and deploy. A platform partner framework can provide a verification and certification process for federal API deployments, allowing the Department of Education to decide who they will pull data from, reducing the risk to internal systems, providing a layer of trust for integration.</p>
<p>Beyond these approaches to deploying APIs, one of the biggest benefits of web API deployments is they use the same security as other government websites, just possessing an additional layer of securing determining who has access, and to what.</p>
<p>It should be the rare instance when an existing system will have an API deployed with direct integration. API automation will provide the ability to sync API deployments with existing systems and data stores.</p>
<p><strong>4. What vulnerabilities might read-write APIs introduce for the security of the underlying databases the Department currently uses?</strong></p>
<p>As stated above, there should be no compromise in how data is imported into existing databases at the Department of Education. It is up to the agency to decide which APIs they pull data from, and how it is updated as part of existing systems.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are the potential adverse effects on successful operation of the Department&rsquo;s underlying databases that read-write APIs might cause? How could APIs be developed to avoid these adverse effects?</strong></p>
<p>As stated above, isolated and external, federated API deployments will decouple the risk from existing systems. This is the benefit of APIs, is they can deployed as isolated resources, then integration and interoperability, internally and externally is up to the consumer to decide what is imported and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>6. How should APIs address application-to-API security?</strong></p>
<p>Modern API partner framework, service management and oath provide the necessary layer to identify who has access, and what resources can be used by not just a company and user, but by each application they have developed.</p>
<p>Routing all API access through the partner framework plus associated service level, will secure access to Department of Education resources  by applications, with user and app level logging of what was accessed and used within an application.</p>
<p>OAuth provides a balance to this application to API security layer, allowing the Department of Education to manage security of API access, developers to request access for their applications, but ultimately control is in the hand of end users to define which applications have access to their data.</p>
<p><strong>7. How should the APIs address API-to-backend security issues?  Examples include but are not limited to authentication, authorization, policy enforcement, traffic management, logging and auditing, TLS (Transport Layer Security), DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) prevention, rate limiting, quotas, payload protection, Virtual Private Networks, firewalls, and analytics.</strong></p>
<p>Web APIs use the exact same infrastructure as websites, allowing for the re-use of existing security practices employed for websites. However APIs provide the added layer of security, logging, auditing and analytics provided through the lens of the partner framework, service composition and only limited by the service management tooling available.</p>
<p><strong>8. How do private or non-governmental organizations optimize the presentation layer for completion and accuracy of forms?</strong></p>
<p>Business rules. As demonstrated as part of a FAFSA API prototype, business rules for each form field, along with rejection codes can also be made available via an API resources, allowing for developers to build in a form validation layer into all digital forms.</p>
<p>After submission, and the first line of defense provide red by API developers building next generation forms, platform providers can provide further validation, review and ultimately a status workflow that allows forms to be rejected or accepted based upon business logic.</p>
<p><strong>9. What security parameters are essential in ensuring there is no misuse, data mining, fraud, or misrepresentation propagated through use of read- only or read-write APIs?</strong></p>
<p>A modern API service management layer allows the platform provider to see all API resources that are being access, by whom, and easily establish patterns for healthy usage, as well as patterns for misuse. When misuse is identified, service management allows providers to revoke access, and take action against companies and individuals.</p>
<p>Beyond the platform provider, APIs allow for management by end-users through common oAuth flows and management tools. Sometimes end-users can identify an app is misusing their data, even before a platform provider might. oAuth gives them the control to revoke access to their data, via the API platform.</p>
<p>oauth, combined with API service management tooling has allowed for a unique security environment in which the platform can easily keep operations healthy, but end-users and developers can help police the ecosystem as well. If platform providers give users the proper rating and reporting tools, they can help keep API and data consumers in check.</p>
<p><strong>10. With advantages already built into the Department&rsquo;s own products and services (e.g., IRS data retrieval using FAFSA on the Web), how would new, third-party API-driven products present advantages over existing Department resources?</strong></p>
<p>While existing products and services developed within the department do provide great value, the Department of Education cannot do everything on their own. Because of the access the Department has, some features will be better by default, but this won&rsquo;t be the case in all situations.</p>
<p>The Department of Education and our government does not have unlimited resources, and with access to ALL resources available via the department the private sector can innovate, helping share the load of delivering vital services. Its not whether or not public sector products and services are better than private sector or vice vera, it is about the public sector and private sector partnering wherever and whenever it make sense.</p>
<p><strong>11. What would an app, service or tool built with read-write API access to student aid forms look like?</strong></p>
<p>Applications will look like turbotax and tax act developed within the IRS ecosystem, and look like the tools developed by the Sunlight Foundation on top of government open data and APIs.</p>
<p>We will never understand what applications are possible until the necessary government resources are available. All digital assets should be open by default, with consistent API platform and strategy from the department of Education, and the platform will answer this question.</p>
<p><strong>E. Privacy Issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. How could the Department use APIs that involve the use of student records while ensuring compliance with potentially applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. &sect; 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. &sect; 552a and 34 CFR Part 5b)?</strong></p>
<p>As described above the partner framework, service management and oAuth layer provides the control and logging necessary to execute and audit as part of any application statutory and regulatory requirement.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t articulate enough how this layer provides a tremendous amount of control over how these resources are access, giving control to the involved parties who matter the most&mdash;end-users. All API traffic is throttled, measured and reviewed as part of service management, enforcing privacy that in a partnership between the Department of Education, API consumers and end-users.</p>
<p><strong>2. How could APIs ensure that the appropriate individual has provided proper consent to permit the release of privacy-protected data to a third party? How can student data be properly safeguarded to prevent its release and use by third parties without the written consent often required?</strong></p>
<p>As articulated above the partner framework, service management and oAuth address this. This is a benefit of API deployment, breaking down existing digital access, providing access and granular control, combined with oAuth and logging of all access&mdash;APIs take control to a new level.</p>
<p>oAuth has come to represent this new balance in security and control of digital resources, allowing the platform, developers and end-users to execute within their defined role on the platform. This balance introduced by APIs and oAuth, allow data to be safeguarded, while also opening up for the widest possible use in the next generation applications and other implementations.</p>
<p><strong>3. How might read-only or read-write APIs collect, document, and track individuals&rsquo; consent to have their information shared with specific third parties?</strong></p>
<p>oAuth. Period.</p>
<p><strong>4. How can personally identifiable information (PII) and other financial information (of students and parents) be safeguarded through the use of APIs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Access of personally identifiable information (PII) via Department of Education APIs will be controlled by students and their parents. The most important thing you can do to protect PII is to give the owner of that data, education about how to allow developer access to it in responsible ways that will benefit them.</strong></p>
<p>APIs open up access, while oAuth will give the students and parents the control they need to integrate with apps, and existing system to achieve their goals, while retaining the greatest amount of over safeguarding their own data.</p>
<p><strong>5. What specific terms of service should be enabled using API keys, which would limit use of APIs to approved users, to ensure that information is not transmitted to or accessed by unauthorized parties?</strong></p>
<p>A well designed partner layer would define multiple level of access, combined with sensible service packages, will establish the terms of service levels that will be bundled with API keys and oAuth level identity and access to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Common approaches to deploying partner layers with appropriate service tiers, using oAuth have been well established over the last 10 years in the private sector.  Controlling access to API resources at a granular level, providing the greatest amount of access that makes sense, while knowing who is access data and how they are using is what APIs are designed for.</p>
<p><strong>6. What are the relative privacy-related advantages and disadvantages of using read-only versus read-write APIs for student aid data?</strong></p>
<p>You will face many of the similar privacy concerns whether an API is read or write. If it is personably identifiable information, read or write access to the wrong parties violates a student's privacy. Just ensure that data is updated via trusted application providers is essential.</p>
<p>A properly defined partner layer will separate who has read and who has write access. Proper logging and versioning of data is essential to ensure data integrity, allowing end-users to manage their data via an application or system with confidence.</p>
<p><strong>F. Compliance Issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What are the relative compliance-related advantages and disadvantages of using read-only versus read-write APIs for student aid data?</strong></p>
<p>APIs provide a single point of access to student aid data. With the implementation of proper partner framework, service management and oAuth every single action via this doorway is controlled and logged. When it comes to auditing ALL operations whether it is from the public, partners or internal, APIs excel in satisfying compliance concerns.</p>
<p><strong>2. How can the Department prevent unauthorized use and the development of unauthorized products from occurring through the potential development of APIs? How might the Department enforce terms of service for API key holders, and prevent abuse and fraud by non-API key holders, if APIs were to be developed and made available?</strong></p>
<p>As described above the partner framework, service management and oAuth will provide the security layer needed to manage 99% of potential abuse, but overall enforcement via the API platform is a partnership between the Department of Education, API consumers as well as end-users.  The last mile of enforcement will be executed by the Department of Education, but it will be up to the entire ecosystem and platform to police and enforce in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>3. What kind of burden on the Department is associated with enforcing terms and conditions related to APIs?</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Education will handle the first line of defense, in defining partner tiers and service composition that wraps all access to APis. The Department will also be the last mile of decision making and enforcement when violations occur. The platform should provide the data needed by the department to make decision as well as the enforcement necessary in the form of API key and access revocation, and banning apps, individuals and business from the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>4. How can the Department best ensure that API key holders follow all statutory and regulatory provisions of accessing federal student aid funds and data through use of third-party products?</strong></p>
<p>First line of define to ensure that API key holders follow all statutory and regulatory provision will be verification and validation of partners upon registration, applications going into production and availability in application galleries and other directories in which students discover apps.</p>
<p>Second line of defense will be reporting requirements and usage patterns of API consumers and their apps. If applications regular meet self-reporting requirements and real-time patterns establishing healthy or unhealthy behavior, they can retain their certification. If partners fail to comply they will be restricted from the API ecosystem.</p>
<p>Last line of defense is the end-users, the students and parents. All end-users need to be educated regarding the control they have, given reporting and ranking tools that allow them file complaints and rank the applications that are providing quality services.</p>
<p>As stated several times, enforcement will be a community effort, something the Department of Education has ultimate control of, but requires giving the community agency as well.</p>
<p><strong>5. How could prior consent from the student whom the data is about be provided for release of privacy- protected data to third party entities?</strong></p>
<p>An API with oAuth layer is this vehicle. Providing the access, logging all transactions, and holding all partners to a quality of service. All the mechanism are there, in a modern API implementation, the access just needs to be defined.</p>
<p><strong>6. How should a legal relationship between the Department and an API developer or any other interested party be structured?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer. I&rsquo;m not a policy person. Just can&rsquo;t contribute to this one.</p>
<p><strong>7. How would a legal relationship between the Department and an API developer or any other interested party affect the Department&rsquo;s current agreements with third-party vendors that operate and maintain the Department&rsquo;s existing systems?</strong></p>
<p>All of this will be defined in each partner tier, combined with appropriate service levels. With isolated API deployments, this should not affect currently implementations.</p>
<p>However a benefit of consistent API strategy is that existing vendors can access resources via APis, increasing the agility and flexibility of existing contracts. APIs are a single point of access, not just for the public, but 3rd party partners as well as internal access.  Everyone involved can participate and receive benefits of API consumption.</p>
<p><strong>8. What disclosures should be made available to students about what services are freely available in government domains versus those that could be offered at a cost by a third party?</strong></p>
<p>A partner tier for the API platform will define the different levels of partners. Trusted, verified and certified partners will get different recommendation levels and access than lesser known services, and applications from 3rd party with lesser trusted levels of access.</p>
<p><strong>9. If the Department were to use a third-party application to engage with the public on its behalf, how could the Department ensure that the Department follows the protocols of OMB Memorandum 10-23?</strong></p>
<p>Again, the partner tier determines the level of access to the partner and the protocols of all OMB memorandum call be built in. Requiring all data, APIs and code is open sourced, and uses appropriate API access tiers showing how data and resources are accessed and put to use.</p>
<p>API service management provides the reporting necessary to support government audits and regulations. Without this level of control on top of an API, this just isn&rsquo;t possible in a scalable way, that APIs plus web and mobile applications offer.</p>
<p><strong>G. Policy Issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What benefits to consumers or the Department would be realized by opening what is currently a free and single-point service (e.g., the FAFSA) to other entities, including those who may charge fees for freely-available services and processes?  What are the potential unintended consequences?</strong></p>
<p>Providing API access to government resources is an efficient and sensible use of taxpayers money, and reflect the mission of all agencies, not just the Department of Education. APIs introduce the agility and flexibility needed to deliver the next generation government application and services.</p>
<p>The economy in a digital age will require a real-time partnership between the public sector and the private sector, and APIs are the vehicle for this. Much like it has done for private sector companies like Amazon and Google, APIs will allow the government to create new services and products that serve constituents with the help of the private sector, while also stimulating job growth and other aspects of the economy.</p>
<p>APIs will not all be an up-side, each program and initiative will have its own policy problems and unintended consequences. One problem that plagues API initiatives is enough resources in the form of money and skilled works to make sure efforts are successful. Without the proper management, poorly executed APIs can open up huge security holes, introduce privacy concerns at a scale never imagined.</p>
<p>APIs need to be managed properly, with sensible real-time controls for keeping operations in check.</p>
<p><strong>2. How could the Department ensure that access to title IV, HEA student aid programs truly remains free, even amidst the potential development of third-party apps that may charge a fee for assistance in participating in free government programs, products, and services with or without providing legitimate value-added services?</strong></p>
<p>Partner Framework + Service Management = Quality of Service Across Platform</p>
<p><strong>3. What other policy concerns should the Department consider with regard to the potential development of APIs for higher education data and student aid processes at the Department?</strong></p>
<p>Not a policy or education expert, I will leave this to others to determine. Also something that should be built into API operations, and discovered on a program by program basis.</p>
<p><strong>4. How would APIs best interact with other systems already in use in student aid processes (e.g., within States)?</strong></p>
<p>The only way you will know is if you do it. How is the IRS-efile system helping with this, but it isn&rsquo;t even a perfect model to follow. We will never know the potential here until a platform is stood up, and resources are made available. All signs point to APIs opening up a huge amount of interoperability between not just states and the federal government, but also with cities and counties.</p>
<p><strong>5. How would Department APIs benefit or burden institutions participating in title IV, HEA programs?</strong></p>
<p>If APIs aren&rsquo;t given the proper resources to operate it can introduce security, privacy and support concerns that would not have been there before. A properly run API initiative will provide support, while an underfunded, undermanned initiative will just further burden institutions.</p>
<p><strong>6. While the Department continues to enhance and refine its own processes and products (e.g., through improvements to FAFSA or the IDR application process), how would third-party efforts using APIs complement or present challenges to these processes?</strong></p>
<p>These two things should not be separate. The internal efforts should be seen as just another partner layer within the API ecosystem. All future service and products developed internally within the Department of Education should use the same API infrastructure developed for partners and the public.</p>
<p>If APIs are not used internally, API efforts will always fail. APIs are not just about providing access to external resources, it is about opening up the Department to think about its resources in an external way that benefits the public, partners as well as within the government.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/29/the-swagger-specification/">The Swagger Specification</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><em>This post is an exact copy from the<a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec"> Swagger specification page</a>, on the Swagger Github project. As I was reviewing the latest Swagger 2.0 release, I read this descripton, and I really felt it caputred not ust the mission of Swagger, but spoke to the essence of API design. With this in mind I wanted to re-post, as part of my ongoing coverage of the API design space.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The goal of Swagger&trade; is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swager removes the guesswork in calling the service.</p>
<p>Use cases for machine-readable API interfaces include interactive documentation, code generation for documentation, client, and server, as well as automated test cases. Swagger-enabled APIs expose JSON files that correctly ahere to the Swagger Specification, documented in this repository. These files can either be produced and served statically, or be generated dynamically from your application.</p>
<p>Without going into a long history of interfaces to Web Services, this is not the first attempt to do so. We can learn from CORBA, WSDL and WADL. These specifications had good intentions but were limited by proprietary vendor-specific implementations, being bound to a specific programming language, and goals which were too open-ended. In the end, they failed to gain traction.</p>
<p>Swagger does not require you to rewrite your existing API. It does not require binding any software to a service--the service being described may not even be yours. It does, however, require the capabilities of the service be described in the structure of the Swagger Specification. Not all services can be described by Swagger--this specification is not intended to cover every possible use-case of a REST-ful API. Swagger does not define a specific development process such as design-first or code-first. It does facilitate either technique by establishing clear interactions with a REST API.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec">GitHub project is the starting point for Swagger</a>. Here you will find the information you need about the Swagger Specification, a simple static sample of what it looks like, and some general information regarding the project.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/23/why-apis-should-be-designed-by-linguists/">Why APIs Should Be Designed By Linguists</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/linguistics/why-apis-should-be-designed-by-linguists.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly evangelizing how APIs bring individuals and companyies out of their silos and stimulate conversations internally amongst distributed groups,co and externally with partners and the public.</p>
<p>During a federal government panel this Monday in Maryland, I was facilitating a discussion between NASA, GSA, the White House, with participation from Energy, FEMA and other agencies. It was mentioned several times that APIs were facilitating conversation beyond what just a data download does, in a way that changed culture, making APIs more about people than technology&mdash;something that is core to my mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>A well crafted API, with essential building blocks like interactive documentation, blogs, forums, active social media accounts, create valuable feedback loops that stimulate conversation around valuable API resources, and the applications and sites that put them use.</p>
<p>Then later this week, at Gluecon in Colorado, I saw a talk from Rebecca Standig (<a href="https://twitter.com/understandig">@understandig</a>), linguist and software engineer at <a href="https://keen.io/">Keen.io,</a> that blew my mind, taking the concept of APIs and communication to a whole new level. Rebecca connected the dots between linguistics, the need for linguists to have programming skills, and the potential when they design APIs. I&rsquo;m still processing everything she said, and told her I&rsquo;d like to work together more to tell stories about lingistics and APIs, so there will be more stories on this subject, but I had to share my initial thoughts while I was processing my Evernote from the talk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always working to craft meaningful stories in the API space, that will help people understand the potential of APIs. Throughout my evangelism I&rsquo;m encouraging companies, organizations and government agencies to employ APIs that will help stimulate conversation with employees, partners and the public. What Rebecca is proposing takes this to a whole new level for me, and opening up new possibilities for how we configure applications to communicate, in a way that is rooted in, and derived from our own understanding of how humans communicate.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">Restaurant Menus As Analogy For API Copyright</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-restaurant-menu.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the interesting conversations that came out of the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">APIStrat Un-Workshops at Gluecon</a> this week, was the exploration of the analogy of applying copyright to restaurant menus, and applying copyright to APIs. This type of conversations is why 3Scale and API Evangelist support these types of events.</p>
<p>When you Google the topic of restaurant menu API copyright, you get a wealth of contradictory answers that show the difficulty of applying copyright to menus. In practice you can put a copyright on your menu, and you could probably spend a lot of energy enforcing this if someone copies your menu. In reality, it will probably be pretty hard to win, unless your menu is exactly copied, and a fair use claim couldn&rsquo;t be enforced.</p>
<p>One interesting layer in this discussion, is the ubiquity of restaurant menus, and even the order, naming and organization of these menus. A phase I don&rsquo;t think APIs have reached, but will at some point. It is pretty difficult to argue that menus are essential to interoperability, meaning you can sit down at any restaurant and the menu contributes to you on boarding with the restaurant experience. Imagine if you had to know to ask for food via a chalkboard, or pick up some phone to call in what you wanted, without knowing any orderly way of understanding what a restaurant provided? Each restaurant would be different, and screw up the whole thing.</p>
<p>I would argue that bookmarks, images, video and other common API designs are just like hamburgers, steaks, and salads, when I explore this analogy. I think a lot of the confusion in the API copyright discussion is around the separation between an API and the API definition. The order and layout of restaurant menu is not the restaurant, just like the API design is not the API.</p>
<p>Could you imagine enforcing copyright on a american restaurant or diner menu layout? Maybe with fast food, which is not about delivering value, but maximizing profit. I think things are just newer in the API space vs the restaurant industry, but the analogy holds up. As a restaurant, your menu is not your restaurant. If someone copies your menu exactly, and opens up across the street, you may have a copyright case where fair use may be hard to defend, but in the end is their steak dinner the same as your steak dinner? Ultimately it comes down to your service, ingredients, presentation, price, ambiance and the other building blocks of a restaurant.</p>
<p>This same thought process can be applied to APIs. If you offer an image API, and someone copies your image API design exactly, the APIs are not exact copies. What you have behind the API design is the value, and represents your company&rsquo;s intellectual property, not the API design. Allowing your API definition to be copied will increase interoperability, and increase the chance developers will build clients, and other tooling that encourages interoperability&mdash;think about Amazon EC2 and S3. Does every copy of the API design deliver the exact same value as Amazon API? I think not.</p>
<p>In the end, if you don&rsquo;t see the separation between an API and its design, the benefits that an open API design delivers to not just an individual API ecosystem, but the overall API sector, you probably don&rsquo;t understand APIs well enough, and /or you are just concerned too much with monetization and control, and you really don&rsquo;t belong in the API space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing that we will end up with the fast food of APIs who really don't offer much value, but actively enforce their brand, which is tightly coupled with their API design. Even with this shit in the market, the rest of us can work hard to offer high quality APIs, which employ open API designs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-sad-face.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I run into enterprise folks at events, one of the common characteristics I notice, is they always tell me how much they read my blog. Yay! Many of these people have Twitter accounts, which follow me and I follow them, and they can usually reference specific topics or posts I've written&mdash;demonstrating they do indeed read.</p>
<p>Most of these people I'm aware of online, and I usually consider them fence sitters. They rarely retweet posts, or engage in conversations online, they just consume. I think this is fine, because not all everyone is suited for actively engaging in the social media world. What I do think is interesting is how interested they are in my work, and they let me know how my work reaches them, and reference specific topics and stories, but don&rsquo;t actually contribute to the conversation.</p>
<p>In my opinion this isn't individuals faults, this is enterprise culture. Businesses of this scale are not equipped to deliver value unless it is sanctioned and specifically part of the larger brand. The enterprise generates value, but only when in service of their business objectives. Generating open value for a community, even as small as a retweet, comment, or a response in blog post, is not in the DNA.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that businesses should generate just as much value as they consume. I&rsquo;m not stupid. I understand that capitalism is about extracting value and monetizing for shareholders, but can&rsquo;t help but think about what this existence is like for these individuals.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it very rewarding to contributing to communities, and the overall health of the API community, by contributing ideas, engaging in conversations, without the expectation that it will all result in revenue for <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>. Ultimately all of this effort comes back to me, and ensures I will be able to sustain my evangelism efforts, while also nourishing my own individual needs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/steve-apistrat-gluecon.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still gathering my thoughts from the deep technical conversations that occurred on Tuesday at the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">Gluecon APIStrat Un-Workshops</a>&nbsp;in Colorado. Before the official <a href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon festivities</a> kicked off, 3Scale and API Evangelist held a 5 hour un-workshop where approximately 70 API professionals gathered to discuss some of the most pressing topics in the API space.</p>
<p><strong>Internet of Things</strong><br /> One of the fastest growing areas of the API design and deployment, is in support of the Internet of things (IoT). During the IoT portion we had some interesting conversation around how APIs enable communication in Iot world, including some heated discussion about whether or not HTTP will scale and handle the fast growing Iot space.</p>
<p><strong>API Versioning</strong><br /> One of the hot topics proposed within the API design un-workshop was API versioning, which I thought would be a technical dive into versioning, but ended up being more of the human side of versioning, and communicating with your API consumers&mdash;clearly setting expectations around the how and why of API versioning.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Time</strong><br /> Dovetailing nicely with the Iot discussion, there was a very enlightening discussion around real-time, which covered one of the most fundamental issues of real-time&mdash;what is it? As with the API versioning discussion, the conversation took gave a nod to the human side of tech, acknowledging real-time was more about expectations of end-users and providers, than about technology.</p>
<p><strong>API Copyright</strong><br /> As expected the topic of API copyright was a major part of the discussion, not just at the APIStart Un-workshops, but also the wider Gluecon. A group of us walked through the legal case, where everything stands with API Commons, and how we can best take the offensive attack on the issue as a community, which includes educating more API providers, consumers and business owners.</p>
<p><strong>API Design &amp; Discovery</strong><br /> Emphasizing the importance of the release of <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> and <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>, and the conversations around <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, a portion of the API design workshop walked through the available API definition formats, and ultimately how APIs are discovered. The conversation went beyond classic API directories, and the newer approaches to search introduced by APIs.io, and discussed IDE integration for API discovery, as well as in the Internet of Things&mdash;again showing the overlap of all the areas of discussion at APIStrat&nbsp;Un-workshops.</p>
<p>The APIStrat Un-workshops were broken into two main groups, API design and Internet of things, while each of the un-workshops started with lightning talks from relative providers, the rest of the un-workshops were just open conversations around a table between all participants&mdash;making them very organic discussions.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t get a chance to participate at Gluecon, the conversations will continue online with blot posts from each of the group leaders in the discussions on API Evangelist, as well as at A<a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">PI Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, where we will be structuring sessions, panels and more workshops to keep the dialogue going.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-design.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In 2014 <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design</a> is exploding, proving to be one of the fastest growing areas of the API industry. For many years we&rsquo;ve talked purely about API management, but after consolidation in the space, and serious growth, the conversation has shifted.</p>
<p>The API conversation is moving upstream in the API lifecycle, focusing on designing, mocking, and collaborating around designing the best quality APIs possible, that will meet the needs of consumers--before any code is written and deployed.</p>
<p>A new wave of API design companies have zeroed in on supporting healthy API design practices by providing tools like <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a> which allow you to mock, design and collaborate early on in API design process. This new wave of tools and service is meant to foster the healthiest possible design practices, and is cultivating an expanding army of knowledgeable API designers, who demonstrate that API design can be more art than science and technology.</p>
<p>Amid this rapid expansion we are witnessing the potentially damaging effects of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/10/where-will-your-api-stand-in-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-debate/">Oracle v Google legal battle</a>, which is looking to inject unnecessary concerns around copyright into this blossoming API design sector. What will the copyright of APIs do to the API design process?</p>
<p>Will API design be as creative when you have to be concerned with designing unique interfaces vs creating with the best of breed API design patterns that are already available in the space? Will you design for quality of interfaces, the needs of your consumers and interoperability, the lifeblood of APIs, when you are focused on copyright and your API definitions become about legal protection and not access and innovation as they were intended?</p>
<p>If the precedent is set that copyright indeed applies to web APIs, I think that one of the chilling waves that will ripple through the industry will be extremely visible in the API design layer. API definitions are not one of the layers where control and monetization should be applied, allowing for more creative energy to exist,  rather than being all business&mdash;monetization should occur in the API or front-end applications. Period.</p>

<p>API discovery has not changed much since 2005, when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/30/history-of-apis--programmableweb/">John Musser launched ProgrammableWeb</a>, the API directory we've all come to know and love. In 2014 (9 years later), we have <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> and a handful of other API directory and discovery tools, but we have not made progress on truly being able to discover the best APIs possible, in a distributed, machine-readable way.</p>
<p>Steve Willmott of <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, and Kin Lane of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, are at it again, looking to provide a possible solution, that we are calling APIs.json&mdash;a machine readable listing of your APIs and supporting building blocks that lives in the root of your domain.</p>
<p>The objective of APIs.json is to help fix this problem by making it easy for people to signpost where the APIs on a given domain are and provide information on how they work. The format is simple and extensible and can be put into any web root domain for discovery.</p>
<p>We are just getting started, so make sure and get involved via the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json">Github repository </a>or via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apisjson">Google Group</a> we've setup to facilitate discussion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m torn on a matter that I face when reviewing APIs for companies. I get emails from people who want me to review their API implementation, and they state they want public developers to get excited about an API, but the program isn't fully available out in the open. Most often these APIs just have some sort of landing page, which is really just a press release, and email address of someone to contact to gain access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for people being able to have any grade of privacy for their APIs ranging from internal to completely public, but I just it difficult when API providers express interest in public developers learning about and potentially using an API, but don't provide any of the common building blocks developers are used to with a modern API. In my mind, if you are courting public developers, you should provide as much information as you possibly can, and manage access at the registration and API access levels.</p>
<p>In the end I guess I'm just exploring the best way to educate companies about the benefits of opening up, provide more information about their developer program, helping them understand that this how it is done with modern web APIs. With the right on-boarding, and API management strategy you can control who actually gets access to your API, and I can't think of why you would want to hide documentation, forums, code libraries, app showcases and other things for an API that is generally available to the public.</p>
<p>In 2014, if you are going to provide API resources to the public, you should expose as much of the developers area and as man of the supporting building block to the public as you can. At least talk through each one, and discuss the pros and cons of this being public. In a world where there are over 10K APIs available, it can be difficult to stand out, and the more public you are, the more chance developers will understand what you are offering.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m working to add yet another API example to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">my growing list of hypermedia APIs in the wild</a>, I can't help but think about the long evolution of hypermedia, and how it will eventually become part of the mainstream API consciousness.</p>
<p>I first started following the often heated discussions around hypermedia a couple years ago as leading API technologists began discussing this significant evolution in API design. Hypermedia has numerous benefits and features, but one you often hear in discussions is that if we use hypermedia we can stop designing custom clients that consume APIs.</p>
<p>The logic is that if every API call comes bundled with URLs for discovering and navigating the resources that are made available via an API, clients can just use this as a blueprint for any app to API interactions. This became a fairly large argument between hypermedia architects and hypermedia haters, something that I think turned a lot of people off to the concept, forcing us to stick with many of the bad habits we already knew.</p>
<p>As I review these new hypermedia APIs, few of them are perfect by any hypermedia measurement, but they use the sensible portions of hypermedia discovery and navigation to deliver a better API experience for developers. I don't think API providers are doing it because of the perfect hypermedia vision we've heard articulated in the past, they are borrowing the pieces that make sense to them and that meet their goals.</p>
<p>Someday we may achieve a world where API clients aren't custom, with every application automatically knowing how to discover, interact, and navigate any API resource it will need. However I think in the currently reality, we will see hypermedia being adopted because it just makes sense as a next step for sensible API design, and this is how we should communicate it to curious API designers, looking to understand exactly what is this concept called hypermedia.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a significant growth in the number of APIs in government, but to date most of these APIs are read-only, meaning you can just retrieve content or data from these APIs, not actually add, update or delete any of the resources made available via these APis.</p>
<p>I've written about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/25/a-rare-beast-in-government-the-write-api/">lack of write APIs in government before</a>, trying to kickstart the conversation amongst existing API advocates at various agencies, and <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/write_apis-notes.html">now 18F, the elite tech group at the GSA is doing the same</a>. 18F has a page dedicated to the conversation around write APIs in government, with eight active examples of write APIs, nine potential examples, and two that are "under consideration".</p>
<p>What 18F is doing, is a key part of the process that will demonstrate to existing API owners at government agencies, that write APIs are possible, by showcasing the existing implementations, as well as others that are under development. Agencies need clear examples to follow, reassuring them that this is possible in government, giving them potential mentors, and in some cases incentivize agencies by making them feel they are behind the curve, and missing out on opportunities to lead when serving their constituents.</p>
<p>The importance thate government agencies have read / write APIs goes beyond the obvious benefits around content and data being more complete and up to date--a two way street, when it comes to API operations requires a more dedicated approach, bringing agencies closer to both private and public sector partners who will be consuming and contributing to the API(s). This process reduces the chance an API will be launched and forgotten about, which really does nobody any good, and contributes to giving APIs in government a bad name.</p>
<p>If you work at a federal agency, or are a contractor working on APIs within government, make sure and <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/write_apis-notes.html">reach out to 18F</a> and see how you can be part of this significant change in how federal government operates. For all of this API stuff to work, APIs in government must be a two way street.</p>

<p>API <a href="https://zapier.com">interoperability and reciprocity provider Zapier</a> is looking to get everyone up to speed on the world of APIs, by providing an <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/apis/">introduction to APIs</a> that is meant for both developers who are new to APIs, and easy enough for non-developers to follow.</p>
<p>To help get people up to speed on APIs, Zapier&rsquo;s introduction has eight chapters covering the big picture:</p>

<li>Chapter 6: API Design</li>
<li>Chapter 7: Real-Time Communication</li>
<li>Chapter 8: Implementation</li>

<p>It is good to see providers like Zapier develop an introductory course for people to learn about APIs. It is in Zapier&rsquo;s interest to help get people up to speed&mdash;the more folks who understand that APIs exist, the more chance they will use Zapier as the platform they depend on to orchestrate their lives in the cloud.</p>
<p>Zapier&rsquo;s move reflects my original vision behind API Evangelist, and my belief that everyone should understand APIs, and I mean everyone! <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/api-and-oauth-literacy-is-as-important-as-financial-literacy-in-the-api-economy/">Much like personal finance, not everyone needs to understand the inner workings of APIs, but every individual should understand they exist</a>, and how they can use services like Zapier to take control of our digital self.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/oauth-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I attended a two day API specification session between major California utilities, <a href="https://www.sce.com">Southern California Edison</a> (SCE), <a href="http://www.sdge.com/">San Diego Gas &amp; Electric</a> (SDG&amp;E), and <a href="http://www.pge.com/">Pacific Gas and Electric</a> (PG&amp;E), that was organized by Hypertek Inc. for <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST), that is looking to push forward the <a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/">Green Button data</a> and API agenda of the White House and Department of Energy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/">Green Button API and open data model already exists</a>, but the current hurdle for the initiative is to get leading utilities to agree to specific implementation definitions that serve their customers, so it can be ratified as a standard. This entire two day session was dedicated to walking through line by line, and establish the oAuth scope that each of the three utility companies would implementing when providing Green Button data via the API to 3rd party developers, who are building solutions for utility customers.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild, would be if a utility customer wanted to get a quote for a rooftop solar installation, the installer could use a software solution that was developed by a 3rd party vendor, that pulls that customers energy usage via the Green Button API, and generate a precise quote for the number of solar panels they&rsquo;d need to cover their energy usage. Now this is just one example of how energy data could be used, but a very powerful and relevant one in 2014, that give customers access and control over their data.</p>
<p>Before we even get there, the Green Button API definition, data model, and oAuth scope has to be finalized with utility providers, before it can be submitted as a standard&mdash;with the final oAuth scope being what will be agreed to by each 3rd party developer that integrates with each utility's Green Button API. This oAuth scope sets the tone for the conversation that 3rd party software providers, and vendors can ultimately have with utility customers around their private utility data.</p>
<p>In my opinion this is one potential model for how industry operations will be negotiated in the future. While not all API definitions, data models and oAuth scopes will be defined by the government then negotiated with industries, but oAuth will be where this scope is negotiated between industry leaders and governments, no matter which side leads the conversation. Governments and industries working together to define API standards is nothing new, but what is new, is the presence of the oAuth layer which gives end-users, and citizens an active role. 3rd party developers and end-users do not get a place in the negotiations, but they do when it comes to putting valuable industry data to use in new ways--or not, which will flow back upstream and influence future iterations of APIs, data models and oAuth scope.</p>
<p>This introduction of the oAuth layer in how industries operate, potentially coupled with the access and innovation that can occur via API platforms when they are executed in alignment with modern API implementations, will change how industries grow and ultimately how power flows (pun intended). This evolution in how the public and private sector partner will not always positive by default, I&rsquo;m not an API solutionist in that I believe APIs bless everything as good, but with the right players at the table, a little sunlight and transparency in the process, and a feedback loop that includes 3rd party developers and end-users, we might be able to implement meaningful change across many different industries around the globe.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-handshake.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is a laundry list of problems with the current state of terms of service, affectionality called TOS--those legal documents we all agree to as part of our usage of online services, and are defining relationships between API providers and their consumers. API Voice is dedicated to exploring this, and other building blocks that make up the politics of APIs, an area you will see increased coverage of in 2014.</p>
<p>As I continue to develop a better understanding of how API terms of service influence the API economy, I can't help but think one of the fundamental flaws of API terms of use is that there is no room for negotiation. Earlier this month I <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/01/would-you-pay-for-alternate-options-for-an-api-terms-of-service/">explored the concept of being able to pay for alternate options within a terms of service</a>, as part of my ongoing journey towards a machine readable TOS.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that to fully realize the API economy as many of us technologists see it, the terms of service have to be machine readable, allowing for seamless integration into the other political building blocks like privacy policies, service level agreements, partner access tiers, and pricing. If you think about it, current API terms of service reflect the command and control governance style of SOA, not the flexible, agile and innovative approach that APIs are often known for.</p>
<p>Why aren't API terms of service negotiable? Well they are, it just isn't built into the existing API platform. Many API ecosystem allow for circumventing and negotiating at the terms of service level behind closed doors, with partners, and API consumers who share the same investors, it just isn't a conversation that occurs out in the open. This approach reflects legacy ways of doing business, where if you are in the know, have the right connections, you can negotiate, and not the new API driven approach that will allow the API economy to scale as required.</p>
<p>The ability for API consumers to negotiate the terms of service isn't something that we can just roll out overnight, it is something we have to evolve towards over time. I&rsquo;m hoping to help facilitate this evolution, through brainstorming, stories and conversations around the potential of machine readable terms of service, here on API Voice over the next couple of years.</p>

<p>The time has come for one of my favorite events in the tech space&mdash;<a href="http://www.gluecon.com/2014/">Gluecon</a>. If you have never been to Gluecon or Defrag, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/11/how-to-defrag-your-brain-and-tech-career-in-november/">read some of my previous posts about just how different the event is</a>. Gluecon has brought together tech leaders, who have helped define the API space for the last six years, to a small resort in Colorado, creating an environment for conversation I have not experienced anywhere else.</p>
<p>This year Gluecon is exceptionally special for me, because 3Scale and API Evangelist are doing a special first day of un-workshop discussions on API design and the Internet of Things and Realtime, continuing the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> conversation. You can find all the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">details over at the APIStrat site,</a> and even register and be part of the conversation.</p>
<p>The topic of API design has dominated my blog traffic, with every story I do on the subject filling the top 10 most visited posts for the last 3 months. The conversation of how to design APIs has exploded, with the introduction of languages and tooling from Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML, and as we realize that API design is more art than science&mdash;something that developers and business leaders should all be part of. The first Gluecon / APIStrat un-workshop is dedicated to this fast growing area of the API sector.</p>
<p>In 2014 you can&rsquo;t have a conversation about APIs without discussing the next wave of Internet enabled devices&mdash;dubbed Internet of Things (Iot). We are seeing a new breed of APIs, and frameworks emerge that don&rsquo;t just connect devices to the Internet, but also facilitate realtime communications between devices and the cloud&mdash;merging realtime and Iot.  The second Gluecon / APIStrat un-workshop is bringing together a wide range of practitioners to discuss what is next for APIs in the context of realtime IoT.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t too late to get your tickets to Gluecon and <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">register for the APIStrat un-workshops</a>. Tickets to Denver are pretty inexpensive from most places in the country, even at this late date. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the conversations that I&rsquo;ll have at Gluecon, both in the sessions, the hallway in-between, and the taproom late into the night--I will see you there!</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/moc-2014/2014-moc-management-of-change.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was invited to <a href="https://actiac.org/MOC2014">moderate a workshop panel in Maryland next week at the The American Council for Technology (ACT) - Industry Advisory Council (IAC) Management of Change 2014 event</a>. If you arenat familiar with ACT-IAC, they are a non-profit, public-private partnership dedicated to improving government through the application of information technology--with the event bringing government leaders together, and discussing open data, open source, and APIs.</p>
<p>The workshop is described as:</p>
<blockquote><em>Open Data isn&rsquo;t just data sets. It&rsquo;s APIs, it&rsquo;s open source and, most importantly &mdash; it&rsquo;s people. Working within these new concepts and methods requires a change in culture by our programs, executives, and contracting offices. In order to execute on providing open source to the public, we need new skills for the workforce that let us contract appropriately, and learn how to design our systems from the ground up with APIs and open source in mind.</em></blockquote>
<p>I will be leading the discussion between a panel of  X subject matter experts:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Kevin Youel-Page</strong> - Assistant Commissioner, Integrated Award Environment, General Services Administration</li>
<li><strong>Dan Gahafer</strong> - Forge.mil Program Manager, Defense Information Systems Agency</li>
<li><strong>Leigh Heyman</strong> - Director of New Media Technologies, the White House</li>
<li><strong>Dan Lockney</strong> &ndash; Technology Transfer Program Executive, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration</li>
<li><strong>Pamela Wise-Martinez</strong> - Senior Strategic Enterprise Architect, Office of the Director of National Intelligence</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m honored to have been invited to help lead the discussion, which is in alignment with my mission to bring awareness of the power of APIs amongst government leaders. I&rsquo;m looking forward to what I, and the rest of the event, can learn from these government leaders regarding how they are using open data, open source software, and APIs to effect change within their agencies.</p>
<p>The fact that we are having conversations like this at the highest levels of government in 2014, after four years of API evangelism, makes me hopeful that we are making progress, in not just changing how we do business, or how the government operates, but also how the private and public sector both work together in the emerging API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/priorities/university-of-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had too many scribbles in my Evernote about work I&rsquo;m doing for <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/index.html">APIs in higher education</a>, so I decided I need to publish as a story, which hopefully will help me organize my thoughts, figure out my next moves, and share what I&rsquo;m doing to a couple of folks who asked what I&rsquo;m up to in this area.</p>
<p><strong>APIs In Higher Education Institutions</strong><br /> To keep API Evangelist operating I have some very supportive partners who invest in my research, and one of the areas <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>&nbsp;and I work together on is understanding how APIs are currently being used in higher education. As part of my recent research I went back through the <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/index.html">universities I track on</a> who have APIs, to see whats changed, and I stumbled upon the fact that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/23/browsing-the-261-apis-at-brigham-young-university/">BYU&rsquo;s API inventory has grown to a mind blowing 261 APIs</a>, covering almost all aspects of university operations.</p>
<p>I will be continuing this research on what BYU is up to, but also the 10 other institutions I&rsquo;m tracking on, and as I do with other areas of the API space, try to identify some of the common building blocks universities are employing&mdash;hoping to create a blueprint that other institutions can follow.  You can find all this research, kindly supported by <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>, up on the <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/index.html">Github repository designated for the project</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dept of Education and FAFSA API</strong><br />Beyond the general use of APIs by universities, last November I started working on a <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">prototype of an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA form</a>, looking to jump start a conversation at the Department of Education around APIs. It worked, and in January they announced that they would looking to get feedback on what an API for FAFSA would look like.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes I was contacted to provide a proposal for a FAFSA API, hoping to chase after some budget that could fund such a project. I worked for two days on a proposal, submitted, but haven&rsquo;t heard anything more about what happened to that budget chase.</p>
<p>Then in April, the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/04/how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">Department of Education asked the public to weigh in on an RFI around APIs</a> not just for FAFSA, but at the Department of Education in general. I need another week or so to gather up all of my work from the last six months around APIs in higher education, and the Department of Education, then probably write another story or two and respond to the RFI before the June deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Reclaim Your Domain</strong><br /> I went down to Atlanta to participate in a talk about the domain of one&rsquo;s own program at Emory University, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/exploring-the-domain-universe-at-emory-university/">you can read more about it in an earlier pos</a>t. I&rsquo;m feeling a seismic shift in my world, and telling stories about using APIs to reclaim your content and data, is something I will be talking about a lot more. What is really fascinating for me is that the inspiration for doing this work to help individuals better understand and control their online world is coming out of leading higher education institutions like MIT, University of Mary Washington and Emory. You can follow <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/">my personal reclaim project on Github</a> for real-time updates in this area of my work.</p>
<p><strong>Data &amp; Analytics MOOC At UT Arlington</strong><br /> In addition to Atlanta, I was i<a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/apis-edx-tableau-google-at-ut-arlington/">n Arlington TX talking about the role APIs could play in a data and analytics MOOC at UT Arlington</a>. While the goal was to understand how students can use APIs to better explore data &amp; analytics, I left thinking about APIs for edX, and how we can develop a single course or group landing page that allows teachers and students to aggregate profiles and content using APIs and oAuth&mdash;a project I will be working on more using <a href="https://oauth.io/">oAuth.io</a>.</p>
<p><strong>APIs and edX</strong><br /> While in Texas I had the pleasure of hanging out with the <a href="https://www.edx.org/how-it-works">folks from edX</a>, the online course platform that offers interactive online classes and MOOCs from MITx, HarvardX, BerkeleyX, UTx and other universities, and of course we got talking APIs. An API is in their roadmap, but definitely something I would like to explore more as well here on the blog. I can&rsquo;t imagine any online learning solution, between universities being successful in 2014 without an API! ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Ok, Now What's Next?</strong><br /> I think that is it. I just needed to write all that down, after a crazy couple of weeks. Now it is easier to see the main action items:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Respond to Department of Education RFI</li>
<li>Create v1 of a APIs in higher education blueprint</li>
<li>Push forward with my personal Reclaim Your Domain</li>
<li>Develop class or group profile and content aggregation page that runs on Github using oAuth.io</li>
<li>Think about what an API program would look like for edX</li>
<li>Pull together a list of good APIs that could be used in a data &amp; analytics course</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives me six clear action items to move forward with, out of this hectic slice of my API research pie&mdash;higher education. I think if I can push forward with this chunk of work I can further kickstart the conversation around healthy API usage across higher education.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m biased, because of my proximity to <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>, but I&rsquo;m hoping that the university is where we can make the biggest impact in educating people about the opportunities and the dangers of APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-voice/oraclevgoogle/oraclevgoogle.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wanted to comment on the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-voice/oraclevgoogle/223105653-Oracle-Google-Java-Appeal-Decision.pdf" target="_blank">response yesterday in the Oracle v. Google case being played out in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a>. This appeal is important to me because it will not just set the tone for how APIs are designed, deployed and managed, but also because <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/02/help-eff-make-case-for-no-copryight-on-apis/">I worked with the EFF to craft the Amicus Brief</a>, and <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google/amici">signed on as one of the computer scientists</a> in opposition of API copyright--making the response a huge blow to me personally.</p>
<p>The case is far from settled, so I will refrain from using hyperbole when I describe the situation, but will echo the EFF&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dangerous-ruling-oracle-v-google-federal-circuit-reverses-sensible-lower-court">the implications of this decision are significant, and dangerous</a>&rdquo;.  For me, it doesn&rsquo;t change the conversation, it just re-enforces what I already believe, and hopefully it will do the same amongst API providers across the space.</p>
<p>Steve Willmott of <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and I read the writing on the wall when we started <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> last year, that a political line was being drawn by the Oracle v Google appeal, and would not just continue to play out in the courts, but also within the heart of the API economy, and that we needed to collectively stand up and push back--API Commons is a back-burn strategy for the wildfire that Oracle has set.</p>
<p>API Commons basically declares that API definitions are ultimately copyrightable or licensable as code, depending on your viewpoint, all you do is hang your definition in the API Commons, and provide a reference to the license that matters to you, whether it <a href="https://twitter.com/mamund/status/464907589294116865">licensed as content (CC) or software (FSF)</a>&nbsp;is your call. Giving every API provider a torch, and the ability to participate in setting the back-burn, taking a stance in the Oracle v Google wildfire that has been set by Oracle, that could potentially burn down all of our collective resources.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Oracle v Google is just one of many battles that will occur within this new, virtual layer of our economy, and will ultimately define whether a company's approach to delivering digital services is more about governance and monetization (SOA), or about access and innovation (API)&mdash;exposing heart of the SOA v API debate.</p>
<p>Changing my metaphor from forest fire being set by Oracle, to seeing the API economy as an engine&mdash;Oracle is replacing the engine oil with glue, and then enabling any company to sell you a solvent + oil to make it better. If the API economy is our baby, Oracle is introducing smoke and alcohol into the womb, which will stunt the growth of the space, and impact not just the rest of us, but also stupidly Oracle&rsquo;s own revenue. Ok I lied, I got all fired up and shifted into hyperbolic gear! ;-) Vrooom!!</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time trying to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/26/what-can-the-enterprise-learn-from-the-open-api-space/">help the enterprise understand what makes APIs work versus their latest SOA approach</a>, and often times I find explaining this difference is akin to teaching dark matter and physics, or the concept of evolution to evangelical christians in rural america. The enterprise is blind to many of the elements that make APIs work, with all the vital elements lost in the quest for profit and control within the industries they operate in.</p>
<p>Generating a machine readable definition of your API, with accompanying licensing model, is just <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">going to be one more lever we will have to adjust when dialing in the political settings for our APIs</a>, which sucks big-time, but ultimately is doable with the leadership demonstrated by API providers across startups, SMS, enterprise, government, and non governmental organizations when they submit their API definitions to the API Commons, accompanied with a liberal or publicly available license.</p>
<p>As new API discovery models emerge, and <a href="http://api500.com/">API ratings models evolve</a>, the license of your API definition will set the tone for the conversation you have with your API consumers. As the usage of machine readable API definitions grows, and API discovery and rating becomes automated, your API licensing will be the difference in whether or not your API even shows up in a search result, or not.</p>
<p>You will have to excuse my brief rant, in response to the Oracle v Google appeal. I currently have the flu after being in Germany for API Days Berlin, and finding it difficult to formulate a coherent, lengthy response. Much like the overall debate, I think I will have to break the response from the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit down, publish as bite-size chunks that will stimulate discussion via my <a href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a> blog over time, and evolve my own understanding--refining my arguments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discussion around API copyright is far from over. I don&rsquo;t have much hope for the results of the fair use discussion, that will continue as part of the case, but I do have hope when it comes to API providers stepping up to take a stance on the subject. Additionally, Oracle can count on me being the "Johnny Fucking Appleseed of API Definitions", convincing companies, organizations and governments of all sizes to publish their API definitions to the commons. Then also being as prolific in designing and defining the next generation of APIs ahead of the enterprise, as I am in writing on my blog(s), making sure that the best API design patterns are openly licensed and put into the commons for everyone to use--before your slow, bloated enteprise can even understand what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>Game on! Fuck you Oracle!</p>

As I do with many stories, I will scrub the names of those involved, because there is no reason to blame a single company, this is a lesson any large entity can learn from&mdash;for this story, we&rsquo;ll just call them Acme Inc.</p>
<p>Acme Inc. contacted me a couple weeks ago, stating they were looking to do some research into the API space, and have been following my work for some time. After a few emails we made time to get on the phone and talk about what each of us were up to.</p>
<p>We spent about an hour, where I gave my history, why I do API Evangelist, and how I go about generating short form, and long form content as part of my research across the API space. Acme Inc. shared their interest in exploring how APIs could be applied to a couple of business sectors, and were looking to generate white paper(s) that they could distribute internally, and amongst partners.</p>
<p>Acme was extremely vague on details, and I understand that not everyone can be as open as me, especially when you work at a big company. We ended the call, agreeing that we&rsquo;d explore what a potential partnership might look like, around research projects, but they would need me to sign an NDA first&mdash;no problem.</p>
<p>I received an NDA via email a couple days later, as I was on my way to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/01/business-of-internal-apis-at-ibm-impact-last-tuesday/">IBM Impact in Las Vegas</a>, and while I was busy in Las Vegas I received an a reminder to please sign the agreement. When I was done in Las Vegas, on my way to  <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/apis-edx-tableau-google-at-ut-arlington/">Texas for another engagement</a>, I signed the NDA, printed a PDF and sent it back.  A few days later, as I was leaving Texas, on my way home to LA for about 8 hours, before <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/01/i-will-be-speaking-at-apidays-in-berlin-next-week/">I left to Berlin</a>, I received another email requesting that I sign a second NDA, this time using a digital signature solution.</p>
<p>At this point my inbox was already out of control, and I boarded the 12 hour flight Berlin, and proceeded to gear up for <a href="http://berlin.apidays.io/">APIDays Berlin</a>. After a day in Berlin where I finished my talk (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">which I rewrote onsite to better suit the local audience</a>), and two days of the amazing interactions at API Days Berlin, I finally made it back into my inbox.</p>
<p>This time I found another reminder, to sign the digital copy of NDA. At this point, I&rsquo;ve received 2 separate NDAs, and two reminders to please sign the NDA--ith no knowledge of what the ideas are. Maybe these are ideas or research I&rsquo;m already working on? Who the fuck knows!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLFO4ZV0i4&amp;feature=kp"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/acme/dont-give-fuck.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just sent an email to my Acme representative, stating that I will regretfully decline the partnership, and summarized my feelings. Acme thanked me.</p>
<p>With this response, I probably blew off thousands of dollars in revenue, and who knows what else. In the end I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. What I do is not about revenue or showcasing partnerships with global companies. It is about ideas, research and my storytelling, whether it is short form (blog) or longer form (whtie papers), or in person, and always in a way that provides value to the community.</p>
<p>I understand that a large entity cannot operate like I do--I&rsquo;m not naive. However when it comes to the world of APIs, if you want to play, you have to learn to open up, and at least be able to have conversations without the need for an NDA. People in the enterprise might fuck you over at every turn, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but I do not.</span> You can ask me to keep something private, and I will&mdash;end of story.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental difference between APIs and SOA that so many enterprise practitioners do not understand. As an individual I am so much happier being able to openly share my ideas, stories, code, and other resources publicly, in a way that is openly licensed, and most importantly&mdash;accessible by everyone. I strongly feel that there is a lot for the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/26/what-can-the-enterprise-learn-from-the-open-api-space/">enterprise to learn from the world of open APIs</a>, which isn&rsquo;t just about technology.  However, I&rsquo;m gambling that most of them will never give a flying fuck.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/green-button/green-button.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most meaningful API projects I work on with the US government is the <a href="http://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/">Green Button AP</a>I, which provides access to energy data for US consumers across the country.  First, what is the Green Button API? The Green Button builds on top of the Green Button data initiative which is:</p>
<blockquote><em>...an industry-led effort that responds to a White House call-to-action: provide electricity customers with easy access to their energy usage data in a consumer-friendly and computer-friendly format via a "Green Button" on electric utilities' website.</em></blockquote>
<p>Which Todd Park, Assistant to the President and U.S. Chief Technology Officer states:</p>
<blockquote><em>Giving residential and commercial customers secure access to their own energy data in a standard, easy-to-understand format will help them visualize their energy use and identify opportunities to save money. At the same time, Green Button is spurring the development of new online tools and services that add value to this information, creating an innovative new domain for entrepreneurship and job creation.</em></blockquote>
<p>The Green Button API delivers flexible access to Energy Usage Information through a set of RESTful interfaces, providing access any consumers Green Button data. The Green Button API is being designed by <a href="https://www.energyos.org/">EnergyOS</a>, providing a solution that any utility can download and run to mediate access between their retail energy customers, and 3rd parties who will provide energy data driven services to them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited to announce that the Green Button API definition has been added to the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>. The Green Button API represents why 3Scale and API Evangelist launched API Commons, to provide a place where we can hang the most important, and meaningful API interfaces, and underlying data models, to encourage re-use.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/API/api-docs">Swagger specification for the Green Button API on Github</a>, complete with <a href="http://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/API/">interactive documentation</a> and other resources. The project is a work in progress, with the final specification still being hammered out by EnergyOS and utilities across the country, but the API is fully functional, and since it is on Github&mdash;the <a href="https://github.com/energyos/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/issues">entire project is open for comment</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-walking-path.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I heard an interesting statement this week at <a href="http://berlin.apidays.io/">APIDays Berlin</a> that I&rsquo;ve heard before, "API document is an bug not a feature". The logic behind this is that if you design a proper API, using proven REST and hypermedia patterns, you shouldn&rsquo;t need documentation.</p>
<p>While this is true, and I agree with 100%, it ignores the vital process of getting the average person up to speed--simply stating that what many of us are actively doing, and what we currently know is a bug. I work with any folks who barely know what an API is, or what JSON is, yet have a lot of influence and control over whether some very important APIs exist, or not!</p>
<p>I know that these API experts are speaking to the correct path that we should be taking, yet there is very little consideration to understanding where most folks are on the path, and how many forks there are in the road, before we get to where we need to be.</p>
<p>To help those understand the path, think of the numerous APIs in the past with no documentation, then all of a sudden static API documentation was the norm, and now in 2014, interactive documentation has become commonplace.</p>
<p>Alongside this journey the debate around REST, and recently hypermedia has been going on, with only recently getting to a place where healthy patterns are being used across many APIs, not just a handful of demos.</p>
<p>Understanding this will help you see the path that we are on. A path that we can only move down at a certain speed, because it takes careful education and planning to move not just developers, but business leaders down. Maybe eventually the path will be a highway, and at some point a freeway that we can get more people down, but for now it takes a lot of planning to shepherding to move everyone along.</p>
<p>I fully respect those that wish to exclusively remain in the academic discussion of API design and deployment. As this is a layer of the space that I follow very closely and use to educate myself, and pull valuable ideas and information from, while telling stories on my blog.</p>
<p>However, my goal with this post is to help recruit the next generation of evangelists, who closely follow the leading edge of the API sector and where we should be going, but also want to help understand how to build a roadmap to help get the rest of the world, safely down the path to where we should be, with storytelling that can reach the masses.</p>

<p>We live in a very exciting time, one where the resources we need to build meaningful websites and applications, that have the opportunity to impact how we do business, and potentially make change in how the world around us, is rapidly expanding. Once upon a time, many of these digital resources took millions of dollars of investment to deliver, if they were available at all. Now, with the introduction of web APIs, many valuable resources are available in a self-service, pay as you go manner, allowing anyone to integrate these valuable resources their own business or personal worlds.</p>
<h3>History of APIs</h3>
<p>Over the last 14 years of the Internet, companies have been using a new approach to APIs, built on the same technology that drives the web&mdash;HTTP.  Web APIs are not a new, proprietary way of building applications on the Internet, but a way of delivering the vital resources web and mobile applications need, side by side with the same websites that humans consume&mdash;except APIs are raw data, minus the visuals that a human would require, enabling developers to deliver exactly the experience that end users will need.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering On Original Visions of Digital Commerce</strong><br /> This low cost approach to deliver resources on the web has been pioneered by tech giants like SalesForce in delivering the next generation of customer relationship management, and sales in the clouds. We&rsquo;ve also seen web APIs transform world of ecommerce from tech giants like Amazon, and shift auctions online from eBay. The payments needed to transact in this new world of commerce also emerged via APIs from Paypal, and a newer generation of payment API providers like Stripe.</p>
<p><strong>A Social Web</strong><br /> The distributed effect of web APIs allowed for the evolution of a new type of online interaction, dubbed &ldquo;social&rdquo;. Early innovators applied web APIs to digital media such as photos from Flickr, and then quickly was applied to the sharing of Internet links or bookmarks by Delicious. Once these pioneers paved the way, a next generation of social platforms were born with the emergence of Twitter and Facebook. All of these social platforms employed web APIs as the driver for all social interactions via the web, that contributed to their growth and user adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Migrating Compute Into The Cloud</strong><br /> After their success with commerce APIs, Amazon internalize the deployment of APIs in a way that gave birth to how we deploy and scale compute and storage, forever changing how develop applications with the introduction of Amazon Web Services. Amazon started with a dead simple storage API called Amazon S3, then shortly after rolled out the ability to deploy server instances in the cloud via web APIs with Amazon EC2&mdash;providing two of the essential building blocks for building apps online.</p>
<p><strong>Geo-locating In A Digital World</strong><br /> As we were getting our bearings in this new digital world we created for ourselves, the search pioneer Google began innovating in the world of online mapping. Shortly after noticing that users were hacking and extending the JavaScript driven Google Maps, they began designing a web API that would meet the needs of the web and the soon to emerge world of mobile apps&mdash;giving everyone the first in a long line of essential API driven Geo resources we would need to make the web mobile.</p>
<p><strong>Messaging For The Cloud</strong><br /> As the web began its collision with the emerging world of mobile devices, a new breed of API driven messaging resources emerged, first around SMS and voice from Twilio, then evolving standard messaging formats like email, from SendGrid. However it doesn&rsquo;t stop with just extending existing messaging standards via APIs, companies like Context.io are completely redefining how we approach traditional email messaging with their API driven messaging solutions.</p>
<h3>What Makes Web APIs So Appealing?</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-shipping-containers.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The wealth of individual resources has made the world of APIs very appealing to developers, but this approach to deploying very modular, web-based resources was also proven valuable to companies when exposing their own resources, for internal development, extending access to partners, and in some cases making available to the general public and open developers.</p>
<p><strong>Granular Resources</strong><br /> With web APIs you are taking the minimum viable portion of a resource and making available over the Internet. A contact, an image, or any other piece of data, content or programmatic resource, and make it securely accessible on the Internet. This modular, granular approach to defining and providing access to resources allows for the remix, and reuse of resources in a very efficient way across all possible systems, web or mobile applications, and increasingly any Internet connected object.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed Resources</strong><br /> Since web APIs are built using HTTP, the underlying infrastructure of the Internet, they are distributed in nature, and globally scalable&mdash;just like the web. This approach to delivering APIs allow for resources to be accessed internally by systems and applications, across the globe by external groups and partners--any potential consumer with Internet access. Defining digital assets as APIs allow for distributed access, by existing consumers, while ensuring they are immediately available to any future need that may arise.</p>
<p><strong>Agility and Nimbleness</strong><br /> With digital assets defined in such a granular, distributed manner, a new agility begins to emerge. Companies who once took months or years to expose data and content sources, and securely provide access, can now open up access potentially in real-time to company and organization wide resources. APIs are all about access and re-use, allowing companies to save time and money when integrating existing assets into web and mobile apps at speeds they never could imagine before.</p>
<p><strong>Research, Development, And Innovation</strong><br /> With valuable assets securely available on the Internet, all resources are available for research and development, allowing for new types of innovation to occur. APIs are external by nature, establishing an R&amp;D lab of sorts, for companies to experiment with new types of product and services, in an environment that encourages outside participation, establishing a rich environment for new ideas to flourish.</p>
<h3>What Have We Learned?</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-question-mark.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Challenging the top down planning approaches of earlier API movements like SOA, web APIs have produced some valuable lessons in deploying application infrastructure that focuses on simplicity, rapid iterations, and bottom-up, grassroots evolution of how a service oriented architecture is designed, deployed, managed and evolved.  Studying the approaches from API pioneers, as well as the current waves of public API deployments provide numerous lessons that other companies, organizations, and government agencies can learn from. Let&rsquo;s walk through some of the biggest lessons from the world of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Technology of APIs</strong><br /> Over the last 14 years suite of technological approaches to designing, deploying and operating APIs have won out, not just through standards, but through organic experimentation, proven through success. Modern web APIs start with pragmatic REST, which uses HTTP and follows Roy Fielding's recommendations for making the web not just consumable, but also programmable. To support API interaction, a new data exchange format has emerged&mdash;JSON is the lightweight, preferred data interaction format for API consumers. Finally, to secure APIs, a standard called oAuth has emerged handling not just the identity of application users, but handles the authorization and access of underling resources available via an API.</p>
<p><strong>Business of APIs</strong><br /> The success of web APIs is only partially a technical thing, a large part of web APIs success is driven from their business approaches. We&rsquo;ve learned that simple, clean and centralized consumer portals, with complete documentation, and supporting code are essential to on-boarding, and helping consumer achieve a successful integration. API providers have also established sophisticated communication strategies for their API operations including blogs, active Twitter and other social media accounts, and community forums within their ecosystem and outside them on existing developer communities like Stack Overflow. All of these supporting business elements help ensure the technical operations of an API are known and supported, providing what is needed for consumers to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>Politics of APIs</strong><br /> APIs are not inherently good, bad or neutral when it comes to company operations, partnerships and public access. There are several aspects of the political side of APIs that ensure consumer success, starting but not limited to sensible, flexible terms of service that protect a company's assets, but also allow developers to innovate. API providers throttle access to valuable resources by establishing rate limits, multiple pricing levels, and access tiers for API consumers, allowing for the generation of revenue, but in a way that encourages healthy consumption by integrated applications. The security and reliability of an API also plays a significant role in an APIs overall image, on-boarding process, and access to a platforms API resources. All of these elements provide the political grease that makes API integrations flow, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">many different knobs and levers that can be pulled, loosened, or tightened for the delivering optimal results</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API Design</strong><br /> In the last couple years, leading API practitioners have demonstrated that API design is more art than science. Good API design isn't always about just getting busy coding, and are using mock API interfaces that introduced collaboration between API providers, key stakeholders and ultimately the consumer&mdash;leading to better, more consumable interfaces without the overhead of iterating within a production environment.  In the last year, this has grown to the point where new tools and languages have emerged, which employs markdown based formats that have the potential make the API design process friendlier to non-developer. The evolution of API design is making API design something that potentially anyone can do, which brings the process closer to the problem owners who are looking for solutions to their everyday problems.</p>
<p><strong>API Management</strong><br /> In the web API world, management of API operations is not about governance, but about making assets more accessible, in safe and secure ways, that do protect a providers interests, but also allow for establishment of API operations that encourage integration and innovation. With modern API management tools and approaches, the process of management is more about understanding, than it is about control. API management becomes about having your finger on the pulse of consumers, understanding how they are using resources, enabling providers to identify new trends, features and enforce healthy usage of API resources&mdash;protecting everyone involved from API owners to developers, and the end-users who will be using the resulting websites and applications.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Evangelism</strong><br /> Every one of the successful API programs today, deploy some sort of outreach as part of their initiative, widely called developer advocacy or evangelism. This type of engagement with API consumers both offline and online is essential to building a strong base of integrations. If nobody knows about an API, and what is possible when you integrate with it, the chances that an API will get used are slim. It doesn't matter how technically sound an API implementation is, if nobody knows about it, it won&rsquo;t get used.</p>
<p><strong>Sensible Business Models</strong><br /> APIs are allowing well established, and new business to evolve their existing business models, while also allowing them to establish entirely new ways of conducting business. External API ecosystems that flourish into R&amp;D labs, allow for potentially safe environment for incubating new business models, increasing the ways that businesses can generate revenue in 2014.</p>
<h3>What Are APIs Delivering?</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-deliver.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>APIs open up multiple channels for distribution of resources, which is the primary reason for their increased usage. Many start-ups tout an API-first development strategy, where they focus first on developing a stack of API resources before they consider developing any web or mobile application. APIs can be platform agnostic, allowing for easily adding of new application channels, devices and other objectives without changing the API.</p>
<p><strong>Websites</strong><br /> Allowing for the development of distributed websites around centralized data and content was the first practical use of web APIs. The modular, and distributed nature allowed for easy syndication of content for providers, and a quick source of rich content for developers and site owners. Early pioneers like Amazon and eBay realized the power of developing armies of resellers for their products and auctions, that allowed anyone to build a website around their valuable resources.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile</strong><br /> With the introduction of iPhone from Apple, the true potential of distributed, modular API driven resources was realized. Developers were able to build apps that consumers wanted, and API driven utilities like Foursquare and Twilio provide the resources they needed, built on top of the recently realized cloud infrastructure, which was also API driven. APIs make resources accessible, but the mobile phone delivers these valuable resources right to where we need them&mdash;in our hands.</p>
<p><strong>Tablet</strong><br /> Building on the success of using APIs to deliver mobile resources, Apple introduced us to the power of the tablet, with the introduction of the wildly successful iPad. Where earlier tablets had failed, the iPad did not&mdash;quite likely this was due to the fact that we didn't have the API driven resources necessary to satisfy customers, as well as the power of the cloud infrastructure to deliver the backend needed. APIs provided the rich content and data necessary to drive the next generation of touch and interactive apps that would emerge via the iPad and following Android and Windows tablets.</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis &amp; Visualization</strong><br /> With the wealth of data available via the thousands of emerging APIs, developers realized that the distributed nature of APIs allows for remote analysis of data, as well as the visualization of this information via dashboards and embeddable widgets, services and portable web applications. A new wave of &ldquo;big data&rdquo; solutions haleve emerged once a critical mass of APIs were achieved, providing a way of engaging with valuable resources beyond just web and mobile applications.</p>
<p><strong>Internet of Things</strong><br /> As the Internet matures, the desire to connect not just mobile phones, tablets, laptops and computers to the Internet increases, but it has also spread to every object in our everyday lives. The availability of APIs has fueled a new phenomenon call the Internet of Things, which is connecting objects like the thermostat in our homes, our automobiles, and entire cities to the Internet using APIs. APIs aren&rsquo;t just for web and mobile anymore, the web API approach is being used to send and receive content from sensors, cameras, and anything you can imagine in the world around us to API backends, where data can be processed, stored and distributed anywhere online.</p>
<h3>Emerging Trends Enabled By APIs</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-trends.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As API usage expands rapidly into the Internet of Things, other practitioners are exploring new ways to put APIs to use in the the web and mobile applications they already use&mdash;approaches that will enhance the user experience, and increase the quality and reach of API driven resources.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregation</strong><br /> Innovative companies across business sectors ranging from cloud computing to advertising are aggregating APIs allowing for a new breed of APis that allow access to multiple platforms, and enhance or augment existing resources via these new interfaces. Some APIs only go so far when cleaning up data, or matching with other complimentary resources available in the API space&mdash;leaving a huge opportunity for innovation by start-ups, and pushing APIs to deliver even more value to API consumers and their application end-users.</p>
<p><strong>Interoperability &amp; Reciprocity</strong><br /> With much of our personal and business lives moving into the clouds, an a new wave of companies have emerged that allow anyone, even non-developers to migrate content and data between online platforms using APIs. This new approach to system interoperability has evolved from early IT migration processes, providing not just interoperability but reciprocity between multiple platforms, while also empowering end-users to initiate migration between platforms that meet their goals.</p>
<p><strong>Real Time</strong><br /> APIs have helped developed a serious appetite amongst end-users for the delivery information as quickly as possible. Having data, content and other resources instantly in our hands via mobile devices, along with the introduction of new real-time technologies like Websockets and PubSubHubub, has made the web an increasingly real time, 24/7 available world. Either from real time APIs directly from providers, or the increasing number of real time frameworks, applications have become much easier to send and receive valuable API resources that occurs in real time or near real time&mdash;changing the pace of how we consume and produce information.</p>
<h3>Remembering Why It All Works</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ying-yang.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>With the increasing pace of technology and APIs, it can get easy to get caught up in the complexity of the web, and make similar mistakes to earlier API initiatives, forgetting exactly what made web APIs work in the first place. For web APIs to be sustainable there are a number core elements that API providers and consumers should keep in mind, to make sure all this success we are seeing doesn&rsquo;t fade.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong><br /> The number one reason this whole world of web APIs has taken off is because of simplicity. In most cases web APIs do one thing, and they do it well. Using simple, intuitive URIs to interact with valuable resources. APIs should not be much harder than to load a web page, allowing anyone to be able to put APIs to use. Simplicity in design, deployment, management, monetization, and evangelism should be front and center for all API providers&mdash;without simplicity, web APIs will find themselves along the same path as its predecessor(s).</p>
<p><strong>Easy, Low Cost Access to Resources</strong><br /> Access to resources is what attracts developers to APIs. This new wave of web APIs is putting resources into the reach of developers that once were either impossible, or so costly that innovation would never occur within small businesses and start-ups. Reducing any barriers to entry for API consumers is the hallmark of a modern web API, and even if you require registering, and keys to access APIs, providers should make ease of access a top priority for all APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Working Together (Collaboration)</strong><br /> Simplicity, self-service and access to valuable resources beg for collaboration not just amongst developers, but also between the platform and developer ecosystems. API ecosystems open up new opportunities for collaboration, and have the potential to change culture within a company, allowing it to reach outside of the firewall and experience new ideas. As the number of APIs grow, the opportunities for collaboration between API providers increases as well, allowing for shared reach across multiple developer ecosystems, and the chance to attract developers who need multiple resources to achieve their goals.</p>
<p><strong>Permissive Terms of Service</strong><br /> An API terms of service guide all interactions consumers will have with exposed resources. The purpose of the TOS is not just protect a company's assets from misuse, is it meant to direct consumers in ways that stimulate integration and innovation, while also protecting the interests of end-users. API TOS need to be legalese enough to cover everyone&rsquo;s ass, but also liberal enough to incentivize consumers to integrate with their own business operations.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency In Operations</strong><br /> APIs provide an extremely huge opportunity for innovation around company assets, but it requires a company to invest in being more transparent regarding how it does business. APIs by themselves do not equal transparency, they require a company to share insight into how it operates, and what it is planning as part of the road-map. APIs let sunlight to business operations in ways that can disinfect and change company culture, allowing in the oxygen needed for new ideas to flourish. Transparency is a requirement for any successful API initiative, it is up to you regarding just how much is just right.</p>
<p><strong>A Balanced 3 Legged  Approach</strong><br /> Inherited from the 3 legs of oAuth, a balanced approach to API operations in a way that isn&rsquo;t just centered around the providers objectives, but equally considers API consumers and end-users, is essential. While its easy to focus on the value delivered by API providers, or the innovation of developers, without educated, engaged and trusting end-users any platform will stumble. Compare the three legs of an API platform to a three legged stool, if one is missing or short, the stool will hold nothing and fall over when used.</p>
<h3>What We Need To Do</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-kaia.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are two things that I feel are critical to helping guide the API economy, and help prevent us from going down a dark alley or face failure like earlier API efforts like SOA encountered. While there are other illnesses and problems we face, I think that these two areas reflect system illnesses that could prove catastrophic to the entire space.</p>
<p><strong>Respecting Everyone&rsquo;s Privacy</strong><br /> As technologists, developers and platform architecture we MUST respect the privacy of any users who depends on our API pipes. The content, data and other resources that flow through APIs are NOT the new oil. There are plenty of monetization opportunities around this flow of information, but we must respect everyone's privacy in the process. What flows through these API pipes may not mean anything to the platform owner, or the developer integrating with apps, but this information will be very valuable and meaningful to the end-user.</p>
<p><strong>Stop Reinventing the Wheel</strong><br /> There are some amazing API design patterns that already exist in the API space, leaders from Salesforce to Twilio have already defined some of the best patterns that are currently imaginable for common resources like contacts, images, and messages&mdash;with all of these patterns why are we often re-inventing the wheel and designing APIs within walled silos? We need to get better at sharing API definitions, media types and underlying data models with the community. Telling stories around why they are good, how they are being used, and publicly share them in an openly licensed way, so that others can follow our lead. This is why <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist have started <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, to give everyone healthy patterns that they can follow and emulate in their own API operations.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s celebrate how far we've come in 14 years of web APIs, learn from the pioneers who have been around, tell stories about how we are using APIs, publishing and being proud of the work we do, while building for our collective future, and not forgetting the dark matter that holds this amazing space together.</p>

<p>Terms of service <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">guide every aspect of how we provide and consume an APIs</a>&nbsp;that drive&nbsp;our web and mobile applications. As an excercise, lets imagine a future where API terms of service (TOS) are machine readable, and always in alignment with the multiple partner tiers, and the service composition of an API platform.</p>
<p>Right now, the options available to API consumers is organized into service packages, allowing us multiple tiers of access, based upon usage + cost, when registering for and consuming API resources. Imagine if during this process the API TOS were integrated into the registration and account management workflows. Imagine you could fully understand each portion of the API TOS, and be provided with options, instead of a single, rigid level of service.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">options for API access are throttled across TOS, privacy policy, branding, service level agreements, pricing, and service composition and partner access tiers</a>. I want to explore the possibility that these building blocks could be machine readable, allowing for variances on each aspect of API operations. This scenario would allow for API consumers to prioritize which aspects of operations are most important to them, allowing them to pay more for premium access to API services.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just working through my thoughts on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">politics of APIs</a>, expanding on ideas of machine readable terms of service (TOS) introduce to me by Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>)&nbsp;of <a href="https://twitter.com/KloutAPI">@KloutAPI,</a> and also a tweet from Antony Falco (<a href="https://twitter.com/antonyfalco">@antonyfalco</a>)&nbsp;of <a href="http://orchestrate.io/">Orchestrate.io</a>&nbsp;about the potential to allow for variances of TOS.</p>
<p>I would love to hear your thoughts on this subject. Am I off in left field, or is this something we should play with more?</p>

<p>I getting ready to heading to Berlin in the morning. I'm scheduled to speak at <a href="http://berlin.apidays.io/">APIDays Berlin</a> on Monday. APIDays is the sister site to #<a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">APIStrat</a>, an event you will always find me at, no matter where it is at in the world.</p>
<p>APIDays has been pushing the conversation around APIs across Europe and the United States for a couple years now. While #APIStrat is focused on larger markets, and bigger events&mdash;APIDays is focused on new markets, and conversations within new business verticals, like the <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">automobile API conversation, in San Francisco this June</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scheduled for the end of the day Monday, so my talk titled &ldquo;The Kin Lane Show&rdquo;, will be a summary of the current state of API space, while also integrating the other talks I will see throughout the day. Something that will helps me fine tune a talk for a local audience and specifically for APIDays Berlin.</p>
<p>Hopefully you already have your tickets, if not you can catch me at the end of May at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIDays Mediterranea in Barcelona</a>, and at <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">APIDays San Francisco</a> in June.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/ibm-impact-2014/ibm-impact-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spoke on the business of internal APIs at the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/">IBM Impact conference in Las Vegas</a>, this last Tuesday. About 15 people attended my talk, but the conversations I had with folks afterwards, signaled to me that my talk was a success.</p>
<p>I do not expect IBM or the enterprise to listen to my brand of API evangelism, but I&rsquo;m still determined to better understand the collision of the enterprise with the open  world of web APIs. Even if I convert just one or two individuals at any event, my mission was a success.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>Impressed that IBM invited <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> to speak at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IBMImpact&amp;src=hash">#IBMImpact</a>. Maybe this isn&rsquo;t your father&rsquo;s IBM!</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>As I walked around the event talking to people I was reminded of how hungry the enterprise is for conversation about the API space that aren&rsquo;t linked to a product or particular company. As soon as people realize I have no sales pipeline, and I&rsquo;m genuinely trying to understand the space, and help them be successful, the tone always shifts dramatically.</p>
<p>You can find my <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/ibm/impact-2014/" target="_blank">slide deck for the talk on Github</a>, unfortunately its in my minimalist style, so you need to have my narration&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;ll work on longer post to summarize what I covered during the talk. I&rsquo;ll have more thoughts on my experience at IBM Impact in Vegas, but will publish as separate posts across <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying the API space exclusively for the last four years, and have worked hard to try and understand the space by studying the <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs</a>, and as a result I can confidently say we are smack dab in the middle of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">what I consider to be an enterprise phase</a>.</p>
<p>In 2013 and 2014 I&rsquo;ve seen the enterprise across multiple business sectors turn their attention to this curiosity called the web API. So why is the enterprise so interested in APIs? Many technologists from the enterprise claim that it is no difference than their own earlier SOA efforts, but there has to be more under the hood, that is attracting the enterprise, beyond just a shiny new label, API&mdash;so what are they?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Keep things small, modular and intuitive</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong> - You should be widening access to your resources, not ever limiting</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong> - While not everything should be 100% open, be as open as possible</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - Provide insight into operations and your roadmap allowing consumers to operate in alignment</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - Two way communication between you and your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Protect the privacy of your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong> - Be open to alternative licensing and ownership of content and data that is favorable to consumers</li>
<li><strong>Legal</strong> - Be as open as you can be with copyright, patents and trademark in API initiatives</li>
<li><strong>Terms</strong> - Establish terms of use that favor your business, but also the interests of consumers</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - Acknowledge the monetization needs of your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Quantify</strong> - Define and understand how digital resources are being consumed</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're looking at the web API phenomenon purely through a technical lens, as many SOA practitioners do, you will not even see most of these characteristics&mdash;they are irrelevant to your tech driven goals.  In my opinion this <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/10/soa-vs-api--the-humans-win/">humanization of a company&rsquo;s digital resources</a>, which historically have been locked up, defined and controlled by IT gatekeepers, is the single most important lesson for the enterprise when it comes to web APIs.</p>
<p>In 2014, as you are planning your API strategy, don't make the mistake in seeing APIs as purely a tool in the SOA toolbox, as they were over 10 years ago. Long ago web APIs jumped out of the enterprise petri dish, experienced the oxygen available within the public sphere and developed some life giving characteristics that will be critical to the enterprise surviving and thriving in the coming years.</p>
<p>I will be talking at <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/">IBM Impact in Las Vegas</a> next week on this topic.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/04/25/a-rare-beast-in-government-the-write-api/">A Rare Beast In Government, The Write API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/how-why/introduction"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/we-the-people/we_the_people.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The number of APIs in government has grown significantly in the last couple of years, increasing access to public data, potentially driving the private sector to build web and mobile apps around government resources data. Even with this growth in API deployment and resulting app development, this movement has been severely handicapped by one aspect&mdash;99% of these APis are read only, you cannot write data to government via APIs.</p>
<p>APIs being a two way street is one of those subtle, but very important aspects of API operations that can define whether an API initiative will be success or not. Since government is so risk averse, most entities are afraid of what can happen when they launch APIs, and completely terrified around what will happen with an API that people can write data to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/09/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy-getting-technical/">pushing for more read / write APis in government for some time now</a>, and for the first time I'm seeing the potential for things to change, with a <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/write-api-beta-testing">new beta API project from the We The People API</a>. I couldn't think of a better program to test a writable API for, than We The People&mdash;pushing the democratic powers of web APIs.</p>
<p>First, what is We The People?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We the People is the White House's petitions platform -- giving people a new way to petition the government. The way it works is pretty simple: People can create or sign petitions on WhiteHouse.gov. If it gets enough support (i.e. signatures), it will receive an official response. And with more than 13 million users, it's been a big success.</em></p>
<p>Second, why an API?</p>
<p>An API opens up the petition platform to exist within any website, application and mobile applications. A read API allows for content to display on any site or app, and a write API allows for participation in the petition process via any site or app&mdash;changing the dynamics of the petition process, moving it off of just .gov websites, ultimately evolving how our government operates.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/we-the-people/we-the-people-write-api-beta.png" alt="" width="575" /></p>
<p><strong>Testing The Waters With A Beta Phase</strong><br /> With any web software you need a beta phase, allowing trusted users to play with and debug an implementation, and this is what the team behind the We The People API are doing. They are using Github as a collaborative platform during the beta phase to test the write API, fix issues and squash bugs, and improve documentation ahead of the public release.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring And Throttling Write API Access</strong><br /> Counter to popular opinion, not all APIs are open and publicly available by default. We The People requires you to request access to the API, and limits the number of API requests available for each API key. This type of access is essential to establishing a trusted layer of users and applications, that will be writing data to the We The People platform, through the API.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Documentation</strong><br /> The We The People API provides complete documentation for the read and write API methods, allowing developers to learn about the interface and how to integrate into their applications. As part of the beta process they are looking for assistance from developers in improving and evolving the available documentation.</p>
<p><strong>A Central Role For Github</strong><br /> The We The People API team is relying on Github for managing code related to the platform, but also relying on it for managing collaborative changes to the API documentation, and using Github issue management to handle all feedback for the API beta cycles--making the deployment of this API a social process.</p>
<p><strong>Politics Of API Usage</strong><br /> Along with the other essential building blocks, the We The People API team provides a terms of service and privacy policy to help set the tone for what is expected of developers who are integrating their web and mobile applications with the API, providing a few of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">knobs and levers for managing the political aspects of a read / write API</a>.</p>
<p><strong>An API Blueprint For Government To Follow</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m super excited about the <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/write-api-beta-testing">We The People Write API beta</a>. There are no other write APIs in the federal government beyond the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint">IRS modernized e-file system</a>&mdash;there are some others that allow for minimal interactions, and open tooling at the city government level, but a simple write API at the White House level, is a big deal. To realize the full potential of an API in government, it has to have write capabilities, and despite what some believe, write capabilities should not be available to everyone&mdash;you should demonstrate that you will bring value to the platform.</p>
<p>The We The People API is a blueprint for how APIs can be done in government. The platform started with a basic read API, that focuses on doing one thing, and makes sure it does it well. Then once they have a handle on that, they have moved into allowing developers the ability to write to the API, during a very controlled beta phase.</p>
<p>I will be watching the We The People API process closely, and work hard to craft stories ,and help solidify it as a blueprint that other agencies can follow. The write API represents a significant shift in open data and API efforts in government. The overall government lifecycle is not a one way street, where government just dictates to citizens, so there is no reason government APIs should be a one way street&mdash;adding write capabilities to all government APIs is essential to getting to not just a healthy government API ecosystem, but also a healthy overall API economy.</p>

<p>I just finished up participating in an API specification session for <a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/">Green Button</a> data with <a href="https://www.sce.com">Southern California Edison (SCE)</a>, <a href="http://www.sdge.com/">San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E)</a>, and <a href="http://www.pge.com/">Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E)</a>.</p>
<p>The discussion at one point during the last day was around &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; of huge data sets that a provider wants to allow for download over http. The group has been talking about scenarios for how this will work, and after over an hour they are getting to some pretty edge case scenarios surrounding &ldquo;chunking&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As I listen, I can&rsquo;t help but thinking about he pros and cons of upfront planning vs. iterating on your API over time. Are they planning for scenarios that will never happen, and building in development time for use cases that may never become a reality? They know their data and industry best, so I am not educated enough to make a determination, but it doesn't stop me from having these thoughts.</p>
<p>I understand that large companies, like wihtin the utility inudstry, have to plan as much as they can, as they operate in a pretty unforgiving environment when it involves physical integrations, government regulations, and other constraints in the industry. Even with this understanding, I think some larger institutions are very used to planning, and covering every possible scenario that they can think of, and in the process, spending unnecessary resources, and also limiting any positive unknowns from occurring.</p>
<p>Developers from the open API space definitely have to better understand planning, and doing their due diligence before just leaping, but I also think the enterprise will have even more challenges when it comes to letting go and realizing the innovation that can occur around APIs. That you can cover your ass by considering the obvious negative scenarios, then building quality management tooling and processes, and identify other negative scenarios in realtime--when you actually have the data evidence to support.</p>
<p>With too heavy of a governance hand, you might just end up re-living many of the suffocating aspects we experienced in the SOA world.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.byu.edu/wiki/display/SOA/Web+Services+Programmer+Documentation" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/brigham-young-university.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on <a title="education APIs" href="http://education.apievangelist.com/">education</a> and <a title="university APIs" href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university</a> APIs for a while now, but after kicking off some work on the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">FAFSA API prototype</a>, and preparing a response for to the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/04/16/2014-08649/request-for-information-on-the-use-of-apis-in-higher-education-data-and-student-aid-processes">request for information (RFI) on the use of APIs in higher education data and student aid process</a>, I'm ramping up the time I&rsquo;m spending on education related APIs.</p>
<p>APIs in higher education is also one of the areas <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist are partnering, to help define what the API landscape looks like across higher education institutions, and as I do with other business sectors, we are looking to stimulate the API conversation amongst existing leaders from the space&mdash;online, and offline at as many events as we can.</p>
<p>In support of all of this, I went through the API efforts of 10 institutions I&rsquo;m currently monitoring, to see what was new, reacquainting myself with what each of the institutions were up to. My primary goal was to establish a list of the common services that other universities could offer, based upon these existing API leaders, and I was well on my to compiling a pretty robust list, until I got to Brigham Young University (BYU), and I was blown out of the water.</p>
<p>BYU wins the API deployment game within a university with the <a href="https://developer.byu.edu/wiki/display/SOA/Web+Services+Programmer+Documentation" target="_blank">261 web services they have listed in their registry</a>. Every aspect of university operation is represented as a web service, and as you scan down the list, and you look at the XSDs, you realize how much work went into their API stack. There are definitely some interesting things going on at <a href="http://webservices.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> and in <a href="http://apps.usos.edu.pl/developers/api/">Poland</a> around university APIs, but BYU blows everyone away.</p>
<p>I will go through the list of web service from BYU, clean up a little, and use to seed a general list of potential services that other universities could use when planning their own API program. When I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/11/common-building-blocks-of-cloud-apis/">profiled the cloud computing API space</a>, Amazon Web Services has such a complete list of APIs, I was able to use them as the starting point for a cloud computing API blueprint. In the same way, I think BYU list of services is so complete, it provides an extremely complete blueprint for other higher education institutions to potentially follow.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://reliefweb.int" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/reliefweb/reliefweb-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was introduced to the <a href="http://reliefweb.int/help/api">ReliefWeb API</a> last week, which provides information including reports, jobs, training, countries, and source details on global crises and disasters going back to 1996.</p>
<p>The ReliefWeb API follows a trend of organizations realizing not just the potential of APIs for delivering content to mobile applications, but also the benefits of opening up publicly. As the site states:</p>
<blockquote><em>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) originally built the ReliefWeb API to power a mobile version of the ReliefWeb website.</em></blockquote>
<p>Since then they have normalized the interfaces for public consumption, hoping that &ldquo;developers can build tools that increase exposure for valuable content and facilitate analysis for better decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ReliefWeb API provides seven valuable API endpoints:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Providing discovery, navigability and insight into other APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Reports</strong> - Content API of updates, headlines and maps available on ReliefWeb.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs</strong> - Job offers available on ReliefWeb.</li>
<li><strong>Trainings</strong> - Training opportunities available via ReliefWeb.</li>
<li><strong>Countries</strong> - Countries from Reliefweb.</li>
<li><strong>Disasters</strong> - Disasters tracked on as part of ReliefWeb.</li>
<li><strong>Sources</strong> - Sources of information available on ReliefWeb.</li>
</ul>
<p>The design of the API is pretty well thought out, providing some common, as well as some forward thinking technical elements:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Detailed information about all API endpoints, including content types, versions, data model, including full text and interactive version using Swagger.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong> - Control links facilitate paging, deep cross-linking of content allows navigating between related resources, and all resources can be reached by drilling down from the top level of the API at http://api.rwlabs.org.</li>
<li><strong>Caching</strong> - Uses Cache-Control headers to point out how often ReliefWeb recommends checking for updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://reliefweb.int" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/reliefweb/reliefweb-syra.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I started playing around making some calls and enjoyed the way the API flows, and excited about the potential. I do have some critique of the implementation, with the hope of influencing their roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>Side Project</strong><br /> The API initiative has a very side project feel. Its under /help/ in the address, and I'd say 90% of the projects I&rsquo;ve seen deployed in this way go away&mdash;this will affect developer perspective. While I understand most API projects are often underfunded side projects, you should work to hide this. Launch at developer.reliefweb.int and give the portal its own navigation, and make a link to developers area prominent in footer or header of main ReliefWeb site&mdash;instilling confidence in API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br /> The API documentation is complete. It has all the relevant information, it just feels fragmented, and needs some UX love. The Swagger API docs could be made to be a little more beautiful, flowing and integrated with the rest of the docs. The age of link to interactive explorer is gone, your entire doc experience should be interactive.</p>
<p><strong>Key Things Up</strong><br /> I love that I can just start playing with API, without registration, but I&rsquo;d much rather have ReliefWeb in tune with how the API is being used, and including usage patterns into its roadmap and future API design. Requiring self-service registration and API key to use isn't going to lock up the data, it will allow you to better understand how endpoints are being consumed, bottlenecks, and common usage patterns. This will all go a long way to helping evolve the API roadmap and understand ReliefWeb API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Building Blocks</strong><br /> Much like I state above about it feeling like a side project, most of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">essential API building blocks</a> are there, but their are really fragmented. There are FAQs on multiple pages, docs spread across multiple pages, and support paths aren't super clear. Overall the portal and supporting building blocks just need some UX love to make sure it flows better for on boarding new developers, as well as supporting existing ones.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Forward</strong><br /> It is always hard to critique new APIs from governmental or non-profit organizations, because I'm just happy to see any API come out the door. This means the iteration cycles start, and things will only get better (potentially).</p>
<p>I could recommend <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">other building blocks</a> like code samples, idea and application showcase and social elements like usage of Github and Twitter, but I know they are just getting going and these things will come.</p>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m excited about the potential around the ReliefWeb API, that the organization has seen the benefits of APIs in their own mobile strategy, but also understands the potential of opening up these resources to the public.</p>
<p>Seeing deployments like the ReliefWeb API remind me that we can truly tackle many of the big problems we face in the world, rather than many of the stupid, first world problem API solutions and applications we see out of Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been involved in a lot of conversations lately around turning government forms into APIs. Which seems like a great idea, right up until the part where I&rsquo;m thinking about the original workflow represented by many legacy forms, and realize that maybe this form was a bad idea to begin with.</p>
<p>If I develop an API for a form, and the original form all by itself is a bad idea, am I just making a bad idea worse, by attaching an API to it? I'd say yes!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like this will be true in all situations. I think APIs will allow us to hopefully break free of what the original intent of a form was, explore new opportunities for gathering and managing data, and changing the concept of what a form is.</p>
<p>Even with the potential, I can&rsquo;t help but think APIs on forms may not be good in all scenarios. Then again, this isn&rsquo;t just limited to forms, before we attach an API to anything, we should probably think&mdash;is this a good idea?</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2014</span>

<p>The first consumer of all of my APIs, including my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a> is me. I develop my APIs first for my use, and only recently have decided to make available to the public. So when I sat down to create my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/service-composition-for-my-screen-capture-api/">service composition for my APIs</a>, I needed to figure out what I was going to do about my internal consumption.</p>
<p>My first instinct was that I didn't need to include my internal API consumption alongside my partner and public API consumption. I quickly changed my tune as I realized that it was going to be important that I monitor my own API usage in the exact same ways I would partners or public consumers.</p>
<p>I need to better understand how I consume my own APIs, identify security breaches or just unhealthy ways I&rsquo;m consuming my own API resources. I've seen too many APIs like Instagram and even Tesla get burned by not having the proper management layer on their own internally consumed APIs--allowing hackers to get through doorways that weren't monitored.</p>
<p>While my internal API usage won't be billed as it will with my partner, retail or wholesale API consumers, it will be tracked, limited and analyzed alongside the other target API consumption groups.</p>
<p>I need to understand how my API resources are being consumed, and this includes my own usage. This is a very important lesson for all of us API providers to understand, helping us see the complete picture of how APIs are put to use.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/ibm-impact-2014/ibm-impact-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The biggest impact APIs will have at your company will be the internal, cultural change regarding how you do business. We are in the middle of an explosion of APIs, and while there are many new public APIs emerging, the majority of growth is coming from the deployment of internal APIs.</p>
<p>There is a lot that companies can learn from the open API movement over the last fourteen years, with many <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks</a>, and healthy practices that can be applied when internally deploying APIs.</p>
<p>This is a topic I will be exploring on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, and at the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/">IBM Impact conference at the Venetian in Las Vegas, NV</a>&mdash;April 27th through May 1st. The abstract from my talk, titled "Business of Internal APIs&rdquo; is:</p>
<blockquote><em>The largest area of growth in the last couple years of APIs is internally within the enterprise. There are numerous lessons that can be extracted from the world of public APIs, and applied internally within any company, helping increase agility, efficiency, while also helping develop new business lines. When it comes to APIs, the secret to success isn&rsquo;t all about technology, and this session will help introduce you to the business of internal APIs, extracted from the approach of leaders in the space.</em></blockquote>
<p>In my experience there are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/10/soa-vs-api--the-humans-win/">fundamental elements that make APIs successful, where more classic approaches like service oriented architecture (SOA)</a> fall short. When companies are deploying APIs for internal consumption, you have to consider elements like self-service access, up to date API docs, code samples, and the human elements, that have made public API deployments successful.</p>
<p>Even though internal APIs consumers will have some unique needs that your partner or public API consumers won't, there will also be many similar patterns across your internal, partner and public API customers that you will need to leverage. If you can&rsquo;t be in Vegas at the end of the month to hear me talk, just tune into API Evangelist and I&rsquo;ll make sure I publish everything online for consumption by all my readers.</p>
