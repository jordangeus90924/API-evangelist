{% include JB/setup %}<p>I recently stumbled across the University of Washington’s Web Services area, where they are working to create a single place to learn about, discover and connect with various APIs that are available at the University.As the home page says: Web Services at the University of Washington is a method of getting important institutional data from and/or into your applications.Web Services are a way for applications or systems to talk to one another and does not usually involve human interaction.I’m always trying to understand where the next wave of API growth might come from, and while the enterprise is definintely sitting on a treasure chest of information and resources, just waiting to be exposed via APIs--I think Universities might be in the same position.As soon as Universities start realizing how many APIs they have laying around already, and understand the potential of launching new ones, they are going to have a massive API management problem.</p>
