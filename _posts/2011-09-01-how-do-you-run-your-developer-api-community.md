{% include JB/setup %}<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developer-think-tank.png"  width="375" align="right" />The guys over at <a title="Developer Think Tank" href="http://developerthinktank.com/">Developer Think Tank</a> are conducting a survey to measure developer program performance.
Developer Think Tank wants to create a platform to discuss the way to create and run a successful developer program.
So they need all of us API owners, evangelists and advocates to share our knowledge and wisdom about how we conduct business when it comes to our API developer communities.
They are offering some gift certificates in exchange for your time, but we should all show our support, and help them identify best practices around developer program managment.
You can get more information about the <a title="developer program survey" href="http://developerthinktank.com/blog/2011/7/29/research-open-now-measuring-developer-program-performance.html">developer program survey on their blog</a>, or head directly to the <a title="developer survey form" href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/600222/Measuring-Developer-Programs">developer survey form</a>.
