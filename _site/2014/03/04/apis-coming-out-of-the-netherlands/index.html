<p>As we gear up for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 24-26th</a>, I&rsquo;m spending my time getting to know API companies across Europe. I published a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/apis-coming-out-of-the-united-kingdom/">listing of APIs I found from the United Kingdom</a> a few days ago, and next up is taking a look at what APIs are coming out of the Netherlands.

I confess that I couldn&rsquo;t name a single API from Amsterdam before this week, but now I notice that Distimo, Drillster, ElasticSearch, Peerreach, and TwitterCounter were all out of the Netherlands, and were APIs I am already familiar with.
