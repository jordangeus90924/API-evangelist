[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/moodstocks/Moodstocks-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" />][1][The Moodstock API][1] provides object recognition for images and photos in a RESTFul API with keys for authentication, and responses in JSON.

The image recognition API allows developers to add reference images that can be used when identifying objects in images. Developers can build a catalog of these reference images, establishing their own definition of what objects mean in the context of their application.

The API has a freemium pricing structure, then there's a charge of �0.10 per image to store a month, and �0.10 per image search and recognition.

The [Moodstocks API for image recognition][2] is a perfect tool for the API stack.
