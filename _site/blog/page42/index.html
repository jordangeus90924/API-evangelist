        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-bread.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my monitoring of the API space, when I started seeing a large number of blog posts, tweets, companies, and other elements I track on get tagged with the same tag over and over, I take notice. My blogging, CRM, and news curation system all have their own <a href="http://theapistack.com/">tag cloud interface</a> for the week, showing which tags have been applied--so if a tag gets heavy usage, I know it.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, I've spun up new research into other areas within the world of APIs, beyond my core <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a title="API Evangelism" href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, <a title="API Discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, and <a title="API Integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a> research. I created separate buckets beyond just provide and consume to track on these new areas, called <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">trends</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/opportunities/">opportunities</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/priorities/">priorities</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014 it is beginning to seem like each of my trend research areas are getting baked directly into API platforms, ranging from real-time features with Firebase, to reciprocity by default using Zapier. API providers are learning that having a real-time layer, or a reciprocity layer baked into their platform is a good thing, and why reinvent the wheel when you have kick ass solutions like <a title="Firebase" href="http://bit.ly/1w9oJSq">Firebase</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/SzPnEh">Zapier</a>.</p>
<p>It makes sense that API providers would be looking externally to deliver&nbsp;<a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">aggregation</a>, <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, and even <a title="Voice APIs" href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a> layers for their API platforms--this stuff is hard, and why spread yourself too thin. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">Intuit just bought reciprocity provider itDuzzit</a>, and I think we will more providers <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">integrating Zapier into their platforms by default like Nimble did</a>. We'll also see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/nest-provides-a-realtime-layer-by-default-for-api-consumers/">more API platforms bring in Firebase as a real-time layer like Nest did for their Internet of Things (Iot) thermostat API platform</a>.</p>
<p>Overall it seems like a white label solution that any API provider could put to use when considering solutions for aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice or even data solutions including spreadsheet connectors, analysis, and visualization, would do well in the space. At the very least, any company looking to step up and provide solutions in these areas, should definitely have a strong partner program like Zapier and Firebase have brought to the table.</p>
<p>I will have to start considering how to migrate aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice out of the trends bucket and into either the provide or consume buckets, or maybe both. It would seem that both API providers and consumers need to be educated in these areas, and made aware of what solutions are available.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that worried about the overall structure of API Evangelist at the moment. That is one of the beautiful aspects of how I architected the site(s), is that each research area lives as its own node on the network, so I can move around, shift as I need to find the right formula&mdash;something that helps me in a very fast moving space, where my understanding is constantly shifting and evolving with the swift currents of the APi space.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/fda-finding-their-api-mojo-with-a-new-drug-label-api/">FDA Finding Their API Mojo With A New Drug Label API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I first wrote about <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">openFDA</a> back in June, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">showcasing the launch of their new developer area</a>, and I'm happy to see they aren't missing a beat when it comes to launching new APIs. I recently saw that openFDA just launch a new endpoint, called the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/label/">Drug Label API</a>, which allows you to query over 60K prescriptions and over-the-counter drug labels.</p>
<p>It is satisfying to see such a large government agency find their API mojo. The original spark at the FDA was lit by Presidential Innovate Fellow Sean Herron (<a href="https://twitter.com/seanherron">@seanherron)</a>, but most recently Sean has handed off the iniative to an internal team who will keep they platform moving forward using the same formula.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/Drug_facts_label_gl01.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Beyond just the API, openFDA is also seriously putting the "open" in openFDA with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fda/openfda">Public Repo on GitHub&nbsp;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opendata.stackexchange.com/search?q=openFDA">Extensive Community Q&amp;A on StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://open.fda.gov/terms/">Progress Terms of Service for Government</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Everything the openFDA is doing provides a great blueprint for other agencies to follow, from their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">creative evolution of the interactive API documentation</a>, to encouraging other federal agencies to fork, and use the openFDA TOS in their own platforms.</p>
<p>The work coming out of the FDA makes me happy, because it sets a strong example that other agencies can follow, provides the rest of us with something positive that we can highlight when working to change public opinion, but also because it is such extremely vital data, and should be available in full download, and API format so that it can stimulate web and mobile app development, and system integration across the private sector.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://platform.pokitdok.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/pokitdok.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adding <a href="https://platform.pokitdok.com">PokitDok</a>, a simple API for healthcare to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>, and my overall <a href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com/">APIs in healthcare research</a>. Well I didn't exactly add them, PokitDok added themselves to my healthcare research by forking the Github repository, and adding themselves to the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/healthcare/blob/gh-pages/data/companies.json">JSON data source</a>&mdash;once I received the pull request, I accepted, and they were published on the site.</p>
<p>Usually once a week I spend time to manually adding new companies I've come across in my monitoring of the API space, but being a one man show I can&rsquo;t find everything across this massively expanding space. This is why I depend on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> to help me curate the best from across the space. Not everyone knows that the entire API Evangelist network of <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ research projects</a> all runs on Github, which allows anyone to help write posts, curate industry news, and maintain the lists of API providers.</p>
<p>As soon as I accepted the pull request for PokitDok, I also tagged them as &ldquo;API Stack&rdquo;, which immediately adds PokitDok to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>, listed under healthcare. No matter which doorway a company enters, I will make sure they get published to all appropriate research areas across the API Evangelist network, using my tagging system.</p>
<p>Thanks PokitDok for adding yourself, and I look forward to paying attention to the good things coming our of your API platform via your <a href="https://pokitdok.com/blog/">Blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PokitDok">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pokitdok">Github</a> profiles.</p>

<p>I depend on a <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/14/details-about-the-52-online-services-i-depend-on/">number of cloud services to make my personal and business world go round</a>. Even as a programmer, who can hand code just about any script to integrate, automate, and orchestrate my world, I find myself using more reciprocity services like <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity providers</a> are one of the most important evolutions of the API space, because they make the whole world of APis accessible to the normals, and not just to the geek crowd. My time is valuable, and personally I'd rather being using existing tools and services, rather than re-inventing the wheel, and when it comes to orchestrating my online life, I need all the help I can, which is why I am looking IFTTT and Zapier for help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using both platforms in 2014, but as I do with any other software I&rsquo;ve been dating for any sustained period, I start looking at getting a little more serious. This is where I have to part ways with IFTTT, and other other platforms that don&rsquo;t have <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/">clear relief valves for their free tier</a>, allowing me to start paying monthly or annually for my use of their service, and sensibly scale up as my needs grow.</p>
<p>Zapier has a pretty straightforward <a href="https://zapier.com/app/pricing">pricing framework</a>, giving you just enough room to get hooked, then you can pay for more usage as needed. Having a free tier for any cloud service is essential, but having a tiered business model, and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">clear monetization strategy</a>, so I know that you will be around in the future, is a requirement.</p>
<p>I will keep my IFTT account to play with, but when it comes operating my business, continuing to integrate Zapier into my workflow makes sense as they have a clear business model that fits my needs. Plus <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/">Zapier has an API</a>. Ummmm&hellip;hello? An API for your automation and integration layer across all the services you depend on, via their APIs--how cool is that!</p>
<p>When launching your own APIs, make sure it has a clear, visible, intuitive and ascendable service framework--it is something that will go a long way in helping companies decide if they will use your APIs, or not.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.uber.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/uber-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The sharing economy is booming, and with the release of the <a href="https://developer.uber.com/">Uber API</a>, the attention on this space will only increase. Personally I&rsquo;m only  interested in the surface area of the API that Uber has released, and what it tells about the opportunity for API designers in the sharing economy.</p>
<p>I think the surface area of the Uber API is pretty minimal, but very significant when you look at it as a glimpse of what is to come, as the sharing economy gets a direct pipeline to the API economy, and the resulting app economy. Oh yeah, I went there&mdash;I used all the economy buzzwords in once sentence. Seriously, I think the five endpoints that Uber launched with, are very telling:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/products</li>
<li>/estimates/price</li>
<li>/estimates/time</li>
<li>/history</li>
<li>/me</li>
</ul>
<p>These API endpoints represent the beginning of the shared economy API surface area, and while there will be many additions, augmentations, and different takes on what APIs look like in the sharing economy, I predict many other providers will often emulate Uber in their own design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really equipped to make a judgement on the value or importance of the Uber API. What I can do is keep an eye on Uber, and other sharing economy startup and their APIs, and look for patterns across each of the implementations. Hopefully the space can remain true to their roots, and make sure the API definitions are shareable, and reusable across the flourishing sharing app sapce.</p>
<p>Uber is focused specifically in the transportation portion of the sharing economy, and this makes me consider the bigger picture, and who will step up to serve the larger sharing economy, with an Uber API platform for the sharing economy. I think much like the wider API space, as the sharing API space matures out there will lots of opportunities for aggregation, real-time, automation, messaging, payments, and other API essentials that are in service of the sharing economy.</p>

<p>I tag a lot of interesting companies that show up during my weekly API monitoring. When I see a tag go from 1 or 2, to over 5 companies--I take a closer look to see what is going on. An increase in the number of companies focusing in a specific area could be a trend, or it could be nothing.</p>
<p>The tag "API Agency" ticked over to 6 today, when I added&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aquevix.com/">Aquevix</a>, an indian company that is focusing on API development. As of August 2014 I now have six separate agency style companies that I've found who have a focus on API design and development:</p>

<p>We'll see how many more dev shops I find in the next couple months. Sometimes when I start focusing in a new area I will find more companies working in the same area, purely because I'm looking harder, and sometimes it takes time for things to actually heat up.</p>
<p>As I'm looking at local Chicago web and mobile development shops during the lead up to <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practce in Chicago</a> next month, and I'm learning that many small shops like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">SYDCON</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/18/how-are-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-bryson-pouw-at-blaze-portfolio/">Blaze Portfolio</a> are using APIs, they just havn't shifted their marketing and web site content to reflect the evolution.</p>
<p>It won't take much for many of these web and mobile development shops to standardize their API design and development services, much like the evolution we saw occur from web to mobile development, shifting the focus of the small dev shop to better serve a growing demand for API design, and development. I think by 2015 I'll see over 50 development shops, who are heavily focused on API design and developmennt in my API tracking system.</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>I REALLY like the API Chappies, and Mike @ Stateless is the freak'n man!</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking with a very nice recruiter over at Google over the last couple weeks, and she has been so kind in keeping me updated about opportunities for evangelism at Google. This is the 3rd round of talks I've had with Google while being the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, talks that historically go nowhere because of their programming test, which is a super silly aspect of their HR process.</p>
<p>I was straight up with the Google recruiter a couple of weeks ago when she first emailed me, and again when we talked on the phone last week&mdash;I do not take programming tests to open up doors for employment conversations, sorry. ;-( It is a waste of my time, and yours, and doesn&rsquo;t measure shit. I understand that you have to qualify large number of folks, at your very algorithmic-centric company, but when it comes to measuring what I do, a programming test isn&rsquo;t a thing.</p>
<p>If programming a tic-tac-toe game on a live screen share is what you need to open up a conversation with professionals around evangelizing your platform, you need to look elsewhere. Nowhere in my role as the API Evangelist do I have to code under time pressure with someone else watching, sorry. I would even say, having hacker skills, trumps programming skills in a public facing evangelism role, and speed, quality of code go out the window. This is about making connections through hacker storytelling, something that doesn't always pencil out to producing best code, and is more about helping people understand what is possible using a platform, in the most meaningful way&mdash;requiring more focus on the person and their problems, not the code or algorthm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve managed to have man very meaningful conversations with other tech giants like Intel, IBM, large institutions like UC Berkeley, BYU, and establish fruitful relationships with partners like 3Scale and API Spark, and across federal agencies like Department of Education, Energy, NASA, and the White House around APIs--all without taking programming tests. I talk to startups, SMBs, SMEs, organizations, institutions, and government agencies a lll the time, and never have to code under pressure, in front of an audience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not under the influence that I will change your hiring practices Google&mdash;you are a very smart, and successful company. All I&rsquo;m saying is you are probably filtering out some pretty talented folks, who are extremely passionate and knowledgeable in what they do, and connected in their space, and when you won&rsquo;t engage in meaningful conversations without a programming test, your missing out.</p>
<p>I actually prefer working with organizations from the outside in, I think it better reflects the essence of API Evangelism. The companies who have trouble working with outside entities, without tradition HR processes, are probably not going to lead when it comes developing an API driven ecosystem.</p>
<p>If your company doesn't have the time to research me, and understand what I bring to the API space, and what my skills are, we probably aren't a fit. Everything about me is available online at <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kinlane">Github</a>--you just have to look. If you are only looking at <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane-resume/Resume-Kin-Lane-API-Evangelist-Summary.pdf">resumes</a>, and making people take tests, you will probably get what you are looking for!</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://twiliosheet.azurewebsites.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/twilio/TwilioSheet.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you follow <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog">Twilio blog</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/twilio">Twitter account</a> you can always find a good API story from the API leader. It also makes me happy to see trends I&rsquo;m seeing from other provider re-enforced by the API heavyweight. This time is providing spreadsheet integration with common API resources, like Twilio SMS.</p>
<p>Twilio has a pretty slick tool they call <a href="http://twiliosheet.azurewebsites.net/">TwilioSheet</a> that allows you to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet, and created a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/08/connecting-twilio-sms-to-google-spreadsheet.html">pretty nice walkthrough of the entire setup</a>. Providing this type of functionality helps, as Twilio says, "make it easy for developers and non-developers alike to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet&rdquo;&mdash;<strong>emphasis on the non-developers.</strong></p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, the spreadsheet is the #1 database solution in the world, and provide a huge opportunity when it comes to bridging the world of APIs with the wider business landscape. This is something that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API reciprocity providers like Zapier</a> have bridging for a while now, and something that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">API providers like Intuit are looking to bank into their API platforms</a>.</p>
<p>When you see Twilio doing something like providing providing spreadsheet integration for their API platform, you have to stop and consider whether or not it is something that might work for your own API platform. Spreadsheet integration by default with API your driven resources is a great way to expand the reach of any API, bringing these valuable resources within reach of the actual, everyday problem owners.</p>

<p>It can be hard to keep up with what the latest geek trends are--where all of the latest digital watering holes are&nbsp;(especially when your old), that allow you to find the latest info, conversations, and links to everything cool and hip. I depend on my network of API peeps for tips, and last week I was introduced to a new place that I wanted to pass on to you, called <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>.</p>
<p>Product Hunt does a good job of describing what they do:</p>
<blockquote><em>Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the site open for the last five days, scanning for cool tech creations that grab my attention, and when I opened the tab today, I noticed that APIs dominated the top of the list.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.producthunt.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/product-hunt/product-hunt-api.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>You see the Uber API (of course), and Zapier both jockeying for top slots, as well as Product Hunts API too. Product Hunt allows you to post product name, tagline, and url for any web, mobile or single page app&mdash;a format that is perfect for publishing and sharing your individual API resource creations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be adding Product Hunt as an <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelism building block</a>, publishing my own API creations, as well as encouraging my API readers to do the same. The platform seems like a great way to show off your API, and generate buzz (or not) around each API resource we bring to the table.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.intuit.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/intuit/intuitbig.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the interoperability, automation, and reciprocity providers I track on <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/blog/2014/08/13/intuit-acquires-itduzzit-syncing-data-between-cloud-apps-gets-easier">itDuzzit has been acquired by the accounting platform Intuit</a>.  Usually acquisitions are just news, and not worthy of analysis here on API Evangelist, but I feel the itDuzzit acquisition is a significant sign when it comes to API providers, consumers, and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">reciprocity providers</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been seeing more <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">API providers offer IFTTT or Zapier integration as a default option, in their own developer hubs</a>. I think the Intuit acquisition of itDuzzit reflects this evolution in how APIs are deployed, and consumed, something that has been pushed forward by this new generation of API reciprocity providers.</p>
<p>The Intuit announcement recognizes that this new breed of reciprocity providers have the potential to reach beyond a core developer audience by:</p>
<blockquote><em>The itDuzzit technology allows multiple audiences to create sophisticated integrations with very little coding required.  With their technology combined with the range of QuickBooks platform services we already offer, the breadth and depth of integrations our partners can build will grow tremendously. itDuzzit&rsquo;s sophisticated rules-based engine really set them apart from the competition, and their technology benefits the entire QuickBooks Online ecosystem: third-party developers, accountants and small businesses.</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cloud.itduzzit.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/intuit/itduzzit.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The world of accounting seems like a great place to start when providing interoperability, automation, and reciprocity tools that are not just developers, but also empower end-users to use API. If you are as advanced as Zapier, <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/">even your reciprocity layer will have an API that developers</a>&nbsp;can&nbsp;put to use when taking advantage of the cross platform API integration and automation possibilities.</p>
<p>I will keep an eye on the <a href="https://developer.intuit.com">Intuit partner Platform</a>, and see what they end up doing with itDuzzit.  According to the press release, "<em>The Intuit and itDuzzit teams are already collaborating to fold the technology into the Intuit Partner Platform&rdquo;</em>, and hopefully we&rsquo;ll see some interesting API reciprocity patterns that I can highlight here on API Evangelist, and other API providers can follow when considering their own reciprocity layer for their own platform</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/vstudio" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/microsoft/visual-studio.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The Bing Developer Center team <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bingdevcenter/archive/2014/08/18/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-focuses-on-improving-productivity-within-the-experience.aspx">has released a pretty interesting pluginthat assist developers who use Visual Studio</a> when building web or mobile applications using APIs.</p>
<p>In an effort to make developers lives easier, the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a1166718-a2d9-4a48-a5fd-504ff4ad1b65">Bing Developer Assistant</a> now comes with integrated API code search that, <em>&ldquo;while coding, a relevant code snippet related to your current API will be automatically displayed in the IntelliSense window which is powered by Bing Code Search"</em>.</p>
<p><em>"Code snippets are short piece of code that you can easily learn and copy"</em>, and you can <em>"copy the code, or click the source URL to view where the code snippet comes from, or click "Search More" to find more code samples related to the API"</em>.  Which seems like it could easily be extended to other aspects of the API, using <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/">APIs.json url type</a>, allowing for the discovery of videos, how-to, and other supporting API resources.</p>
<p>The approach by the Bing Developer Center team&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-within-the-developers-ide/">reflects what I&rsquo;m seeing from Salesforce, Google, and other API IDE integrations</a>. I&rsquo;m interested in continuing to explore what role API definitions like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML</a> will play when it comes to API discovery via popular IDEs like Visual Studio.</p>
<p><a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ide-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I also envision <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> also taking a lead role when it comes to discovering new APIs, or pulling from a curated list of existing APIs, while programming within any IDE. There will also be an opportunity for IT, and development support staff to discovery API resources using <a href="http://apis.io">API search engines like APIs.io</a>, and then create their own internal APIs.json collection of sanctioned API resources from across public, partner and internal sources.</p>
<p>IDE API integration isn't something that will just be for the big players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google. As more API providers publish machine readable API definitions, complete with APIs.json indexes of these resources--we&rsquo;ll begin to see more niche IDE developers who are curating meaningful stacks of API resources from a variety of sources into a single, rich API development experience.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is one of the benefits of where we are currently headed with <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>.&nbsp;API providers can focus on making machine readable API definitions, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> collections. Then others can innovate in the deployment of tooling like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and IDE plugins like the Bing Developer Assistant for Microsoft Visual Studio, that make sure API resources are disocvered and put to use in everyday development environments.</p>

<p>I had someone ask me the other day if I had any numbers on how many APIs are used in a modern web or mobile applications--great question! I often refer to the growth in the number of APIs we use, but this is really just anecdotal, and not based on any real facts.</p>
<p>In August, as part of the&nbsp;lead up to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/APIStrat">@APIStrat</a>&nbsp;I am spending more time reaching out to dev shops in Chicago, with the most recent talks with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/18/how-are-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-bryson-pouw-at-blaze-portfolio/">Bryson Pouw at Blaze Portfolio</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">Dave Devitt at SYDCON</a>. In future conversation I will make sure and ask the dev shops how many APIs they use in the average app they deliver.</p>
<p>If you have any data on the average number of APIs used in web or mobile apps at your agency, or know of research or stories that talk about this, please let me know.  Until now, many of the numbers being reported in the API space are coming from providers, I think we need to start gathering, tracking on, and reporting on API usage from the API consumption side of the coin.</p>

<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> was designed to be a versatile API discovery format, not just a format for public API discovery via search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. An APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable index of APIs within a single developer hub, providing information on the API endpoints as well as any other supporting resources--there is no reason that all of this can&rsquo;t also be applied in a private setting.</p>
<p>APIs.json can easily be placed within a domain, subdomain, or at any network address, and be used to describe an internal collection of API resources, as well as bring in outside APIs. APIs.jsonbui excels at aggregating multiple, potentially disparate APIs, into a single coherent collection for use in development.</p>
<p>Using internal APIs.json files, a company, organization or governent agency can deploy an instance of an open source API search engine like APIs.io, or develop a custom API search tool that can aggregate the different APIs.json from each location, into a company wide API search and discovery destination.</p>
<p>An APIs.json provides a framework for referencing each APIs machine readable definition in Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML format, as well as other resources that internal developers will need to be successful, such as authentication info, SDKs, terms of service, and the multitude of other <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks</a>.</p>
<p>If you have public APIs, it will be a no brainer for you to generate machine readable API definitions for your APIs, and add them to a single, or potentially multiple <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> files for indexing. Even if you don&rsquo;t have public APis, you can put APIs.json to work improving your internal API discovery, while also opening up your API resources to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">other benefits of having machine readable API definitions</a>.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stacks.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I used to publish out a list of curated stories each week, and a listing of the top 25 APIs I was paying attention to during my regular monitoring of the API space to a site I called <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>. When i went to Washington DC last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, I suspended that weekly ritual, and never picked up after my world got back to normal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still monitoring about 1000 companies, with over 2000 total APIs, and curating the stories--I just don&rsquo;t take the time each week to publish them to The API Stack. In an effort to try and reboot the project, provide value to the API Evangelist network, as well as to you my loayal reader, I've republished a new reflection of my work at the Github project. Right now it just lists 819 of the companies who are doing interesting things with APis in 114 categories.</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks I will be reviewing each of these 819 companies APIs, and as I validate them, I will publish more detail. You can search for General Services Administration (GSA), under the <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=federal-stack">Federal Stack</a> to see an example of this work in action. I link to each of the GSA APIs, across multiple domains, and include a machine readable API definition as well as interactive documentation generated from the definition.</p>
<p>The API Stack will continue to be a window into my API targeting and monitoring, and I will update regularly as I have time. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that going forward, the API space needs to focus on the quality of APIs, and not just the number of APIs available, and <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a> reflects this way of thinking, playing out in my own work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blaze-portfolio/atom-align-blaze-portfolio.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently talked with Bryson Pouw (<a href="https://twitter.com/bpouw">@bpouw</a>), Founder / CEO at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com">Blaze Portfolio Systems</a> in Chicago about how his portfolio management and trading technology company sees the world of APIs. Last week <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">I had talked with Dave Devitt (@sydcon), President at SYDCON, a web development shop</a>, and this week I was very interested to hear Bryson&rsquo;s view on APIs, because his company is a little more niche, focusing specifically on the needs of the investment professional.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com/features/model-rebalancing">Atom Align</a>, the Blaze Portfolio Systems flagship product is looking to help investment professionals better manage their portfolios, and a big enabler of this is the <a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com/atom-align-api">Atom Align API</a>,&nbsp;which provides programmatic access to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Information Queries</strong> &ndash; Obtain the list of portfolios, orders, brokers, and securities</li>
<li><strong>Trade Orders</strong> &ndash; Place, execute, cancel, and allocate trade orders</li>
<li><strong>Manage Trade Extracts </strong>&ndash; Create and download trade extract file</li>
</ul>
<p>The Atom Align API is only made available to trusted Blaze Portfolio partners and clients upon request, while also being used internally to drive system integrations. This approach to API design, as the core for specialty, or even widely available web and mobile applications, <a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-market-graph.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>is the signature of a software development shop that has evolved and realized that a core API stack is essential for internal, as well as external integrations&mdash;APIs aren&rsquo;t just for public consumption when it comes to todays dev shop operations.</p>
<p>Beyond their own internal Atom Align API, Blaze Portfolio also uses several other financial related APIs as part of their core operations. APIs are core to the Atom Align secret sauce, aggregating, refining, and making sense of markets by pulling data and content from multiple API sources, most notably <a href="ttp://www.xignite.com/">financial data from Xignite</a>.  You can&rsquo;t be an investment professional in 2014 without having the right technology in your toolbox, and Blaze Portfolio has done well aggregating financial data from public API sources, into tje tool the pros are needing.</p>
<p>Blaze Portfolio Systems designing, deploying, and managing their own internal APIs, as well as consuming multiple publicly available APIs, provides an interesting blueprint that other software development shops can follow. There is money to be made in managing your own API infrastructure, using the best of breed, publicly available data and API sources--then craft it all into your own API driven software solution that can deliver web, mobile, or even device based solutions for niche or mainstream customers.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time looking for good quality logos to represent the companies I track on and write stories about. I have a certain vision in my head about how I want company listings and detail pages to look across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>&mdash;something that takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>To support this vision, I spend a lot of time looking for logos. Sometimes you can find them in the header of a website, but often times they are poor quality, not configured to be standalone, or difficult to get at for any number of other reasons--making my work a lot tougher.</p>
<p>I published a new list of 819 companies who are doing interesting things with APIs that I call&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>. After publishing the project, <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>, one of the <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=travel-stack">travel API providers</a>&nbsp;listed, tweeted at me asking if I could replace their logo with a better quality one from their <a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/logos">official logo page</a>--I did so very quickly!</p>
<p>I sure love me a good logo and branding page for an API. It makes my life easier, by giving me a single place to go get high quality logos, without having to open up my image editor. I wish that more API platforms would have a well designed logo page like <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote about&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/what-is-an-api-first-strategy-adding-some-dimensions-to-this-new-question/">What Is An API First Strategy? Adding Some Dimensions To This New Question</a> the other day after talking with <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. One of the commonets on the post was&nbsp;from my friend Logan Powell (<a href="https://twitter.com/logantpowell">@logantpowell</a>), and I think it was so good, that it deserves its own post. I will let Logan do the talking:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To supplement the pool of meaning here, I would like to add that an API-first strategy is one where the API serves as both a pattern of an enterprises IT architecture as well as catalyst for engagement.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In a nutshell, an API-first strategy is a systems paradigm shift</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>-- from a centralized, engineered mechanical system made up of subordinate parts serving as means to deliberately designed ends</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>-- to a decentralized, organic and evolving ecosystem where the individual actors can be spontaneously enfranchised or co-opted by any other actor / set of actors to serve new purposes.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>This allows the system to be more flexible, respond more quickly and behave more dynamically to suit unforeseen purposes. I believe the API-first paradigm is thereby more scalable by nature.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Prudent separation of information from presentation through APIs should be the first and next step for most organizations with large IT infrastructures. To be more specific, this provides a number of efficiency benefits. To just name a few: by modulating infrastructure with solid APIs, stakeholders can create / hack together production-ready applications faster, more securely and more reliably.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This approach warrants a new form of IT team protocol wherein the curation of APIs is front-and-center to their role. When designing a new product / service, the design of it's API should be commensurate. As the product or service makes it's way to production, making sure the API is well documented, easy to use / as conventional as possible, hooked up with analytics, secure and prepared to scale should be a given (these are frequently included in any self-respecting API management solution). In so doing, not only might the enterprise benefit from the speedier and more rewarding 'dog-fooding' of these services / resources, if they ever decide to commercialize or publicize / open them up to users outside their organization (the decision to flip the switch itself being informed by the aforementioned analytics), it's just an invite / key request away.</em></p>
<p>Logan works in the federal government, on some pretty high value open data and API projects, and he is on the frontline for how APIs can be a catalyst for change within enterprise IT, but also connect externally in some meaningful ways--in short he knows his stuff, and is helping internalize APIs across the federal government.</p>
<p>What Logan describes IS why I believe so paassionately in APIs. In my mind It is the culural change, with an eye towards exernal interactions and conversations that make APIs work, and while the tech of APIs is critical, it is the cultural, organizational, and ultimately the human aspects of APIs that make the biggest impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/swagger-apisjson-and-review-for-the-new-developertradegov/">coordinating with the development team for Developer.Trade.Gov today</a>, providing them with a review of their new developer area, and some suggestions on how to make their APIs, and developer more usable.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> is published as a <a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal">Github repository</a>, using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to actually deliver the website. The feedback I&rsquo;ve been giving to the team, has been done through the <a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal/issues">Github issue management for the repository</a>.</p>
<p>One piece of feedback I left was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I love that when I land on your home page, I get a brief description of what developer.trade.gov delivers, the probem is that the description is below the fold on some monitors, leaving just the 3 links available to see.</em></p>
<p><em>I'd switch the description and links, putting description at the top....and the first thing your eyes are drawn to. You'd be surprised how valuable this can be. Simple, but important.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I submitted&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal/issues/20#issue-40274346">the suggestion 5 hours ago</a>, and I just received an update that the issue was closed, and my suggestions were incorporated. When you go to the <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> website now, you will see the text, with links to the right&mdash;creating a much more clean, informative, and usable way to deliver the most valuable real estate you have in your developer hub. It was a small, but quick and meaningful change to a government website.</p>
<p>Imagine if we could help other agencies see the benefit of publishing small, simple websites, developer hubs, single page apps, and other projects to Github, and manage their feedback loops via Github issues. What types of improvements in delivering government services would we see? What cost savings could be realized across government?</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/trade-gov/developer-trade-gov.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I got a gentle ping today, as I often do when there is a new developer hub or API launched in the federal government. This time it was located within the Department of Commerce, for the International Trade Administration, and was a new developer area, with five APIs at <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a>.</p>
<p>I quickly went through the new developer area, which I consider passing the test for a minimum viable developer area, possessing all the essential building blocks an API developer hub needs. The only places I feel it fell short is in the feedback loop, and providing machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs.</p>
<p>I submitted my feedback as Github issues, on the repository for the developer hub, but when it comes to machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs, I know how easy this is, so rather than just submit issues, I figured I'd get to work generating the machine readable API definitions for Developer.Trade.Gov, and demonstrate what was possible. As I do with all of my work, I setup a <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/">subdomain, and Github repository</a>, to store all of my work, and got to work on each of the five APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/market-research-library.html">Market Research Library</a> (<a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/definitions/market-research-library.json">Swagger</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/ita-office-locations.html">ITA Offices &amp; Centers</a> (<a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/definitions/ita-offices-and-centers.json">Swagger</a>)</li>
<li>Trade Events</li>
<li>Trade Leads</li>
<li>Trade News &amp; Articles</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I chose to use <a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger</a> for creating my machine readable API definitions, and while I was waiting for the Github commit to take for the Market Research Library API Swagger definition + Swagger UI, I got to work on the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API. As I was finishing up, I reloaded the <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/market-research-library-api.html">interactive docs for the Market Research Library API</a>, and got the dreaded CORS warning:</p>
<blockquote><em>Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://api.trade.gov/market_research_library/search?keyword=travel. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.</em></blockquote>
<p>That is where the fun ends for me. I can keep creating Swagger specs for the other three APIs, but I won&rsquo;t be able to play with them until I create a proxy to make calls through, and open up CORS on my end. I will make time to do this over the weekend, but until then the fun stops. I am hoping they will also open up CORS, but I'm sure it will take a while.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>To wrap up my work, I also generated an <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json file for the Developer.Trade.Gov domain</a>, listing the details for both the Market Research Library API, and the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API--opening up the APIs to discovery by API search engines like APIs.io. When Developer.Trade.Gov publishes the APIs.json + Swagger specs under their domain, it will become more authoratative and given prominence in search engine results.</p>
<p>In about 2 hours, I was able to review a new developer area, and five APIs, generate two swagger specs, 1 APIs.json, publish to a Github repository where I launched interactive documentation for each of the two APIs, and wrap up with this story of my work. As with all of my work, you can find all of this <a href="https://github.com/commerce-data/developer.trade.gov">work at the Github repository,</a> and the best part is, when I pick the work back up, it is all in one location, <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/blog/">with complete notes about what I did</a>&mdash;helping me understand where I left off, in addition to allowing anyone else to step in and learn from the process.</p>

<p>I spoke with Phil Windley (<a href="https://twitter.com/windley">@windley</a>) over at <a href="http://byu.edu">Brigham Young University (BYU)</a> about their API strategy this morning. BYU is bringing together API providers and consumers, to establish a coordinated strategy for delivering designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs across campus--an effort being led by <a href="http://cio.byu.edu/">CIO Kelly Flannagan</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/kelflanagan">@kelflanagan</a>).</p>
<p>As part of their latest API effort, BYU is focusing in on the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to campus resources:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Students</li>
<li>Instructors</li>
<li>Classrooms</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Courses</li>

<p>The API team is still struggling with a handful of technical details like how to deal with unique identifiers, and relationship between resources, but overall they are on a healthy path when it comes to getting their API designed, and deployed for use at the institution. I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how fast they progress with a top down approach to APIs, vs the bottom up efforts I&rsquo;m seeing at institutions like <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>.</p>
<p>I will be talking their team regularly, about their design, deployment, management, and integration strategy. I want to make sure and document the process all along the way, and share real-time updates that other universities can follow along, or possibly collaborate with us when it comes to establishing some common API patterns we can share and re-use across higher educational institutions.</p>
<p>Look for any stories out of BYU, here on API Evangelist, or over at my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university API research site</a>, and if you are doing any API work at your school, I'd love to know more about it.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I just wrote a piece on r<a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/13/replacing-legacy-systems-with-apis-at-the-department-of-veteran-affairs/">eplacing legacy systems at the VA using APIs</a>, where one of the systemic constraints in place that restricts the modernizzation VA systems using API is purely about money, and more specifically the color of money. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the detail of the topic, but in short the color of money is: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_procurement_in_the_United_States">Money appropriated for one purpose cannot be used for a different purpose, according to the Purpose Act (31 U.S.C. &sect; 1301)</a>.</p>
<p>In short, if $50M was given to sustain an existing legacy system, and that money cannot be re-appropriated, and applied to the newer system, what incentive is there to ever get rid of legacy VA systems, or modernize any government system for that matter? Whether it is usng APIs, or anything else. Newer approaches to using technology are difficult to accept when you are working hard to accomplished your job each day, but if you already have $50M in budget to a specific job, and that job won&rsquo;t go away, unless you choose to make it go away, guess what happens? Nothing changes&hellip;hmmm?</p>
<p>As I said before, I don&rsquo;t give a shit if you deploy APIs from the ground up, or excite via a presidential mandates from the top down, if you have incentives in place for employees to do the opposite, based upon how money is allocated, you won&rsquo;t be changing any behavior or culture&mdash;you are wasting your energy. I don&rsquo;t care how excited I get any one individual, team or department about the potential of APIs bundled with new systems, if it means their job is going away&mdash;too bad, nobody will give a shit.</p>
<p>Think about this scenario, then consider that <a href="https://www.voa.va.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DocumentID=1942">$1,810M of the 3,323M overall VA budget (54%) is sustainment</a>. Granted this isn't all IT system sustainment, but still over half of the budget is allocated to keep shit the same as it is. Imagine what environment this creates for the acceptance of modernization efforts at VA.</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.</p>

<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>One of the jobs I was tasked with at the VA as a PIF, was taking inventory of the web services within the agency. When asking folks where these web services were, I was directed to various IT Leads on different groups, each giving one or two more locations I could look for word, excel, or other PDFs talking about web services used in projects and known systems. Most of the time these were redundant lists, pointing me to the same 5 web services, and omitting 20-30 that were actually in use for a project.</p>
<p>At one point I was given the contact information for a lady who had been working for two years on a centralized web registry project, that would be the holy grail of web service discovery at the VA. This was it! It was what I was looking for, until I sat in on the weekly call where this project got a 10 minute update, demonstrating that the registry was still about defining the how and what of the registry, and never has actually moved to cataloging actual web services in the wild at the VA. ;-(</p>
<p>Then one day I was introduced to a gentlemen, that was in a back office, in an unmarked cubicle, who seemed to know where most of the web services were, the one difference with this person was that they were a contractor, and not an employee. One thing you hear about, but do not experience fully until you work in government is the line between government employee and contractor&mdash;in meetings, and conversations you know who is who (it is pretty clar), but when it comes to finding APIs, I&rsquo;m sorry the contractors know where everything is at. This contractor had some pretty interesting lists of what web services were in operation, where they were, and which groups at VA owned them, including up to date contact info. These contractors also had their finger on the pulse of any project that was potentially moving the web services converations forward, including the global registry.</p>
<p>Overall I was surprised at how IT groups knew of their own web services, could care less about the web services of other groups, but contractors new where all the web service were across the groups. I was closing in on 500 web services on my list before <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/11/15/why-i-exited-my-presidential-innovation-fellowship/">I left during the shutdown</a>, and I wonder how many else I would have found if I kept up the good fight. This mission had nothing do with API, except that web services are often compared to APis, I was purely taking inventory of what was already in place, a process that went far beyond just technical inventory, and shed light on some serious business and political flaws within operations at the VA.</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-onion.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the byproducts of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/10/where-will-your-api-stand-in-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-debate/">Oracle vs Google API copyright case</a>, was a realization that many API providers and consumer do not understand the layers of the API stack, let alone the potential licensing considerations for each layer of the API onion. I wouldn't just blame API providers, and consumers, I&rsquo;m still getting a grasp on all of this, which is why I'm blogging about the subject.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick crack at defining the layers to the potential API licensing onion:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Data</strong> - What is the licensing for the actual data returned and collected by an API? I&rsquo;m still learning about the ways to license your data, and the <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/faq/licenses/">Open Data Commons provides some guidance in this area</a>, while others feel that your data can just as be easily licensed using <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licensing.</li>
<li><strong>Data Model </strong>- The separation between data and its data model can be hard to see, where in reality end-users may own their data, but the order and structure of it can be owned by the originating application. If this layer is a concern, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, or other copyright options should be considered. </li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - Server side API code is the core of any API operations, and should be licensed accordingly using <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses">common open source software licens</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">es</span>&nbsp;when appropriate. However I would add that this is the one layer in the API stack where a proprietary licensing could make sense, but the rest of the stack should always be licensed as open as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Interface</strong> - The separation between the API and its surface area is important, and is something that is just becoming relevant with the Oracle v Google copyright case. Understanding the importance of an openly licensed surface area, is essential to the health of any API stack, and should be kep as open as possible, even when associated with a proprietary API backend. This is why we started <a href="http://apicommons.org">API commons</a>, to help API providers take a stance on the license of the surface area of the API stack.</li>
<li><strong>Clients</strong> - As with server side code, you should apply<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses"> common open source software licensing</a>&nbsp;to client code when appropriate, but your client code samples, libraries and SDKs should never be licensed in a proprietary way, encouraging implementation for any commercial integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario we are talking about a purely data API, if you are serving up some sort of programmatic resource, things might be different. My goal is to just try and understand the separation between the API layers, and apply some thoughts on how licenses can be applied to open, or possibly close access and constraint an APIs operation.</p>
<p>Much like other political building blocks of the API ecosystem, licensing in the aPI stack can be good, bad, or neutral. In the end, regardless of your stance I think it is important to have an open conversation about how our API stack is licensed, so that your consumers can better understand what they are in for.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/digital-strategy/logos/va.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, slowly bringing them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>On deck are my thoughts on <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">replacing legacy systems with APIs</span></em>, at the Department of Veteran Affairs. In the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, one of the motivations for deploying APIs, is to assist in the evolution, and replacement of legacy systems. The theory is, you have older system that needs to be replaced, and you can wrap in a modern web API, and slowly switch any desktop, web, mobile or other client system to use the new API&mdash;then you build out newer backend system, and make the switch in the API layer from the legacy to the newer backend system, leaving everything operating as expected. API magic!</p>
<p>I'm used to hostile environments to this way of thinking, but most times in the private sector there are other business objectives that can be leveraged to get legacy system owners to get on board with a shift towards API deployment&mdash;I saw no incentive for this practice in the VA environment, where in reality there are incentives for IT, and business owners, as well as 3rd party contractors to keep legacy systems in place, not replace them. There are a variety of motivation for existing VA workers to keep existing systems in place, ranging from not understanding how the system works, to budgetary restrictions on how money flows in support of this pro-sustainment culture.</p>
<p>Here is an example. There is old database for storing of a specific type of document, a database that X amount of existing desktop, server, web, or even mobile systems depend on. If I move in and create an API, that allows for reading and writing of data into this database, then work with all X of the legacy systems to use the API instead of a direct database connection&mdash;in theory I can now work to dismantle the legacy database, and replace with a newer, modern backend database. In most IT operations, this approach will then allow me to replace, modernize and evolve upon an existing legacy system. This is a common view of technologists who are purely looking through a technical lens, and ignoring the existing business and political constraints that exist in some companies, organizations, insitutions and government agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the real world, you have staff, budgets, workflows, and decision making processes that are already in place. Let&rsquo;s say this legacy database had $50M a year allocated in budget for its operation, and I replace with a newer database, plus API, which operates for $10M a year&mdash;you&rsquo;d think I get to reallocate the staff, budget, and other resources to developing newer mobile apps, and other system with my newly liberated $40M. Right? Nope&hellip;that money goes away, and those people have no interest in moving from supporting a COBOL system, to supporting a new MongoDB + Node.js API that is driving a Swift iPhone app. ;-(</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large companies, organizations, institutions and government agencies operate, that are in conflict with what an API philosphy can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin to weave my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.</p>

<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I was given three projects when I started work at the VA: 1) Inventory data assets 2) Inventory web services 3) Move forward D2D, a forms web service that would allow VA hospitals and Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to submit forms through the claims process on behalf of  veteran.</p>
<p>The most prevalent illness I witnessed across these three efforts was a unwillingness to trust outside groups (even VSOs and hospitals), and a lack of desire to share data and resources to anyone outside of the VA (ironically except contractors), to the point where groups seem to take defensive positions around what they did on behalf of our veterans. This culture makes for some pretty toxic environments, I personally feel contributing to much of the problems we&rsquo;ve seen bubble up into the public media space of late.</p>
<p>While work at the VA you constantly hear about the VA claims backlog, and how we need to optimize, but when you bring up sharing data, or resources to other federal agencies, trusted external partners like hospitals, and VSO&rsquo;s you get pushback with concerns of security, personally identifiable information (PII), etc. All which are valid claims, but there are proven ways to mitigate these risks through Identify and Access Management (IAM), which is another whole post in itself. You start feeling crazy when you get pushback for arguing that a doctor should be able to submit disability questionnaires via an iPad application, that uses an existing VA API, in a way that securely authenticates the doctor.</p>
<p>As a result of other system, cultural issues, and mistakes made in the past, VA employees and contractors are extremely adverse to opening up to the outside world, even if it can help. I kept <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/vatheft/">hearing references to the 2006 data breach</a> as a reason to keep systems locked down, where an employee brought a laptop home, affecting 26M individuals. This horror story, plus a variety of other cultural issues are keeping VA staff from accepting any new way of thinking, even if it could help reduce their workload, improve the claims process, and better serve the veterans and their families.</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.</p>

<p>I get regular requests to add APIs to my website via email, Twitter, and carrier pigeon. I have an Evernote that I put these requests into, and as I have time, I review, then possibly add to the appropriate API Evangelist network project.</p>
<p>To support this process, I've crafted a new response email to requests I get, that I thought I would share with everyone:</p>

<p>Sure thing. It could take me a day or two, or maybe up to a week.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to fork any of the 60+ API Evangelist network projects, and add to the JSON list that is driving the listing, they are all under the /data folder. Otherwise I'll add as I have time in the next week.</p>
<p>Once you submit your pull request, if your company listing is relevant to the research I&rsquo;m doing, I will accept your addition. No guarantees, so make sure it will provide value to not just my research, but to the API community.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing information about your API!</p>

<p>It is a little known fact that all <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ plus of my research projects</a> run as Github repositories, using Github and Jekyll to drive the overall website and blog.

        <span class="post-date">12 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-platform-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was taking another look at the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a> yesterday, and stumbled across <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/?_ga=1.186468064.812314948.1407779892">Google Cloud Endpoints</a>. It was something I saw come across my feeds, but really didn&rsquo;t give it the time it needed to see what it was all about.  With the new Google Cloud Endpoints, Google is making a strong push to be not just an API deployment provider, but their approach also reflects what I&rsquo;d consider to be an evolution of backend as a service (BaaS) deployment.</p>
<p>I think Google describes their service better than I can do it justice:</p>
<blockquote><em>Google Cloud Endpoints consists of tools, libraries and capabilities that allow you to generate APIs and client libraries from an App Engine application, referred to as an API backend, to simplify client access to data from other applications. Endpoints makes it easier to create a web backend for web clients and mobile clients such as Android or Apple's iOS.</em></blockquote>
<p>While much of the Google Cloud Platform offering looks a lot like the cloud offering over at Amazon Web Services, AWS definitely does not have API deployment as a service, baked into their cloud stack, like Google does with Google Cloud Endpoints.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-endpoints-architecture.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Google puts an emphasis on API endpoint deployment for mobile purposes, but leaves it open to be used in JavaScript as well&mdash;which seems a little limiting, since you could call same endpoints in any language. Oh well, I&rsquo;m not writing their marketing.</p>
<blockquote><em>..the API backend is an App Engine app that performs business logic and other functions for Android and iOS clients, as well as JavaScript web clients. The functionality of the backend is made available to clients through Endpoints, which exposes an API that clients can call.</em></blockquote>
<p>Google provides SDKs for Android, iOS, and JavaScript, as well as a very Java heavy development process using <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/getstarted/backend/create_project">Maven</a>, combined with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/cloud_endpoints">Google Plugin for Eclipse</a>, which&nbsp;is used to design, develop, and deploy your APIs to <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.</p>
<p>All Google has to do now, is open up the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Console</a>&nbsp;as a Google Cloud Endpoints management console, giving developers on the Google Cloud Platform the ability to design, deploy, and manage their APIs. Then if Google baked in <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">Google Discovery</a> services for all Google Cloud Endpoints, developers would have a pretty slick discovery layer on top of their cloud API stacks. Hell, all you need then is to allow generation of <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> for each collection, and boom you have a pretty complete API design, deployment, management, and discovery platform in the clouds.</p>
<p>Now that Google is added to my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment research</a>, I will be keeping a closer eye on what they are doing in respects to being a cloud API platform.</p>

<p>I hear this phrase used more and more lately, &ldquo;An API First Strategy&rdquo;. It is something you hear from startups like <a href="https://www.lob.com/blog/api-first-development-makes-lob-more-productive">printing API LOB</a>, to <a href="https://developer.pearson.com/blog/creating-a-single-platform-for-all-pearson-apis/">established players like Pearson</a>, all the way up to <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F at the GSA in Washington DC</a>, but what is API first? Much like APIs in general, an API first strategy is something that will mean something different to each company, organization, government agency, or individual.</p>
<p>From my view, the most common interpretation of API first will be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Develop an API First</strong> - Before you build your website, web, mobile or single page application you develop an API first, then you get to work on defining the channels you will be making the API resources available on.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had an interesting conversation today with the 18F team in Washington DC, and they illuminated some other possible dimensions to the API first conversation for me, that I wanted to explore a little:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Design Your API First</strong> - Using tools like <a href="http://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, and API definition formats like <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a>, you kick off discussion with customers, generate user stories, and mockup your API, and even your web or mobile app interfaces, using your mock API.</li>
<li><strong>API First In Open Source Software -</strong> Encouraging the development and use of open source software solutions similar to Wordpress, that have API by default, so when agencies deploy them, they always have an API as part of their first steps for making access and integration decision&mdash;something that can drastically shift what is possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to help small business, non-profit organizations, and government of all shapes and sizes understand the benefits of an API first strategy, so having conversation with API leaders like 18F, and getting their view on what API first means is essential to my storytelling process. How do you view API first at your company? How has your development lifecycle evolved since embracing APIs? Let me know, I&rsquo;m curious to hear other views on the phrase.</p>
<p>All three of the dimensions laid out above are very appealing to me. I am big advocate for "API first being" about API design, open source software architectural patterns, or just a way of life before you consider connecting any web, mobile, or single page app to a back-end system. To me, API is more about conversation, collaboration, and access to ideas and resources, before we even get to any technical definition of what an API can be&mdash;making API first strategies more about philosophy and methodology, rather than what technical component you develop first.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/08/next-stable-version-of-apisjson--apisio-is-ready--are-your-apis-discoverable/">published the story last night on finalizing the most recent version of the API discovery format APIs.json</a>, and the support for it in the open source API search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Steve and I are done messing with the format for a while, and want to encourage API providers to begin describing their APIs using the open format.</p>
<p>After publishing the story last night, I also had an interesting comment on Google+ from <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JonasHellstr%C3%B6m/posts">Jonas Hellstr&ouml;m</a>:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apis-json-timeline.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>The question got me thinking about how APIs.json rolled out. As with <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, APIs.json started as a conversation between Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I. Around the beginning of April we combined our notes on what each of us envisioned when it came to API discovery, establishing the first APIs.json definition with the timeline going roughly like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>April 2014&nbsp;</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Steve and I established version .11 of APIs.json</li>
<li>We emailed a handful of smart folks that we trusted for feedback</li>
<li>Crafted version .12 of APIs.json</li>
<li>Developed <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>May 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>We <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/05/20/announcing-apisjson-at-gluecon-2014/">launched API.json at Gluecon</a> in Broomfield, CO</li>
<li>Encouraged discussion via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apisjson">APIs.json Google Group</a></li>
<li>Encouraged feedback via the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">Github issue management</a> on APIs.json repo</li>
<li>Cotinued email Conversations</li>
<li>Established a Twitter presence for <a href="https://twitter.com/apisjson">@apisjson</a></li>
<li>Presented as part of session at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">API Days in Barcelona, Spain</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>June 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Establish version 0.13 of APIs.json</li>
<li>Continued discussion on Google Group</li>
<li>Continued feedback on Github issue management</li>
<li>Continued email conversations&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>July 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Conducted a session on API discovery, including APIs.json at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">APICraft</a> in Detroit</li>
<li>Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) for the work on the JSON schema (thank you Tony!)</li>
<li>Established version <a href="http://apisjson.org/format/apisjson_0.14.txt">0.14 of APIs.json</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>August 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Updated APIs.json for API Evangelist network to version 0.14</li>
<li>Updated APIs.io to support version 0.14 of APIs.json</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been an interesting five months. I like to record things like this while they are fresh in my mind, because as time moves on, the details fade into the past. I feel like if I do not capture the moment, it will be forgotten and it will be like it never happened.</p>
<p>I think we got the feedback from the community we needed to get to the first stable version, and I want to thank&nbsp;@fehguy, @mamund, @darrel_miller, @OriPekelman, @xmlgrrl, @johnmusser, and the attendees at Gluecon, APIDays, and APICraft for listening, and providing feedback. Also thanks to&nbsp;Jonas Hellstr&ouml;m for your great question!</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> looks like in 2015--it is a very exciting time!</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.sydcon.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chicago/sydcon/sydcon-web-development.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just talked with Dave Devitt (<a href="https://twitter.com/sydcon">@sydcon</a>), President at <a title="SYDCON web development inc. in Chicago" href="http://www.sydcon.com/">SYDCON Web Development, Inc. in Chicago</a> about how his web and mobile development shop sees the world APIs. I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for stories about how the everyday person on the ground at startups, all the way up to the federal government, actually see the world of APIs, and I was pleased that Dave could make some time to share his view of APIs with me.</p>
<p>First, Dave said something I found very interesting when we first started our conversation. He said they were a &ldquo;web development shop&rdquo;, not in the the sense that they build websites, but that they develop applications that use the web for their operations.  I think this is an important distinction when we start putting developers  into buckets, and it isn&rsquo;t always as straightforward as building websites, web applications, mobile, single page or Internet of Things apps&mdash;we are now building software that uses the Internet for communication, something that will inevitably use all of these channels (and more).</p>
<p>When it comes to API usage at SYDCON, they primarily use what we all call public APIs for driving commerce. Whether it is B2B or B2C, Dave&rsquo;s team is using APIs to sell products, integrate with payment systems like Authorize.net and PayPal, activating and validating of gift cards. Whether it is the nature of development or just a reflection on the type of customers SYDCON has, commerce is a pretty clear motivator for public API integration. The modern web API movement was started by commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Paypal, and 14 years in it makes sense that commerce is a major driver of development at smaller develop shops.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sydcon"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chicago/sydcon/dave-nevitt-sydcon.jpeg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Beyond commerce, the main usage of APIs at SYDCON is about opening up access to internal resources that exist within their client systems, and making them available to buid apps on top of. Dave provided an example of a oil &amp; gas worker who uses one of the mobile applications they&rsquo;ve developed to scan the barcode of a 4 inch PVC pipe, and using an API the mobile application is then able to access the company&rsquo;s internal product database and return information to the worker looking to get their job done, with the assistance of the mobile app they've developed. APIs are how they deliver the resources they need for the mobile applications they develop for their customers. Period. It can be products in a database, or media across servers, APIs are how these reousrces are delivered to the web enabled applications SYDCON delivers.</p>
<p>It was good to hear the stories from Dave at <a title="SYDCON web development inc. in Chicago" href="http://www.sydcon.com/">SYDCON</a>, and understand what API usage looks like on the ground at a Chicago area application dev shop. I think we can easily get blind to what the mainstream developers are needing when it comes to APIs, being so close to the Silicon Valley echo chamber, as well as playing a part in some of the bleeding edge aspects of the API sector. Talking with people like Dave who actually are making a living developing APIs, and web enabled applications, whether it is a web or mobile, is extremely valuable to me when I am working to better understand the realities of the API space.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time today Dave. I have calls scheduled with other web and mobile development shops, as well as some IT and analytics firms, as I lead up to the API conversations we will be having at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago</a>. The event is titled &ldquo;APIs Go Mainstream&rdquo;, so I think that conversations with small and medium sized development shops about how APIs are impacting their day to day worlds are super relevant, and something the larger API industry should tune into.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-platform-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was browsing through <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google&rsquo;s Cloud Platform</a>, in the 15 minute lead up to a preliminary discussion with Google about being an evangelist for the platform (another story), and I saw a useful pattern from the "customers" section for publishing API customer case studies--something I wanted to share with you.</p>
<p>This pattern was evident in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/redbus/">Travel Agency Masters Big Data with Google BigQuery case study</a>. I think the format for the case study provides a simple format that other API providers might consider following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A catchy summary title&nbsp;</li>
<li>Challenge the company faced&nbsp;</li>
<li>Solution to the problem&nbsp;</li>
<li>A quote from company&nbsp;</li>
<li>Results from the solution</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/redbus/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-cloud-platform/logo-redbus.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, Google provides an "At a Glance" summary in the left hand bar, for those busy folks who don't have the time to read case studies, providing a quick summary of the case study:</p>
<ul>
<li>What they wanted to do&nbsp;</li>
<li>What they did&nbsp;</li>
<li>What they accomplished&nbsp;</li>
<li>About API service used</li>
</ul>
<p>The outline for the case study, as well as the summary version is a nice, simple format that any API provider could use to when crafting their own API case study experience. The format allows for easy scanning by visitors, which allows for us busy folks to read, or quickly scan multiple case studies--giving more context to the potential value an API will deliver.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Steve (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>), Nicolas (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a>), and I have been working hard to gather all the feedback from some very smart folks on the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">API.json format</a>. Now we are stoked to finally announce that we have the <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">0.14 version</a> ready for prime time. Our goal with the first version of APIs.json, was to just get the idea out there to get feedback from the community, and after four iterations, we feel like the format is now something the community can really build on.</p>
<p>First, lets recap, what is APIs.json? APIs.json is a machine readable JSON file that lives in the root of your domain, and describes your APIs and its supporting API program.</p>
<p>Think of APIs.json as a <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/">robots.txt</a>, or <a href="http://www.google.com/sitemap.xml">sitemap.xml</a> from Google, but instead of describing all the pages of your website, an APIs.json describes your developer portal, all available APIs, and the supporting building blocks of your API program--allowing you to describe your API efforts whether it is a public, or private affair. The goal is simply to provide a machine readable description, that any search engine can crawl, and make sense of your overall API program, and each individual API resource.</p>
<p>The real power of APIs.json lies in the properties that you can apply to your APIs. We wanted to start with providing basic links meant for humans, like a link to the API signup page, or documentation, but then quickly provide machine readable elements like a <a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger specification</a>, or <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a> manifest. However we don&rsquo;t want to define and control all of the properties you use to describe your APIs, and while we have a <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues/44">short list of additional properties</a> that we are adding in on the next version, you can use any property you like just by adding x- to your own type label.</p>
<p><a href="http://apis.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-io/apis-io.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Along with the <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">APIs.json 0.14</a> release, the API search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> also supports the latest APIs.json format. You can now validate your APIs.json 0.14, and submit your API.json for indexing using the APIs.io interface or API (mind blown). Your APIs.json will be your gateway to API discovery in the future, and since <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> is an open source API search engine, it will just be the first of a wave of new API search engines to emerge, built on the APIs.json format.</p>
<p>While we will be making slight changes in coming versions of APIs.json, we feel like the format is now ready for prime time, and we encourage the entire API community to begin participating in the next generation of <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a>, where your API, and the details of your API program are machine readable, and discoverable, in a single, known location at your company, organization, or agencies &nbsp;public or private domain.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-connector.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing an increase in the number of API deployment services this year, such as startups like <a href="http://bit.ly/1jLr1Pf">StrongLoop</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>. These companies are looking to help all of us deploy APIs from common systems, often without the need for IT or programming resources.</p>
<p>The providers I&rsquo;m seeing emerge are catering to some of the lowest hanging fruit for deploying APIs. The commonly used, and easiest to access systems, that contain the valuable content, data, and media we need to make accessible via APIs.</p>
<p>The common source for many of these API deploy solutions are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Excel Spreadsheet&nbsp;with</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://sheetlabs.com">SheetLabs</a></li>
<li><strong>Google Spreadsheet&nbsp;from</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a></li>
<li><strong>Database&nbsp;At The</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/">Dream Factory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These common information sources, represent the places where the average person in any size company, organization or government agency will be storing their valuable resources.  It makes sense that this new wave of API deployment startups would target these services.</p>
<p>If you consider every system integration option that classic API gateways have delivered, it provides a good reference for finding opportunities for building independent API deployment solutions, that if done right, could be a startup all by itself.</p>
<p>Not all companies can afford a full API gateway solution, and their needs are too small for a gateway. There is an emerging opportunity to help people quickly deploy APIs from common sources like spreadsheet, database, file stores, as well as more unique sources like specialty CMS and CRM systems.</p>
<p>Sometimes I like to look at the expanding API universe as a result of the SOA big bang, where all the tools that were in your SOA toolbox, being liberated, and available as independent services that you can get from an increasing number of new API deployment startups.</p>

<p>In preparation for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago, September 24-26th</a>, I did a little research on where the good beers, and specifically the kick-ass IPAs can be found. You may not know, but in addition to being the API Evangelist, I am also the <a href="http://ipaevangelist.com">IPA Evangelist</a> (plan b career path), and I'm always interested in knowing where the killer IPAs are, in addition to knowing where to find the best APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While in Chicago we want to be able to have the tasiest beer possible at the conference, while also having the best options for finding good beer and food after the event to network and socialize with the 600+ folks that will be at #APIStrat. To prepare for #APIStrat I found 32 local Chicago breweries:</p>

<p>A blog is such a simple thing, but when it comes to the world of APIs, it can be one of the most important signals for whether or not an API is worthy of integration, or you should just move on and continue looking for another API to use. I know many folks will dismiss that a blog is so relevant, especially if they are coming from IT or developer disciplines--I respectfully decline.</p>
<p>In reality, a blog not only provides a great way to keep API consumers up to date, it also provides the essential human face to any API operation. An API&rsquo;s blog provides a regular flow of information that show there is someone behind the curtain, who is not just working on the API, but actively is contributing ideas to the API community, and is there to support.</p>
<p>A blog is the number one signal for me when evaluating the quality of an API. I track on whether an API has a blog, how of the blog is updated, and how long since the last post. Using these signals, it is pretty easy to tell when a public API is getting the resources it needs, and when the support for a public API is losing steam within a company.</p>
<p>Here is an example of this in action&mdash;back in April I commented on the ESPN API:</p>
<div class="twitterBlock">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>It is sad that the last ESPN "API-focused musings and ramblings" was 1 year ago ;-( <a href="http://t.co/sMWDoFtacJ">http://t.co/sMWDoFtacJ</a> &gt;&gt; I prefer them more often</p>

<p>Sure enough, four short months later, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/08/public-apis-are-tough-when-you-are-in-a-tightly-controlled-industry/">ESPN announces they are shutting down their public APIs</a>. The existence of a blog for your API shows that you care about with your API community, regular blog posts show that you are thinking about your API community regularly and want to share stories with them, and when your blog goes silent, it speaks volumes about what is going on behind the curtain--run for the hills!</p>
<p>What does your blog say about your API? Storytelling via a blog can be one of the most powerful tools in your <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> toolbox, but be careful an inactive API blog can quickly become the canary in the coal mine when it comes to imminent demise of a public API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2014</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve launched a new API news site, designed to provide short news updates from across the world of APIs. The API Report is the newest part of the API Evangelist network of sites, with apievangelist.com as the analysis on the business of APIs, apivoice.com as the analysis on the politics of APIs, and the the API Report as the industry news heartbeat.</p>
<p>The API Report is built on Github, as a public repository, using Github Pages, and Jekyll. This approach to blogging opens up the news site to a new form of collaborative publishing, allowing anyone to fork, author their own API news story, and make a pull request for publishing to the site. Every commit will be reviewed for quality, and either rejected, or published to the live API Report website. Each post should follow a simple format, allowing for easy scanning of the days API news by consumers. The API Report has an RSS feed, as well as a Twitter account, for reader and social syndication.</p>
<p>Soon, the API Report will also have its own advertising network, which will allow anyone to purchase any of the advertising slots available in the header, right hand sidebar, and in the body of all blog posts. Advertising will be priced very low at first, but as pageviews grow, and demand increases, and weekly market rate will be set--allowing for weekly turnover of advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>If you are an API provider of any shape or size, or an API enthusiast, I recommend you help craft stories for the API Report, fork the site, and make a pull request, anytime you have a new piece you want share. Once the API Report advertising is up and running, and being monetized, I will be setting aside 50% of revenue and sharing with all contributors based upon pageviews.</p>
<p>The API Report is brand new, and looking to be the place where the community can publish their own stories about providing, consuming, or delivering services to the API space, and provide a regular news heartbeat for the API community, by the API community.</p>
<p>Get involved as early as you can, I'd love your feedback.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.espn.com/branding"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/espn/espn-api-black_200.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>ESPN just <a href="http://developer.espn.com/blog/read/publicretirement">announced that they will no longer be accepting registrations for public API keys</a>, and discontinuing all of their public APIs. I saw a few enraged comments on the Twitterz when I originally tweeted out the story, and also saw a couple of people compare it to the recent <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">Netflix API deprecation</a>.</p>
<p>In reality I don't think the shuttering of the public ESPN API, or the Netflix API is a reflection on the viability of APIs, steering clear of the usual API FUD <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever-wait-nothey-can-go-away-at-any-time/">that APIs are forever, wait no&hellip;they can go away at any time</a>! I think the decision to shutter the ESPN API is due to lack of vision, outreach, and the establishment of the vital developer feedback loops that are necessary to make APIs successful, but most importantly they failed to understand the challenges faced when deploying APIs in a tightly controlled industry.</p>
<p>Doing public APIs in tightly controlled spaces like the movie and sports industry has to be tough. Both to these spaces have built their empires on tightly controlling the content, messaging, distribution, branding, and other elements&mdash;which are all things that work against the ethos of a successful public API strategy.  In my mind it shows that APIs aren&rsquo;t really the thing we all claim they are, it is everything that comes bundled the API, and a company's willingness to evolve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we'll see waves of other companies, who come from legacy industries like movies, sports, publishing, television, and other similar sectors, try APIs, thinking they will be a technological silver bullet, in coming years who also neglect to pay attention to the business and politics of APIs that will provide essential building blocks that support the technology.</p>
<p>There are plenty of lessons to be learned from both ESPN and Netflix, but two that stand out for me, is the importance of understanding the entire lifecycle of the resources you are making available, and the value of having a robust API service composition and API access tiers, that sensibly serve internal, partner, and in some(not all) cases public API consumers.</p>

<p>I went through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">77 federal government API developer portals</a> a couple of weeks ago, as part of some <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> work I&rsquo;m doing with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. I ended up <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">targeting 120 APIs</a> that I will be generating of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a> definitions, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">API.json</a> for their umbrella domain, or subdomain over the next couple months.</p>
<p>As I made my way through each of these developer areas, I began to realize that I would have to sign up for API keys at each of these developer areas. I&rsquo;m sure some of the APIs will not require a key, but it is still potentially 77 separate API keys (I will let you know the final count when I know), that I will have to register for&mdash;the federal government needs a common, yet distributed API management strategy.</p>
<p>To augment this common, yet distribution API management strategy, I would like to be able to just use Github oAuth to ping an API provider, request my application keys, and using the Github API to then store them in a repository of my choosing. I store all of my API keys for my applications, in a central location that my apps can securely put to use, and in many cases these apps are already using a private Github repository as a centralized configuration location.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have to go through 77 separate API registration flows to get the API keys I need. I should be able to get API access in a programmatic way, using my existing Github account, and put Github oAuth to use in an authentication flow, getting the API keys I need in real time, in the location that I need them.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-key.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>This API access workflow would allow me to quickly gain access to resources I need for my apps, and store all my API keys in a single, or across multiple Github repositories&mdash;potentially giving me a simple, but powerful way to manage all of my API keys, via Github.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could someone please build this, so that government, and even the private sector APIs can install on their server, and provide me machine readable access to generate an API account, the API keys I need, and store them in one of my chosen Github repositories. I think it would make both API providers, and API consumers lives much easier. We could even develop some sort of trust layer in there based upon Github profiles, allowing API providers to assess new registrations, and provide didn&rsquo;t levels of access, based upon their trust of a Github profile.</p>
<p>We are moving beyond the world where we use one or two APIs, we are now using 10 or 20 different APIs, or more, from multiple providers, and there needs to be a better solution for us to manage API key access. I really appreciate you building this, I just don't have the time ;-)</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

<p>I was learning more about the <a href="http://timrogers.uk/2014/07/12/discovering-private-apis-with-charles-app/">discovery of private APIs with the Charles App</a>, and was fascinated by its potential to visualize, and map the darkest regions of the API realm. There is a lot of speculation about the number of APIs out there, with the 10K+ public APIs that are currently available being the &ldquo;tip of the iceberg&rdquo;, and the number of private APIs rpresenting the rest of the surface area below the dark surface--making the approach that Tim Rogers (and others) employ a tantalizing option for mapping these dark waters of the rapidly expanding API space.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">HTTP proxing and monitoring solutions like Charles</a> are nothing new, and there are a wealth of next generation&nbsp;<a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/">API integration</a> tools like <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> and <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a> available, but what is interesting about this, is the routing all of your app traffic for your laptop, tablet or smartphone through a proxy, and record not just the traffic between you and the private APIs your apps depend on, but the mapping out the API interface, request, response, and underlying data models.</p>
<p>Before I continue with this story, I have to admit this is a little on the dark side of APIs, and is something I don't recommend doing, because you are going to piss off a whole bunch of API providers&mdash;regardless, I think it is an interesting idea, that is worth sharing and discussing.</p>
<p>What if someone packaged up an HTTP proxy, monitoring, and provided a recording layer for the interface, requests, responses, and data models, scrubbed out PII, and allowed individuals to opt in and publish the resulting definitions to a shared, public registry?</p>
<p>Of course you would not publish your own transmissions, and underlying data, you would only publish the interface, requests, responses, and data models for the private APIs that are driving your public mobile and tablet applications. This centralized location would then aggregate, and shed light on this dark region, providing a single directory to discover what goes into all of the private APIs we depend on in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Something like this would pretty quickly map the world of private APIs, but at first glance I think the negative backlash would far outweigh the benefits. Mobile app providers would recoil, and probably look for ways to secure the inner workings of their mobile apps...or would they? It might also have the opposite effect, and push providers to realize they need to be more transparent with their APIs, and while they don't need to open up access to for everyone to use, they could publicly share the technological surface area their(our) apps depend on&mdash;which in my opinion is never the secret sauce, and a company should always be willing to share. (I know controversial) Think of it as the shared zone between provider and app.</p>
<p>The concept of a rogue API registry for internal APIs is one of those areas I see as pretty damn grey, and I'm unsure how I feel about it. I personally wouldn't recommend building a tool or a registry for mapping private APIs like this, because I worry about the repercussions it would have. One the other side it also fascinates me, and is a concept that is very much in the public domain already, and is something I feel is  worthy of discussion, or at least more thought.</p>

<p>I began exploring the <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">use a restaurant menu to help people understand API copyright</a>, and how your API definition is not your secret sauce, and that there is so much more to your API that just the surface area.</p>
<p>I'm continuing my exploration of using restaurants as an analogy to help onboard people with not just API copyright, but introducing APIs to the masses--helping them understand the layers to the API space, in a way that is familiar.</p>
<p>To prepare for future stories and conversations I'm expanding on my API definition = Menu analogy with:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Providers = Restaurant Owners</li>
<li>Developer Portal = Restaurant</li>
<li>APIs = Food &amp; Drink Items</li>
<li>API Definition + Docs = Menu</li>
<li>API Consumers (Apps) = Restaurant&nbsp; Customers (People)</li>
<li>Freemium - Samples Out Front</li>
<li>Partner Access = Catering</li>
<li>Terms of Service = We Reserve The Right To Refuse - No Substitutions</li>
<li>API Service Providers = Restaurant Equipment Providers</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously it is work in progress. I will need better stories and visuals to get the concept across. Then once I start working through the different types of restaurants (ie. American, Chinese, Mexican, Fusion, etc), I'm sure I'll flush out more, while also potentially hitting some dead ends.</p>
<p>Explaining what an API is, let alone the versatility and flexibility of an API, is really hard. I need as many tools in my API toolbox to help get people up to speed, understanding what an API is, and how it can apply to their business. We'll see where I go with the restaurant analogy, who knows it might be a dead end. It proved to be extremeley valuable in helping people understand API copyright, and I'm hopefull it will do the same for APIs in general.</p>

<p>I spend a great deal of time looking at new APIs from companies, institutions, and government agencies during my weekly monitoring of the API space, and over the last couple years, I've come across an increasing number of APIs tht are out of higher educational institutions around the world. It began with a c<a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/2012/05/29/university-information-services-with-apis/">entralized developer area at the University of Washington (UW)</a>, and then <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/25/get-a-list-of-all-classes-at-uc-berkeley-with-api-call/">I saw the same from UC Berkeley</a>, with more recently noticing the impressive <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/23/browsing-the-261-apis-at-brigham-young-university/">conversion of 250+ services from a traditional Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), to a more modern web API approach, at Brigham Young University (BYU)</a>.</p>
<p>Along the way I began seeing that APIs at higher education institutions were going to be an important piece of the overall API puzzle, and as I do with any research area, I setup a Github repository (<a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university.apievangelist.com</a>), and began tracking on universities who were doing anything interesting with APIs, no matter how small. I now track on twelve separate higher education institutions that have active API efforts, and I have been engaging in active conversations with two of the institutions, regarding their strategy, working to understand how I can provide any guidance, but also learn from each team about the unique challenges higher education institutions face when designing, deploying, manage, and even evangelize their APIs.</p>
<p>My university API research has now reached a level, where I have enough material to produce a white paper, so over the last couple months, I&rsquo;ve worked to compile all of my work into a single downloadable narrative. As with all of my API research, this white paper will change often, as my work is never done. I&rsquo;ll keep adding institutions, and evolving my understanding an awareness of APIs in higher education as long as there is meaningful activity to be found. The reason I produced this white paper, before I finished other papers I&rsquo;m working on for <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com/">payment APIs</a>, and&nbsp;APIs in the federal government, is because I feel like higher education is going to be critical to the futrue of not just APIs, but also the overall web literacy of our society.</p>
<p><strong>Higher Education Is Front Line For Web Literacy</strong><br /> A large part of our worlds have moved online. Whether it is entertainment at home, education in the classroom, or out and about on our mobile devices, we are living more of our lives online&mdash;increasing the imperative that we are empowering every student with at least a minimum amount of web literacy. Think of web literacy, like understanding your personal finances, every single adult must have a certain level of awareness of how our financial system operates. You don't need to understand the inner workings of banking and global markets, but you need to know how to setup a bank account, apply for credit or debit cards, balance your checkbook and pay your taxes. As our lives move online and our digital footprint expands, our data is fast becoming the online currency of Internet platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, increasing the need for us to understand the mechanisms at play in this new digital economy, and empower each student to take back some control.</p>
<p>Web literacy goes beyond just what you will need to know in your job and career, it is what you will need to be a literate citizen, and use government services, conduct business, and even interact with your friends and community around you. Just as higher education has played a significant role in preparing our youth for the real world in the past, it will have to take the lead in providing them with the basic web literacy skills they will need to engage online in everyday scenarios, as well as the specialty career trajectories. API is a layer of web literacy, one that allows the tech savvy individual to peel back how the Internet works, and configure, tweak, and make the Internet work for them--not the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>Providing A Blueprint For Other University To Follow</strong><br /> As I spent more time looking at universities, I wanted to create a static snapshot of the current state of APIs in higher education, share some of what I learned looking through the leading universities in the space, and also apply some of my wider knowledge from the API industry beyond the university campus--in hopes university leaders are listening.</p>
<p>I want this paper to be a blueprint that any university CIO or CTO, student or energetic professor can pick up, and get an idea of what is going on across other universities when it comes to APIs. I&rsquo;m fascinated by what I&rsquo;m seeing out of BYU, UW, UC Berkeley, and UM, and as I do with the rest of the space, I&rsquo;m looking forward to monitoring their progress, and having more conversations about how we can make university API efforts more successful.</p>
<p>I will continue to update this white paper as I find more examples of institutions putting to APIs to work. While much of this research is rooted in what I'm seeing across these 12 higher education institutions, there is still much that is speculation based on my experience, and as I find more concrete examples in the wild I'll expand and add to this paper.</p>
<p>I can't emphasize enough, the important role that higher education will play in not just equipping the next generation with the web literacy skills they will need to be successful, but also help take the lead in defining the underlying pipes that will drive our increasingly digital economy. APIs are not good by default, they can be used is some very bad ways, and I'm confident that if higher education take a lead in the space, the patterns that can be established will provide a healthier path forward than if we let Silicon Valley continue to exclusively lead.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/08/05/the-hypermedia-api-debate-sorry-reasonable-just-does-not-sell/">The Hypermedia API Debate: Sorry Reasonable Just Does Not Sell</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-craft/detroit/apicraft-panel-0.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I moderated a panel of hypermedia experts at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft in Detroit</a> last week. One theme that dominated not just the panel, but was also pervasive in the conversation over the next two days of the API event, was how can the hypermedia space, improve its overall image, message, and potentially reach a wider audience, and maybe even converting some of the hypermedia skeptics, to hypermedia evangelists.</p>
<p>After a session at #APICraft, <a href="https://github.com/apicraft/detroit2014/wiki/Hypermedia%3A-Why-Y'all-Hatin'%3F">dedicated to understanding all the hypermedia hate</a>, Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) and I continued the conversation, where he stated: When it comes to hypermedia, and technology online, reasonable just doesn't sell.</p>
<p>This statement sums up my views of the current state of the hypermedia conversation. I went into the event expecting a very heated debate, filled with very intelligent, passionate, yet opinionated and hard-headed individuals. If you even lightly pay attention to the world of APIs, you probably have stumbled across the conversation between passionate REST practitioners (aka <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/whatisarestafarian/">Restafarians</a>), and the more recently the select group of hypermedia specialists&mdash;producing an image that is perceived by some as passionate, opinionated, and pushy, or even portrayed as being down right mean, nasty, delusional and confrontational by some.</p>
<p>What I saw on the hypermedia panel last Monday, and over the next two days at #APICraft, was anything but the popular image of REST and the hypermedia community. I don&rsquo;t dismiss that some REST, and hypermedia practitioners can be rude, mean, and less than tolerant of those of us who don&rsquo;t quite understand every detail, but this group of hypermedia leaders were anything but. They were humble, articulate, and eager to better understand the hypermedia approaches of their colleagues, and try to understand how to better get the message out to the larger public.</p>
<p>So where does this image come from? I think there are two camps, who are equally to blame: 1) The <strong><em>hypermedia pioneers</em></strong> 2) The <strong><em>hypermedia skeptics&nbsp;</em></strong>&mdash; the rest of us are just along for a ride on this hypermedia roller coaster.</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s look at from the hypermedia skeptic side:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>One Client To Rule Them All -</strong> You often hear claims, whether true or not, that hypermedia pioneers claim if all APIs were hypermedia, we could have a single, intelligent client to rule them all, and do away with all of the crap we have now&mdash;think web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Adds Unnecessary Complexity -</strong> Adding extra links, and payload to each response just adds more complexity, without any benefits to warrant the added work.</li>
<li><strong>Too Lofty, Dreamy, and Still Academic -</strong> Many say that Hypermedia is just to big of a vision, and the hypermedia pioneers are too dreamy, and stuck in just an academic discussion&mdash;it won&rsquo;t work in the real world.</li>
<li><strong>Solution For All APIs - </strong>There are many claims that hypermedia is something that all API designers should follow, applying to APIs in all industries as a silver bullet style solution.</li>
<li><strong>Will Prevent APIs From Breaking - </strong>When you use hypermedia, your APIs are completely protected from breakage, and your developers will never feel any pain from API versioning, and the evolution of your API.</li>
<li><strong>Solves Discoverability -</strong> With each payload, you get instructions for what is next, so if you know an API endpoint, you should be able to find everything else from there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next let&rsquo;s look at from the hypermedia pioneers side:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Haters Gonna Hate -</strong> It has nothing to do with Hypermedia being good or bad, haters gonna hate. There is nothing you can do.</li>
<li><strong>They Don&rsquo;t Care - </strong>Nobody even cares about learning new things like hypermedia, so there is no reason to even explain it to them.</li>
<li><strong>They Don&rsquo;t Need To Understand -</strong> Not everyone even needs to understand what hypermedia APIs are, they will just benefit from the results. </li>
<li><strong>They Just  Don&rsquo;t Understand - </strong>Skeptics just haven&rsquo;t taken the time to understand what APIs are, and would rather just remain ignorant.</li>
<li><strong>Its OK to Not Be Perfect -</strong> Hypermedia makes it ok to not build your API 100% correctly the first time, allowing you to change it along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Use Media Types -</strong> People don't read docs, we need to rely on media types help provide the information developers will need.</li>
<li><strong>Give Us A Break - </strong>This shit is hard, and the hypermedia community is working hard, and taking risks to push APIs forward.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-craft/detroit/apicraft-panel-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>Beyond both the hypermedia pioneers, and the hypermedia skeptic camps, I think the main problem with the hypermedia conversation is as Mike said, "reasonable just doesn't sell&rdquo;. I think this is the number one illness in the whole debate, that some bloggers feel the need to polarize any debate, sensationalize and use hyperbole at every turn. You can see this playing out in coverage of hypermedia, but also around other areas of the API space like API deprecation, where the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever-wait-nothey-can-go-away-at-any-time/">argument was either APIs can go away at any moment, to the other end where you have to support APIs forever</a>&mdash;not discussing the middle reality which would show there are plenty of APIs who handle deprecation very well, but year, that is boring, and really doesn't sell.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what the hypermedia pioneers can do to shift the conversation:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Strong Implementations - </strong>The space needs for examples of hypermedia APIs in the wild, providing as much detail about the implementation, and hopefully a public API that they can actually go play with.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling -</strong> There needs to be much more storytelling about hypermedia. Not the technical narrative of your implementation, but a story of hypermedia APIs, and the solutions it delivers. Keep stories, short, inviting, compelling, and published often&mdash;we are all busy and don't always have the time to commit to reading longer pieces.</li>
<li><strong>Patience -</strong> Have patience with the community, this is complex stuff, and it will take time for hypermedia to roll out, get the implementations we need to showcase the potential, the tooling and resources needed to support developers.</li>
<li><strong>Friendly -</strong> Make sure and keep things friendly&mdash;this will go a long way in defusing the skeptics, and you never know you might convert them, one by one along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Speak To Management - </strong>When you are telling stories, building case studies, and presenting on your work, make sure you speak to management level as well as to developers. It can be the leadership that carves out time for developers to learn about hypermedia, or possibly mandate that it should be part of an API design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what the hypermedia skeptics can do to shift the conversation:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Make The Time To Read - </strong>There is some great material out there about hypermedia, to get you up to speed if you can carve out the time. Sure, we need more examples of hypermedia in the wild, case studies, and tooling, but in the mean time, make sure and read as much as you can before casting judgement.</li>
<li><strong>Make Sure And Listen -</strong> I heard some really compelling stories around how hypermedia works, and I bet if you take the time to listen to more of the conversation you might at least evolve your opinion of hypermedia.</li>
<li><strong>Think Long Term - </strong>Hypermedia provides some long term benefits that are often overlooked in the short term concerns about time and resources needed to get up to speed with hypermedia, and actually implement as part of your API design.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Worry About What You Don&rsquo;t Know -</strong> I feel like some of the trolling of hypermedia might be based upon insecurity about what one doesn&rsquo;t understand. I have to admit I don&rsquo;t fully grasp everything about hypermedia, but I see enough to grasp the long term potential, and know I should worker harder to close the gaps in my understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Be Mean -</strong> I&rsquo;ve seen some pretty harsh responses to what hypermedia pioneers are working on, and I think it would be easier to just walk away, rather than shitting on someones hard work. Hypermedia pioneers are putting a lot of time and energy into moving the space forward in positive ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately the ball is in the court of the hypermedia pioneers.There really is no reason that skeptics, or anyone else should care, until there is more examples, tooling, and stories around why hypermedia is worth the extra work in getting up to speed, and implementing as part of our APIs designs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-craft/detroit/apicraft-hater-session.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I see hypermedia at the same place, as REST was in 2010 when I started API Evangelist. I had witnessed first hand the solutions a RESTful API provided, and saw what was playing out in the public API space with Amazon, Twitter, and Twilio. As I continue to  study the space I saw the RESTafarians arguing, shaming and generally making people feel stupid for not understanding HTTP, and fighting over exactly what REST was. It appeared to me that REST would suffer from the same image problems as the semantic web, and linked data.</p>
<p>The API space needed a friendlier layer, one that would help soften up some of the technical debates, and tell stories that would make all of this valuable knowledge more accessible&mdash;with this in mind, API Evangelist was born. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m responsible for web APIs moving into the mainstream consciousness, it has taken all the valuable implementations available out there to do that, but I do know I&rsquo;ve started some important conversations by working so hard to help everyone better understand the space.</p>
<p>After what I saw in Detroit last week, during the hypermedia panel I moderated, and over the following two days, I&rsquo;m confident that with a little more storytelling we can shift the tone of this conversation in just a year or two. It won&rsquo;t happen overnight, but I saw some really smart, hardworking folks who were very humble about their hypermedia work, and willing to admit there is a lot of work to be done, and eager to help the public to better understand the benefits hypermedia will bring to not just individual API operations, but the overall API space.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t believe that hypermedia offered significant benefits, I wouldn&rsquo;t be talking about it. In 2014 I&rsquo;m seeing the hypermedia conversation move beyond just the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/api-craft">API-Craft forum</a>, beyond just academic discussion, and we are seeing some meaningful implementations of hypermedia in the wild. I will keep working to evolve my understanding and storytelling around hypermedia, while also working with the experts to generate more stories, and examples of their own work.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>I changed the word hater to skeptic (except in the haters gonna hate bullet), John Sheehan said I should use, which seems sensible, and following my own advice. Thanks John.</p>

<p>Irakli Nadareishvili (<a href="https://twitter.com/inadarei">@inadarei</a>), Dave Goldberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/davidgoldberg">@davidgoldberg</a>)&nbsp;and I were having an interesting conversation on the Twitterz, after I posted "<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/03/as-we-recover-the-banking-industry-seems-to-be-warming-up-to-apis/">As We Recover The Banking Industry Seems To Be Warming Up To APIs</a>", yesterday--on a topic I think is worth repeating regularly, to generate discussion within any business sector.</p>
<p>I think that all three of us are optimistic about what APIs can do in an industry like banking, and because of our experience, we are very realistic about what is possible in the end--realizing not every API will be good by default.</p>
<p>I'll just let you follow along with our conversation, then I'll explore a little more:</p>

<p>What would a Twilio look like for the banking industry? Probably similar to <a href="http://openbankproject.com/en/">The Open Bank Project</a> or <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, and focusing on rebooting, and simplifying just a single slice of the insanely complex banking system. I'm not saying that these two startups are the next Twilio of banking, but I do see them as two potential dynamite holes being drilled into the bedrock of a very entrenched, highly regulated industry, and powerful industry.</p>
<p>I don't see APIs being the silver bullet to the banking industry, or any other industry for that matter. Slow change will happen through the solid execution of an API focused business strategy by one or more of the existing banking powerhouses, at the same time it will also take a wave of API driven banking startups, who hopefully emulate much of Twilio's game plan, to slowly to blast away at the bedrock core of the banking industry.</p>
<p>Another thing to pay attention to, is when the large banks do understand how APIs are becoming the pipes for this new digital economy, they will begin to wield their power and influence, just as other 1000lb gorillas do in business sectors like education, healthcare, and other critical areas of our economy. APIs don't just purify the distribution of legacy power like a rocky mountain stream does to water, it will take the development of some pretty sophisticated API facades to mask legacy complexity, every step of the way.</p>
<p>In a next post, I'll explore what this top down, and bottom up approach looks like, by examining the progress we have all made with open data, and APIs in the <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">federal government</a>.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Sorry Irakli, I just couldn't use Twilio the "HECK" out of them. I have an edgy image to uphold, but remember everyone Irakli is the first person to use Twilio as a verb!</p>

<p>I originally started writing this post after <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, where I had numerous conversations with banks, about the potential of APIs, and how banks might be starting to move from talk to action, when it comes to their API programs.</p>
<p>After recent talks with a couple more folks, behind the scenes at banks, I&rsquo;m pretty convinced, as the enterprise are doing in other sectors, banks are slowly waking up to the potential of APIs&mdash;something that has taken a long time, as they slowly come out of their bank vaults, where they were hiding during the economic meltdown.</p>
<p>When you Google the phase "<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=banking%20api">banking API</a>", you see the signs that the space is ripe for disruption with APIs from two open banking pioneers:</p>

<p>These players do not represent movement from the banking space itself, the conversation I&rsquo;ve had with Visa, Mastercard, Capital One, Rabobank, and others I can&rsquo;t even mention are notoriously closed about what they are doing, but these new open banking API platforms do represent the opportunity that exists in the space.</p>
<p>Until I see robust, open developer areas from Chase, HSBC, Citigroup, and other banking giants, I won&rsquo;t declare APIs getting traction in the banking sector, but I think the ice is thawing, and I feel we are moving from just banks talking about APIs, to banks maybe, kinda sorta considering taking action when it comes to APIs.</p>
<p>Hopefully I will get to talk about more of my conversations in the future, until then I will just showcase what The Open Bank Project and Plaid are up to, hopefully through public, competitive, and regulatory pressure, banks will open up more&mdash;I have little faith that they will do it on their own, without a little nudging.</p>

        <p><span>When visiting an API developer area, as soon as the page loads,&nbsp;you can tell if its an organized effort, or something that was thrown up by a single project or team. Half of the institutions I track on as part of my university API monitoring have a centralized developer area for their APIs, as well as what appears to be an organized approach behind the designing, deploying, managing or evangelizing their APIs.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <span>I&rsquo;ve talked with both&nbsp;University of California Berkeley and Brigham Young Universities about their API strategies, while only having light communication with University of Washington and Michigan. I feel there are some interesting lessons to be had when taking a look at these six leading universities.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://wp-api.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/wordpress/wordpress-logo-stacked-rgb.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While at <a href="http://bit.ly/1zIq2sl">API Craft in Detroit</a> this week I had the pleasure of hanging with two leads on the WordPress(org) development team, and discuss the API strategy for the blogging platform. Andrew Nacin (<a href="https://twitter.com/nacin">@nacin</a>), Lead Developer, and Ryan McCue (<a href="https://twitter.com/rmccue">@rmccue</a>), WordPress Plugin Developer, facilitated an open circle discussion to work through the challenges that WordPress is facing when developing an API for the open source blogging platform.</p>
<p>At face value, I know a number of API developers who will be less than pleased when they hear about a <a href="http://wp-api.org/">WordPress API</a>, as both PHP, and WordPress are easy targets for developer&rsquo;s hatred, for generating less than perfect code. ;-) But, in the end you can&rsquo;t ignore some of the stats on WordPress usage:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">Used by more than 22.0% of the top 10 million websites as of August 2013</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">Most popular blogging system in use on the Web, used in more than 60 million websites</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wordpress.com/stats/">Over 409 million people view more than 15.5 billion pages each month</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wordpress.com/stats/">Users produce about 41.7 million new posts and 60.5 million new comments each month</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These stats don&rsquo;t even touch on the number of WordPress plugins and mobile solutions there are developed on the insanely popular website, and blogging platform. I couldn't think of a better platform to start rolling APIs out APIs to the masses, and quickly educating a very large group of tech savvy folks along the way.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wordpress.com/stats/"><img style="padding: 15px; margin-left: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/wordpress/wordpress-traffic.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Many of these WordPress sites are already integrated with popular API platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, so it makes sense to educate WordPress administrators on the APIs they are already using, as well as introduce them to the concept of having their own API around the potentially valuable content they generate.</p>
<p><strong>We Are Talking About Developing 60 M+ Distributed APIs</strong><br /> There is no API deployment or management service provider that is even close to numbers of this magnitude. When ready, the WordPress API will give millions of websites, and the individuals, companies, organizations and government agencies behind them, an Application Programming Interface (API). (weird, I haven't spelled that out in a while) What does this mean for the API sector? I do not know yet, but to me it definitely resembles the long tail of API deployment, that I, and <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> have been advocating for the last four years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building For The Lowest Common Denominator</strong><br /> One dominant theme in the conversation around the WordPress API at API Craft, was about building an API for the lowest common denominator. WordPress is an open source blogging platform built using PHP and MySQL, something that enables it to be installed on just about any hosting platform, which has contributed to the platform's growth. However, many of these platforms restrict common aspects of the Internet like the ability to use all of your HTTP verbs, like PUT or DELETE, or simply do not offer essentials like SSL, which is needed for oAuth. The bar for developing an API that will be used by 60 M+ providers has to be set pretty low, ensuring it will work across the entire ecosystem&mdash;something WordPress is already pretty damn good at.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring That The WordPress API Is Extensible</strong><br /> One of the hallmarks of WordPress is the ability to create custom themes and plugins, that extend the functionality of the blogging platform, and the API will be no different. WordPress is much more than just a collection of pages, posts, tags, and links. WordPress has been used as the core of just about any time of website, serving up books, photos, videos, maps, and any other content type you can dream up. The WordPress API has to be able to provide a common interface that can be used to create, read, update, and delete core WP content types, like pages and posts, as well as be extended to any other interpretation the WordPress community can dream up&mdash;adding another dimension to the already massive scope of delivering an API to 60M+ websites.</p>
<p><strong>Single Place To Educate Everyone About APIs</strong><br /> I can't think of another platform that has introduced the average person to web programming, more than WordPress (maybe Drupal?). When you go back to the concept of lowest common denominator, WordPress employs PHP and MysQL to drive its functionality, and combined with the plugin and theme extensibility, the platform has provided a rich gateway to the world of web, and mobile app development. The opportunities to introduce, and educate the masses of the benefits (and downside) of APIs, is huge! While the already established API developer community may not want the WordPress community developing APIs, it will be the quickest way we from 10K APIs, into the millions of APIs.  WordPress drives 22.0% of the top 10 million websites, which will instantly provide access to some potentially high value content and data, that will significantly increase the size of the overall API economy, as well as contribute to API literacy in every business sector, around the globe.</p>
<p>At the time of this post, the <a href="http://wp-api.org/">WordPress API is only a plugin</a>, which means it is an optional part of the platform, requiring a WordPress site administrator to know about the plugin, and install as part of their individual WordPress installation. However, the goal is to bake the API into WordPress as part of the 4.1 release, which could happen as soon as this fall, or at the latest the first or second quarter of 2015.  While not all 60 M+ WordPress sites will immediately update to the 4.1 release, a significant portion of websites around the world will instantly have an API--good or bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited at the idea of so many websites having APIs, then at the same time I'm completely terrified. It is kind of like flooding the market, with some very high value APIs, while also adding millions of very shitty APIs, and I'm sure a lot in the middle. With a lot of the problems we are facing around discovery and integration at 10K, imagine what things will look like with millions of APIs all of a sudden. Do we want every website to have an API this fast?</p>
<p>Beyond just giving a website an API, I'm also very interested in the potential of using WordPress API as purely an API core, allowing it to be used to drive content and data for mobile, and <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">single page applications (SPA)</a>. Considering the innovation we've seen around the core WordPress platform, from the community, I imagine we'll see similar when it comes to just raw API deployment, and when you start considering the potential when bundled with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">latest containerization movement</a>, led by <a href="http://docker.io">Docker.io</a>, and being driven by <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2014/04/23/aws-elastic-beanstalk-adds-docker-support/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/containers">Google</a>, <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/06/09/docker-and-azure-coolness/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/2014/4/red-hat-docker-expand-collaboration">Red Hat</a>&mdash;your head will start to spin.</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>WordPress API + Virtual Containers = API Deployment As Part Of The Fabric Of The Cloud</em></strong></blockquote>
<p>I will be carving out more time to consider the implications of the introduction of the WordPress API, and hopefully provide more feedback to the WordPress API development team. If you are a seasoned WordPress developer, and experienced API consumer, you might consider getting involved too.  You can get access to the source code for <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API">WP API over at Github</a>, and you can <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues">submit issues via the issue management</a> for the project&mdash;they also provide updates via the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/json-api/">WP blog tagged as json-api</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-conductor.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring one possible API future more and more lately, a future which centers around the a concept of being able to deploy <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>, by employing the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/the-power-of-designing-and-deploying-api-driven-resources-in-containers/">power of deploying API resources in virtualized containers</a>, something that will free individual API resources up for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">orchestration in new and exciting ways</a>--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">doing for APIs, what APIs have been doing for companies</a>.</p>
<p>Driven by a recent evolution in cloud computing introduced by <a href="http://docker.io">Docker.io</a>, we are beginning to see new services emerge that get us closer to this vision of API orchesstration. Last week I wrote about how <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/23/the-new-strongloop-api-server-provides-a-look-at-future-of-api-deployment/">StrongLoop providing one look at the future of API deployment</a>, using Node.js. This week I was introduced to another API deployment solution that also resembles some of these earlier thoughts I have had on API orchestration, from <a href="https://api.blockspring.com/">BlockSpring</a>.</p>
<p>Blockspring deploys a containerized API for any Python, Ruby, and R scripts, so all you do is take some code resource, deploy using BlockSpring, and it generates API endpoints, and a form interface for working with the resource. Blockspring provides documentation to help you understand how to craft your code, and a library to publish your API to, when ready.</p>
<p>When you look at their API library, it even drops you into a folder called /blocks, which gives you into a list of APIs deployed using Blockspring, doing a range of functions from screen capture, applying image filters, to sentiment and text analysis. Blockspring enables, and encourages the design, and deployment of very granular API resources, that do one thing, and hopefully also doing it well, providing an interesting, and very modular way of deploying APIs--think legos.</p>
<p>This deployment of simple, programmatic API resources, using a very containerized architecture, is an important new layer to the growing world of API orchestration, complimenting the simpler content and data driven API resources we are seeing deployed from spreadsheets and databases, and common file stores. I&rsquo;m not seeing a pure spreadsheet to API, or database to API solution which solely employs virtual containers, but I&rsquo;m sure its not far off.</p>
<p>Seeing what Strongloop and Blockspring are up to makes me happy. Imagine a world where you can deploy exactly the data, content, and programmatic resources you will need for your web, mobile or single page application. This ability to define, deploy, scale and manage all of your API resources, in such a granular way will contribute significantly to the evolution how we build apps, and connect our devices to the Internet.</p>
<p>This emerging landscape of new API orchestration platforms will change how we deploy and consume APIs, making APIs much more remixable and composable, bringing APIs out of their silos. I also hope this new approach will also expand on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale opportunities for API providers</a>, and continue to change how we monetize our content, data, and programmatic resources in the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://api-craft.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-craft/api-craft-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>I&rsquo;m still gathering all of my thoughts on the hypermedia media panel this last week at API Craft. I have an Evernote full of ideas, thoughts, and potential stories from the amazing API event this week in Detroit.  First up is responding to the Twitter backchannel around being a hypermedia hater, and the panel I moderated on Monday between&nbsp;<span>Mike Amundsen (</span><a href="http://bit.ly/1mtrwki">@mamund</a><span>), Mike Kelly (</span><a href="http://bit.ly/1hBxi4m">@mikekelly85</a><span>), Steve Klabnik (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a><span>), Kevin Swiber (</span><a href="http://bit.ly/1oC7Udw">@kevinswiber</a><span>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a><span>), and Markus Lanthaler (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a><span>)</span>.</p>
<p>After bringing the panelists up, giving them each 10 minutes to introduce themselves, I kicked off the discussion by calling out a Tweet from @JeremiahLee:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> I hope the conversation about hypermedia makes it beyond <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APICraft?src=hash">#APICraft</a> to the rest of us because it still seems like 99% bullshit.</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>First, I called out @JeremiahLee because he happened to tweet right at the moment I was moderating the panel, and second because I thought his comment reflected the polarization of the conversation around hypermedia. I personally know @JeremiahLee, and I know he&rsquo;s not a hater, he a super smart, and critical leader in the API conversation, but he Tweeted a controversial tweet, at the perfect moment, and I seized the opportunity. ;-)</p>
<p>Hypermedia hating was a central theme to the event in Detroit, and I have several stories planned, hoping to further explore the phenomena, and make suggestions for moving the conversation forward, and @JeremiahLee provided a little more explanation of himself, so let&rsquo;s explore his position, and I'll add some commentary along the way:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">

<p>Thank you so much for Tweeting this @JeremiahLee, it really did provide a great focal point for kicking off the panel, and made this topic be a pervasive part of the conversation across the next two days! ;-)</p>

<p>Very true, but you can when you call someone&rsquo;s conversation about a proposed solution, 99% bullshit. ;-) Something I think is a hallmark of many of the hypermedia haters, which immediately makes it easy to label as such, from a single Tweet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Spot on, and something the hypermedia has failed to do. I do see signs where the benefits are being demonstrated, and potentially outweigh the work involved, but they are poorly communicated. There is so much work to be done on educating people around what hypermedia even is, let alone demonstrating the solutions it provides, which will allow each person to individually assess whether it alleviates more pain then it creates, and is something they should consider.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Great feedback. I think this was heard loud and clear by the audience. They realize there is a lot of work to be done to increase the number hypermedia API implementations in the wild, which will result in better client tooling, which will also provide material for the stories and evidence you will need to satisfy this concern.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>Linking data is cool. Finding common ways to describe common data types can enable some use cases. Do we need the rest? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APICraft?src=hash">#APICraft</a> 5/7</p>

<p>Another area that was discussed at the event. I think <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a> provides a minimalist approach that fits this description, and I leave to each of the other hypermedia format designers to chime in on why their approach is preferred, and isn&rsquo;t extraneous baggage. I will also spend some time better acquainting myself with each of the formats, and try to lend my own view. I think linking data, and establishing a common data vocabulary are great starting points for demonstrating hypermedia value to API providers and consumers, and we will have to build a case for each addition layer added on from there--lots of work to be done!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced the problems being talked about are wide spread or painful enough to warrant much overhead. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APICraft?src=hash">#APICraft</a> 6/7</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>I agree, and we need to see stories of specific implementations, that demonstrate that more value is generated then pain, as I said above. I&rsquo;d also urge you to look beyond just pain, and looking at the potential for establish new ways to express ourselves using APIs. I think hypermedia can provide very subtle, simple ways of expression that don&rsquo;t impose a lot of overhead, but can make integration, and even the end-user experience much smoother, chipping off the rough edges of what we currently have, reducing pain incrementally as we go.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced the hypermedia solutions can live up to the bold claims that border on magic. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APICraft?src=hash">#APICraft</a> 7/7</p>

<p>The conversations I heard over the three days of API Craft do not reflect the &ldquo;bold claims&rdquo; I hear of online. I did not hear talk of a perfect API client, or APIs that never break, and the other &ldquo;magic&rdquo; that is pointed at in online discussions. The conversations were very humble, realistic, and talked of the challenges, pitfalls, and acknowledging hypermedia is not a fit for all scenarios. While I&rsquo;m sure there are some snake oil hypermedia practitioners who preach magic, but I&rsquo;m thinking &ldquo;magic&rdquo; and &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo; are the terms used by folks who aren&rsquo;t immersing themselves in the conversations around hypermedia, and will only change when there is more material to help onboard them, and demonstrate real world implementations, and the solutions they provide.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have to put the term bulldozers in the same toolbox as bullshit, and magic. By no means do I see adding simple linking at the bottom of an API response as a bulldozer. I saw many layers to what hypermedia is, and I think calling it a bulldozer is speaking to the entire stack, not acknowledging providers can implement any part, and developers can also choose to use or ignore any part, as well.</p>
<p>I will explore more of these thoughts in future posts on hypermedia, but I wanted to respond specifically to @JeremiahLee thoughts. You do have some excellent points @JeremiahLee, and I think they were heard loud and clear, and reflect the conversation that happened throughout API Craft.  I think for anyone who wants to refrain from being labeled a hater, when it comes to REST, hypermedia, or any other topic, should be cautious when using polarizing terminology, and encourage the community to produce more of the evidence you are requiring to make the leap--while also acknowledging their desire to pioneer into new areas, which is good for entire community.</p>
<p>I will do my part to continue producing stories about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/what-is-a-hypermedia-api/">what hypermedia is</a>, and provide more examples of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">where hypermedia is being applied</a>. I&rsquo;m paying attention to hypermedia in 2014, not because it is the latest trend, I&rsquo;m paying attention to it because in my monitoring of the API space I&rsquo;m seeing a significant amount of discussion around it beyond just the academic discussions on <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft</a>. I&rsquo;m seeing an increased amount of blog posts, and examples of hypermedia being used in the wild.</p>
<p>Thanks for playing so nicely into the discussion on hypermedia at API Craft, Jeremiah. I think you are asking the right questions, I just want to help both sides of the discussion better understand how we can better set the tone for the conversation, so that things are more productive, and the whole community can move forward in a healthy way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://api-craft.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-craft/api-craft-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm preparing for my hypermedia panel at&nbsp;<a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft Detroit</a>&nbsp;today. The API Craft organizers have brought together one of the most important line-ups, when it comes to the hypermedia API discussion, that I've ever seen. To prepare for the discussion, &nbsp;I've spent time profiling each of the panelist, to help me, and hopefully you, better understand who they are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/24/getting-to-know-mike-amundsen-for-the-api-craft-2014-detroit-hypermedia-panel-">Mike Amundsen</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>)</li>

</ul>
<p>These six hypermedia leaders, spend their time discussing hypermeida on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/api-craft">API-Craft forum</a>, but it isn't just talk, each of the panelsts have each also contributed their formats and tooling to the discussion, resulting in 9 separate hypermedia formats to consider:</p>

</ul>
<p>To help guide the conversation, I've asked each panelists to give me two things that they want the audience at API Craft to walk away with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>adding hypermedia to an API is a way to improve the API's usability (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>)</li>
<li>the more hypermedia information in a response, the more stateless that response can be (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>)</li>
<li>Hypermedia allows us to go beyond CRUD-influenced API design,  enabling a task-based message design consisting of current resource  state and available transitions.  This provides a richer interaction  model between client and server.  (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>)</li>
<li>The best way to improve the state of the art is to see hypermedia  applied to more use cases and have feedback shared publicly with the  community. (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>)</li>
<li>What are the metrics of success for your API? How do hypermedia designs contribute to or detract from those metrics? (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>)</li>
<li>Is adding links to a response enough? (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>)</li>
<li>What are the benefits of adding HTTP method and payload encoding  information to links - aka forms/actions for APIs? What are the  problems? Is it worth it?  (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>)</li>
<li>Are more complicated media types, that require more than an HTTP  library and a JSON parser to deal with, moving away from the  "simplicity" that has been driving web API adoption over SOAP?  (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>)</li>
<li>Does adding hypermedia really help if the data itself can't be understood without out-of-band knowledge? (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>)</li>
<li>What are the pros and cons of moving hypermedia controls to a  separate, machine-readable document (API descriptions) compared to  embedding them directly in resource representations? (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>)</li>
<li>How would an ideal hypermedia client library look like? (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>)</li>
<li>People often have a knee jerk reaction to dismiss hypermedia APIs as  a complex approach to API design. What is your three sentence pitch to  convince these people that it is not overkill, and in fact can be a  simpler approach over time? (<a href="https://twitter.com/MattMcLartyBC">@MattMcLartyBC</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions you'd like to have asked, I have the list on a <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-craft-hypermedia-panel-detroit-2014">Github repository dedicated to the event</a>. You are welcome to do a pull request on the list, or leave as an issue for the repository, and I will consider including in the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panel kicks off today around 1PM (we may start late, as some panelists hit flight troubles), and the <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/api-craft">conversation is being live streamed via UStream</a>.</p>

<p>I'm preparing for my hypermedia panel with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), Mike Kelly (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>), Steve Klabnik (<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a>), Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>), and Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>), at&nbsp;<a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft Detroit</a>&nbsp;next week. I wanted to go into the panel with a snapshot, and at least a minimal understanding of each of the panelists. This is kind of an all-star panel of hypermedia experts, so I need to at least bump up my understanding of what they are contributing to the API space, and who they are, beyond what I know from my own interactions with these API leaders.</p>
<p>As I do with all of my research, I wanted to share my work with you, my reader. Next up is J&oslash;rn Wildt. I'm a fan of&nbsp;J&oslash;rn's conversations via API-Craft, but beyond that I know very little. I look forward to talking more at API Craft, and learning about his work through my research.</p>
<p>Here is the outline of my research into J&oslash;rn's&nbsp;work:</p>
<p><strong>J&oslash;rn Wildt</strong><br /> <br /> <span>Software developer with experience from web programming (C#, </span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ASP.NET</span></span><span> and PHP) - both web UI as well as RESTful web APIs, Windows desktop clients, SOA, asynchronous messaging, domain driven design, computer language design, compilers, formal verification. Some hobby experience with hardware, embedded systems and low level programming.</span><br /> <br /> <span><strong>Title:</strong> Software developer at cBrain</span><br /> <span><strong>Mission:</strong> Hard working father, coder by day, hacker by night, RC pilot when possible.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Mason</strong><br /> <br /> <span>Mason is a JSON format for introducing hypermedia elements to classic JSON data representations. With Mason you get hypermedia elements for linking and modifying data, features for communicating to client developers and standardized error handling. Mason is built on JSON, reads JSON, writes JSON and generally fits well into a JSON based eco-system.</span><br /> <br /> <strong>Links:</strong></p>

<p>I'm not posting all of this information just so I can share my research, it is also because J&oslash;rn has contributed a lot of work to the space, and the wider world needs to understand his contributions.. While I learned a lot through this process, I will also use it as a reference for my panel at API Craft, and for other stories I write in the future.</p>
<p>I've already added <a href="https://github.com/JornWildt/Mason">Mason</a>&nbsp;as a tools in my&nbsp;<a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia API research</a>. I could spend days going through this research, but I also have 2 ther hypermedia API experts to profile, so I'm going to move on to the others, and come back to my profile of J&oslash;rn&nbsp;in the future to continue my own hypermedia education.</p>
