{% include JB/setup %}<p>I maintain an active list of online services I depend on for my business, in Evernote.Each month I spend an hour or two maintaining this list, to make sure it is complete and actively change my logins when appropriate.As a recovering IT guy, and maintaining infrastructure for myself, but also Audrey Watters--so I keep good tabs on the various services I use.While going through this my services list this month, I added a new section to it, and started tracking if I depend on the service for their API.I have enough automated jobs running on top of APIs I needed to make sure I keep good track of which APIs I depend on.</p>
