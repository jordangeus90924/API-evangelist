			<p><em>02 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I explore through API portals, looking for the successful approaches to APIs, I'm increasingly seeing formal partner programs, resulting in me expanding the topic as its own research area. My objective is to keep track of how the APIs I track on operate their partner programs, resulting in the list of organizations I reference in my research. I also want to try and identify what some of the common building blocks of API partner programs are, in addition to the news stories that I have curated about partnerships--which is the fuel of my research. I have recorded 31 separate partner programs, which I found through the course of my API monitoring and research.&nbsp; Amazon Web Services AssureSign CallFire Cloudflare Constant Contact Dandelion Developer Media Disqus DocuSign Dyn eBay Eventbrite API Facebook Gigya Google IBM Watson InfusionSoft LinkedIn Mailjet Moz MYOB API Pinterest Salesforce SendGrid Shopify SurveyMonkey The Guardian Twilio Twitter VerticalResponse Xero These are all companies who have formal partner efforts that provide a higher level of access to their API. There are many companies who feel their developer programs is a partner program, but what I am looking for is a partner program that looks to certify developers, and give them more benefits through deeper participation with a platform. After looking through these companies I've recorded a handful of what I'd consider to be some of the common building blocks of these API partner programs.&nbsp; Program Details Landing Page&nbsp;- An official landing page for the partner program. Program Details&nbsp;- Short, concise information about the program. Program Requirements&nbsp;- Information about what the details of the program are.

			<p><em>02 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have a notebook of story ideas I can do from any moment, but I find that I foten need some sort of inspiration to kick them off properly. I got that this afternoon in a Tweet from Leah Bannon, reminding me how important it is for me to have stories for non-developers. Tools that make it easier for non-devs to do stuff with APIs are the most under appreciated and awesome things in tech right now imho &mdash; Leah Bannon (@leahbannon) November 3, 2015 There are many tools available right now that let's anyone publish an API, you just have to know the right tools, and right process to get the results you need. Thanks to Zapier, you can connect to the API driven services of a wide variety of cloud tools, and using Google Spreadsheets and Zapier, you can easily store data and content, to be used in a simple API--all without writing any code. The most useful example of this, is using popular form services like Wufoo, Gravity Forms, Typeform, and Survey Monkey, you can collect just about any information you want, crafting exactly the form and fields you want, then using Zapier you can route the form results to a Google Spreadsheet. Once you have your Google Spreadsheet, you can then easily publish an API, complete with documentation using Restlet's cloud API deployment, and management services. I'm going to save the detailed how-to for a future post, but I wanted to kick-start, what I hope to be an ongoing series, of simple exmaples of how non-developers can consume and publish their own APIs, without being a programmer. My goal is to help encourage anyone to understand the value of aggregating valuable data and content using Google Sheets, and then allowing it to be put to use anywhere, by deploying an API with Restlet. If you need help with this example, let me know and I will expedite my next how-to post....[<a href="/2015/11/02/even-nondevelopers-can-create-an-api-using-popular-form-services-zapier-and-restlet/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have some really amazing resources exposed as APIs. Everyone is doing it these days, and I have some good ones, now I just need a plan. You know, actually, I need several plans, that will help me expose these resources to the right people, while remain as much control as I need, and also generate revenue from these resources, tailored to whoever I am offering them to. Starting With The Essential API Building BlocksI want to allow anyone to access my valuable APIs, however I want to control exactly how much they can access, and even limit it to a free trial, and a small amount of calls upon the API. I am going to call this Plan A, also known as my freemium layer, meant to just wet the appetite of any potential API consumer. I ow have a basic level of access to my API resources, that anyone can sign up for 24/7, yet I get to dictate exactly how many hits on the API they can make, and who gets access. Moving Beyond Plan A For My API StrategyPlan A only gets me so far, I need to also be able to establish additional plans that help me cover the costs of my operations, and hopefully also generate some revenue from API access and usage. I need to be able to establish any number of plans that I will need to be successful. Each additional plan that I offer, lets call them plan B, C, and D, should have the ability to sign-up 24/7 without approval, possess a trial version option if necessary, and allow for charging of setup costs to get going--if I so choose. Defining Usage Metrics That Are Meaningful To MeAll of my plans will start with these elements, but then should allow me to set any other metric I desire.

			<p><em>31 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>API rating is a conversation I have several times a year, with different groups, and is a conversation that seems to occurring with a little more frequency in recent months. How do we know which APIs are the good ones? What constitutes a good API? How do we measure whether a contract (the API) is being adhered to, by both API provider, and potentially the consumer as well. How will we establish the Standard &amp; Poors or Moodys for the API economy? These are the API rating conversations I am having with folks. These are all great questions, and something many companies have approached me looking help in solving, with nobody moving forward with this in a meaningful, and sustainable way. So to help apply some CPR to the subject, I am going to explore API rating some more, from my own point of view, in hopes of guiding some existing conversation I'm already having on the subject, and also hopefully generate some new ones. I want to quantify where we are at with this problem, what work I've put into, and maybe establish an open blueprint that the community might be able help run with. Starts With API DiscoveryBefore we will ever have a usable approach to API ratings, we are going to have to also work on our API discovery problems. We have one open format, designed to not just index the technical side of APIs, but also the business, and political side of operations--APIs.json. The problem is we haven't reached a critical mass where a machine readable index of API operations is available for most of the public APIs available, as well as private indexes of the APIs that exist behind the firewall. It will take time, but soon, every actor in the API economy,&nbsp;from Fitbit, up to&nbsp;the International Trade Administration, will have&nbsp;APIs.json indexes&nbsp;of their API operations.&nbsp; Next, What Makes A Good API?There are many things that goes into making an API...[<a href="/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>After writing&nbsp;I Have A Bunch Of API Resources, Now I Need A Plan, Or Potentially Several Plans, and&nbsp;How Are We Going To Create The Standard And Poors And Moodys For The API Economy, I wanted to combine what I had learned while crafting these stories, and try to look at how these two areas could work together. The API plan and pricing research is derived from existing approaches to API service composition introduced by providers like 3Scale, however the rating portion is fresh territory for me, with very few precedents to follow. What I see when I start wading through a structured approach for API providers to craft meaningful API plans to serve up their API resources through, and how developers will be paying for API usage, via the apps they build, I begin to see the potential of a structured approach to API plans, and pricing. When you start thinking of the implications across providers, and consider the opportunities for developers to manage API consumption across API providers, and exchange the credits they purchased, or generated via API usage--a potential blueprint for an economic engine for the API space begins to emerge.&nbsp; I wanted to explore this concept, by crafting a visualization, and ponder how common approaches to API plans, and pricing, could be complimented by a standardized API industry rating system. The only thing really original in this diagram, is the introduction of an API rating system, and the potential for developers being able to exchange credits between the API service providers they depend on. The rest of this standard API management approaches, that are defined by API providers like 3Scale. If you aren't familiar with modern approaches to API service composition, API providers can have many different API resources, as well as many different plans for subscribing to these API services, which provide a wealth of dimension for API providers to define, price, and limit how developers put API resources to use...[<a href="/2015/10/31/after-combining-my-api-plans-pricing-and-rating-research-i-see-hints-of-an-api-industry-economic-engine/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>There are number of areas across the API life-cycle that are being expanded upon in the current space, thanks to the evolution of API definition formats like Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML. One area I haven't seen as much growth as I'd like, is in the area of visualizations driven by API definitions.&nbsp; There are two distinct pools of API definition driven visualization: 1) Letting you visualize the surface area of an API 2) Letting you visualize the resource made available via an API. One area my friend the @APIHandyman has been exploring is around the surface area of API. @APIHandyman has a nice prototype created that he is calling "Swagger Specification Visual Documentation". The API Definition driven visualization uses A D3.js visualization to help you explore the surface area of any API that is defined using Swagger. I have written about API definition driven visualizations before, so I am happy to see the concept being pushed forward, as we have a lot of iterations to cycle through before we find a visualization format(s) that works for different API designers, architects, and developers. The visual documentation that @APIHandyman created runs on Github, and he is looking for feedback on the micro tool, and where he should take it next. He recently added a bigger information display area, but could use the communities ideas on how to make it more useful. This type of work is a time drain. Every time I started playing with Swagger + D3.js I would lose an entire evening, and have very little to show for work, so I know how valuable feedback can be. I strongly feel that API definition driven D3.js visualizations will be the future of API design, management, and orchestration. APIs are going to continue to grow in number, and scope, and we will need simple, visual ways we can quickly traverse the landscape, and makes sense of things.

			<p><em>29 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>This is one of my ideas for an API service provider, that I will never get time to do, but would love to see exist in the space, so I am happy to put out there for someone else to do. I'm calling this one an HTTP Status Code Clinic, which would be an API definition driven API service provider (why would you do it any other way in 2015), that would help API providers tailor more useful, and meaningful HTTP status codes. HTTP Status Code Clinic would be a simple software as a service, complete with its own API (why would you do it any other way in 2015), and CLI for operating as well. You would pass it a Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML, or any other API definition format, and it would return a bunch of feedback on HTTP status codes returned (or not). The process could anchor the feedback in the current API design, while also providing HTTP status code education along the way. The service would have to get crafty around how it walked through an API, requesting sample data, or requiring default values for query parameters, headers, body, etc. If it was done well it could be done as a kind of wizard that walked the user through each endpoint, what was returned, and might be better solutions, as well as additional status codes that could be used. You could also include examples from popular APIs like Twilio, Twitter, and others, to show what is possible. I recommend you do this as a standalone service. While it might be nice to have as part of an existing service provider stack, I think it makes more sense to offer as a standalone clinic / service that API providers could use when they are ready. API designers and architects could make it part of the API design and definition portion of their life-cycle, as well as integrate into their existing systems using...[<a href="/2015/10/29/an-api-idea-http-status-code-clinic/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>One of the discussions we are having behind the scenes at APIWare.io, is whether we should be hand-crafting, or auto-generating SDKs for the clients we are working with on the design, deployment, and management of their APIs.&nbsp; The answer is easy--we do both!&nbsp; There are many situations where I would push for the API SDKs to be hand-crafted, and designed for a specific API, as well as specific language or platform. However, with the increase in the number of APIs, and simplicity of some of the APIs I work with, crafting an API definition, and auto-generating your SDKs using a service like APIMATIC, makes sense. I've cracked open the APIMATIC SDKs, and only being fluent in JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and C#, I can only speak to these realms of operation, but I'm happy with what the APIMATIC team is producing. For me, this isn't a black and white game, it isn't hand-crafted vs. autogenerated--it is how you employ both approaches across your API operations. APIMATIC provides high quality SDKs in 10 languages, some languages I do not speak. The APIWare.io team has a wealth of programming talent on the team, and while we could hand code libraries across these areas, for all of our clients, for many of the more straightforward APIs, it just makes sense to generate. We are already an API-definition first shop, where we craft Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML, or other required API definition format, so using this to generate SDKs makes sense in many situations. Are you trying to figure out the best path forward for providing high quality SDKs for your API?Llet me know how my APIWare team can help. They are willing to help you figure out the best route for providing the SDKs you need, but also help maintain them as part of the versioning, and overall roadmap for your API operatins.

			<p><em>28 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have been writing some fictional stories on a project site I have called Alternate Kin Lane for some time now. Writing fictional stories in the tech space has provided a sort of pressure release valve for me, giving me a quick creative outlet throughout the week. Honestly, there are more stories in my notebook, than there are on the actual blog, but this is a sign for me that I need to spend more time working in this area. I am making several shifts in my work lately, in response to kind of hitting the wall recently, a process that includes rethinking how I work on projects, and partner with folks in the API space, as well as an increased focus on the fictional side of my writing. I do not just want to write fiction that is derived from the tech space. I want to write fiction that helps me formulate my own view of the space, and who knows, maybe influence the space in similar ways my regular tech blogging has over the last five years. If you aren't familiar with the concept of design fiction, it "is a method of critical design that uses fictional and narrative scenarios to envision, explain and raise questions about possible futures for design and the society." Up until now I was just dumping some random, crazy ideas into my fiction notebook, and taking the time to publish a few of these on Alternate Kin Lane. Now I'd like to try and bring a little closer to my daily API monitoring and research, and see if I can use to explore concepts around the tech, business, and politics of the API space--which is touching pretty much every aspect of our personal and business lives in 2015, leaving a pretty wide playing field. I think some of my writing on Alternate API Evangelist will be just as dark as some of the stuff I've written on Alternate...[<a href="/2015/10/28/adding-a-new-research-area-to-api-evangelist-i-am-calling-apidesignfiction/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I go through each of the 20 core areas of the API sector that I am keeping an eye on, in preparation for my keynotes at @DefragCon and @APIStrat, I'm taking a fresh look at which of them have APIs. When you think about it, if a company is selling a product or service to API providers, encouraging an API focus--they should probably have APIs. :-) As I was updating some of the news, companies, and reviewing the common building blocks I have aggregated across the 20 areas of research, I just poked my head around to see if I could find an API for each service provider. There are many things that look like a language specific API, but I am looking for a clear developer / API area, with a coherent web API available, as we'd expect from API providers in 2015. After spending a couple hours looking through my core research, I found the following service providers, in the follow areas, actually had web APIs available: Definitions APIMATIC API Transformer Deployment Amazon API Gateway Orchestrate.io Tyk Kong Microsoft Azure Containers Docker Kubernetes Scraping Kimono AlchemyAPI ParseHub DNS CloudFlare Akamai AWS Route 53 ARIN DNS Made Easy DNS Simple StatDNS Management 3Scale Apigee Tyk API Umbrella Github Gluu Microsoft Azure Kong SDK APIMATIC Monitoring Runscope API Science Tyk API Metrics Pingdom Status Page Testing Runscope LoadImpact Loader.io Discovery Google API Discovery Service APIs.io ProgrammableWeb IDE Codenvy This was my first pass through all of my core research looking for APIs, so I am sure I missed some--let me know which ones I missed. My design, hypermedia, performance, monetization, evangelism, embeddable, client, SDK, visualization, and virtualization didn't have any clear leaders who had easy to find APIs. I will update as I find them--which smells like an opportunity to me. Eventually I'd like to see some common definitions to be established across all these areas of the API space, but as you can...[<a href="/2015/10/27/which-api-service-providers-across-the-20-areas-i-track-on-have-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I was talking through the features, and roadmap for SecureDB with their team the other day, and one of the conversations that came up was around on-premise opporutnities for deploying encrypted user, data, and file APIs. In my opinion, on-premise is something that has morphed from meaning "in our data center", to where wherever we store data and run our compute power--which could be spread across multiple cloud vendors.
SecureDB offers an extremely valuable API commodity in 2015, encrypted user, data, and file stores--something EVERY website and mobile application should have as part of their back-end. When you have something this valuable, and potentnially ubiquitous, it needs to run wherever it is needed. With this in mind SecureDB is available on demand, as a retail API solution, but they will also deploy it for you "on-premise" on AWS or Heroku, with "more platforms in the roadmap".
While a wholesale, on-premise, deploy anywhere API will not be required for all APIs, as some SaaS solutions won't benefit from this type of distribution, if you are a core architectural building block, or utility APIs like SecureDB, to compete in the API economy, your API will have to deployable to anywhere it is needed. With the explosion of Docker and Kubernetes, your API should technically be able to able to be deployed in any containerized environment, with a business model, licensing, and legal framework to support the different use cases.
The ability to deploy your API on Heroku is just a gateway drug to the wholesale, white lable, containerized, API economy that is coming, where the most agile, flexible, and interoperable APIs will dominate.&nbsp;

			<p><em>27 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As you probably know, I'm always up for learning about APIs, so when @Darrel_Miller and @GBlock started doing their In the Mood for HTTP podcast, I was all in. Both Darrel and Glenn are API experts, and respected leaders in the space, but more importantly both of them are super nice guys, and reflect a tone I love to experience and support across the API space.
The format for In The Mood For HTTP is simple. The audience asks questions, and Darrel and Glenn discuss. They are both very graceful in how they answer questions, extremely knowledgeable on the subjects at hand, but they are also very opinionated, and they don't always agree--the exchange between them is educational, and very benefitial to the wider API community.
The API duo has quickly produced three episodes. I am listening to episode three as I write this post. My only critique of the podcast is I'd like to see better indexing of the episodes, with easy text version of the questions, and a link to that specific time in the Youtube videos. I'd love to have a library of these organized in a sort of API FAQ, that I can share with my readers, and reference throughout my storytelling.
I'm going to explore how I can get more involved, and provide some questions, and help drive their conversations. I've enjoyed doing this with Traffic and Weather, and other API related podcasts that have emerged. On this note, I encourage anyone to create their own podcast in the space, and explore finding your voice when it comes to conversations in the API space. I know many voices across the space, who I hear at API conferences like @APIStrat and @APIDaysGlobal, which I'd like to hear in more real-time, as Darrel and Glenn are doing--if you do, I'll help support!
Keep up the good work you guys!

			<p><em>27 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As I've written several posts on the recent Amazon API Gateway release, one of the side things I noted about the API solution from AWS, was that API monitoring is baked in by default. As stated on the AWS API Gateway page:
After your API is deployed, Amazon API Gateway provides you with a dashboard to visually monitor calls to your services using Amazon CloudWatch, so you see performance metrics and information on API calls, data latency, and error rates.
This may seem like common sense to many people who have been in the API space for a while now, but for many API designers, architects, developers, and business folk who are just getting going, API monitoring may not be default for all implementations.
To me, AWS baking in API monitoring by default, demonstrates that the world of API monitoring has matured, marking an important milestone that all API providers should pay attention to. I've been watching this space grow over the last couple years, and similar to the API management space, the AWS release reflects the overall health of the API sector.
If you are operating any API In 2015, monitoring should be standard operating procedure, alongside your API documentation.

			<p><em>26 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>It can be difficult to know where to start when it comes storytelling around an API. Many of us who have been in the space, have followed the lead of Twitter, Twilio, Amazon, and others, but when you are new to the space, knowing where to start can often be paralyzing. This is something I am regularly helping clients and partners think through, and while&nbsp;I'm thinking through the topic with SecureDB, I figured I'd share the details with you my readers. If you are unfamiliar with how the API Evangelist network operates, I have common building blocks available for almost 20 core stops along the API lifecycle. However, when many of my partners and clients are just getting going, they are often overwhelmed by the volume of data I provide, so I regularly find myself tailoring, and distilling down a specific strategy for each conversation I engage in. I wanted to help SecureDB understand where they can start with evangelism from day one, by providing a 101 list for API evangelism, but before I could do this, I needed to make sure they had a few API building blocks in place first. Wait...before we got going with a 101 API evangelism list, let's make sure the most essential element is present? Value&nbsp;- Check! Encryption for all your data in this climate is critical. Now, let's make sure the minimum viable&nbsp;API management building blocks&nbsp;are in place to support evangelism efforts: On-boarding Portal -&nbsp;Check. The SecureDB product is their API,&nbsp;so the website is their portal.&nbsp; Getting Started -&nbsp;Check. There is a&nbsp;simple quick-start&nbsp;to get developer up and running. Self-Service Registration -&nbsp;Check. There is a simple,&nbsp;self-service signup&nbsp;for the &nbsp;platform. Documentation API Definition -&nbsp;Check. SecureDB has their API defined using Swagger. Documentation&nbsp;- Check. They provide&nbsp;an attractive Slate version, as well as&nbsp;interactive Swagger playground.

			<p><em>24 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>An API key management service targeting Drupal developers came across my radar this week. The service is very focused, in that it is a Drupal module, and is focused on helping Drupal developers manage the keys they use across a single app or installation, but I think it represents a potentially larger trend. I think this particular solutions is just a symptom of a growing problem for developers of any type--how do you manage the number of keys you are depending on for you application(s). API consumers are in need of a plug and play way of to store, access, and manage the increasing number of API keys they put in use, otherwise we will be looking at a pretty serious security problem, adding to the existing security issues API providers and consumers face. If you need evidence of the viability of API Key management solutions, AWS has one. Ok, why don't developer just use AWS? Well they should if it makes sense, but we also need other competing, and complimentary key management solutions, to ensure a healthy API space. Not all users are going to need full-blown IAM solutions, they just need a simple, encrypted place to put all their keys, and some utilities to help them manage them.&nbsp; Personally, I store my keys in a JSON config file stored in the private Github repo for any application I develop, and for each org, I have some crude API key management utilities to help me manage turnover. My server apps can cache the config file locally, and my client side apps run on Github Pages, using SSL, and Github OAuth to open up API key access they need. I will be keeping an eye out for more API key management solutions, and begin the process of documenting the building blocks of these product and services, like I do with other areas.

			<p>I had a follower tweet out an interesting question about successful patterns for multi-linguarl APIs, which I thought was interesting enough to share as a story, adding to my research, and helping me tune into the topic better.&nbsp; As the API economy unfolds, and APIs make their way into more countries around the globe, the need to standardize how we internationalize different layers of our API operations is only going to increase--making these types of conversation starters very important. Here is the Twitter thread: @phillipadsmith @kinlane The Accept-Language header is a good start. https://t.co/Gt6TuUUSB2 &mdash; pete gamache (@gamache) October 21, 2015 @gamache @kinlane Root of my Q is headers vs. endpoints, e.g., /en/ &amp; situations where document is avail in one lang but not another &mdash; Phillip Smith (@phillipadsmith) October 21, 2015 @phillipadsmith @kinlane I&rsquo;d advocate for a query string, e.g. ?lang=en, rather than a URL path. The server can choose a fallback language. &mdash; pete gamache (@gamache) October 21, 2015 @gamache @kinlane Pondering... So, /documents/?lang=ar might return documents in fallback language if not available in Arabic, for example? &mdash; Phillip Smith (@phillipadsmith) October 21, 2015 @phillipadsmith @kinlane More or less. I&rsquo;d imagine /documents/?lang=en would return a list of docs in English (1/2) &mdash; pete gamache (@gamache) October 21, 2015 @phillipadsmith @kinlane And /documents/123?lang=en would return doc 123 in either English or a fallback language. &mdash; pete gamache (@gamache) October 21, 2015 @gamache @kinlane What if a collection of documents only exist in Arabic, and not English? &mdash; Phillip Smith (@phillipadsmith) October 21, 2015 @phillipadsmith @kinlane Then Arabic becomes the fallback language for that doc, and the response carries the header Content-Language: ar. &mdash; pete gamache (@gamache) October 21, 2015 I see two key building block that I can extract from this conversation.

			<p><em>23 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>Shortly after the Zypr voice API came on to the scene in 2011, I launched my research into voice APIs. Like many other areas of the API universe, voice has come in and out of focus for me, something I think will take much longer to unfold, than any of us could have ever imagined. Zypr quickly ran out of steam, and other similar solutions have come and gone over the last couple years as well, leaving my research pretty scattered across many different concepts of how voice and APIs are colliding--lacking any real coherency. I took a moment last week to take a fresh look at my voice API research, because of a comment by Steven Willmott (@njyx), the CEO of 3Scale. Its not an exact quote, but Steve spoke about how voice is the future of API consumption, after he had attended the AWS:Reinvent in Las Vegas. I agree with him. Voice APIs is a topic that has been significantly stimulated with the&nbsp;introduction of the Amazon Echo platform, but I also feel also coincides with a critical mass of available API driven resources that will deliver some of the value these platforms are promising users. Voice recognition has always been something that leaves a lot to be desired--think Siri. Even with these challenges there are many dimensions to the voice API discussion, and with the amount of resources now available via simple APIs in 2015, I feel we are reaching a more fertile, and friendly time for voice solutions to return the value end-users desire. We now have a rich playing field of weather, news, stocks, image, video, podcast, and other data, content, rich media, and programmatic resources, which can be linked to specific voice commands--something we didn't have before. While there is still so much work to be done, but I agree with Steve's vision, that voice will play an increasingly significant role as an API client. I would add that like...[<a href="/2015/10/23/voice-as-the-next-generation-api-client/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've been tagging companies that I come across in my research, and stories that I find with the term "orchestration" for some time now. Some of this overlaps with what we know as cloud-centric orchestration using Puppet or Chef, but I am specifically looking for how we orchestrate across the API lifecycle which I feel overlaps with cloud orchestration, but pushes into some new realms. As I'm carving off my orchestration research, I am also spending time reviewing a newer breed of what I'm calling API hubs, workspaces, or garages. Over the last year, I've broken out IDE research from my overall API Discovery research, and SDK from my API Management research, and client from my API Integration research. In parallel with an API-centric way of life, I want all my research to be as modular as possible, allowing me to link it together into meaningful ways that help me better understand how the space works, or could work. Now that I'm thinking terms of orchestration, something that seems to be a core characteristic of these new&nbsp;API hubs, work spaces, or garages--I'm seeing a possibly new vision of the API life-cycle. I'm going to organize these new hubs, work spaces, and garages under my IDE research. I am starting to believe that these new work spaces are just the next generation IDE meant to span the entire API life-cycle--we will see how this thought evolves. This new approach to API IDEs gives us design, and development capabilities, but also allows us to mock and deploy APIs. You can generate API documentation, and SDKs, and I'm seeing hints of orchestration using Github and Docker. I'm seeing popular clients like Postman evolve to be more like a API life-cycle IDE, and I'm also seeing API design tooling like Restlet Studio invest in HTTP clients to expand beyond just design, adding live client interaction, testing, and other vital life-cycle elements. None of my research is absolute. It is...[<a href="/2015/10/23/reconciling-my-api-orchestration-research-with-the-evolution-of-ide-sdk-and-http-clients/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am keynoting APIStrat in Austin next month, and it is a big deal for me. Ok, its my event, and I probably shouldn't be that excited, but it is the first time I've ever keynoted it. ;-) It is the sixth edition of APIStrat, and Steve asked if I wanted to keynote, which I dismissed because it seemed too ego, but when he pushed back, I realized that I would be stoked to keynote.
I'm excited about the preparation for the talk, and trying to think about how I can incorporate my research, and working API operations into it. I'm also keynoting Defrag the week before, so both my keynotes will march in lockstep. They won't be the same keynote, but they will reflect what I'm seeing across the API space right now, allowing me to use both venues as vehhicle to move my research forward.&nbsp;

My Defrag talk is titled, "The 17 Stops Along The Modern API Lifecycle", which I'm guessing will grow as I prepare both these talks, but it will also be the same core theme of my APIStrat keynote. Over the last five years, the API space has been slowly coming into focus for me, and in 2015 I feel like I'm really starting to see some coherency in how things are working together, making for a clearer API life-cycle for me to reference.
Storytelling on my blog helps me work through my ideas, and doing it on stage at Defrag and APIStrat will help me organize them in a way that can benefit the entire API community. I haven't been this excited about two talks in a while, and I'm looking forward to sharing where my research has gone in 2015, on stage at two conferences I really enjoy supporting.
See you in Broomfield and Austin folks!

			<p><em>23 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I started playing with the possibilities when it comes to API deployment using virtual containers like Docker early this year, exploring the constraints this approach to API deployment introduced, on my own infrastructure. The process got my gears turning, when it comes to deploying very simple data, content, and algorithmic APIs into any environment that runs Docker.&nbsp; As 2015 has progressed, I'm seeing containers emerge as part of more stops along the API life-cycle, specifically in deployment and virtualization. A new one that just came across my radar is API PLUG. I haven't played with the containerized API deployment solution yet, but after watching video, and looking through site it seems in line with what I'd expect to see from a next generation, containerized, API deployment solution. Overlapping with my previous post on reconciling API orchestration, I'm seeing several stops along API lifecycle present in API PLUG, beyond just API deployment, it allows you to design, deploy, and document your API which moves well into the world of API management. As I'm seeing with other emerging solutions like API Studio from Apigee, I predict we will see testing, monitoring, and other critical layers of the API life-cycle emerge as orchestration layers of API PLUG. I've added API PLUG to my API deployment research, and I am still considering the best way to include them in other areas of my API research. I'm increasingly finding that modern API management solutions are spanning multiple areas of the API life-cycle, which further encourages me to modularize my research, but also tells me I'm going to need to create some sort of Venn Diagram visualization to help me better understand the reach of emerging API products and services. Anyways, more to come on API PLUG as I play with, and listen to the stories they tell via their blog, Twitter, and Github accounts (I can only find a Twitter account, but I'm sure they are working on that! ;-)....[<a href="/2015/10/23/api-plug-a-new-containerized-api-design-deployment-and-documentation-solution/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
Marketing your products and services in the API sector can often look very different than marketing of products and services in other sectors. Developers are a very different target audience, and to make things even more complicated, not all developers are created equal! Open developer are not like the enterprise developer, and healthcare developers won't have much in common with device-based, Internet of Things developers.&nbsp;
How to market your API has been a session at every APIStrat since we did the first conference in New York City back in February of 2013, and we just announced the latest edition of marketing for APIs at @APIStrat in Austin in November. Here is the lineup we have for this round:





Thursday Bram (@thursdayb)
Urgency Inc.





Matt Gordon (@esquivalient)
Expected Behavior





Adam Duvander (@adamd)
Orchestrate.io





Kristen Womack (@kristen_womack)
LeadPages




With the session being chaired by:




Jennifer Lankford (@jenlankford)Crowd Supply, Inc.&nbsp;(Session Chair)



The marketing session at @APIStrat is one of the tracks that is meant for API users of all types, from business to developer, and is something that should be attended whether you are at a startup, or leading things in the enterprise.&nbsp;
There is less than a month left before @APIStrat Austin 2015, so make sure and get registered before tickets are sold out.&nbsp;There are also still a couple of keynotes left to announce, so stay tuned for some last minute highlights.
We'll see you in Austin, November 18th, 19th, and 20th.

			<p>It has been a year or two since I've given any deep thought to the Twitter ecosystem. There has been such little meaningful action to come out of the social platform over the last couple years, I had all but given up on it being a platform with any sort of future for developers. When Jack Dorsey apologized and solicited feedback from the community this week, I honestly felt I didn't have much to offer when it comes to advice--I just wasn't prepared. Twitter does almost everything right when it comes to their developer ecosystem...well on the surface, where they do fail, is within the most critical areas of API operations: Communication&nbsp;- Twitter communicates about the usual mundane API platform stuff, but really lacks a tone and substance that really cuts through the BS for developers. In my opinion it will take years to recover from the tone set by Dick Costolo &amp; Ryan Sarver--they just did not respect developers at all, and it showed. This isn't something you recover from quickly. Access &amp; Rate Limits -&nbsp;While communications around access level and rate limits have gotten much more clearer, with a dedicated area in dev portal, and available inline within documentation, it will take going the extra mile before developers feel like there is truly a level playing field. It will require more API access to account level usage, notifications, dashboards, etc. to heal these wounds--real-time communication. Business Model -&nbsp;There is just no clear business model evident from the developer ecosystem--something that showcases how Twitter is making money, where the API fits into this, and the opportunity for developers to play in this game. I've broken down the pricing confusion involved with using the REST API, and Streaming API, and tried to understand across the different levels of access--even though my research is dated, the confusion still exists. There is no clarity when it comes to how I can grow my usage of Twitter (as...[<a href="/2015/10/22/if-twitter-can-deliver-transparency-around-api-access-and-business-model-they-might-be-able-to-find-their-way-again/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I just had a call with one of my newer API partners, working with them on crafting version 1.0 of their API evangelism strategy, and the subject of what content to generate, and which channels to use, when building up their brand arose. In my work, about 90% of the approaches I see implemented by API providers is a traditional PR strategy, where you create content, and push to popular channels to do the work of syndicating the message. While this approach works, and is something I recommend you do, I have a different way of building up my brand, and the partner or community brands that I invest in. All of this begins with something that truly brings value to the table for everyone involved, without this, my approach will not work. Once you have something of value, you start working directly with this value, building things, experimenting and playing, while telling the story all along the way. If it isn't something you'd use yourself, and be able to innovate with, why would you expect anyone else to. If value truly exists around products, services, and tooling associated with a brand, you will build momentum with each story you tell, eventually encouraging others to do the same. An example of this in the wild is with the fast growing API definition Swagger. I started paying attention to Swagger closely in 2011, and by mid 2014 I had gone all in with Swagger, and integrated into my own platform, and tooling, resulting in 265 stories that reference swagger over the last four years. Let me show the value driven by this type of storytelling--here are the plotting of my stories over the last four years: Here is a plotting of growth of the Swagger according to Google Trends: This is how you build brand awareness organically. I'm not saying I'm solely responsible for Swagger's success--it all started with the value brought to the table by...[<a href="/2015/10/22/how-to-build-an-api-brand-through-consistent-storytelling/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>One layer I am working to add to my API research, are machine readable API definitions that I find, or generate from the APIs of the API service providers I keep an eye on. Within this new layer I'm aggregating these API the specs of the companies who are offering services within the emerging areas of the API sector. The first area I've started aggregating is within API management. 3Scale was very forward leaning with their willingness to open up their API definitions for their own API management infrastructure APIs. These are API specs that describe all of the features of the 3Scale API management platform, and represent one possible blueprint that API management service providers could emulate. I have four separate API definitions included from 3Scale on my new page, something that could be broken down further if it makes sense. I also just added a suggested API definition for API portals--crafted by the APIMATIC team. They thought my idea for defining a common set of definitions across the 17+ areas I monitor was an interesting cenough oncept, and was something they wanted to explore further with me. Zeeshan Ejaz Bhatti of APIMATIC pulled together this spec: &nbsp; &nbsp; This is just one potential starting point for providing a common interface for managing your API portal. Zeeshan feels that , if "API-Portals-as-a-Service", and other API management providers agreed on a common publish API format, it would benefit other API service providers like APIMATIC who are providing services to their customers via these API portals. I agree with Zeeshan, and might&nbsp;play around adding an API facade for managing your API portal using Github + Jekyll, like I do with my standard API Portal template. This is all work in progress. Right now I am just aggregating the API definitions for API service providers that have APIs. In my opinion this layer of the API space will differentiate API service providers from each other, demonstrating which...[<a href="/2015/10/22/adding-a-suggested-api-definition-for-api-portals-to-my-api-management-spec-collection/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I have used the&nbsp;Federal Agency Directory API&nbsp;for quite some time to lookup federal government agencies. USA.gov has some highly valuable, and simple APIs including the&nbsp;Social Media Registry API, which I find extremely useful. They recently added a new one for searching government websites that do not end in .gov.
The Non-.gov URLs APIs allows you to search for all websites that end in .com, .org, .edu, or other top-level domains, including:

Federal, state, local,&nbsp;tribal, commonwealth, and territorial government agency websites
Federal reserve banks and branches
Federal home loan banks
Libraries, archives, and museums, including&nbsp;Presidential libraries
Department of Defense websites for&nbsp;recruiting&nbsp;and&nbsp;service academies
Travel and tourism&nbsp;websites for states and U.S. territories
State lotteries
Cooperative extensions
Combined federal campaigns
Government sponsored enterprises&nbsp;(such as Fannie Mae) [PDF]
Federal and state retirement systems
Task forces (such as the Preventative Services Task Force) and commissions (such as the 9/11 Commission)
A few select, non government organizations (such as the Red Cross) and public-private partnerships



I find the APIs coming out of USA.gov to be excellent examples of what ALL government agencies should be doing. The APIs don't have to be complicated, just provide simple read, and sometimes write access to valuable government data that should be public.
I am going to prioritize the creation of an API definition for USA.gov, and wrap their APIs in an APIs.json file, and add to my federal API stack. The more of these APIs I have at my disposal, the more efficient I am at when it comes to opening up government data, and making existing API resources available across my research.

			<p><em>16 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've been working on expand upon my API security research, but it can be difficult to find API focused security solutions. Exactly what is security when it comes to APIs can vary. Are you looking to secure your APIs? Are you looking to secure your data or content using an API? This is why I started a research projects so that I can turn on my keyword monitoring, and begin scouring the landscape in real-time--the more I conduct research in an area, the better I get at it. The best part of my research is that sometimes when I write about things, companies just come to me. This happened the other week, with an encrypted database API provider called SecureDB. What this brand new API driven platform provides is default security for your&nbsp;accounts, data, files, and settings--exactly what we need in this cyber-insecure world we have created for ourselves. I do not store any sensitive data, but if I did, I would not want to be in the business of storing it. Period! SecureDB gives you everything you need to manage your users account and identity, create the data stores you need, and store your appilcations files and settings in a secure environment. All identity data is encrypted by default, and you get to set the encryption levels for all your data stores, allowing you to make sure everything sensitive is not readable on the server, even if it is compromised. SecureDB is just getting started, but they have a lot of things in the works, including on-premise, containerized implementations, version that run on Heroku, white label solutions, and much more. I will be working with them to help them craft a marketing and storyteling strategy around their encrypted database solution, and establishing a deeper partnership between them and API Evangelist. I'm pretty stoked on my ability to attract these types of API service providers just by publishing my research regularly, and talking about the...[<a href="/2015/10/16/an-api-for-encrypted-storage-of-all-your-accounts-data-files-and-setting/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>It is up to API providers to establish a coherent approach regarding how they rollout and manage their APIs, something that historically has just involved deploying and managing, but in the last couple of years we have seen more formal approaches emerge, something we are all calling the API lifecycle.&nbsp; In 2012, after we started standardizing our API development and management thinking using API definitions, the expansion of the API lifecycle was set into motion with the introduction of an API design-first way of thinking from the Apiary team. API definitions allowed us to get our development and management house in order, but also begin collaborating, mocking, and having a conversation around our API designs, way before we began the costly process of writing code. In 2015, I am tracking on API definitions driving over 17 separate stops along this fast evolving API lifecycle. While some API providers who are further along in their API journey are incorporating all of these stops, many API providers who are just getting going, are still learning about all the stops along this modern API lifecycle. Part of this evolution is establishing just exactly what is your companies API lifecycle, something that can be a very personal thing, and we'll need more of our tooling to help us quantify this. This is why I was happy to see evidence of API lifecycle management built into the tooling with the new AWS API Gateway. In my earlier post on the&nbsp;potentially very powerful API orchestration with the Amazon API Gateway: Going beyond the types of integration you can employ when crafting, and deploying APIs using the Amazon API Gateway, the platform also provides a way to define stages that APIs will exist in from design, development, QA, production, or any other stage you wish. I like the concept of having a stage defined for each API, designating where it exists on the API life-cycle.

			<p><em>15 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I mentioned the concept of what I call API building blocks coming to life by API service providers yesterday. These are the features provided from API service providers that are made accessible via APIs. Mind blowing right? API service providers having APIs? Which then allows API providers to programmatically manage the operations of their own APIs? Who would have ever thought!! Actually it is a pretty clear example of API service providers who are kind of full of it, when they do not offer their own APIs--meaning they are telling you about the importance of APIs, but not actually practicing what they preach. It is kind of like API providers who do not use their own APIs in their applications (dogfooding). Anyhoo. I have done a lot of work to define the common building blocks across API service providers, spanning over 17 stops along the API lifecycle, and part of the next phase of my research is to connect these building blocks to actual API definitions that can help automate these vital API features. First up, I took the 3Scale API, and generated this list of common building blocks represented in the API for their API infrastructure.

			<p><em>14 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
Maybe I've looked at too many APIs, but I feel that APIs are very telling of the overall culture of a company. APIs that are trusting, tend to open up a full stack of APIs, including POST, PUT (or PATCH), and DELETE functionality, giving developers access to all, or nearly all functionality available via a platform.
I do not feel that platforms are required to open up everything, but the amount of what they open up, does tells a lot about how a company is thinking. While I find many companies are not fully up to speed on the benefits a modern API management strategy, and the control it gives you over resources and API consumers, I think many just do not trust anyone outside the firewall, and think they know best when it comes to everything.
APIs are not for every company, and I do not think everybody should have any API, but I do want API providers to be aware of how telling their approach will be about their motives behind having an API. You should not see this as a negative lesson, it will help you think about your company from the outside-in, this is one of the most important aspects of the API journey in my opinion.
A journey you should begin as soon as possible, if you think you can make it work in a positive way.

			<p><em>14 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
NASA just launched two new APIs, as part of their open data efforts. I find the APIs they offer to be simple, and very inspirational examples of what an API can be. Maybe I just love space, but seeing these well designed, very fun APIs out of our countries space agency is just cool.
They added a Near Earth Asteroids API, and a Mars Rover Photos API, and they also understand the value of telling the story of the release on their blog. Remember API providers, if you launch an API in the woods and don't blog about, nobody will know about it--storytelling is one of the most important tools in your toolbox.
Also, your APIs don't have to be complicated, and overthought. Just providing GET access to interesting images and other content like NASA is doing can really go a long ways in generating attention (it got me to write a blog post). You can see this in action with both their APIs, and their approach to their API portal--I look forward to seeing what APIs they release next!

			<p><em>14 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I wrote about the ability to convert between multiple API definition formats using API Transformer&nbsp;the other day, a solution being developed by the APIMATIC team, and shortly after posting, the LucyBot team pointed out they are working on a similar tool. This is one of the reason I try to write these posts, it always brings folks out of the woodwork.
It is good to see multiple efforts out there. Converting of API definition formats is a fast growing need for both API providers and consumers, something that is only going to grow with the adoption of popular API definition formats. I feel it is a healthy sign that standard tooling for converting common API has emerged, and an even better sign that there will be a diverse selection in this tooling.
It looks like the Lucybot converter is a little behind API Transformer, but I'm sure they will get caught up soon. I'm eager to see how these API definition conversion service providers keep up with each version of API definitions as they evolve, as well as new players who enter the game. If they can do successfully they will possess some very valuable data around which API definitions are being put to use by API providers and consumers.

			<p><em>13 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
If you have followed my work since 2010, you know I pull out what I call the common building blocks of originally just API management, but over the last five years this has grown to 17 areas of the API life-cycle. My goal is to better understand the common features offered by API service providers, but only the ones that will also matter to API consumers at the same time.
In the last couple months I started tracking on how these API building blocks match to actual APIs offered by the API service providers I monitor. What do I mean? Well, when you consider the common building blocks offered offered by API management providers, these building blocks come to life when you look at the API offered by 3Scale.
Moving down the lifecylce, you can see this in action with the Runscope API in the area of API monitoring. The RunScope API allows API providers and consumers to realize API monitoring and testing in a programmatic way, going beyond the web interface they provide to their users. While the features available via RunScope, and via the APIs are not a one to one match, they represent a very important start.
This is where API providers become API consumers, accessing common building blocks they will need to operate their platform. This is also where API providers practice what they preach, and also become API providers, in addition to just selling services to API providers--an important distinction that separate the API service providers who are further along in their journey.&nbsp;
If you are an API service provider, and do not offer an API to your customers, matching as many of the features available in your interface, my prediction is you won't last long in the current fast moving landscape.

			<p>One of the things that really bothers me in the API space is when API service providers are too competitive, establish silos, don't use APIs themselves, and refuse to provide interoperability with other service providers. It is the API space y'all, this shit needs to work together, if we expect anyone to buy into what we are selling--if you aren't confident of the product you are selling, you probably shouldn't be in business. This is why it makes me happy to see the work 3Scale has done in integrating their own API infrastructure with AWS API infrastructure. You can find the details of the integration opportunity over at 3Scale, but I want to focus on the subject of API service providers working together, even if it is externally augmented like 3Scale did, as opposed to formal partnership. Within weeks of AWS launching their API Gateway, the 3Scale team was not only unfazed by the potential competition from the cloud giant, they immediately got to work understanding how their own infrastructure could compliment the offering. There is an overlap between the AWS API Gateway, and 3Scale infrastructure, but both platforms bring an immense amount of value to the table, and it is very forward thinking of their team to see this, rather than just sit around worrying about what AWS would do to their business. 3Scale has an eight year head start when it comes to API management, and AWS brings some serious API deployment power to the table with their new Lambda platform. What 3Scale has done, represents how API service providers should behave in the industry. I have lots of experience in trying to get API service providers to work together, and participate in a conversation on stage at events, something that can like getting a group of toddlers to play together. To me, what 3Scale is doing demonstrate their confidence in the infrastructure they are selling. I saw a number of folks on...[<a href="/2015/10/10/3scale-sets-example-by-augmenting-the-amazon-api-gateway-with-their-own-api-infrastructure/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I add each API to my stack, I consider security along the way. I require an API key to access all of my APIs using my 3Scale API management infrastructure, and I also have different tiers of access, and while defining this management layer my first impulse is always put POST, PUT, and DELETE methods into the most trusted tiers. The service composition layer in API management is where I feel the heart of API is--the thing that makes it different than SOA, and other approaches. This is where you can loosen things up, trust your 3rd party developers, and allow serendipity to occur. If you always default to locking things down, and only allowing the updating of resources by internal, or just trusted external sources, you are limiting the possibilities. With this in mind I'm carefully evaluating a couple of defensive API management tactics I can employ: Notifications - Make sure and send out an email or push notification to myself when POST, PUT, and DELETE are executed on certain APIs. Key Locking - Allow for a certain amount of POST, PUT, and DELETE, but when you go over a certain volume, it locks your API key. While these tactics won't prevent all bad situations, it can help me quickly identify them, and take action. My goal is to encourage people to develop on top of my APIs, and I'd rather focus on letting things flow, over locking everything down. There are certain security realities surrounding publicly available APIs, but honestly most people will never take the time to register for key, and learn a system just so they can do malicious things, and for the ones that will, I have some defensive things in place to trip them up. There are plenty of tools built into my 3Scale API infrastructure that do this for me, what I am considering are some additional measures I can build into my own API, that employ...[<a href="/2015/10/06/thinking-through-some-of-my-defensive-api-management-tactics/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've been getting demos of some pretty interesting new work spaces meant for API architects, and designers. Examples of this are API Garage,&nbsp;RepreZen API Studio, and the recent SwaggerHub. These are just some of the API life-cycle solutions I'm seeing emerge recently, where companies are trying to provide API design, development, and deployment solutions in a single, tidy, work space. Now that the API life-cycle has expanded beyond just API management, deployment, and design, into testing, monitoring, security, and beyond, I predict these types of API work-spaces that span multiple stops along the API life-cycle will become common place. To help prime the pump, and ensure there will be more viable products launched, I wanted to share a few thoughts on what these solution providers should consider as part of their offerings. Here are some of my scribbles while drinking an IPA at my local bar: API Definitions - Speak Swagger, API Blueprint, Postman Collections, and other common API definition formats, and allow for the importing and exporting of them at every step. Provide APIs - Make sure you provide APIs to all the functionality available within the workspace -- paying the whole API thing forward. Consume APIs - Make sure you allow the consumption of APIs, from within the interface, either as part of http client, or add-ons. Plug-in Framework - Allow some sort of extensibility of the work space, allowing 3rd parties to augment the platform via plugins. Play Well With Others - Please play nice with other service providers, all of this works because of interoperability, and I should be able to use the services I need via my work space. Search - Provide a comprehensive search, allowing me to discovery across everything I do within a work space, via a comprehensive history Notebook - Give me a notebook for storing my work, draft APIs, and other items I gather through my work, allowing me to come back and re-use work from...[<a href="/2015/10/06/some-thoughts-for-the-coming-wave-of-api-hubs-garages-and-workbenches/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I received a personal demo of the new SwaggerHub from Mr. Swagger himself -- Tony Tam, this last week. SwaggerHub is a new API life-cycle hub, centered around the API definition format, developed by the SmartBear Swagger team. The new hub brings together all of the Swagger tooling into a single, collaborative web application, that allows you to manage API definitions through varioius stages of the API life-cycle. SwaggerHub lets you import and export your JSON or YAML Swagger definitions, giving you an environment for storing, searching, versioning, and collaborating around the definitions. Using the platform, you can edit Swagger definitions using Swagger Editor, generate server and client side code with Swagger CodeGen, and play with the API using Swagger UI--all wrapped in this new versioned and collaborative API design environment. After importing a handful of my APIs into SwaggerHub, it feels like a solution to help me manage the central truth that are my API definitions, allowing me to bring other people into the process, and generate the code and docs that will be needed at other stops along the API life-cycle. I'm assuming that other stops like testing, monitoring, and virtualization will emerge in future iterations of SwaggerHub. SwaggerHub works well for API definition centralization, collaboration, and management, but some of the publishing of docs, server and client code didn't work as I'd expect them. There is Github integration for logging into SwaggerHub, and a "Github Push" feature, which I couldn't get to work, so I'm assuming the publishing and orchestration around APIs will only improve -- something I'm really interested in, because I use Github to manage all aspects of APIs life-cycle. I like what I see so far in the SwaggerHub, and see hints of the future with Docker image references, an API behind the platform, and I know there is APIs.json goodness right behind the surface. For now, I will just keep importing my designs into SwaggerHub, keep playing with,...[<a href="/2015/10/02/playing-with-the-new-swaggerhub/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have a whole bunch of APIs I want to deploy. There is a queue of APIs that I will never get to, but I can't help myself, and when I am tired of watching what everyone else is doing, and want to get busy actually building things, I crack open my queue of ideas. This weekend I launched four new APIs, that will be in the service of some very different objectives that I have. Low Hanging Fruit - Identifying the potential CSV, XLS, XML, and table resources that exist in any domain, and publish them to Github as a list for deploying as APIs - aka the low hanging fruit. TSA.Report - A simple form for submitting your thoughts as you are going through the airport line. APIs.How - The URL shoretner for the API Evangelist and Kin Lane network--getting off Bitly. Magnetic Jargon - A dictionary creation API, allowing the building of word lists to use for a magnetic fridge web and mobile app I am building. Each of these APIs have a specific purpose. Low Hanging Fruit, and APIs.how are both very back-end system tools, where TSA.Report and Magnetic Jargon are meant to drive simple web and mobile applications. The purpose of these applications are not the point of this story, the minimum viable existence of these four new APis is what I want to talk about. These four APIs are far from complete. I anticipate that TSA.Report and Magnetic.Jargon will evolve based upon the apps that are developed on them, but Low Hanging Fruit and APIs.How are core to how I do business, and will continue to evolve as far as I can afford to scale them (ie how many sites and links I can index).&nbsp; My goal this weekend, is to just get the APIs up and running. Their overall relevance and productivity in my world will be decided by their roadmap.

			<p><em>24 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>I was gathering my thoughts today around API management solutions can better work together, in response to an industry discussion going on between several creators of open source tooling. The Github thread is focused on proxies, and how they can work more closely together to facilitate interoperability in this potentially federated layer of the API economy, but as I do, I wanted to step back and look at bigger picture before I responded.&nbsp; As I was gathering my thoughts, I also had an interesting conversation with the creator of API Garage, in which one of the topics was around how we encourage API service providers to want to work closer, but this time from the perspective of a API client workspace. This made me think, that the thoughts I was gathering about how open source proxies can better work together, should be universally applied to every step along the API lifecycle. Open APIsIt should be a no-brainer for API service providers--have an API! One of the best examples of this, is with 3Scale API management--they have a very robust API, that represents every aspect of the API management layer. Other service providers like API Science, and APIMATIC, who server other stops along the API life-cycle, also have their own APIs. If you want your API tooling to work with other API tooling, have an API--think about Docker, and their API interface, and make your tools behave this way.&nbsp; Open SourceProvide openly licensed tooling around any service you provide. Make your tooling as modular as you can, and apply open source licenses wherever it makes sense. Open licenses, facilitate people working together, and breaks down silos. This is obvious to the folks on the API proxy thread I'm referencing, but will not be as obvious to other service providers looking to break into the market.&nbsp; Open DefinitionsSpeak common API definition formats like Swagger, API Blueprint, and in Postman Collections, and provide indexes using APIs.json.

			<p><em>22 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>
My own API management system allows me to import Postman collections, HAR files, Charles Proxy XML files, and Swagger version 1.2, but when it comes to output, it only speaks Swagger 2.0. I've been wanting to create a tool for outputting my definitions as API Blueprint for some time now, but just haven't had the time to do the work.
I have been secretly hoping someone would build a good quality, so I wouldn't have to do this work myself. Now I have API Transformer, an API definition translation platform, developed by the APIMATIC team. Using API Transformer you can upload or pull API definitions in the following formats:


API Blueprint
Swagger 1.0 - 1.2
Swagger 2.0 JSON
Swagger 2.0 YAML
WADL - W3C 2009
Google Discovery
RAML 0.8
I/O Docs - Mashery
APIMATIC Format

Then you can output API definitions in the following formats:

API Blueprint
Swagger 1.2
Swagger 2.0 JSON
Swagger 2.0 YAML
WADL - W3C 2009
APIMATIC Format

With API Transformer, they are offering a pretty valuable service, that any API service provider, and API consumer can put to work right away. I quickly generated four API Blueprints, for my API, audio, blog, and building block APIs, which I also indexed as part of each APIs.json file.
As any good API service provider should, The API Transformer has an API. You can build in API transformations between definition into any service or tooling. In my opinion, every API service provider in 2015 should speak as many API definitions as possible, always allowing customers to import, and export in all of the formats offered above.
API Transformer reflects how API service providers should work, it is doing one thing, and doing it well, and it provides a simple web interface, as well as a dead simple API. There is no way I will be building out my own service now that APIMATC has launched API Transformer.

			<p>
I have a research project dedicated to trying to understand al things Swagger. I try to add any new research, or tooling there when I can. The latest thing I added was a page to list out Swagger extensions that I find in the wild.
I knew Apigee has extended Swagger in some interesting ways, but I was coming across other interesting examples, and want to try and aggregate into a single location, so that others can reference and build upon.&nbsp;
There is now an extensions page on my Swagger research. I have added&nbsp;APIMATIC's&nbsp;x-codegen-settings, a couple from&nbsp;Apigee to kick things off. If you know of any interesting examples of Swagger extension, please let me know via the project's Github issues, or feel free to fork the project and add to the extensions page using the _config.yml file for the Github project, they are stored as a YAML collection.
Hopefully we can start centralizing all the innovative extensions of Swagger into a single location, helping us all not re-invent the wheel when it comes to extending the popular API definition format, affectionately known as Swagger.

			<p>I just sat in on an APIWare call with a fast growing startup, developing a better understanding of how we can assist their team. They have a pretty solid development team behind their API, so providing core API development resources is not in the cards.&nbsp; Where&nbsp; this startup is needing the most help, is where the APIWare team shines: API Operations Review - Taking a look at how an API platform works from the inside out, preferably starting with an outside perspective, so we can bring that fresh perspective to the table, and immediately begin adding value to the road-map. Crafting API Strategy - With a better understanding of how an API works, inside and out, we can take a walk through our massive list of best practices, and see what we can apply when it comes to bringing together a strategy. Providing companies with a comprehensive review of their API operations from an outside perspective, but also walking through their architecture, team, and other internal resources, is a valuable process on its own. Having a team of experience API professionals listening, and walking through the current makeup of your API operations helps you better articulate your vision while also helping us define how things work, so a coherent API strategy can be crafted by our team. This is the stage we are in with this particular startup conversation--kicking off a formal review, so we can help them craft a coherent API strategy. Once this is done, we can re-assess how we can help them, and probably begin telling more public stories about the project. This conversation reflects other conversations the APIWare team is having with other startups, SMB and enterprise groups. However one thing that did present itself on this call, is how APIWare is also becoming a burst-able development team that can act as a backup when small startups are faced with potentially large enterprise relationships that come with API success.

			<p><em>21 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>Sometimes I have ideas, that are sticky, meaning they won't leave my brain, but are not always concepts I personally enjoy exploring. This is just a little insight into the madness that is my brain, focus Kin...FOCUS! So, I found myself thinking last week about API monetization, while I was also updating my API design and hypermedia research--then, during this Reese's peanut butter cup moment, I came up with an idea for a suggested or sponsored link relation engine for hypermedia APIs. First, I'd prefer to start with what I'd consider to be a hypermedia suggestion engine, that could provide external suggestions for related links to any structured data that is being returned via an API. It is a suggestion engine that an API provider, who has followed hypermedia principles as part of their API design, could use to augment the resources they are serving up. Such a suggestion engine would have to be pretty smart, and work from an existing index that API providers could train via an external API. One possible example of this from my existing work, is present in a scientific research API, that might be serving up research papers, and with each API call you could potentially get some native related links for annotating, tagging, and other opportunities that are dictated by the API providers. But, what if the institution, where the research occurred could provide related links to other research going on at the institution, or maybe a governing scientific organization could suggest other related research or resources, and it was up to the API provider to whitelist or blacklist link relations that were included. Taking this to the next level, which is inevitable, and I might as well be the asshole who suggest it, but what if API providers could approve a paid index of links to suggest as a link relation, for any product in the catalog. Sure you can add this product to your wishlist, or...[<a href="/2015/09/21/a-suggested-and-sponsored-link-relation-engine-for-hypermedia-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>If you are in an industry being impacted by technology, you have probably become very aware of the term Application Programming Interfaces, more widely known as APIs, and how they are driving web applications, mobile applications, and increasingly everyday objects in our homes, cars, businesses, and across the public landscape. If you are finding yourself part of this growing conversations, you have most likely have also heard talk of a new breed of API definition formats that are becoming ubiquitous like Swagger and API Blueprint. API definitions are a way to describe what an API does, providing a machine readable blueprint of how to put the digital resource to work. API definitions are not new, but this latest round of available formats are taking the API conversation out of just IT and developer groups, and enabling business units, and other key stakeholders to participate throughout the API life-cycle. Much like the latest wave of web APIs has made data, content, and other digital resources like video and images more accessible, API definitions are making APIs more accessible across the rapidly expanding digital business landscape. The first widely available API definition format was the Web Services Description Language (WSDL), which is an XML format established in 2001 that described web services. Much like web services (an API predecessor), WSDL was a very technical vision of APIs, something dictated by IT, and developer groups, with heavy top down governance from business and industry leadership. While web services, and WSDL are still ubiquitous across the enterprise, they are rapidly being replaced with much lighter weight, simpler web APIs that use the Internet as a way of delivering the digital data, content, and resources web, mobile, and devices are demanding in 2015. Along the way, newer, more web friendly API definition formats emerged, such as Web Application Description Language (WADL), but ultimately WADL was something that never took root, suffering from many of the same illness of its predecessor...[<a href="/2015/09/15/api-definitions-broker-critical-conversations-between-business-and-developers-who-are-building-nextgen-web-mobile-and-device-apps/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>When it comes to the API space, it always takes numerous conversations with API providers and practitioners, before something comes into focus for me. I've spent five years having API management conversations, an area that is very much in focus for me when it comes to my own infrastructure, as well as using as a metric for reviewing the other public and private APIs that I review regularly. While I have been paying attention to API monetization for a couple years now (thank you @johnmusser), in 2015 I find myself involved in 20+ conversations, forcing the topic to slowly come into focus for me, whether I like it or not. When talking to companies and organizations about how they can generate revenue from their APIs, I generally find the conversation going in one of two directions: Resource - We will be directly monetizing whatever resource we are making available via the API. Charging for access to the resource, and composing of multiple access tiers depending on volume, and partnerships. Technology - We believe the technology behind the API platform is where the money is, and will be charging for others to use this technology. Resulting in a growing wholesale / private label layer to the API economy.&nbsp; 90% of the conversation I engage in are focused in the first area, and how to make money off API access to a resource. The discussion is almost always about what someone will pay for a resource, something that is more art than science--even in 2015. The answer is, we don't know until there is a precedent, resulting in an imbalance where developers expect things for free, and providers freak the fuck out--then call me. ;-) As more of my thoughts around API monetization solidfy, a third dimension is slowly coming into focus, one that won't exist for all API providers (especially those without consumers), but is something I think should be considered as part of a long...[<a href="/2015/09/15/adding-a-3rd-dimension-to-my-api-monetization-thinking/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>API design and definitions are the number one area when it comes to talks submitted for APIStrat 2015 in Austin, and when it comes to traffic across the API Evangelist network in 2015. After diving into the Amazon API Gateway a little more over the weekend, I was reminded of the opportunity out there when it comes to API design tooling. Amazon did a good job, providing a GUI interface for crafting the methods, resources, and underlying data models for APIs you are deploying using the gateway. However when you compare to some of the GUI API design editors I mentioned in my last post on this subject, from Restlet, APIMATIC, and Gelato, the Amazon interface clearly needs evolve a little more. AWS is just getting started with their solution, so I'm not knocking what they have done. I just wanted to keep comparing of all of the solutions as they emerge, and highlight the opportunity for some standardization in this layer of API tooling. I see a pretty big opportunity for some player to step up and provide an open source API design editor that provides a seamless experience across API service providers.&nbsp; This post is nothing new. I am just trumpeting the call for open API design tooling each time I see another new interface introduced for crafting APIs, their paths, resources, parameters, headers, authentication, and underlying data models. At some point, a new player will emerge with the open source API design editor I am looking for, or one of the existing players open sources their current offering, and evolve it in context of the wider API design space, providing an abstracted layer that supports all API definition formats. With the growth in the number of service providers I see stepping up to server the API space, the need for common, open tooling when it comes to API design is only going to grow. It took almost four years of waiting for...[<a href="/2015/09/14/there-is-a-big-opportunity-right-now-when-it-comes-to-api-design-tooling/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>One of my readers recently reached out to me, in response to some of my recent stories of monetization opportunities around government and scientific open data and APIs. I'm not going to publish his full email, but he brought&nbsp;up a couple of key, and very important realities of open data and APIs that I don't think get discussed enough, so I wanted to craft a story around them, to bring front and center in my work. Most open data published from government is crap, and requires extra work before you can do anything with it There currently are very few healthy models for developers to follow when it comes to building a business around open data Business people and developers have zero imagination when it comes to monetization -- aka ads, ads, ads, and more ads. My reader sums it all up well with: I don't dispute that with some pieces of government data, they can be integrated into existing businesses, like real estate, allowing a company to value add. But the startup space levering RAW open, or paid government data is a lot harder. Part of my business does use paid government data, accessible via an API, but these opportunities the world over are few and far between in my mind. I think his statement reflects the often unrealized challenges around working with open data, but in my opinion it also the opportunity when it comes to the API journey, when applied to this world of open data. APIs do not equal good, and if you build a simple API on top of open government data, it does not equal instant monetization opportunity as an API provider. It will take domain experts (or aspiring ones) to really get to know the data, make it accessible via simple web APIs, and begin iterating on new approaches to using the open data to enrich web and mobile applications in ways that someone is willing to pay...[<a href="/2015/09/14/are-there-really-any-monetization-opportunities-around-open-data-and-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>
The Element Loader from API service provider Cloud Elements came across my monitoring this week, providing a configurable JavaScript application that help simplify data migration, allowing you to move content and data between cloud platforms, by putting their APIs to work.
The Element Loader is interesting to me as an evolution to the concept of what I&rsquo;ve long called API reciprocity, where companies like Zapier allows you to migrate your bits and bytes between the platforms we are all increasingly finding ourselves dependent on.
I think Cloud Elements is moving the needle forward just a bit, by formalizing a tool that is dedicated to real-time sync, between the platforms you depend on. You can accomplish similar things with Zapier, but I think looking at it purely about sync of specific life bits (objects) can be a very valuable exercise.&nbsp;
I have been calling this reclaim your domain for a couple years now, where I think the process of identifying the services we depend on is extremely valuable, and one where establishing a plan for how your bits and bytes work in concert, really pushes things into the realm of actually healthy IT operations--for both individuals and businesses.

I do not have my world synced. My contacts on Google, LinkedIn, and other platforms are totally out of sync, and my documents are spread between Google, Amazon, and Dropbox, without any coherency at all. Don&rsquo;t get me started on my images. This is a real problem, that is only growing, and a segment where I'd like to see more solutions like Element Loader emerge.
I&rsquo;ll start tracking on reciprocity providers like Cloud Elements who are doing specific things like sync, which will become one of the common building blocks I&rsquo;ll add to my research when I get the time to update. Hopefully I will find some more time soon to take a deeper look at my my API automation and interoperability research--it has been a while.

			<p>I preparing a talk this week in Portland, OR, at the IDX Developer Summit. IDX serves the real estate industry, providing real estate professionals access to hundreds of multiple listing services (MLS) groups, from around the United States. If you are a real estate broker or agent, and you need real estate listings on your site, IDX is how you do this--they are leading player in the space. If you aren't familiar with the world of real estate data, it has been long controlled by a network of MLS groups, totaling almost 2000 (I think), spread around the nation. These MLS organizations tightly control their data, deciding exactly who has access to it, and exactly how it can be used, and how it MUST be displayed in print and across the web. This is a process that has long existed, prior to the existence of the web, but since 1995, it is mechanism that has gotten even more strict, and litigious, seeking to maintain their control over a very valuable, and increasingly digital layer of our physical worlds.&nbsp; When it comes to APIs, the real estate industry is the OG API provider, making data available via FTP locations as soon as the web was a thing. However, when it comes to the core principles of what makes APIs work, the real estate industry is the anti-API. MLS hoard facts, something that cannot have copyright applied, but if you are litigious enough, it is something you can defend. The address, and details of residential and commercial property is data that should be accessible to everyone, but MLS groups, and National Association of Realtor (NAR) have created a cartel, that prevents this from ever being a reality. Think what the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and record labels have done to music--the MLS and NAR do this to real estate.

			<p>I sat down for a second, more in-depth look at the Amazon API Gateway. When it first released I took a stroll through the interface, and documentation, but this time, I got my hands dirty playing with the moving parts, and considering how the solution fits into the overall API deployment picture. API Design ToolsAs soon as you land on the Amazon API Gateway dashboard page, you can get to work adding APIs by defining endpoints, crafting specific methods (paths), the crafting the details of your HTTP resources (verbs), and round off your resources with parameters, headers, and underlying data models. You can even map the custom sub-domain of your choosing to your Amazon API Gateway generated API, giving it exactly the base URL you need. API Mapping TemplatesOne feature provided by the&nbsp;Amazon API Gateway that I find intriguing is the mapping templates. Using the data&nbsp;models and the mapping template tool, you can transform data from one schema to another. This is very interested when you are thinking about evolving your own legacy APIs, but I'm also thinking it could come in real handy for mapping to public APIs, and demonstrating to clients what is possible with a next version--designed from the outside-in-mapping is something I've wanted to see for some time now. API Integration TypesUp until now, in this review, we are just talking about designing APIs, and possibly mapping our data models together. There are many other ways you can gateway existing systems, databases, and other resources using Amazon API Gateway, but the one that seems to be getting the lions share of the discussion, is deploying APIs with Lambda functions as the back-end. API Integration Using Lambda FunctionsLambda functions give you the ability to create, store, and manage Node.js and Java code snippets, and wire up these resources using the Amazon API Gateway. When you create your first Lambda function, you are given a small selection of blueprints, like a microservice, or...[<a href="/2015/09/11/some-potentially-very-powerful-api-orchestration-with-the-amazon-api-gateway/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
There is a little more than 24 hours left for you to submit your talk for APIStrat in Austin, TX, this November 18th, 19th, and 20th. With this sixth edition of APIStrat, we are taking things back to our roots, and not choosing a theme, but making it a conversation about the most important topics in the space facing API providers and consumers in 2015.&nbsp;
From looking at the talks that have been submitted so far, API definitions, design, and Internet of Things seems to be leading the pack. We've also seen a couple session talk submissions that we think are probably more worthy of being keynotes, because they are just that good.
The APIStrat team feels like 400 people is the sweet spot when it comes to having a productive API discussion, so we chose a venue that fits this vision, which will most definitely sell out. Check out the sponsors who have already lined up, and we have only announced two keynotes (more coming this next week).
Make sure and submit your talk before tomorrow night, so that you are part of the conversation. Also, make sure you jump in and &nbsp;sponsor the event, as we are already looking at closing off one tier of sponsorship--contact us today if you want to get in on the action.
We'll see you in Austin!&nbsp;

My last rant of the evening, I promise. Then I will shut up and move back to actual work instead of telling stories. I'm working on my Adopta.Agency project, processing&nbsp;a pretty robust spreadsheet of Department of Veterans Affairs expenditures by state. As I'm working to convert yet another spreadsheet to CSV, and then to JSON, and publish to Github, I can't help but think, "where is the save as JSON" in Microsoft or Google Spreadsheets?
I can easily write scripts to help me do this, but I'm trying to keep the process as close to what the average person, who will be adopting a government agency data set, will experience. I could build a tool that they could also use, but I really want to keep the tools required for the work as minimal as possible.&nbsp;
It would just be easier if Microsoft and Google would get with the program, and give us a built in feature for saving our spreadsheets as JSON.

			<p>I had a reinder on my task list to check-in on where some of the common database platforms were when it came to APIs. I think it was a Postgres announcement from a while back that put the thought in my notebook, but as an old database guys I tend to check-in regularly on the platforms I have worked most with. The point of this check-in, is to see how far along each of the database platforms are when it comes to easy API deployment, directly from tables. The three relational database platforms I'm most familiar with are: SQL Server - The platform has APIs to manage, and you deploy an OData service, as well as put .NET to work, but nothing really straightward, that would allow any developer to quickly expose simple RESTful API. PostgreSQL - I'd say PostgreSQL is furthest along with thier "early draft proposal of an extension to PostgreSQL allowing clients to access the database using HTTP", as they have the most complete information about how to deploy an API. MySQL - There was a writeup in InfoQ about&nbsp;MySQL offering a REST API, but from what I can tell it is still in MySQL Labs, without much movement or other stories I could find to show any next steps. The database that drives my API platform is MySQL running via Amazon RDS. I haven't worked on Postgres for years, and jumped ship on SQL Server a while back (my therapist says I cannot talk about it). I automate the generation of my APIs using Swagger and the Slim framework, then do the finish work like polishing the endpoints to look less like their underlying database, and more like how they will actually be used.&nbsp; Maybe database platforms shouldn't get into the API game? Leaving API deployment to the API gateway providers like SlashDB and DreamFactory.

			<p>There was a pretty interesting conversation around API design going on in one of my API slack channels over the last couple days, about what is API design, and what is needed to get developers, and even non-developers more aware of the best practices that exist. It is a private group, so I won't broadcast it as part of this post, but I did want to extract a narrative from it, and help me set a bar for other API design discussions I am having.&nbsp; The Restafarian, hypermedia, and linked data folk have long been frustrated by the adoption of sensible API design practices across the sector, and the lack of basic HTTP literacy among developers, and non-developers is at dangerously high levels. The good news, is some of this is beginning to change, but we still have so much work to do, something that won't be easy, and unfortunately it won't always have the clean outcomes leaders in the space are looking for. APIs returning JSON is just the next step in the evolution of the web, and when you consider how much work it took to get everyone on-board with HTML, and building web pages, then web apps, and recently mobile apps, you can begin to understand the work that still lies ahead. We have to help the next generation of developers be more HTTP literate (something the previous generations of developers aren't), and possess a baseline knowledge of common API design best practices. This needs to be done in a world where many of these developers really aren't going to care about the specifics of good API design, like us API architects and early pioneers have. The average API designer in the future will not always be willing to argue about the nuance of how to craft URLs, whether to use a header or parameter, caching, and how to version.

			<p>I have two more conversations kicking off on the topic of API monetization, so I just needed to take a moment to gather up the last wave of posts on the subject, catch my breath, and refresh my overall thoughts in the area. What I really like about this latest wave, is that they are about providing much needed funding for some potentially very important API driven resources. Another thing is that they are pretty complicated, unproven approaches to monetizing APIs--breaking ground!! Over the last couple weeks, I have be engaged in four specific conversations that have shifted my gaze to the area of API monetization: Audiosear.ch&nbsp;- Talking with the PopupArchive team about making money around podcast search APIs. Department of Interior&nbsp;- Providing feedback on the Recreation Information Database (RIDB) API initiative. Caltech Wormbase&nbsp;- Helping organize a grant effort to fund the next generation of research, from Wormbase, and other scientific database. HDScores&nbsp;- Mapping out how HDScores is funding the efforts around aggregating restaurant inspection data into a single, clean API. &nbsp;As I think through the approaches above, I'm pushed to exercise what I can from these discussions, on my own infrastructure: My API Monetization&nbsp;- As I look to add more APIs to my stack, I'm being forced to clearly define all the moving parts of my API monetization strategy. Blockchain Delusions&nbsp;- While thinking again about my API pricing and credit layer, I'm left thinking about how the blockchain can be applied to API monetization. The API Evangelist network is my research notebook. I search, re-read, and refine all the thoughts curated, and published here. It helps me to aggregate areas of my research, especially in the fast moving areas, where I am receiving the most requests for assistance.

			<p>I believe in the ability of APIs to pull back the curtain of the great OZ, that we call IT. The average business and individual technology consumer has long been asked to just believe in the magic behind the tech we use, putting the control into the hands of those who are in the know. This is something that has begun to thaw, with the introduction of the Internet, and the usage of web APIs to drive applications of all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; It isn't just that we are poking little holes into the corporate and government firewall, to drive the next generation of applications, it is also that a handful of API pioneers like Amazon, Flickr, Twitter, Twilio, and others saw the potential of making these exposed resources available to any developers. The pulling back of the curtain was done via these two acts, exposing resources using the Internet, but also inviting in 3rd parties to learn about, and tap into these resources. Something that is present in this evolution of software development, is trust. API providers have to have a certain amount of trust that developers will respect their terms of service, and API consumers have to have a certain amount of trust that they can depend on API providers. To achieve this, there needs to be a healthy dose of transparency present, so API providers can see into what consumers are doing with their resources, and API consumers have to be able to see into the operations, and roadmap for the platform. When transparency and trust does not exist, this is when the impact of APIs begin to break down and they become simply another tech tool. If a platform is up to no good, has ill intentions, selling vapor ware, or there is corruption behind the scenes, the API concept is just going to create problems, for both provider and consumer.

			<p>This is a full walk-through of me trying to distill down my approach to API monetization, in a way that can be applied across not just 30 APIs, but potentially 300, or 3000. There are several things converging for me right now, which includes the maturing of my own infrastructure, as well as conversations I'm having with startups, enterprise groups, federal government agencies, and my own partner(s). I need to keep hammering on this to help me operate my own infrastructure, but I am also partnering with APIWare to help me deliver on much of the API design, deployment, and management, so I need to have a good handle on my costs. As with all of my areas of research, within the area of API monetization I am just trying to get a handle on the common building blocks, and provide a checklist of considerations to be employed when I'm planning and operating my API infrastructure. To help me build a base, let's walk through some of the building blocks of my own API monetization strategy. AcquisitionWhat do I have invested into any single API. Even if I am building something from scratch, what went into it? Every API I possess has some sort of acquisition cost, even if it is just $14.00 for the two pints of beer I bought while I was brainstorming the idea. Discover -&nbsp;What did I spent to find this. I may have had to buy someone dinner or beer to find, as well as time on the Internet searching, and connecting the dots. Negotiate&nbsp;- What time to I have in actually getting access to something. Most of the time its on the Internet, and other times it requires travel, and meeting with folks.

I'm rolling out a standardized credit system as part of my API operations, and using my API service composition layer to apply credit usage as part of each API call.&nbsp; My objective is to make it easy as possible to buy and even sell credits via my platform, and easily apply those credits across any API I publish, in a variety of access tiers. As I think through this, I can't help but start thinking about how this can play out on a larger scale. Meaning, how do we get API providers to adopt a universal API credit system, so you could buy and sell credits anywhere, use them on any API platform, and transfer them between platforms. Every time I think about this topic, I end up at the&nbsp;blockchain. It just makes sense that we would use blockchain technology establish a currency that could be used as fuel for the API economy. The blockchain ledger could be used to manage API credit exchanges, but also could be used to store other relevant details that could impact API driven transactions in real-time. With the most important piece being about interoperability, and the fact that you can use in any API ecosystem. An API world, where you could generate credits on one platform, and transfer them for buying of API calls on another platform, opens up some pretty interesting API driven scenarios for me. Not many platforms pay developers to use APIs, most are just free, or charging per API call. There isn't much incentive for API providers to shell out cash, to incentivize API consumers, but when you could pay in credits, that were transferable, it might change the...[<a href="/2015/09/05/a-blockchain-to-act-as-a-universal-api-credit-layer-that-can-be-used-by-both-api-provider-and-consumer/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>It has been almost 10 years since Google launched the Maps API. With as many APIs as Google have, you'd think they'd have a better handle on a standard approach to pricing across all of them. As we've seen with Google Translate, they have struggled with the right way of pricing APIs, as well as communicating this to their developer ecosystem. This week Google took further steps on the road to standardizing how you pay for Google Maps API, opening up pay as you go purchasing via the Google Developer Console. Here is how they put it: In this new purchasing structure, the Google Maps Geocoding, Directions, Distance Matrix, Roads, Geolocation, Elevation, and Time Zone APIs remain free of charge for the first 2,500 requests per day, and developers may now simply pay $0.50 USD per 1,000 additional requests up to 100,000 requests per API per day. Developers requiring over 100,000 requests per day should&nbsp;contact us&nbsp;to purchase a premium licence. It is good to see Google run with some pretty standard pricing, and running with something in line with what other API providers are putting to work. Just like Google worked to standardize OAuth 2.0 across the APIs, and get their approach to API management organized via the developer console, it looks like they are now working hard to get their API pricing in order. I still see many API providers struggle with API pricing, both large and small. Many of the larger API providers do what Google did, and offer a free access level, and then once they need to generate revenue they shut things down, or tighten things up, rather than just offering a clear path to paying for resources. This approach has fueled the debate around whether you can depend on APIs, and also whether or not a freemium approach to APIs will work at all. Another common stumbling block I see API providers trip over when it comes to pricing, is...[<a href="/2015/09/03/learn-from-google-maps-api-and-just-have-standard-approach-to-free-and-paid-tiers-for-your-api-from-the-beginning/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>If you have heard any of my talks at API Days Sydney, in Barcelona, or at Gluecon in Colorado this year, you've heard me talk about wholesale APIs, and how I am using Docker to help make some of my APIs available for use as private or white label APIs. The concept of a white label, private label, or wholesale API is something I've been talking about for a while, and is something I am starting to see more of in the wild. The most recent sighting is from payment API provider Dwolla, with four new API endpoints that deliver a white label&nbsp;ACH payout API solution. According to the announcement from Dwolla, the white label API solution will: "..leverage Dwolla&rsquo;s existing infrastructure&mdash;our fraud analysis, bank partnerships, real-time fraud analysis, communication protocols and more&mdash;while maintaining your brand&rsquo;s look, feel, and name on end-user interactions. This functionality will provide platforms a powerful, flexible, and custom ACH infrastructure at a fraction of the cost and time." When you use the Dwolla white label ACH payout API, "there are no individual transaction fees or percentages&mdash;regardless of how many times you, your business, or your application transfers money". Providing a pretty interesting alternative to the common, pay for what you use business model used by man API providers today. I predict this approach to API deployment will become more common place in coming years. Many developers, and API consumers will be quite content just calling your regular retail API, but more specialty, and larger partners are going to want the functionality you offer, but are not going to want to be metered for each API transaction. When I deploy wholesale, or white label versions of my APIs I will not be charging for each API call, however I will still be managing API access, and usage with my 3Scale API infrastructure, because I still want to be able to get analytics, and other awareness generated via my API management layer....[<a href="/2015/09/03/dwolla-just-released-a-white-label-version-of-their-api-are-you-ready-for-the-wholesale-api-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm always on the hunt for API driven solutions that will help the average business user be more exposed to the power of APIs. It is common for us technologists to kick up dust, and get all excited about what we build, when in reality, it doesn't mean anything to the average person in the real world--after 25 years in business, I still do this regularly.&nbsp; This is why, having a constant reminder to look for solutions that bridge the technical world of APIs, to the average business users world, helps me break free from my own biased approach. When I lean back in my chair, and think about what solutions are currently available in the space, that have this potential, these are the two companies. BlockspringAccess web services from spreadsheets. Blockspring is the world's library of functions, accessible from everywhere you do work. Your tables automatically stay up-to-date. Save hours of manual, error-prone exports and copy/paste. Get fresh data from any source whenever your spreadsheet recalculates. Build and share powerful spreadsheet tools. Form.ioForm.io is a platform that enables developers to rapidly build modern web and mobile applications. Our intuitive drag &amp; drop interface allows you to create both the forms and the RESTful API's all in one easy step! Both of these platform speak API, but more importantly they speak spreadsheet and forms, two of the most common dialects spoken by the average business user today. I'm closely working with both groups to better understand how they can communicate what they do to the business world, and repeatedly the examples in play are not focused on API, they are focused on solutions that make sense to the end user, but just happen to be API driven. While much of the API design, deployment, management, and integration services and tooling that has evolved over the last five years will play a significant role in providing the API base we will need for the API economy,...[<a href="/2015/09/02/the-two-platforms-that-will-bring-apis-to-the-masses/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>One of the reasons I setup individual research projects, is to provide me with a structure for better defining each aspect of the API world, something I am working hard to jump-start within my API security research. You will notice the project does not have any building blocks defined, which when you compare with one of my oldest research areas, you start to see what I mean. The blog posts, and other links I curate as part of my API security will help me find companies and tools that are providing value to the space. As I break down each company, and what they offer, I often have to read between the lines, in trying to understand how an API, service, or tool can be used by API providers, as well as potentially API consumers. I am looking for APIs that offer security, but also APIs that offer security to APIs--make sense? As part of this research, I am playing with Metacert, which bills itself as &nbsp;a security API for mobile application developers, helping them block malicious ads, phishing links &amp; unwanted pornography inside apps, but I think it is so much more. I could see Metacert being pretty valuable to API providers, as well as API consumers building web and mobile apps. Security isn't always about brute force attacks, and could easily just be in a simple link, added with some content, via your API. I am adding Metacert to my API security research, with a focus on its potential to API providers. I could see API providers seamlessly integrating the Metacert API into their own stack, processing all links that are submitted through regular operations. I will also be adding link screening like this as a building block to my API security research. If you are looking for a wise investment in the API security space, you should be talking with Metacert. APIs like Metacert provide us with a model for thinking about...[<a href="/2015/09/01/breaking-down-the-layers-of-api-security-and-considering-link-integrity/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Sep 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As I make my way across my research projects, I'm learning more about how companies like Metacert can deliver valuable security services to API providers. I'm also getting a better idea of the nuance that goes into monitoring APIs, from API Fortress.&nbsp;
API Fortress has very interesting API monitoring story, derived from the Etsy API. This isn't the API monitoring story you'd think, it isn't about the overall stability of the Etsy API, and whether its up or down, it is about the details of API payloads, and inconsistencies they found scanning the API.
Through a payload toast of the Etsy API, the API Fortress team found an occurrence of NULL values in 3,600 out of 50,100 items scanned--which negatively affected what results that were actually accessible via the API vs the Etsy interface. Something that can result in loss of exposure for products, translating into reduced sales.&nbsp;
While full API outages are definitely front and center when you think about monitoring, things like this could potentially drain revenue over a long period of time, in a way that makes it very difficult to discover. I can only imagine, when you are doing things at the scale Etsy is, this kind of monitoring could plug some pretty big holes in your sales bucket.
API Fortress is already part of my API monitoring research, but just like with API security, I am going to add content analysis, and pattern matching like this as building blocks for API monitoring. After I make my way through all of the current companies I have listed in my API monitoring, I will publish the master list of common building blocks I've collected.

			<p><em>31 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am always pleased to see API providers publishing Swagger definitions, and using them to drive their interactive documentation. Projects like the&nbsp;Global Change Information System API, are getting on the API definition bandwagon, and this is a good thing. I have been pushing API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint since 2012, but in 2015, while I want to keep on-boarding folks to the concept of using API definitions for interactive documentation, but I also want them to also understand that their APIs definition will be used in other areas of API operations as well. Most people think Swagger is the documentation, and have not been able able to separate the specification from the interactive documentation. I think Apiary has done a better job of this separation with the separation of API Blueprint from Apiary. As an API provider, you may not have evolved to a full API-first level of operation, which is ok, but I encourage you to make your Swagger or API Blueprint definition as accessible as possible, so your API consumers can put to use in other ways--even if you don't have the time. As soon as I saw that the&nbsp;Global Change Information System API&nbsp;employed Swagger for their documentation, the next thing I wanted to do was also use in my Postman client. While the Swagger UI provides me with a hands-on way of getting to know the GCIS API, I have to come back to the site to play with more, and it doesn't give me as much detail about how the API works, as my Postman client does. All GCIS API team has to do, is publish a text or image link to their Swagger definition in a prominent location, so it is obvious to us consumers. I get easily reverse engineer the Swagger UI, using my Google Developer tools, but it is a couple of extra steps for me, that stands in between me, and making calls to...[<a href="/2015/08/31/please-do-not-hide-your-api-definitions-from-consumers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>When it comes to API security, there are a number of things to consider, something I will be be working to define, and share as part of my ongoing research. However there are three building blocks that are front and center in most security conversations--SSL, API keys, and OAuth. SSL is a must-have, and OAuth is fast becoming a must-have when there is personal data involved, but I still encounter numerous misconceptions around the role API keys actually play in security. API key, and its accompanying secret are a common way to secure API access. You require developers to register for an account, create a new application, and they are then given an application key, plus a secret that is passed along with each API call. You cannot call the API, without passing in your API key and secret. This act alone, is what people view as the security role API keys are playing, and I get a number of questions if this is truly secure.&nbsp; No it is not. Looking for two values being passed with each API call, really doesn't do that much. The actual security of your platform requires a much higher level, IT view of security (which I won't go into here), with API keys being just one tool in your security toolbox. Where keys do play a huge role, is around the awarness that is introduced, of who is accessing what, and managing how much they can access (aka mitigating how much damage is done, when there is a breach). This short sighted views of API keys is why many companies feel they can just roll their own API management solution, and why many API developers and architects think the keys themselves possess some magical security pixie dust. The actual power comes from your awarness of the resources you are exposing via APIs, organizing into coherent service tiers, applying meaningful rate limits on these resources, and evolving your detailed awareness...[<a href="/2015/08/31/are-api-keys-and-secrets-actually-very-secure/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>
While there are numerous examples of APIs that successfully offer more than one option when it comes to the content types their API returns, the concept is missing from the large portion of the APIs I review. When I see good examples of this in the wild, I try to make time to showcase, and share, to help with the HTTP literacy of my readership.
One API which is rocking several fronts when it comes to API design for me, is the&nbsp;Global Change Information System, which interestingly is an alliance between government agencies, not something born out of Silicon Valley. When requesting resources from the GCIS API, the following HTTP accept headers are honored:

application/json
application/x-turtle
text/turtle
application/n-triples
text/n3
text/rdf-n3
application/ld-json
application/rdf+xml
application/rdf+json

When integrating with the GCIS API, it all begins with some&nbsp;basic JSON, but then look at all the other linked data goodness in there! JSON-LD, RDF, Turtle!! Discovering APIs that support robust content type negotiation like this can be hard to find, most APIs don't talk about it, so even if they do, there is no way to know about it. Thankfully the&nbsp;GCIS API shares it via email, as well as describes in the GCIS Swagger definition, which is how I learned about it.&nbsp;
Content-Type negotiation is one of those HTTP literacy areas that need a lot of discussion, helping on-board API newbies to the power and possibilities that are present here, and that you can go beyond just plain ol JSON, and receive much richer API responses.

			<p>I'm immersing myself in the&nbsp;Data Sharing and Open Data for Banks, published by&nbsp;the HM Treasury and Cabinet Office&nbsp;in the United Kingdom,&nbsp;"to explore how competition and consumer outcomes in UK banking could be affected by banks, giving customers the ability to share their transaction data with third parties using external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)." While I do not think an open API standard will ride into town like a white knight, saving England from all its banking problems, I do think there is a lot of good that will come from this effort. The banks have a lot of technical debt, corruption, and many other issues to deal with before APIs will even work, but I think there is enough pressure on them right now from consumers, and startups, that they will have to change at some point--or die. As I look for evidence of movement around an open API standard online, I came across the response to the government proposal back in March. I thought there was a lot to learn from in these responses, not just for banks, but for any company that is struggling with a coherent API strategy. You can read the document yourself--here are the specific responses. Benefits and risks of an open API standard&nbsp; 2.1 The first set of questions in the call for evidence invited views on the benefits and risks of an&nbsp;open API standard.&nbsp; 2.2 The vast majority of the respondents supported the development of an open API standard,&nbsp;and respondents agreed that there are many potential benefits of an open API standard in UK&nbsp;banking. The most commonly cited benefits were increased competition and innovation in&nbsp;banking, a greater degree of consumer choice in financial services, and the development of new&nbsp;and better services tailored to customers that can enhance the overall efficiency of banking.

Very similar to the Obama open data mandate in May of 2012, &nbsp;I saw a lot of discussion shortly after the release of the document from the HM Treasury, but not many details on how things are going so far. There was a response to the document published back in March, which holds some interesting perspective, but not much else from the government, or banks, that I can find. It is only August, I'm sure we'll see more activity this fall and into 2016, when it comes to standardizing banking APIs in the UK. I've tracked on efforts like the Open Banking Project for a while now, but I think what is potentially happening in the UK is worth me taking things up a notch or two. To help me, I will setup a banking research project, which will push up banking and related APIs in my daily and weekly monitoring, something I can review regularly, and maybe push back on some key players to get more information on where things are. Establishing an official research project really helps me find the key players, both individual and companies, which in turns increases the amount of information I gather as part of my research. If you work for a bank that does business in the UK, or possibly for the government, I'd love to hear your thoughts, even if it is off the record. I'm hopeful for what can occur in the UK, but I'm also eyeballing the effort as a potential blueprint that the rest of the world could follow.

I enjoy what I do, but when I embarked on my API Evangelist journey in 2010, I set myself on a mission to educate people about the business of APIs, and highlight that it isn't just the technology that makes APIs a thing. I have worked hard to distill down what it takes to execute an effective API management strategy into usable advice that anyone can run with when crafting an API strategy.
As I conduct my monitoring of the API space, It makes me feel accomplished, when I find my work cited, influencing important API related projects. This just occurred to me as I was taking a fresh look at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Data	Sharing	and	Open	Data	for	Banks, published by&nbsp;the HM	Treasury	and	Cabinet	Office&nbsp;in the United Kingdom. As I was reviewing the document I happened to search for apievangelist (I know, I'm vain)--I was pleased to find a single citation to my work.
Reference 152 -&nbsp;Thirdly, making the most	out	of	external	APIs	involves	providing	on-going	support	to	the	developers	and	third	party	organisations	that	make	use	of	them.	Good	API management	can	involve	providing	samples	of	code,	a	curated	support	forum,	a	sandpit	with	dummy	data,	an	up	to	date	blog,	FAQs	and	more.
It isn't much, but it is a nod to my work, that helps validate what I've been studying for the last five years--the business of APIs. For me, this isn't about recognition, its about knowing I'm making an impact, and I'm influencing policy, and helping companies, institutions, and government agencies understand API best practices. Little mission accomplished, I'm contributing a small piece to potentially improving the UK banking system, which is something that will undoubtedly spread beyond just England.
Ok, celebration is over. Nice job Kin. Back to work. There is too much to be done.

			<p><em>29 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm almost to the point with my API stack, where I can start plugging in new APIs I have planned. Up until now, the APIs i have deployed, are of little use to a wider commercial audience. However some of the APIs I have planned for the next year, I'm looking to monetize their usage, and operate as part of a larger commercially viable API stack. (practice what I preach baby!) To run this stack, I need a plug and play way to define what an API is costing me, and potentially how much revenue I am generating from each API. With this in mind, here is my draft look at an API monetization framework, that I am employing across my API Stack.&nbsp; Acquisition (One Time or Recurring) Discover - What did I spent to find this. I may have had to buy someone dinner or beer to find, as well as time on the Internet searching. Negotiate - What time to I have in actually getting access to something. Sometimes its time, and sometimes it costs me.&nbsp; Licensing - There is a chance I would license a database from a company or institution, so I want to have this option in there. Even if this is open source, I want the license referenced. Purchase - Also the chance I may buy a database from someone outright, or pay them to put the database together, resulting in one-time fee.&nbsp; &nbsp;Development (One Time or Recurring)&nbsp; Normalization - What does it take me to cleanup, and normalize a dataset, or across content. This is usually he busy janitorial work necessary. Design - What does it take me to generate a Swagger and API Blueprint, something that isn't just auto-generated, but also has a hand polish to it. Database - How much work am I putting into setting up the database. A lot of this I can automate, but there is always a setup cost. Server - Defining...[<a href="/2015/08/29/an-api-monetization-framework-to-help-me-standardize-pricing-for-the-apis-i-bring-online/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>I walked around San Francisco with Jakub Nesetril (@jakubnesetril), the CEO of Apiary, Wednesday evening, talking about the API space. Eventually we sat down in Union Square, continuing our conversation, which is something I wanted to further process, and blend with some existing thoughts I'm working through. Much of our conversation centered around the need for an open abstraction layer for API design, which would reduce the focus on Swagger vs. API Blueprint vs. WADL vs. RAML vs. any other API definition, and make it just about defining and designing our APIs. Jakub is right, I'm sure he'd love everyone to use API Blueprint (which thousands are), but it is more important to him that people just use API definitions, and commit to a healthy API design strategy. This line of thinking is in alignment with other thoughts I'm having around there being a&nbsp;common open source API design editor,&nbsp;which I'd like to use as vehicle to get us closer to&nbsp;my vision of a perfect API design editor. I see an abstraction layer consisting of the following elements: Import&nbsp;- We need to be able to import ANY API definition format we desire. Export&nbsp;- We need to be able to export ANY API definition format we desire. Viewer&nbsp;-&nbsp;We a code view for ANY API definition format we want to look at while working. Editor&nbsp;-&nbsp;We a visual, GUI editor that is all about visual API design, WYSIWG editor for APIs The import, export, and viewer should work as an API, and the API editor should be a simple, well design JavaScript tool that can be embedded anywhere. The back-end API stack should be available in PHP,Python,Ruby, Node.js, Go, C#, and Java flavors, with a docker image anyone can deploy within their own infrastructure. This should be all about abstracting away the complexities of each individual format, and focus on delivering a simple, yet robust API design editing experience. API definition format owners should be able to maintain importing,...[<a href="/2015/08/28/we-need-an-open-abstraction-layer-to-help-us-better-define-and-design-our-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was given an introduction to the Microsoft Graph&nbsp;A concept being applied to Office 365 APIs, other Microsoft APIs, and potentially beyond, to map out segments of users and every day objects. As I learn more about this unifying, graph API effort, I will write more, but this particular story is about how we communicate around the first steps taken by developers when integrating with any API. As an API provider, how you talk about integration, and craft your on-boarding resources, can significantly impact how developers view your resources, something that I think still will always need some work across the space. After being introduced to the Microsoft Graph APIs, we were given a list of code resources, that we could use to hack against the API. The API integration overview had all the modern elements of API integration, with C#, Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, and other "coming soon" libraries. The resource toolkit, even had a sandbox account we could use, helping us on-board with less friction. While this approach is very progressive for the Microsoft world I've known, evolving us beyond the endless sea of C# focused WSDLs we all have seen historically, I would like to point what I think should be the next step in our evolution. It makes me happy that we now speak in multiple programming languages, and provide sandbox or simulation environments. +1 What I'd like to see next, is that we also speak more HTTP, than just language specific clients. I'd like to see these types of API on-boarding toolkits start providing a Postman Collection for the API, or even better, a Swagger or API Blueprint definition that can allow me to not just on-board using the HTTP client of my choice, like Postman, PAW, or Insomnia REST. I agree that we should be speaking the native language of the developers we are courting, but I like to nudge things forward, and encourage speaking a more generic language...[<a href="/2015/08/28/thinking-beyond-just-language-specific-clients-and-also-speaking-the-formats-popular-http-clients-are-using/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I'm processing all of my thoughts from some travel to the big city of San Francisco. I was providing feedback on Microsoft's API design guide, as part of the&nbsp;OneAPI Technical Advisory Group. As I was thinking about the journey Microsoft is on, the role of the API design guide, and how many other companies like Paypal, and Cisco, are on the same journey.&nbsp; In parallel to this, I am on my own journey with my own API stack, I've been looking at everything from a slightly different perspective than many other analysts and providers in the space. When I started in 2010, it was all about API management, then after folks kept asking me about options for deploying APIs I expanded my monitoring to API deployment. Then Jakub the CEO of Apiary, moved the dial back ruth on the life-cycle, and got me paying attention to the concept of API design. Fast-forward to 2015, I am paying attention to almost 20 separate areas, as part of my core API research. I tune into a number of other areas, but these research projects make up the heart of my API storytelling. On the trip back from San Francisco today I had a few thoughts, and needed to organize them in context of my core research.&nbsp; Define (A) A1 - Tech Do you use Swagger to define APIs? Do you use API Blueprint&nbsp;to define APIs? Are there other API definition formats you use? Do you employ NO API definitions? A2 - Business Do you support multiple API definition formats?

			<p><em>28 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>I spent all day Wednesday, at Microsoft offices in San Francisco, providing feedback on the Microsoft API design guide, as part of the&nbsp;OneAPI Technical Advisory Group. The OneAPI team had already done most of the hard work in hammering out the API design guide, by working with the API leadership from groups across Microsoft--we were just brought in to provide outside perspectives. A group of about 20 of us, spent the entire day walk through the high levels of the Microsoft API Design philosophy. The Microsoft OneAPI design guide is a draft, so they aren't ready for us to share it publicly, something we'll see in the near future. However, document being ready or not, the process showed me that Microsoft is really working hard to get their API design strategy house in order. They had worked hard to iterate through all the common areas of API design, with their various teams--even some of the more controversial areas like versioning. I did not feel like I had a lot to contribute to the process. They have some really good API designers, and there was plenty of high quality API design talent in the room, to provide the feedback they wanted. When Microsoft is ready for more of the management, evangelism, and other areas more in the business and politics of APIs, I will have much more to bring to the table. I did however, provide some insight that I think could help the overall process, and will continue to provide feedback--which is why I'm gathering my thoughts in this series of posts. Prior to me participating in the&nbsp;OneAPI Technical Advisory Group, I had just published the API design guides for Cisco and Paypal, as part of my API design research. Bringing the number of API design guides to 9, which is a good sign the space is getting more serious about standardizing how we do API design.

			<p><em>25 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>Making sure APIs that are available via the enterprise service bus, affectionately known as an ESB, more discoverable, accessible, and consumable via the open Internet, is one of the many challenges organizations will face along their API journey. Striking a balance between internal APIs, and public APIs, even if they aren&rsquo;t open to the wider public, and only partners, is proving to be a big challenge for many enterprise groups I am engaged in conversations with. When Steve Willmott (@njyx) and I developed APIs.json, an open API discovery format, we were focused on bringing solutions to the table that were focused on API discovery on the open Internet. We knew that the format could also assist in more controlled environments, like within the enterprise, but wanted to focus on the wider discussion first. Our primary focus is making indexing the current landscape of publicly available APIs, using APIs.json, so that we can make available via our open source search engine APis.io. We have been working with other API service providers like WSO2 to integrate into their enterprise offerings, but pretty much leaving the enterprise landscape to craft its own APIs.json driven solutions. So it pleases me to see that Werewolf ESB has integrated not just Swagger into their open source ESB solution, but also APIs.json. Any service you expose through the Warewolf ESB security layer, will automatically be published in an APIs.json file--additionally these services will also have a Swagger file generated, providing you a machine readable definition for the surface area of each exposed API.&nbsp; Warewofl ESB's usage of APIs.json is exactly what we had envisioned when it comes to providing API discover solutions, for APIs that originate within the enterprise. In this scenarios, APIs.json is acting as a portable, machine readable, JSON definition of what APIs can be found via an company, or organization's ESB. The availablity of Swagger makes these services consumable, as soon as they are discovered via the APIs.json index--showing...[<a href="/2015/08/25/making-sure-the-apis-being-served-up-via-your-enterprise-service-bus-esb-are-discoverable-and-consumable-using-apis-json-and-swagger/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am slowly making my way through defining of&nbsp;the APIs available in the API Stack, beginning with the APIs that I depend on to operate API Evangelist. The best way to understand any API in my opinion, is to create a Swagger definition for it, as well as an APIs.json file, indexing the overall API operations. Since my mission is all about understanding APIs, this is something I try to do on a regular basis. Creating an APIs.json file allows me to index each APIs operations from registration and documentation, to pricing and terms of service. Then I work to break down every possible unit of value represented by an API's endpoints, reducing it down to the minimum viable element possible--something that Swagger allows me to do nicely. Here is what I ended up with for AngelList so far: AngelList &nbsp; AngelList Accreditation API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Comments API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Follows API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Jobs API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Like API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Me API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Messages API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Paths API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Press API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Reservations API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Reviews API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Search API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Startups API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Status Updates API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Tags API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AngelList Users API &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I depend on AngelList API to provide a vital lens for monitoring the companies I track on, who are doing interesting things with APIs.

			<p>I'm neck deep in discussions around API monetization lately, from building a business model in the fast growing podcast space with AudioSear.ch, funding scientific research through API driven revenue, and the latest being a continuing conversation around how to monetize high volume usage around the Recreational Information Database (RIDB).&nbsp; I have been pulled into the conversation around the API for our National Park system information several times now. In October of 2014&nbsp;I asked for Help To Make Sure The Dept. of Agriculture Leads With APIs In Their Parks and Recreation RFP, something I saw some&nbsp;Next Steps For The The Recreation Information Database (RIDB) API this January. This time I was pulled in to comment on a change in language, which allows the vendor who is operating the API to charge for some levels of API access. I received this National Forest Service Briefing, regarding the pricing change last week: U.S. Forest ServiceNational Forest System Briefing Paper Date: August 17, 2015 Topic: &nbsp;Addendum to Recreation One Stop Support Services Contract RFP for a Recreation Information Database API download cost recovery mechanism for high frequency, high-volume requests Issue: &nbsp;Questions and comments from prospective contractors for the R1S support services contract included significant concern about the costs associated with supporting a completely open API. &nbsp;There is an incremental cost for each instance that a third party &lsquo;calls&rsquo; the API. &nbsp;In private industry, the volume of calls is often managed by provisioning access to the API by requiring registration and agreeing to the volume of calls in advance. &nbsp;For third parties wishing to create an interface that will call the API frequently, private industry typically implements a tiered pricing approach where costs rise as volume increases. In response to these concerns and to provide a mechanism for cost recovery for high frequency, high-volume requests, the R1S Program Management Team offered this solution by posting this statement to questions on FedBizOpps (FBO.gov).

			<p><em>24 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>This is a deep dive from one of my loyal readers, who doesn't just listen to what I write, he is pushing my own research in new directions, and reporting back to me. You have read his work before in&nbsp;API Police Report: Raw Thoughts From On-Boarding With Your API, and this time Bob Salita is building on my own proxy work with Charles Proxy. Guest posts isn't something I do on API Evangelist, but when you are pushing the conversation forward like Bob does, I can't help but share. I'm a multi-platform, multi-device developer. I wanted an easy way to inspect HTTP(S) API traffic (requests, responses) from one of my many development devices. Inspection can be achieved by using (reverse) proxy software such as Charles, Fiddler, squid, or mitmproxy. The usual method is to make proxy changes to a device so traffic is forced to a system running a reverse proxy. This process is inconvenient and error prone in multi-device environments. For every device, one has to discover how to make a proxy change, then manually effect the change, and then manually reverse the change when inspection is done. I found the process annoying and error-prone. There had to be a better way. It occurred to me that the ideal setup would be a router where the WAN's gateway was a system running a transparent proxy. Thus simply by connecting the device to the router, the transparent proxy software would capture HTTP and HTTPS traffic. After weeks of research, testing of many configurations and software, I am pleased to document a working configuration. The first step is to install mitmproxy&nbsp;(Linux, OS/X), or&nbsp;mitmdump (Linux, OS/X, Windows) on a system. I've tested mitm software on OS/X and Windows only. The same software is known to run on Linux, I personally haven't tested there yet. OS/X proved to be a better platform than Windows because it can run the&nbsp;console UI program called mitmproxy, whereas Windows users have to...[<a href="/2015/08/24/easy-way-to-inspect-https-api-traffic-in-a-multiplatform-multidevice-environment/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>While we wait for the next steps of the long drawn out Oracle v Google Java API copyright battle, I wanted to take some time and talk about what we can all be doing to actually make a difference. If you aren't familiar with the legal case,&nbsp;is a legal dispute related to Oracle's copyright and patent claims on Google's Android operating system. The court case started in California courts in 2012, with the rmost recent verdict coming in&nbsp;May, 2014, where the&nbsp;Federal Circuit&nbsp;partially reversed the district court ruling, ruling in Oracle's favor on the copyright-ability issue, and&nbsp;remanding&nbsp;the issue of fair use to the district court.&nbsp; While we wait for appeals, endure the continued discussion, and read the trickle of FUD that comes out from the tech press, what can the tech community actually do to make a difference? First, we can reduce our anxiety about this being hellfire and brimstone for the current web API movement. The Oracle v Google legal battle is &nbsp;focused on Java APIs, which are a different beast than a web API, and it would take another legal case to actually set a precedent that copyright applies to web APIs--when this happens, I will be showing up with my Internet of Things enabled pitchfork, and torch.&nbsp; When it comes to actually making a difference, you can openly license and share your existing API designs. If you think copyright applies to APIs, publish them&nbsp;CC-BY,&nbsp;CC0, or&nbsp;other Creative Commons license--something you can link to using&nbsp;API Commons. If you do not think copyright applies to APIs, apply whichever licensing stance you feel is relevant. The important part is that we share how our APIs licensed, accompanied with machine readable API definitions that can act as a representation of what is covered by a license.&nbsp; Your web API definitions are the recipes for your digital resources, and machine readable API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint are how we describe our recipes in a machine readable...[<a href="/2015/08/22/what-we-can-do-to-make-a-difference-in-the-wake-of-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>This is one of several stories I am evolving as part of series I'm calling API fairy tales. With these tales I want to educate business leaders, technologists, and government about the importance of Application Programming Interfaces (API), and how they are being applied in almost every aspect of business occurring online today--providing simple examples that mainstream users can learn from, as well as retell in their circles. Just two months after launching there new messaging startup in 2006, Twitter introduced the Twitter API to the world. Twitter's API release was in response to the growing usage of Twitter by those scraping the site or creating rogue APIs, so Twitter exposed the Twitter API, returning machine readable JSON and XML that developers could put to use, building things beyond what Twitter could build. In just four short years Twitter&rsquo;s API had become the center of countless desktop clients, mobile applications, web apps, and businesses -- even by Twitter itself, in its own mobile apps, and for its public website. The majority of what you know as Twitter today, came the API ecosystem. If Twitter is the nervous system of the world, the Twitter API is the nervous system of Twitter. In my opinion, Twitter is one of the most influential APIs operating today, showing what is possible when a dead simple platform does one thing well, then opens up access via an API and lets an open API ecosystem of almost a million 3rd party developers, build out the rest of the platform--establishing an external R&amp;D environment for the fast growing communication platform. In addition to importance, Twitter is also one of the most complex APIs platforms in operation today showing us the difficulty in running large developer ecosystems, where you have a million developers building whatever they want, around your valuable companies assets. Sometimes this is a blessing, and sometimes this is a curse, and Twitter does pretty well at striking a balance between...[<a href="/2015/08/22/building-everything-you-need-for-a-global-nervous-system-using-the-twitter-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am spending an increasing amount of time thinking about how you monetize data, content, and other digital resources via APIs. A couple of very compelling layers to all of this work, is pushing forward my thoughts on how and when government should charge for access to public data, as well as the how and when private sector companies should charge for access to public data--lots to think about here. Another layer to this conversation that was introduced this week, centers around how we can keep data and content generated via publicly funded research, at publicly funded institutions, available, accessible, and moving forward, by applying the technology and business of the modern web API. I was contacted this week by a group at Caltech, that is proposing a research to database hyperlinking project, which would provide one-click access from published biomedical research papers to authoritative biological databases such as WormBase (WB;&nbsp;wormbase.org), Flybase (FB;&nbsp;flybase.org), the Saccharomyces Genome, and Database (SGD;&nbsp;yeastgenome.org). The primary objective of the project is to make information around scientific research, and the resources you need to accomplish the research, more accessible at the time of research--not after the fact. The secondary objective is to identify monetization opportunities within the industry for the data, and apply modern API methodologies, to take advantage of these opportunities. In short, we are looking to build a viable business model on top of this highly valuable scientific data, to help keep these databases accessible, evolving, and living.&nbsp; This is where the API monetization discussions I've had in the past around generating revenue around public data, come into play, but this time it is with publicly funded scientific research. It takes money to keep these databases up and running. It takes money to design, deploy, and manage APIs, and operate the API ecosystem that will arise around these databases. Where is the ethical line between providing access to this important data, and generating enough revenue to keep the important...[<a href="/2015/08/15/can-we-keep-important-scientific-research-projects-alive-through-revenue-generated-from-api-access/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I play with a lot of services that target the API space each week, during my regular monitoring of the space. These are services from all along the API lifecycle that service this space, from design to integration, that target both API provider and API consumer. After I on-board with a service, there is one trend I see emerging that really puts service providers into two distinct buckets.&nbsp;
The API focused services that stand out the most, are the ones that employ common API definition formats like Swagger,&nbsp;and&nbsp;API Blueprint. After I've on-boarded with a service, if I can upload a machine readable definition of one or many of my own own, or public APIs I depend on, the quicker I will see a service in action--well on my way to understanding the value generated by a service provider, and becoming a customer.
Examples of this in the wild are:

SDKs with APIMATIC
Monitors with API Science
Tests with Runscope
Client with Postman
Documenetation with Gelato

As a service provider, focusing on the API space, if you do not speak Swagger, Postman Collection, or API Blueprint, the chances API providers (or consumers) will be on-boarding and using your service, goes significantly down. This works just like APIs themselves, in that you have to reduce any friction possible when on-boarding. If I can signup using my Github account, and fire up the service with a Swagger, or even better a collection of Swagger APIs using APIs.json, the chances I'll be a customer increase dramatically.
I am adding flags for the common API definition formats, to the system that I use to track on API service providers, and will be highlighting those that speak these formats. After that, I will find a way to showcase which formats these providers support, bringing front and center across my research, and storytelling.

			<p><em>13 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>One of the areas I focus on in the API space, is the business of APIs, and how companies actually make the rubber meet the road when it comes to pricing the API resources they are serving up, as well as the price that API service providers offer up to their customers. After security, monetization is the top question I get from the folks i am talking to about their API strategy. I've been watching the SDK service provider APIMATIC move from a company in beta, to announcing pricing for the valuable API service this last week. I love watching any company break up their valuable resources and services, but feel APIMATICs pricing announcement is interesting enough to warrant a story, because it provides other API service providers with one possible blueprint they can use. APIMATIC is somewhat unique, because they generate SDKs for your APIs, but the way they define their service and broke it up into units of measure valuable, can be universally applied. APIMATIC distilled their service down to a basic unit of value--line of code, or LOC: LOC stands for lines of code. KLOC is a short form for 1000 (1K) lines of code. We use KLOC to estimate the size of an API and charge accordingly. An average API would consume about 1 KLOC. You get different amounts of KLOC, depending on what tier you are in, with a free, professional, and commercial levels of access, as well as a pay as you go option at each level. Even though APIMATIC are an API service provider, who provides services to API providers, APIMATIC's pricing reflects an API way of thinking. The lessons here for other API service providers is not necessarily about a KLOC, but about the process of distilling down your service to its smallest possible unit of value. Then you attach a freemium doorway to the front, break down into reasonable priced, evenly scaled service tiers, with a...[<a href="/2015/08/13/one-approach-to-consider-when-crafting-your-pricing-as-an-api-service-provider/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I love the API design editors that have emerged from Restlet as part of their design studio, and from APIMATIC as part of their SDK management service, and if you haven't checked out Gelato.io, I highly recommend it. All of these solutions provide me with a well designed user interface for working with common API definitions, but even with these offerings, I feel like the overall API universe is very deficient in this area.
It is good that these providers are using common API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, but the UI itself is a one-off, and for API definitions to take their place, front-and-center throughout the API lifecycle, we are going to need some common API design tooling. Any successful solution needs to go well beyond just the JSON, YAML, and Markdown, and give us a powerful user interface to craft exactly the APIs we need.
There are several other API definition editors that let you directly edit JSON, YAML, and Markdown, but to move things forward, we need an easy to use, standardized, open source, API interface interface that will work across common API definition formats. Think of what the WYSIWYG editors did for web design--we need a similar, elegant and modern solution for API design.
I have had this conversation with several API service providers, but I wanted to expand the conversation, and see if I can stimulate the development (or release) of an open source API design editor. I am looking for a solution that any API service provider can deploy within their management solutions, encouraging them to not just speak in common API definition formats, but do it in a way that developers, and non-developers alike, can participate at every stage of the API design life-cycle.

			<p>I love the wide swinging perception people have of who I am, often based upon a 15 seconds of sizing me up, reading the title, first and ending paragraph of a blog post, and often seeing this photo. I'm also humbled by the people who tell me the stories of who they thought I was, before they got to know me, and how that dramatically shifted once they met me. People think I'm all sorts of crazy things, without ever actually having a conversation with me. To help clear the smoke, I figured I'd hlelp answer a few of the common perceptions people throw at me, that in my head I feel people should know, but regularly I am reminded that based upon my site name, branding, etc, people have no clue: APIs Are Good - No, no, sorry they aren't by default. People do a lot of really stupid, fucked up shit with APIs. I'm not blindly cheering on the API masses--sorry. ;-( Its About REST You Idiot! - No, no, really don't give a shit if its RESTish, RESTful, REST, or RESTafarian. I do think you should follow sensible, common patterns, something that is rapidly evolving beyond just REST. I Am Master API Designer - No, no, sorry. I'm making this shit up as I go along, and learning just like the rest of you. Polishing my skills a little more with each iteration. I Like All The Attention - No, no, actually I don't. I like to read, write, and code, and about 1/3 of the time I like interacting with everyone else. During that time I thrive on conversations with people about what they are facing.&nbsp; Public APIs Are Where It Is At - I think you should be as transparent, and as publicly available as possible--it just is good for operations, but not everything needs to be publicly available for anyone to consume (that is dumb).

			<p><em>11 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm feeling like the recent release of the AWS API Gateway isn't just an isolated product release, but more of a signpost in the overall evolution of the API space. It is quite possible that Amazon's moves, set much of this into motion, but I am seeing a number of new API gateway solutions, as well as engaging in more API gateway conversations as part of my regular monitoring and discussions. Amazons API Gateway release has left me pretty underwhelmed, but I still have a lot of exploration to do, which includes employing the gateway alongside Lambda--so I may be changing my tune. When I said AWS launched exactly the API deployment solution the enterprise wanted, not what they need, I'm not necessarily saying it was a stupid move for AWS, my criticism is more about just about making money off the enterprise over providing what they actually need to evolve. (not really a battle I will win--just my ethics bubbling up) I've also talked with the AnyPresence team about their JustAPIs gateway release, which I thought was more progressive than what AWS is up to, pushing into Internet of Things (IoT) territory, over just mimicking what many existing API gateways offer. Later on in the week, I also noted the "API gateway-light" approach of Wavemaker in their full suite of API-first development solutions, adding to the mix. After these conversations, I also noticed that Apigee launched their new "Edge Microgateway", and StrongLoop launched their new&nbsp;API Gateway which is powered by Node.js. I have not dug into either of their solutions, but on the surface it seems to reflect this overall shift in the concept of an API gateway, something that better addresses the needs of API providers and consumers. The concept of an API gateway is nothing new, and honestly is something that doesn't normally excite me, but a much lighter-weight, evented, containerized API gateway that will run anywhere I need, and helps me...[<a href="/2015/08/11/the-continuing-evolution-of-the-api-gateway/">Read More</a>]</p>

We are picking up momentum on our way to the APIStrat conference this November 18-20th in Austin, TX. The call for papers is now open, and we are looking to hear your ideas for what the session discussions should be. APIStrat is all about discussing the most pressing topics in the space, while also revisiting some of the cornerstone's of API operations, for those just entering the space.
If you aren't familiar with the tone of the conversation APIStrat, we are looking for a diverse range of speakers, from many different industries, to share their API stories, avoiding the usual product or company pitches. We want you to focus on the honest stories from your own API experience, in a way that the 400 attendees can take home to apply in their own operations.
We have seeded the call for papers with some topic ideas, if you need help. Feel free to reach out to me personally, if you need any guidance--it is important to me that we have the best talks possible. We entertain any submission, but are looking for ideas that really push the conversation forward, and will benefit the entire community.&nbsp;
Thanks for your submission, and I look forward to seeing you in Austin, TX this November.

			<p><em>11 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>I came across HDScores a couple of weeks agao, but their API wasn't quite ready, something they officially released this last week. HDScores is interesting to me for a couple of reasons. It is an API that aggregates open government data, but also has what I'd consider a potentially viable API business model as well.&nbsp; The monetization of government data using APIs is something I've been discussing for a while, exploring whether our government should subsidize and profit from open data, and helping agencies develop a better understanding of their open data and API consumers before they charge for anything. HDScores takes this to the next level for me, presenting some possible models we can all follow when developing viable business on top of open data.&nbsp; HDScores aggregates restaurant inspection data, something I know other leading tech companies like Yelp, and&nbsp;CityGrid&nbsp;(ha I wrote that)&nbsp;have wanted to solve for a while, but seems like something that an independent 3rd party could potentially accomplish better. While it is is n Yelp's interest to serve up inspection, it isn't their core competency to make it accessible for others to serve up as well, something I think is critical for the success of open data.&nbsp; I like HDScores own description of what they do: HDScores is creating ways for everyone to make better decisions on based on actual restaurant inspection data collected by registered/licensed health inspectors in an easy to read, search and understand format. This is an important aspect of open data, and something the government stewards of this data do not always have the time and resources to accomplish. I feel there is a huge opportunity here for the private sector to step up and help out in an open, transparent fashion, when there is a viable business model present. HDScores approach to monetization is pretty straightforward, they allow you to pull up to 1K establishments, and 2.5K inspection reports daily, for free--after that they charge you...[<a href="/2015/08/11/hdscores-one-potential-api-driven-business-model-aggregating-public-data/">Read More</a>]</p>

I am accumulating more references to API goodness from across Universities, as part of my APIs in higher education research. The more I monitor, the more I find, this is how the API monitoring game works. Unfortunately there is no silver bullet for finding APIs, and related resources, it takes going out and finding it--while also having an eye for what to look for.
One thing I found recently was an API usability course from Carnegie Mellon. The material is a little bit dated, not reflecting API design used in modern efforts, but it is still good to see something like this as part of university curriculum. There are also some good references there, I will be borrowing from.&nbsp;
In addition to seeing more standardized blueprints emerge regarding how campus IT should approach their API efforts, I'd like to see more standardized curriculum emerge that teachers can use in the classroom. I'd also like to see material emerge that isn't just for developers, helping anyone on-board with the concept of APIs, all the way to helping students better design APIs.
Lots to keep an eye on when it comes to APIs on campus. Stay tuned.

			<p><em>04 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am participating in several API focused Slack channels these days, which opens up entirely new channels for conversations across the API community. I think the private channel(s) gives people a safe place to talk about the challenges they face, but there are also some very educational conversations that occur, that should also be shared publicly.&nbsp;
One of these conversations from yesterday was focused on how we handle the trailing slash in our endpoints, a conversation started by Nicolas Greni&eacute; (@picsoung), @3scale&nbsp;hacker in residence, who asked about:

myapi.com/authors/ vs myapi.com/authors
myapi.com/authors/1/ vs myapi.com/authors/1

Something which Guillaume Laforge (@glaforge) of @Restlet said, "technically speaking, they are different resources&hellip; but practically speaking I think an API should accept both to do the obvious thing".
Then John Sheehan (@johnsheehan) of @Runscope brough some simple wisdom to the conversation, "save a byte, remove the slash, and redirect when it's present to the non-slashed version".&nbsp;
Closing up the conversation&nbsp;Darrel Miller (@darrel_miller) shared a previous blog post he had published, the mystery of the trailing slash and the relative url, which he concludes with ensuring the trailing slash is present in all his urls.
I tend to flip-flop on topics like this, one month adding slashes to everything, and the next month running around removing them. It is my strange ebb and flow API design, and conversations like this help me draw a line in the sand, keeping my behavior consistent. I think I'm going to stick with making sure the slash is present, for no other reason than it looks better.
I'll keep trying to cherry-pick simple wisdom like this from our conversations, capturing and sharing some of the exhaust from these private Slack channels, making sure the wisdom of the crowd gets shared, while still respecting the private conversations that occur.

			<p><em>03 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>While updating my APIs in higher education research this last week I came across an API portal I think tells an important story about an evolution in how we develop and maintain software. The current wave of web APIs that I cover has been working well because it has exposed a number of valuable resources, that once upon a time were only available in the realm of IT, making these resources accessible to a wider audience of developers, or even business users.&nbsp; This evolution has been slowly pulling back the curtain of IT, exposing more of it's inner workings, potentially simplifying, and decoupling valuable digital resources from legacy power structures. An important piece of this transformation is the translation of IT speak to language that the average human can understand, something that is playing out within API developer portals across companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies.&nbsp; I touched on this subject with my work on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Envirofacts API a couple weeks ago. With a little work I was able to expose a rich set of API resources, just by renaming the APIs, and hydrating some of the acronyms that were being used. While this is an example of the intersection of government IT power structures, it represents the same evolution. As I was updating my university API work, I stumbled across the same evolution occurring at The Ohio State University. When you land on this API developer portal, you are given no signal that this contains course, and other valuable campus related APIs. This API effort is born out of a classic IT lead project, and while it brings forward some healthy API patterns, it also carries forth the language and culture of IT. I am not saying the team behind the API portal is approaching their portal with intentional bias, these types of efforts are common, and often done by very well meaning groups, who only shortcomings are they don't...[<a href="/2015/08/03/when-planning-your-api-portal-do-not-hide-apis-and-always-translate-from-it-to-something-humans-can-understand/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I work with each generation of API service providers, I always notice a portion of them that are born out of a previous era of software development from the 1990s, and even sometimes the early 2000s, This reminder frequently brings up the point of how these companies need to follow the same advice they (we) offer to their own customers--decouple your resources, into small API driven services. I regularly stumble upon companies who asks me to review software services that are targeting API providers, that don't reflect an API-first approach. My advice to these companies is always to step back, take a deep breath, and consider how you can embark on the same journey that the companies you are targeting have already begun traveling. Define all of your digital assets, break them down into the smallest possible API resource you can, then retool how you sell these service through an API platform, as well as web, mobile, and other micro tooling that you, and your partners can build on top of these APIs. To me, this is the Dogfood (Champagne --&nbsp;@inadarei) 2.0 conversation that needs happen in order for the API space to mature to the next level. In 2015, if you are a company that is selling a service to API providers of any shape and size, and this service is not available via an API, and offers a self-service on-boarding flow, I probably won't be talking about it often. I won't be spending too much time convincing API service providers that they need to reduce this friction--it seems like common sense at this point, I will be focusing on the leading service providers, that they need to be "communicating" using common API definition formats like Swagger, API Blueprint, and with Postman Collections. Just like we tell companies that are considering the API journey, "don't get left behind", as an API service provider you need to make sure and decouple your services, making...[<a href="/2015/08/03/api-service-providers-need-to-decouple-the-services-they-offer-to-api-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I migrate the version 1.0 of my internal systems to an API-first version 2.0, one of the challenges I face is the optimization of some of the features in my own system. I have numerous systems I crafted to solve a specific need, at a specific point in time, with very little consideration about the most efficient design.&nbsp; About 50% of my version 1.0 systems employed APIs, many systems relied on directly connecting to my MySQL databases. One example of this is my main news curation screen on my dashboard. This was the replacement for Google Reader about 6 months before they killed it off. My reader system is very chatty, every action I take against a single post (archive, curate, tag, etc.) initiates a round-trip to the database--something when you translate to API calls, becomes a very huge blip on my API analytics.&nbsp; I treat all my internal apps, just like I would one of my API consumers, and make them sign up for key, and exist within my API service tiers. There are numerous reasons for this, but in the end, it helps me see things through an external lens. When I got my report on my usage, I noticed my curated API usage was through the roof. This is good right? No! It means I have super chatty features in my application, something I need to refactor.&nbsp; My curation may involve 1000 to 3000 news articles which needs to be curated or archived, resulting in potentially 3000 API calls, and when you add on applying tags, and managing other details, I can be in the 5,000 to 10,000 range pretty quick. Its obvious I need a better approach, so I'm developing a new queue based system that lets me work with 25 news stories at once, and submit the changes as a single bulk API call--significantly reducing the number of calls I make. In the end, my API rate limits are...[<a href="/2015/08/03/api-rate-limits-are-making-me-think-more-about-how-i-design-my-apis-and-how-i-consume-them/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Aug 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am revisiting the service composition for my own APIs on a regular basis lately, along with the ever increasing number of conversations I'm having with API providers about their own API monetization strategy. An example of this can be seen with the conversation I had&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Popup Archive about their monetization strategy for their AudioSear.ch API, and how they are shifting from a resource based perspective to a more experience based monetization approach. One side effect of this conversation, is that it looped me back around to thinking about the next steps for my own system. I currently have 28 APIs, with almost 400 endpoints, most of which are content and data style APIs. This represents the core of the API Evangelist network, and now that I have it well defined as a single set of decoupled APIs, it is allowing me to move forward with a whole new generation of APIs. With my current set of content and data APIs, the number one consumer is me, any 3rd party usage is something I want to stimulate, and derive any revenue--my blog, curated, and other APIs are just value add to the traffic on my network of web sites.&nbsp; With the next phase of my API development, I am looking to create more structured API resources that do things like convert CSV to JSON, process patent XML dumps to JSON, the indexing of websites, and much more. These newer APIs tend to go well beyond just pulling information from a database, and require a little more engineering, as well as potentially a lot more compute resources to make a reality. Historically I only meter my APIs to help me manage my costs, but moving forward I am looking to actually generate revenue as well.&nbsp; The service composition I currently have defined using my 3Scale API infrastructure addresses the different types of consumers who potentially will be consuming my APIs.

			<p><em>31 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am fortunate to be able to take part in numerous conversations around API strategy, with companies, organizations, and government agencies who are trying to understand, and maximize the role they play in the API economy. However, one side effect of this world, is that most of these conversations begin and end with strategy planning, and when it comes to deployment and management, I rarely stay on in discussions. I do have clients who do check in with me, at different stops along their journey, but for the most part my role ends once the strategy discussions end. I would like to change this with a new relationship I've established with APIWare, a new API-first agency that is dedicated to defining, developing, deploying, and managing APIs at all stages of the life-cycle. I have worked with the core team that is APIWare, on earlier projects, and after a couple of years, I've learned to trust the work they do. API Evangelist and APIWare are partnering to make sure that some is always available to help you meet the demand of your API operations, by exclusively focusing on: Defining Your API - Where do your resources originate, and what is the best path forward in defining and designing your APIs. Developing Your API - The actual hard work of crafting your APIs from scratch, all the way to using common API gateway solutions and frameworks. Managing API Operations - Take care of the day challenges when operating your API from monitoring and availability to developer on-boarding.&nbsp; The APIWare team is determined to stay focused in these areas, while you are busy doing other things, and the team is working hard to follow many of the best practices that I showcase across my work in the API space.

			<p>I was made aware of the&nbsp;Citi Mobile Challenge during a conversation last week with the Anypresence team about their new JustAPIs offering. The conversation with them has triggered several potential stories, but one that stood out for me, was the API virtualization opportunities that emerge when you use solutions like the JustAPIs gateway.&nbsp; To support the&nbsp;Citi Mobile Challenge, the bank launched a set of virtual APIs to support the event. I think their descriptions tells a lot of the story: The APIs made available through Citi&reg; Mobile Challenge power some of Citi's latest digital offerings around the globe. These APIs will give developers an opportunity to create solutions that could function with existing Citi technology. No customer data will be shared. Citi encourages developers to also use APIs outside of Citi to support and add additional features to their innovations. The bank needed to mimic their production environment, but in a way that developers can still build meaningful mobile apps,without the immediate security and privacy concerns that are present when working with live systems. While I wish sandbox environments were default via all API platforms, which unfortunately is not a reality, however I think when it comes to fintech, the stakes are much higher--which smells like an opportunity for API definitions to me. It can be a lot of work to establish and maintain both sandbox and production environments, but is something that if you do, can open up even more opportunity when it comes to supporting hackathons, providing QA environments, and much more. Additionally, if you embrace modern API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint in this process, as well as approaches to containerization like Docker, a whole new agility and flexibility can be realized as well. Like API monitoring, performance, security, and other growing incentives for embracing modern API definition formats, I see the demand for API virtualization growing.

			<p><em>30 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>I found a pretty cool Github repository during my latest review of my university API research, with a mission "to provide a collection of RESTful web APIs that can allow developers to create applications or services that utilize public data from the University of Toronto." I am a big fan of jump-starting API efforts on campus in this way, something I did to help fuel the API discussion at University of Oklahoma. Which is a topic I will be talking more about in the near future as these conversations continue play out. In my opinion, many campuses are just not ready for APIs, and to get things rolling, it will may often take outside influences. This API project I found, that is dedicated to the University of Toronto is interesting because they identify three target APIs that are being worked on. &nbsp;UofT Course API &nbsp;UofT Building API &nbsp;UofT Food API They are also building their own scraping module, which is available in the repository, complete with a list of target sources, where they will be scraping valuable data for inclusion in the course, building, and food API. I find the project repository is very focused, informative, and simple--well done. I would call this a minimum viable blueprint for API operations on any campus, and is something that should be forked, and cleansed of University of Toronto information,&nbsp; replaced with generalized how-to instructions--complete with a scraping tool. Anyone involved with a university should be able to set a project like this in motion, by forking, and following a simple blueprint. With all the work available on Github, it also means anyone else can potentially get involved and contribute, and if a single project gets abandoned, someone else could potentially pick it up. Most importantly, when a university is actually ready to legitimize the API efforts, they can also fork, and build on top of any work that has been already accomplished.&nbsp; While this approach to doing...[<a href="/2015/07/30/providing-a-web-scraping-toolkit-on-github-to-jumpstart-the-api-conversation-at-the-university-of-toronto/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I had another one of my regular check-ins with Anne and Bailey over at Popup Archive&nbsp;today, with a focus around the monetization strategy for their AudioSear.ch API. I thoroughly enjoy my conversations with the team, because they have worked really hard on their audio API solutions, and are extremely open to discussion, and sharing the stories of their API journey. During our talk, they tuned me into where they were at with their road-map, which includes now having a solid set of API resources that provide access to the episodes, people, and shows involved in podcasts across the Internet. They talked about how they have been iterating on these core API resources, with more experience focused endpoints including relatedness, trending, and tastes, to name a few. All of this really demonstrates that the company are well along in their API journey, moving beyond just the definition of core aPI resources, and actually getting in tune with how these resources will actually be put to work. Next they walked me through some of the core use cases for their podcast API, ranging from radio stations looking to provide better recommendations, to advertisers who want to better understand the exploding world of podcasts, and understand where the opportunity is. Audiosear.ch is working to quantify the world of podcasting, by indexing not just the metadata surrounding audio files, but also its contents, and relationships between them--busting open a brand new realm in cyberspace, that like video, that is poised for explosive growth, and will be ripe with opportunities. Now that AudioSear.ch can crack open, index, and develop awareness around the contents of podcasts, which includes the episodes and people involved with shows, they are also faced the hard part of actually defining, and delivering APIs that developers will need, and actually pay for. Meaning which API endpoints do we provide, and what do we charge for them?

			<p>in my time as API Evangelist I've seen a number of API deployment as a service providers come and go. It is something that is technically hard to do properly, and something that historically had been hard to monetize, but as a wider awareness around APIs grows in the mainstream, the demand landscape for API deployment is shifting. I got a demo of an API provider today called apitite, which provides API deployment and management services in the cloud. The core of the service is built around the common need to deploy APIs from datasources like MySQL, SQL Server, etc. However I wanted to highlight another feature of their platform which they call code endpoints. When I help folks understand what is possible with APIs, I break into four main groups: Data - APIs are about making data more accessible, and usable. Content - With a focus on data, many forget to talk about serving of media and content via LAPIs. Functional&nbsp;- Providing more algorithmic and functional features that accomplish a task. Hardware - Allowing for a device to connected to by other applications and systems. I know this is simplified, and some tech pundits will love to poke holes in it, but when you are explaining the API opportunity to business leaders, as well as the average business user, this has worked well for me.&nbsp; apitite delivers on the functional portion of this API equation forward for me, with their endpoints service. Their platform is Node.js based, but allows for very small scripts to be deployed as simple API endpoints. When you couple this with marketplace-like abilities so users can find ready to go scripts they can reverse engineer, as well as a place for developers to publish and share / sell their scripts--you have a potentially very powerful API deployment formula.&nbsp; I have seen other similar solutions emerge like Algorthmia, but nothing that is bundled with the data API capabilities that apitite also...[<a href="/2015/07/30/going-beyond-just-data-apis-with-code-endpoints-at-apitite/">Read More</a>]</p>

With my latest look at APIs in universities, I increased the number of institutions I'm watching from 17 to 48, more than doubling the number of API efforts in higher education from 2014 to 2015. Not all the APIs I found are fully listed, but if I found a valid public API effort under a school domain, I have added the school, and will work to profile more in the future, as I have time. Here are the 48 institutions I'm tracking on as of August 2015: Brigham Young University&nbsp;Brigham Young University has the most APIs I've come across with any of my university research. While many are still SOAP services, they are actively working to evolve them.
