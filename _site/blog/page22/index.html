        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-bright.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I'm <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">slowly migrating my own infrastructure, towards a microservice first approach</a>, something you can follow the details of on my <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">alpha.apievangelist.com blog</a>. I've been running on my own custom brew content management system (CMS) since I started API Evangelist in 2010. There are many APIs in use across my system, both external publicly available APIs like Twitter and Crunchbase, and a wide variety of internal APIs I've developed myself.
<p>As I work to replicate each aspect of my CMS, carving off each potential micro service, I'm reminded of how much of what I do lives in the shadows. Little scripts I've written here, and there, jobs I haven't run in months, and just general code exhaust from years of operation. I&rsquo;m a little different than most shops, as I'm a one person operation, who codes all my own stuff, but based upon my experience in other shops, the same behavior exists in almost any organization.
<p>Throughout this migration I&rsquo;m reminded of what I'd consider to be one of the biggest security lapses in my world, which is just about things being known. As I build out new features, jobs, bells, and whistles, are they all cataloged, mapped out, and consistently used, or deprecated. Anything that is unknown, unaccounted for, lives in the shadows of my operations, and potentially provides a security risk. Often times the culprit in any security lapse, is an unknown workstation, server, application, or single script.
<p>Having a single doorway (micro service), with a single approach to authentication (<a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API Infrastructure</a>), and a map of my entire surface area, using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> + <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, I&rsquo;m getting a much better handle on things. It will take a while to clean up all my legacy stuff, and map everything out, but once I do, I can easily audit, monitor, deprecate, and ultimately secure the entire surface area of my infrastructure, because it is all done with an API first approach. Then I&rsquo;ll continue to address other aspects of my security like SSL, app management, and other critical areas, but for now, I feel like being able to map out my infrastructure, is doing wonders for bringing my infrastructure out of the shadows.

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-api-transaction.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>I am putting a lot of thought into the value of an API request and response lately. I've talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/postman-collections-as-unit-of-measurement-for-transactions-in-the-api-economy/">the potential of a Postman collection as a unit of measurement, for the API economy</a>. I&rsquo;m also spending time breaking down the monetization strategies of <a href="http://theapistack.com/">the 700+ companies I track on</a>, but I&rsquo;m really looking to get beyond just the API pricing, and actually measure any evidence of real value that I can.
<p>This particular post is born out of a conversation with John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), CEO of <a href="https://bit.ly/1rgh3wM">Runscope</a>, while we were in Sydney Australia last month for <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days Sydney</a>. John had mentioned that when people asked him which are the best APIs out there, he replies &ldquo;none of them, until they are used&rdquo;. Which when you think about it, it really is the truth--APIs do not offer ay value, until they are actually put to use in an app, or system integration.
<p>It is easy to place the value in the actual API definition, or in the request, or response from the API. There is also a lot of talk about much of the value being in the documentation, or possibly the SDK. You can event point to the value being that it is a public API, with easy on-boarding, that you can rely on, and scale as you need. All of this may contribute units to the overall value, but at this point any API still doesn't have value to anyone.
<p>As John says, the point at which an API has value, is when it is used. Until that point, an API isn&rsquo;t a thing. I&rsquo;m not saying the API call as a metric, is the single metric to rule them all, but it is at this point when I feel you can really begin to measure the value an API delivers, and capture the exhaust from it. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know what I mean by all of this, it really is just an exercise for me to break down the moving parts of each API, so that I can better understand how APIs will potentially fuel the API economy--think what Runscope does, but for the monetization portion of each API transaction.

        <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2015</span>

<p>I'm working with multiple partners to define what I&rsquo;d consider to be the firsts stops along the API lifecycle, when you use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as the scaffolding for your API operations. APIs.json is a machine readable format for indexing APIs, that exist under a specific website domain, or are part of a aggregate collection designed for a specific project or objective.
<p>To help me, and the folks I&rsquo;m working with to better see the API lifecycle that APIs.json is enabling, I wanted to take a stroll through each of the stops along the API lifecycle, and think through the potential for additional formats, services, and tooling throughout the entire journey. I want to explore the possibilities for individual API providers, API consumers, as well as API service providers, and the aggregate level, where companies and individuals are delivering valuable tools and services to the overall space.
<p>First, lets start with what I envision APIs.json enabling at the direct one to one, API provider and consumer levels:
<ul>
<li><strong>API Metadata - </strong>Quick access to the most important info about any API, its title, description, image, endpoint, url and tags.</li>
<li><strong>API Surface Area - (The Truth) -</strong> Using Swagger and API Blueprint, any developer can quickly quantify the surface area of an API or microservice.</li>
<li><strong>Execute API -</strong> Include Postman Collections, allowing each API to be execute ready, allowing consumers to load in Postman and deliver the value behind any API.</li>
<li><strong>On-Board API -</strong> One click reference to where an API consumer can onboard with an API.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Server-Side Code - </strong>Locating of existing server-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Generate Server-Side Code -</strong> Locating of services for generating of server-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Supporting Container Images - </strong>Where Docker, and other container images reside, providing instant deployment opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Client Side Code - </strong>Locating of existing client-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-generate Client Side Code - </strong>Locating of services for generating of client-side code in multiple language.</li>
<li><strong>API Pricing -</strong> Understand pricing, access tiers, and partnership opportunities around API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Services - </strong>Access, and make sense of terms of services that apply to API usage.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing - </strong>Understand the licensing of an API, data, content, and code related with an API.</li>
<li><strong>General Questions -</strong> Be able to ask, and get answers to common questions about any API.</li>
<li><strong>API Conversations - </strong>Understand where to engage in conversations, and experience streams from common sources like Github and forums.</li>
<li><strong>Augment APIs - </strong>Add endpoints, verbs, and parameters to existing endpoints, augmenting what any single API provider can deliver.</li>
<li><strong>API Presets -</strong> Establish preset value for API entries, allowing the single, or bulk publishing of data, content and other values to APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Mapping and Domain Specific Language (DSL) - </strong>Bridging API definitions, and APIs, providing much needed aggregation and reciprocity for APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Sandboxes -</strong> Establish API sandboxes, based upon existing API designs, allowing developers to develop against alternative API than a production environment.</li>
<li><strong>API Simulations - </strong>Beyond just a sandbox, actually establish alternative APIs that provide specific simulations of production scenarios that an API would serve.</li>
<li><strong>API Cookbooks - </strong>Assemble API cookbooks that help onboard API consumers using wizards, blueprints, and other established orchestration patterns.</li>
<li><strong>API Testing -</strong> Initiate API testing tools and services, covering surface area of each API.</li>
<li><strong>API Monitoring - </strong>Initiate API monitoring tools and services, covering surface area of each API.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Security - </strong>Audit surface area of any API that is indexed using APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>API Adjacent Monitoring - </strong>Initiate monitoring of other API adjacent resources like documentation, terms of services, and other essential building blocks of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Visualize API Surface Area -</strong> Simple, embeddable visualizations that help us see the surface area an API provides.</li>
<li><strong>Visualize API Resources - </strong>Simple, embeddable visualizations that help us interact with the resources APIs deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze API Surface Area - </strong>Simple, plug and plug tooling and services for analyzing the surface area of any API.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze API Resources -</strong> Simple, plug and play tooling and services for analyzing the resources APIs deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Load API Response In Spreadsheet - </strong>Resource for loading, and importing API resources into an Excel or Google Spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong>Craft experiences -</strong> Weave together experiences made up of multiple API resources, and the resources that are available to support them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list represents my master vision for stops along the API lifecycle, that could be served via APIs.json, providing value directly to API providers, and their consumers. Each of these areas would benefit both sides of the API coin, but as you can see will add value to the APIs.json engine, in a way that goes well beyond just API discovery--which APIs.json is known for.
<p>It is hard for me to articulate, and map out the opportunities that will be available when APIs.json is fully realized. Our goal is to push the number of APIs.json files available to a critical point, where this full lifecycle vision is a reality. Once this occurs, I see another plane of existence emerging, one that can be applied across hundreds, or thousands or public or private APIs and micro services.
<p>Once a critical mass with the number of APIs.json files is achieved, the wider opportunities for expansion, growth, and monetization will span three main areas in my mind:
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definitions - </strong>Additional API definitions like Swagger, API Blueprint, and API Commons, providing machine readable access to vital components of API operations, that can be baked into the overall API lifecycle. 
<ul>
<li><strong>API Pricing -</strong> A machine readable format for breaking down pricing, access tiers, and partnership opportunities around APis indexed with APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>API Questions - </strong>A machine readable format for aggregating questions around API operations, including terms of service, privacy policy, and other elements that impact API integration.</li>
<li><strong>API Conversations - </strong>A machine readable for for aggregating conversations that occur around API operations, that occur on multiple channels like Github, Stack Overflow, Twitter and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>API Services -</strong>&nbsp;The opportunity for new API services to be developed on top of the APIs.json lifecycle.   
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing -</strong> Introduction of testing related services to known, and custom APIs definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring -</strong> One time and schedule monitoring services, triggered via APIs.json indexing.</li>
<li><strong>Security -</strong> Scanning of entire API surface area defined by an APIs.json definition.</li>
<li><strong>Broker - </strong>Use of APIs.json in API broker related activity, crafting custom API backends and stacks.</li>
<li><strong>Analyst - </strong>Delivery of vital industry and area data and content, using APis.json format, connecting analysis directly to sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>API Tooling&nbsp;<strong>-</strong></strong>&nbsp;The opportunity for new API tooling to be developed on top of the APIs.json lifecycle.  
<ul>
<li><strong>Search -</strong> Continued growth in the number of API search engines like APIs.io, providing options, and competition.</li>
<li><strong>Collections -</strong> Establishment of common tooling for doing API roundups, collections, stacks, or any other grouping that is defined.</li>
<li><strong>Notebook -</strong> Deployment of tools for saving, organizing, and remixing using APIs.json formats, either publicly or privately.</li>
<li><strong>Spots / Hubs - </strong>Deployment of API spots and hubs that allow aggregation of API definitions, supporting building blocks, and API consumers in a wide variety of API areas.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboards -</strong> Deployment of dynamic, APIs.json driven dashboards that generate visualizations, listings, and other detail via machine readable API definition formats.</li>
<li><strong>Infographics / Reports -</strong> Deployment of dynamic, APIs.json driven infographics, reports  that generate visualizations, listings, and other detail via machine readable API definition formats, in a portable format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is just a sampling of the definition, services, and tooling opportunities that are already, and will eventually emerge around an APIs.json driven lifecycle. The objective of this post was to flush out my ideas around the one to one, and the wider API economy opportunities using in APIs.json driven API lifecycle, for my own purposes, but also to communicate my thoughts to a handful of partners who are executing definitions, services, and tooling already.
<p>If you are curious about what this all means, and get more clarification about how your company, its services and tooling fit into this, feel free to reach out, and I&rsquo;ll do what I can to help you understand where you fit. Some of the stops along this API driven supply chain, I&rsquo;m depending on existing efforts like Swagger and API Blueprint to execute, some of the areas I&rsquo;m pushing forward myself like API Commons, API Pricing, API Questions, and API Conversations, while other areas I&rsquo;m depending on 3rd party individuals and companies to step up and own. If you think you might be interested in delivering an API definition, service, or tooling somewhere in the areas I&rsquo;ve defined, feel free to reach out.
<p>This post is a product of several conversations I&rsquo;m having with folks, and the regular conversations that Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of 3Scale, and I are having around the APIs.json format. Additionally we are currently working on the roadmap for APIs.io with Nicolas Grenie (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a>), which is the first of many tools that are being built on the APIs.json format. <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">You can influence the roadmap for APIs.json via the Github repo</a>, and the individual communities of each of the sub APIs.json API definitions formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, on their own working sites and repos.
<p>If you made it this far, thanks for listening! ;-)

<p>I was just talking with my friend Oliver Seiler (@0seiler) in New Zealand via email. Oliver is great at keeping me in tune with API related stories out of New Zealand. I was making sure he knew how much I appreciate people like him sending me regular updates, and that it is what makes API Evangelist go around&mdash;to which he replied, reminding of how important the work we are doing here in the US API space.
<p>Oliver told me what I hear a lot, <em>"We still need to sell our story every single day and you wouldn't believe how much anything that comes from particularly you and 18F, but also ProgrammableWeb and GDS in the UK matters to our work."</em> This isn't an isolated case, I hear this a lot from people I talk to in government, enterprises, and other institutions around then globe--the stories we tell are used to make change in how they think and potentially operate. Our stories from the trenches, become the stories they use to sell APis to their bosses.&nbsp;
<p>These reminders are what keeps me going after almost five years of evangelizing. The stories we are sharing about API best practices, and the challenges we face across API design, deployment, management, monetization, evangelism, discovery, and integration, are important to not just the health of the overall API space, but to each public and private sectors that APIs are touching in 2015.
<p>The message for me here, is that we all need to keep pushing forward, but also making sure we tell the stories publicly, sharing our knowledge in real-time, because people are watching, and depending on us to help influence how things work in their businesses, institutions, and government agencies around the world. #NoPressure

        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://gsa.github.io/sam_api/sam/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/sam-api-gov.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>Running the perfect API operation is pretty much a delusional dream. Even leaders &nbsp;like Twilio and AWS have platform, and ecosystem produced problems on a regular basis. In my opinion, API are all about the journey, and we may never get our strategy 100% perfect, we can communicate, and evolve along the way&mdash;this is what I consider the API journey.
<p>To help demonstrate this in action, here a p<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/yBlLdvG2lmk">ost from the GSA, about the SAM API, on the US Government API Forum</a>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We've, rightfully, heard complaints about the SAM API languishing and the documentation not being as functional as it needs to be. We want to make sure users of the API feel comfortable using it to build real applications off of. We've adjusted how we're staffing the API as well as raised the priority the API in the eyes of our developers.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To you, this means this:</em>&nbsp;
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>1) At a minimum, we're sweeping through new GitHub issues weekly, but we will do everything to go through those issues more rapidly.<br /></em><em>2) We're going to increase our transparency by making sure that anything in our backlog that's API-related is in a GitHub issue - if it's prioritized with a date, that'll be made clear, too. We want to make sure you know what's coming and on what days - and the docs will be updated to reflect what's currently implemented and what's coming.<br /></em><em>3) We're going to publish our version management plan to the SAM API site so it's more clear what's going to cause a version change. One of the things about the SAM data is that regulations may change our data, so we should be treating some of it (like reps and certs) as variable-length instead of fixed to keep systems from breaking, so we absolutely document that.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>We've already added some updates that include reference data that wasn't available before and a few minor cleanups. Expect the more as we ramp up our people at this to be worked through by the end of next week. We appreciate being held to task on this - IAE's larger strategy relies on usable, exciting APIs and we can't do that if we aren't serving you.</em>
<p>This is why I prescribe APIs, not because APIs are a technological wonder that magically fixes everything (they do, oh they do). I prescribe APis because of the API journey, and if done right, the API provider can change, evolve, and learn to better serve their consumers, and in this case constituents.
<p>APIs are born out of breaking down legacy walls built up between IT and business operations, but they have also become about breaking down walls built up between inside the firewall, and outside the firewall. In the end I do not think APIs are the thing that will change government or companies, it is the process of doing them, learning to open up and communicate, that will move the needle forward.
<p>Something that will not happen at your agency, organization, institution, or business if you do not start on the API journey yourself.

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-micro-definition.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>Like API, the term microservice has emerged as a force, along with a meaning that is very precise, or very broad, depending on who you are. The only thing I&rsquo;m sure of at this point, is the term microservice is very personal, and means very different things to different people, depending on where you stand in the industry.
<p>Regardless I can't help but consider the implications of the term, internalize it, and see what value I can derive from its meaning in my own world. This exercise leaves me asking, what is a microservice? Over and over, acknowledging I may never fully know the meaning, and like API it will be more of a journey, then it never will be a destination.
<p>First and foremost in my world a microservice means simple, and small. Simple and small. Simple and small. Say it until you can feel it, all Buddhist colliding with API Evangelist. Simple and small, penetrates all layer of meaning for me.
<ul>
<li>minimal surface</li>
<li>minimal on disk</li>
<li>minimal compute</li>
<li>minimal message</li>
<li>minimal network</li>
<li>minimal ui</li>
<li>minimal time to rebuild</li>
<li>minimal time to throw away</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately I want all of this, coupled with the ability to achieve maximum scale, with minimum effort. I want to do one thing, as well as I possibly can, with as minimal resources necessary, but delivering the maximum value at any scale&mdash;with value benefiting myself, my API consumers, and the end-users being served, equally.
<p>None of this is set in stone for me. I acknowledge this is my own perception, and that others will see microservices as something entirely different. Even so, I share my definition publicly, as also I enjoy reading others definition. I kind of think that is part of the whole microservices thing, sharing your own personal definition. In reality microservices do not change my API mission, but it does allow the conversation to be distilled down, for a new generation of business leaders working to make sense of all of this.

<p>I would say the enterprise space fleet has successfully shifted their course, heading in the general direction of everything API. SAP, Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, and the rest of the usual suspects have pledged their faith to APIs, mobile, and IoT, all in a very public way. For those of us who jumped off the SOA bandwagon a while back (getting on the API bandwagon, yeehaw), this can be amusing to watch, cause the API bandwagon is better y'know?. ;-)
<p>I sincerely hope that these large companies can make a shift towards an API way of life, or a microservice devops way of operating, or whatever the cool enterprise kids are calling it these days. Some companies will find success in these areas, while many, many others will just talk about it, and buy a wide range of vendor services that will help them talk about it&mdash;there will be a lot of money to be made (and spent).
<p>The thing I fear, is that many of the core principles of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">why this whole thing is working</a> will go right over the heads of many technologies and business leaders in the enterprise. Elements like simplicity, transparency, openness, and functioning in a decoupled, decentralized way. You are the enterprise, many of the essential ingredients of API, are just fundamentally at odds with what you are. You are a big, complex, powerful, and political corporate presence&mdash;a beast that does not like being taken apart, reinvented over and over, and being forced to work in concert with other internal, partner, and public resources, in an open way.
<p>This doesn't mean that some enterprise entities won&rsquo;t be successful&mdash;some will. I will be carefully watching the waves of enterprise organizations, for these tech savvy few, who internalize the core philosophy around APIs, successfully uploading their corporate soul to the API singularity. However, I predict I will have to work very hard to find these companies amidst the wreckage of the enterprise organizations that make the same mistakes they did with SOA, because APIs are just not compatible with their DNA, and ultimately will be rejected for reasons that are more enterprise than they are API.

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.postman.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm immersed in deep thoughts about the implications of machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="https://www.postman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collections,</a> which are being applied to APIs, in some very different, but overlapping, and complementary ways. Currently I&rsquo;m working to define the overlap between APIs.json and Postman Collections, and how they work together.
<p>For me, any good API starts with a Swagger definition, or API Blueprint, which is the single, machine readable truth of what is the surface area of any API, which I consider fingerprint for what is possible with any API or micro service. Additionally when I am working with any API, or stack of APIs, I am using APis.json to organize them into a single coherent set of APIs, then rely on each APIs properties to point to essential resources like Swagger, terms of service, pricing, and anything else I feel is essential to operations.
<p>In addition to providing links to Swagger definitions for each APIs.json API entry, I&rsquo;m also experimenting with adding a property that point to any Postman Collection for each API, and microservice.  I&rsquo;ll start by just calling the type &ldquo;x-postman-collection&rdquo;, and provide a URL to a Postman Collection I&rsquo;ve generated around the API call, providing a link between what an API is, and a measurement of the transaction an API produces.
<p>I&rsquo;d say that Swagger is the promise of value an API delivers, and Postman is a machine readable representation of the value, ready for execution&mdash;which acts as machine readable unit you can then load into Postman, or any other system, and actually experience the result. When this unit is sitting in your Postman client, you can see the value behind a single collection, but when you see a couple hundred of these collections in your Postman, you start seeing the important role they can play in the overall API economy, as portable a unit of measurement for API transactions.

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-feedback-loop.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>If you are following some of my recent stories, I&rsquo;m heavily focused on <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, as <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">I work to organize my own stack of microservices</a>, using APIs.son and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. I&rsquo;m working hard to define additional, machine readable layers to my microservices index that answer as many of the questions that I have about the microservices and APIs that I depend on.
<p>The first machine readable definition I include in any <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/making-sure-my-api-roundup-stories-are-machine-readable-by-designing-them-as-apisjson-collections/">APIs.json collection</a> I&rsquo;m building is Swagger, which provides a JSON or YAML definition of the surface area for any microservice or API that I depend on. The second thing I put to work for my own APIs, is <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, which provides a JSON definition for the licensing of my APIs. Beyond that I&rsquo;m pushing forward a couple of other machine readable definitions, that help me make sense of not just a handful of APIs in my own collections, but potentially thousands of APIs in the public space.
<p>I just published two potential new machine readable definitions to add to my stack of APIs.json properties:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com/">api-pricing</a></strong> - My quest to understand the API pricing across the API space, from providers like Amazon to Twilio, there are some healthy patterns to follow when crafting API pricing.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">api-questions</a></strong> - My realization that nobody would give a shit about a machine readable terms of service, so I created a simple JSON list of questions and answers that can be applied to APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are two areas that I am trying to better understand, as I build my machine readable index of the APIs, that I call <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>, which also helps fuel <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Another area I&rsquo;m struggling to get a handle on, is the message layer around APIs, and more widely what I&rsquo;d consider the feedback look around APIs. So, what the heck do I mean by this? I&rsquo;m not entirely sure, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure it out in real-time--which is why I'm writing this post.&nbsp;
<p>If an API is one of my internal APIs, the messaging, communication, and feedback loop starts with issue management in Github. Each API has its own Github repo as its home base, and any communication around its design, deployment, and management, happens there. However there may be other references to the API made on Twitter, Stack Overflow, or other channel, and I am looking for a way to aggregate them all in a single machine readable away, that is connected to the API.
<p>To do this, I&rsquo;m employing the same approach I&rsquo;m using to get a handle on pricing, and other questions I have around API operations, and creating a new APIs.json API property type, which I&rsquo;m going to call <span style="text-decoration: underline;">api-conversations</span>. Right now I&rsquo;m just going to include message entries for Github issues, but work to make as inclusive as I can, to include any possible channel. We&rsquo;ll see where I go with api-conversations, right now I&rsquo;m going to use it to manage the feedback loop within my own microservices stack, but then I&rsquo;m also going to apply to the API Stack, and see what it looks like when I try and aggregate the feedback loop around public APIs.

<p>I've said it before, and I will say it again &mdash; <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">Excel and spreadsheets</a>&nbsp;will continue to be super critical for the growth of the API industry. There are an increasing number of solutions like <a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark for deploying and managing APIs using spreadsheets</a>, something that will get easier over time, but so far I'm not seeing equal acknowledgment of the potential of Microsoft Excel as an API client.
<p>The majority of the world's data is locked up in spreadsheets, and CSV files. Something I learned during my short time in Washington DC, is that the API community is going to have to court the legions of data stewards who spend their days in spreadsheets at the companies, and government agencies around the world, if we are going to be successful. The tooling for deploying APIs from spreadsheets has emerged, but we have a lot of work ahead to make them simpler and easier to use.
<p>With the majority of the worlds data locked up in spreadsheets, this also means many of the business decision makers have their head in the spreadsheet on a daily basis, depending on the data, calculations, and visualizations that influence their daily decision-making. I&rsquo;m seeing only light efforts around delivering API driven services in the spreadsheet, something that is going to have to grow significantly before the API industry can reach the scale we would like.
<p>I know that the spreadsheet does not excite API providers, and API integrators, but they are a comfortable tool for many of the business ranks, and if we are going to get them to buy into API economy, and play nicely, we are going to have to accommodate their world. When thinking of spreadsheets and APIs, don't just think delivering content and data to APIs, but also how APIs can deliver vital content and data back to spreadsheets users&mdash;acknowledging the ubiquitous tool can provide huge benefits as an API client, as well as data source.

<p>I use many types of APIs. Some are public APIs, operated by other people, and then there are the APIs I have designed, operate, and consume on my own. As I design, redesign, deploy, and manage my APIs, I'm in a fortunate place that I get to push the boundaries of API operations, without much of the friction of normal API platforms. I'm the only one providing and consuming many of my APIs, essentially running an API dictatorship.
<p>Over time I have built quite a few APIs that are still up, active, but nobody is using them. I have built them during some specific research, or to support a prototype, which once I was done with core work, I do not need the API to actually be alive and running. At some point in the future when I revisit the research, I may want to fire back up the APIs, but for now its ok if they are down, with a dormant Docker image, and server-side code living within its requisite Github repo.
<p>This is just one example of how I&rsquo;m building APIs that could possibly go away at anytime. It is an area that, as I think about more, the more use cases I come up with. It is helping me rethink some of my architecture, and workflow. Another potential approach I am contemplating involves having a single UI that may use one or many APIs, but those APIs aren't even live until I load the screen&mdash;which triggers the containerized deployment of the last known snapshot of each of the dependent microservices.
<p>If nothing else I&rsquo;m having fun. I&rsquo;m not sure if all these scenarios are viable in the real world, but it makes for an interesting exercise, and provides me with a kind of fire drill approach to my workflow that lets me rethink my APIs, and the workflow around them, with each drill. For me, it shines a whole new light on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever-wait-nothey-can-go-away-at-any-time/">the old APIs can go away at any time, no wait you have to support them forever argument</a>. Docker and containerized deployment of my APIs are really warping how I see the services I depend on&mdash;fun, fun!

There are a lot of interesting API informational nuggets throughout the podcast, some of which I'll be writing about, but this one is about something Tony mentioned&mdash;called <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#vendorExtensions">Swagger vendor extensions</a>.
<p>I've been using Swagger for a while, and specifically Swagger 2.0 since its release, and Swagger vendor extensions was new thing to me&mdash;most likly user error. I don't ever sweat things I miss, because I consume so much information each day, things are bound to get past me. Anyways, Swagger vendor extensions are simply the ability to add any property to an API definition by using the &ldquo;x-&ldquo; prefix&rdquo;.
<p>This is something we do with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as well, and is something that I think becomes the R&amp;D layer for any specification. Since I just learned about this ability, I do not have many examples of what has been done with these extensions.<a href="https://blog.apigee.com/detail/tutorial_using_apigee_127_to_build_apis_in_nodejs_swagger_20"> I found a post from Apigee</a> demonstrating how you can add "capabilities such as caching, quota, OAuth, and analytics to your API with Swagger vendor extensions via a <a href="https://github.com/apigee-127/volos)">project we call Volos.js</a>&rdquo;, and I came across <a href="https://rest.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/v1/?spec">Wikimedia using a "x-subspecs&rdquo; in the API definition for Wikipedia</a>&mdash;now that I&rsquo;m tracking on Swagger vendor extensions I will look for them in Swagger specs I come across.
<p>I've come across blog posts about Swagger, where people outline how they don&rsquo;t use it because they can&rsquo;t define something they want. Maybe they just didn't know about Swagger vendor extensions like me, IDK. Regardless I will be tracking on how people are extending Swagger using the vendor extensions, and begin brainstorming some of my own ideas on how they can be used to craft exactly the API definition you need.

<p>I am revisiting some work that I started when I was working in Washington DC as a Presidential Innovation Fellow(PIF). Actually there are several things going on here, a sort of perfect storm of API design thoughts. After reviewing hundreds of APIs, including APIs in the federal government, you start to want to either go mad, or start making changes to the API designs you are exposed to.
<p>This leads me to the other layer to this story, a common question I get regularly, regarding <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/02/using-machine-readable-api-definitions-to-solve-a-persistent-question-are-there-any-write-apis-in-federal-government/">whether or not there are any write APIs in the federal government</a>&mdash;meaning, can you POST, or PUT to a common government resources. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/25/a-rare-beast-in-government-the-write-api/">Write APIs are important in government</a>, and their scarcity reflect some of the systemic illnesses I feel exists in government IT. With that in mind, bundled with the regular process of reviewing an API implementation out of government&mdash;you get this late night API Evangelist story. Enjoy. ;-)
<p>I was profiling the <a href="https://data.usajobs.gov/Rest">data.usajobs.gov jobs API</a>, which included crafting a machine readable Swagger API definition:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7bccc3d914aae35003a0.js"></script>
<p>After crafting this machine readable definition of the surface area of data.usajobs.gov, I am once again reminded of the lack of write APIs in government--as the data.usajobs.gov API is GET only, which only provides a single search endpoint. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I am thankful for the work they&rsquo;ve done with the data.usajobs.gov jobs API, it is just my nature to study, then push and iterate on API designs anywhere I possibly can. Sorry, I have an addiction. ;-(
<p>As I was profiling data.usajobs.gov, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/25/github-can-be-the-post-and-put-layer-for-federal-government-apis/">I remembered of the work I did as a PIF in DC, and how after the government shutdown, I wanted to see more APIs, have an augmented layer to their operations</a>&mdash;eliminating the ability to turn off the switch for government APIs. Meaning I would like read only APIs like data.usajobs.gov to have one or many other APIs that sync, and augment API functionality, beyond what the original government agency intended. It may sound radical, but I think it is how we are going to get this stuff done.
<p>To help understand what I&rsquo;m talking about, I generated a basic evolution of the data.usajobs.gov jobs API design, allowing for potential POST, PUT, and DELETE capabilities, opening up the federal jobs API for community input:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/b5100f01f293cad858ea.js"></script>
<p>Of course, this API isn&rsquo;t a real API--It is just a Swagger representation of one possible API that could exist to augment the read only API provided by data.usajobs.gov. My goal is to just think through how we might be able to help iterate on existing API resources being provided by government agencies. Allowing for extending, building upon, and potentially crowdsourced assistance in the management public data. I&rsquo;m not saying this should be a fully open API, available to anyone, but the idea of a well managed, or possibly multiple well managed resources for the same public data is an interesting thought.
<p>This approach would allow for the evolution of public data, beyond what the government can do on its own. External entities could build upon government data, like the jobs data from data.usajobs.gov, and then data.usajobs.gov could decide if any 3rd party resources becomes worthy of paying attention to. I&rsquo;m thinking about applying this type of model in other areas of government I am working through like with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/15/free-application-for-federal-student-aid-fafsa-api/">FAFSA API</a>, and some of the API efforts I&rsquo;m seeing out of Department of Interior and Department of Energy.
<p>In the end this post is primarily about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/17/beyondget-or-otherverbs-an-augmented-api-platform-/">potential in augmenting existing read only APIs, with an external POST, PUT, and DELETE</a>. I&rsquo;m not saying the data.usajobs.gov jobs API needs this, it just happen to be the API I was profiling when this story came up, and it seemed as good of an API as any to leverage as part of this story.
<p>Not much else will happen for me on this topic. I am not going to develop this API. <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">I just wanted to add the data.usajobs.gov job API to my federal API stack,</a> and along the way I got sidetracked with adding the POST, PUT, and DELETE layer of this story--damn ADD! ;-)
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find a couple of other federal government data sources to possibly push this idea forward, and eventually I&rsquo;d like to see a single API, developed on top of a government resources, surpass its original source in quality, and value, resulting in the original agency accepting the data back into their interanal systems. When it comes to data stewardship, open data, and APIs in government it is all about trust&mdash;without trust, any external, outside-in effort around open data and APis in the federal government, will be rejected.

<p>I came across <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/10/frontline-systems-rason-modeling-language-and-rest-api-make-advanced-analytics-easy-in-web-and-mobile-applications/">an interesting piece of technology today while doing new curation for API.Report</a>. <a href="https://rason.com/">RASON</a>,&nbsp;an interesting approach to API driven analytics and potential UI and visualization, that kind of resembles what I have been envisioning for one possible future. The analytics tool is created by a company called Frontline Systems, and I&rsquo;ll let them articulate what it is:
<blockquote><em>RASON&trade; software is designed to make it much easier to create, test and deploy analytic models that use optimization, simulation, and data mining. RASON stands for Restful Analytic Solver&trade; Object Notation.</em></blockquote>
<p>RASON targets analytical professionals, excel power users, and web app developers, but here is where it gets over my head, "Problems you can solve with the RASON service include linear programming and mixed-integer programming problems, quadratic programming and second-order cone problems, nonlinear and global optimization problems, problems requiring genetic algorithm and tabu search methods -- from small to very large." &mdash; sounds impressive to me!
<p>I signed up and played with RASON a little bit, but it wasn't as intuitive as I hoped. I think I have a little more to learn about RASON. <a href="https://rason.com/Home/About#rason_models">The RASON models are very cool, I like the airport hub</a>, I just don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge to make it work right now, however I&rsquo;m digging the idea, and it reflects what I&rsquo;ve been seeing in my head when it comes to defining <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com">API driven analysis</a>--when you connecting that with <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com">API generated visualizations</a>, <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a>, <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com">spreadsheets</a>, <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a>, and more&mdash;I start to get a little too excited.
<p>Anyhoo. Just sharing a new technology that I found. Once I learn more about RASON, hopefully I will be able to see where RASON fits into the bigger API life-cycle, and share a little more.

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/alps-io-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>I was watching an <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/api-craft/mSFq__019ik">open thread around ALPS over at API Craft</a>, something that is on my working list to better understand, apply more in my world, and tell the story all along the way. ALPS author, and API visionary (;-) Mike Amundsen (<a href="/admin/blog/mamund">@mamund</a>) responded to the thread with a nice overview, which I wantd to repost and share with you.
<p>So, what is <a href="http://alps.io/">ALPS</a>?
<ul>
<li>ALPS is not a runtime format like HTML or HAL</li>
<li>ALPS is not a designtime format like RAML or Swagger</li>
</ul>
<p>ALPS is a Profile format for describing the bounded context of a service.  ALPS can be used as source material for designtime formats like RAML, WADL, Swagger, WSDL, etc. on the server side.
<p>ALPS can also be used as source material for client-side frameworks like Ember.js, Angular, etc on the client side.
<p>ALPS describes the operations (actions) and data elements of a service. that's all. that description is the same no matter the designtime tooling, protocol, or message format used. that description is the same whether you are implementing code on the client-side or server-side.
<blockquote><em>"Hence state is maintained SERVER SIDE by mapping the URL's when it is implemented... correct?"</em></blockquote>
<p>ALPS has nothing to say about how or where state is maintained. You can do whatever you wish when you implement the bounded context ALPS describes.
<p>ALPS tells you the WHAT of the service, not the HOW.
<p>For example, you can use the ALPS document to implement a services that employs your API Chaining on the server side. Or you can use the same ALPS document to implement a classic hypermedia-driven service using Cj or some other hypermedia-rich format. You can also use the same ALPS document to implement a simple JSON-object CRUD-style service.
<p>When you use ALPS as the "shared bounded context" you can be confident that each of the services, regardless of their local implementation choices are supporting the same bounded context. this is especially handy when you want to provide the same operations using different implementations (e.g. JSON-object CRUD for mobile, HTML for browser, etc.).

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/mohiomap/mohiomap-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>There are lots of good visualization stories recently, or maybe I&rsquo;m more focused on API driven visualizations. Who knows? This particular post is an API story because <a href="https://www.moh.io/mohiomap/welcome.php">Mohiomap</a>, the company at the center is using APIs to accomplish their &ldquo;vision&rdquo;, not because they have an API&mdash;which actually would be a nice way to pay it forward, but that is another story. Regardless, I think what <a href="https://www.moh.io/mohiomap/welcome.php">Mohiomap</a> is up to, is interesting on a lot of levels, bur primarily because in coming years we need to be able to better understand this new, cloud-based world we are  creating for ourselves.
<p>Why am I blogging about this? Because Mohiomap is driven with APIs, and if done right, it can make a big difference in how we see our virtual selves, whether the business or brand personas we are crafting online, or our personal self that is spread across Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, and other API driven platforms. We currently can easily see our personas within each silo, like Facebook profile, Twitter profile, or Github profile, but understanding ourselves across the places we frequent online is much more difficult&mdash;something only possible when you begin using APIs.
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a visualization research project on my radar for some time now, but I think its time that I start publishing it for everyone to enjoy. API driven visualization is an important layer to my overall API economy research, and whether its for the meta layer of APIs, or for the valuable resources they are serving up, like wall posts, messages, photos, videos, or business documents--visualizations will continue to drive how we evolve our understanding of the digital world that is unfolding at a breakneck speed.
<p>With the addition of Mohiomap, I&rsquo;m starting to develop quite a list of API driven visualization services and tooling. Enough to warrant its own research area, and be given a certain amount of attention each week. Ultimately it will depend on what the community delivers, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that visualizations will dominate the stories here on API Evangelist for the foreseeable future.

<p>As I look through more APIs, and I don&rsquo;t just play around in their developer portal, and look at documentation, I am actually get my hands dirty generating Swagger definitions, and authenticating and making calls to an API. There is no better way to get to know an API, that generating a Swagger definition, and integrating with it&mdash;something when done, you always walk away with a new perspective.
<p>Once I get more of the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">APIs profiled in my API Stack</a>, I&rsquo;m going to see if I can configure my API editor to let me iterate on other people&rsquo;s API designs a little bit. As an API consumer, you don&rsquo;t always get a voice in the design of the next version of an API, but with API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, you can actually make edits, and then share them back with a provider. Of course it is still up to a provider to decide on what they accept, but there is not better way to make suggestions than a machine readable API definition, that is ready to go.
<p>When I get around to doing some housecleaning on these API designs I generated, and possibly make some design iterations, I&rsquo;ll focus on some of the smaller operations, leaving the bigger teams to do their own heavy lifting. Also, my goal isn&rsquo;t just to iterate on API designs to help the original provider improve on their design, my goal is to iterative and improve on the API designs in my stack. The more designs I play with, more designs I have in my library, and the more I get a feel for what I think API designs could, or should look like.
<p>I can&rsquo;t fix all the APIs in the world, but I can improve on the hard work that has already occurred, and who knows, maybe some providers will see it for the compliment that it is, and listen to some of my API designing that is occurring out loud.

<p>While processing the news today over at <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, I came across a <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/10/broadcom-open-switch-apis-drive-innovation-in-network-infrastructure/">story about Broadcom delivering an API for managing their latest network infrastructure</a>. The intersection of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Application Programming Interface (API) is something I&rsquo;m paying closer attention to lately. Hmmm. SDN + API = Brand New Bullshit Acronym? Meh. Onward, I just can&rsquo;t slow down to care--{"packet keep moving"}.
<p>At the networking level, I&rsquo;m hearing <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/">Broadcom</a> making a classic API infrastructure argument, "With the OpenNSL software platform, Broadcom is publishing APIs that map Broadcom's Software Development Kit (SDK) to an open north bound interface, enabling the integration of new applications and the ability to optimize switch hardware platforms.&rdquo;, with examples of what you could build including "network monitoring, load balancing, service chaining, workload optimization and traffic engineering."
<p>This new API driven approach to networking is available in the Broadcom Tomahawk and Trident II switches, looking to build up a developer community who can help deliver networking solutions, with Broadcom interested in giving, "users the freedom to control their technology, share their designs and boost application innovation.&rdquo; Everything Broadcom is up to is in alignment with other valid Internet of Things (IoT) efforts I&rsquo;m seeing across not just the networking arena, but almost any other physical object being connected to the Internet in 2015.
<p>I think what Broadcom is doing, is very forward leaning effort, and providing native API support at the device level is definitely how you support &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; around your networking infrastructure. To keep in sync with the leading edge of the current API evolution as I'm seeing it, I would also recommend adding virtualized container support at the device level. As a developer I am thankful for the APIs that you are exposing, allowing me to develop custom solutions using your hardware, but I need you to take it one level further--I need to be able to deploy my own APIs using Docker, as well as working with your APIs, all running on your infrastructure.
<p>I need your devices to support not just the web and mobile apps I will build around your around your hardware, and the API surface area you are providing with the new Tomahawk and Trident II switches, I need to also plugin my own microservice stack, and the microservices that vendors will be delivering to me. I need the next generation of switches to be API driven, but I also need to guarantee it is exactly the stack I need to achieve my networking objectives.
<p>That concludes my intrusion into your road-map. I appreciate you even entertaining my ideas. I cannot share much more details on what I intend to do with your new SDN &amp; API driven goodness, but if you work with me to let me innovate on your virtual and physical API stack&mdash;I feel that you will be surprised with what what the overall community around your hardware will deliver.

<p>I'm a big fan of private APIs, and all for keeping API access tailored to meaningful groups of users vs. just opening up data to the public, without first thinking critically about the possible pros and cons. With that said, I always encourage API providers to seriously consider the outside-in effect, when APIs are designed to be as accessible as possible, allowing unintended things to occur around your API resources.
<p>It isn't just about the developers who are directly working with your API, it is also the entire API industry, and service providers that serve it. A number of companies exist across the API space, providing valuable products, services, and tooling that is derived from one or many API platforms. The API space is big enough now, it isn't just about the handful of strongest players, it is about the entire community.
<p>An example of this is with <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API ChangeLog</a>, a monitoring service for API documentation. The API ChangeLog keeps an eye on 68 of the leading APIs, and tracks on whether or not they have updated their API documentation, and keeps developers informed of the changes. These types of services benefit both API providers, and consumers, making for a healthier space overall. While some API provider are good at keeping developers in tune with documentation changes, not all of us are able keep up, and sometimes developers just aren't tuned in, and the API ChangeLog helps fill in the gaps.
<p>Without outside access to API resources (like your docs), services like API ChangeLog do not exist, leaving developers to fend for themselves, and not providing valuable industry data that can be used by anyone. Services like API ChangeLog will be the lifeblood of the API economy, and provide valuable exhaust that informs API driven markets as they grow, and help give these markets som e of the positive forces they are so well known for.
<p>Keep your APIs, and much of their supporting building blocks as accessible as possible, and while you are at it, <a href="http://apisjson.org">make sure and index them using APIs.json</a>, helping services like <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API ChangeLog</a> provide vital data to developers, and the wider API economy.

<p>A short, concise, portable description of what your API does, is one of the most critical building blocks of API management, and is essential to reducing friction when new users are on-boarding with any API. It can be easy to design, and populate your API developer portal from a perspective that is very much in the know. I do it all the time, structuring your portal to reach the widest possible audience can be hard&mdash;it is why I&rsquo;m here! ;-)
<p>Here is a great example of providing all the right elements, but leaving out the essential detail that new API consumers will need. View the <a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com/">Dailymotion developer area</a>, land on home page, and without clicking, tell me what Dailymotion does.
<p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/dailymotion-dev-portal-screenshot.png" alt="" width="98%" align="right" />
<p>&nbsp;
<p>The portal has all the right moves, except it neglects to say anything about videos, or show a video picture. I guess you could argue that anyone landing here will probably be getting there via the main Dailymotion site, with the proper knowledge of what is going on. This is probably true, but there will always be people landing on the API developer portal page, without any clue of what Dailymotion does&mdash;do not make them click to find out.
<p>This really isn&rsquo;t that big of a mistake, and something that only someone like me, who looks at numerous developer portals would think about. For Dailymotion, all they have to do is update the FMA area, put video in the title, short description, and maybe include as an image in the background. Boom, within seconds everyone understands the value offered by Dailymotion in 2 seconds or less.
<p>The description you provide on your API portal landing page is your first impression, make it count. It is also likely, that the press, bloggers, and  other 3rd parties will copy / paste the description to describe what you do, on remote websites&mdash;so make it good!

<p>Tony Hirst (<a href="https://twitter.com/psychemedia">@psychemedia</a>) wrote an interesting story about what I would consider <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the API journey</span>, which he called, &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2015/03/09/whats-the-point-of-an-api/">What&rsquo;s The Point Of An API?</a>&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m the first to call bullshit on the term API, which is more storytelling magic than it ever was technical, for me. In my opinion, the point of an API is rarely ever the actual technical implementation&mdash;sorry devs. ;-( The point of the API is the journey, for the API provider, and the API consumer (both dev and end-user).
<p>The point of the API is about the API provider reducing friction, when it comes to understanding, and put to work, valuable digital assets from data, content, to more programmatic, algorithmic elements like image filtering or video encoding, to more physical elements like a Nest thermostat, webcam access, or drone controls. An API does not automatically equal success, it take so much more than just launching an API to establish something that delivers value, and is sustainable--something that can be easier said than done, in todays volatile, digital environment.
<p>The point of an API is about the API consumers having the freedom to discover, access, explore, and put to use valuable digital resources that they couldn&rsquo;t deliver on their own, in new and interesting ways. Developers need to be part of a feedback loop with API providers that helps iterate APIs, and evolve APIs towards being more experience based beyond their resource oriented roots, and integrate them in meaningful ways into the systems, apps, and devices end-users depend on the most.
<p>The point of an API is about empowering the end-user with applications that deliver value, all while opening up as much of the backend, and the pipes that are delivering valuable API driven resources, giving end-users a voice throughout the supply chain, using open formats like oAuth&mdash;bringing much needed transparency to the process. This isn&rsquo;t just about tech, it is also about developing sustainable businesses built around applications that are truly deliver value, which along a way also protect the interests, security, and privacy of the end-user.
<p>The API is not purely the technical elements, it is made up of the technical, business, and political building blocks, which includes the documentation, SDK, terms of service, pricing, and the many other essential aspects of API operations. APIs are definitely made up of the API projections into the users environment, and back-again, facilitating a real-time journey, that if done right, can benefit the API platform, developers who build upon it, and the end-users who ultimately define what the point of any API is.

<p>Up until now, my research has been about showcasing:
<ul>
<li>News </li>
<li>Companies </li>
<li>Tools </li>
</ul>
<p>All I&rsquo;m doing now is exposing some of the people who are doing interesting things as well, and are open to being contacted about their work, and discuss how you can potentially tap their expertise to help you achieve your API objectives. Over the next couple weeks, you will see me start listing individuals who are open to helping out in the core areas I research:
<ul>
<li>API Design</li>
<li>API Deployment</li>
<li>API Management</li>
<li>API Discovery</li>
<li>API Integration</li>
<li>API Evangelism</li>
<li>API Monetization</li>
<li>API Security</li>
</ul>
<p>I already showcase companies in many of these areas, and track on the features, or building blocks employed to deliver products and services they offer, all I&rsquo;m going to do now is provide more information on individuals who can help execute in these areas as well. Along the way you will also find me showcasing specific companies and tooling as well--API Evangelist partners like 3Scale, WSO2, and Restlet, but also other products I&rsquo;m personally invested in like APIs.json, and the companies, and tools I use daily like Swagger, API Blueprint, APITools, API Science, and Runscope.
<p>After five years of doing this, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/scaling-what-i-do-at-api-evangelist/">I&rsquo;m trying to understand what scale looks like for API Evangelist</a>. My objective is to keep funding my research, producing the short form (blog), and long form (guides, white papers, and blueprints), while keeping it all rooted in what the leading API providers, and ultimately the people behind them are doing on the ground. With this in mind, you will find more areas of my research, providing links to people actually doing these things in the field, and you will also hear more about the conversations I am having with these people as they execute their craft.
<p>As always, if you, or your company is doing something interesting in these areas, let me know&mdash;if you are an individual looking to freelance in these ares, or build a consultancy delivering services in these areas, let me know. I can&rsquo;t guarantee I&rsquo;ll include you in my research, but if you are doing interesting things, you&rsquo;ll stand out, and I&rsquo;m sure I can find some way to showcase your work in a way that helps you, me, and the wider API space. Also, if you need help with a project in one of these areas, feel free to reach out, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to point you in the right direction.

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://bit.ly/1Gm0CmP"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>If you are an API developer, it is likely you have used <a href="https://bit.ly/1Gm0CmP">Postman</a>, the simple tool for building, testing, and documenting your APIs. I have <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop">Postman open as a Google Chrome App</a>, which allows me to make API calls as I&rsquo;m designing, developing, and integrating with the APIs across my world. Something which opens up the response and requests of API calls that I&rsquo;m making, giving me more insight into how things are actually working (or not).
<p>One of the <a href="https://www.postman.com/docs/collections">key aspects of Postman, are the collections</a>, which:
<blockquote><em>A collection lets you group individual requests together. These requests can be further organized into sub-collections/folders to completely mirror your API. Requests can also store variations and responses when saved in a collection. You can add metadata like name and description too so that all the information that a developer needs to use your API is available right where he(she) needs it. Collections are listed in the sidebar alphabetically. You can search through collection requests using the search form for quick access.</em></blockquote>
<p>To me, Postman Collections are <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> at the API transaction level. Allowing you to define a single unit of currency in the API economy, save, and organize them, and execute them at any point in your API lifecycle. Postman Collections measure not just an API transaction that happens, it is a measure of future transactions that can happen, complete with any relevant meta data that will be needed along the way.
<p>Along with <a href="https://bitly.com/1tnYxV8">Swagger</a>, and <a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/1arUHCU">API Blueprint</a>, I&rsquo;m working to better understand how Postman Collections impact, and fuel the API lifecycle, including conversations with Abhinav Asthana (<a href="https://twitter.com/a85">@a85</a>), Founder and CEO of Postman, about their roadmap. Postman Collections are not just about defining, organizing, and executing your API calls in the Postman client as a solo API developer, they are also about collaborating with other key players involved throughout the API lifecycle.
<p>I&rsquo;m setting up my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> as Postman Collections, to help me understand how I can use the format to improve my API own API workflows. My goal is to ensure Postman works seamless with all stops along my own API and micro service lifecycle, from design to evangelism, and is plug and play as a machine readable element of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.

<p><a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com/support">Dailymotion employs two very common building blocks for their platform support</a>, including an API specific Twitter handle, and good ol fashion email&mdash;both pretty proven approaches. However Dailymotion also employs a third aspect to thier API support, by recommending you head over to Stack Overflow for some community support.
<p>Using <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> in this way is not that original, I see numerous API providers doing this, the part I found interesting was their reference to getting Dailymotion API support via Stack Overflow as, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"ask the stack!"</span> I like that, I think it reflects what Stack Overflow is to the API developer community, and was an elegant way to send API developers off your site, to get the support they need.

<p>I was spending time profiling APIs late last night while putting back a couple of IPAs. Yes this is what I do on a Friday night, you have a problem with that? Anyways, I was crafting Swagger definitions for the <a href="http://developer.7digital.com/">7digital music APIs</a>, and the I came across <a href="http://developer.7digital.com/resources/api-docs/territories-api">their territories API</a>. "The Territories API serves data about countries that 7digital operates in, data about those counties, and a one or more languages with shop urls in each country&rdquo;, something that I could see being pretty useful to developers when building music apps on top of the platform.
<p>There has been numerous APIs I&rsquo;ve developed in the past, where the need for some supporting, utility APIs, such as a list of states, zip codes, counties, or other resources was called for. Two layers to doing this: 1) Acknowledging the little things developers need goes a long way in building trust with them, letting them know you actually care, and get what they are facing 2) You want devs to achieve integration as quickly as possible, provide them with the little things that they will have to go hunt for, and possibly prevent them from achieving their objectives. &mdash; Reduce any friction possible!
<p>I'd like to see an open source library of utility API design, complete with a variety of server side code, and data stores emerge, that help API providers deliver a more complete stacks of API resources. If you need a state / province API, or a language API, you could just grab one off the shelf and install it seamlessly into your API stack. This is just one of those little areas, that I think could be slowing the overall advancement of APis (just a wee bit), and with a little community effort, could really grease the wheels in API adoption, and fuel more meaningful integrations.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/07/a-breakdown-of-my-dream-apis-json-file/">A Breakdown Of My Dream APIs.json File</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm continuing my work, to help people understand what APIs.json is, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/three-ways-i-am-putting-apisjson-to-work/">varying ways that it can be put to use</a>.  My post the other week, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">breaking down Fitbits APIs.json file is a good example of where to get started</a>, and as a follow-up I wanted to help further set the bar for what a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">minimum viable APIs.json</a>&nbsp;looks like, and today, I am going in the other direction--toward my dream APis.json file.
<p>APIs.json starts with a basic set of descriptions for who you are, the API provider. Each header of an APIs.json file gives you a handful of parameters for describing who you are:
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - your individual or company name, who is managing the APIs.json file.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of your company and / or the API collection you are building.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes yourself or your company</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe your API collection.</li>
<li><strong>created</strong> - the first date in which an APIs.json file was created.</li>
<li><strong>modified</strong> - the last date in which an APIs.json file created.</li>
<li><strong>url</strong> - The url of where the APIs.json lives, allowing your file to be portable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those seven parameters provide details on who you are, and what the API collection is all about. Remember an API collection doesn&rsquo;t always have to live under a specific company domain like Twilio.com, it could be a temporary or more permanent collection, that is part of specific project or application.
<p>The next essential element of an APIs.json file, is the APIs collection, providing you the ability to describe one or many APIs as part of this collection. Similar to the parameters provided for the header, each API entry is allowed a handful of parameters that describe the API:
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - the name of the API.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of the value an API delivers.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes an API.</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe the API itself.</li>
<li><strong>humanURL</strong> - The url any human should visit to learn more about an API.</li>
<li><strong>baseURL</strong> - The base url any machine should follow to start using an API.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-gears-soft-round.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>Each API should have at least this information, at a minimum. I could stay here, with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">minimum viable APIs.json definition</a>, but I encourage you to take one more step, and put the properties collection to use for each API. You can provide any other URL you want for an APIs properties, but I recommend starting with the basic properties:
<ul>
<li><strong>TermsOfService</strong> - where do I find your terms of service page.</li>
<li><strong>StatusPage</strong> - where is the url of the status page, where I can get platform update.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - point me directly to where your pricing page is, so I can make a decision on price.</li>
<li><strong>Forums</strong> - where is the community forum located for a platform, even if this is Stack Overflow.</li>
<li><strong>AlertsTwitterHandle</strong> - what is the primary Twitter handle for the API itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are meant to satisfy the common needs of anyone learning about API operations, however they are just URLs meant for the human API consumer. In my dream APIs.json file, there will be a robust amount of machine readable properties available for each API, beginning with the two most important:
<ul>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> &nbsp;- a machine readable JSON or YAML file describing your API surface area</li>
<li><strong>Blueprint</strong> - a machine readable markdown file describing your API surface area</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with providing machine readable definitions of the API surface area, establishing a central truth or fingerprint for any API interface, it is just as important to provide a machine readable license for the API:
<ul>
<li><strong>InterfaceLicense</strong> - a machine readable pointer to the licensing for the API interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with making sure the interface of an API matches your application objectives, consumers need to understand the licensing restrictions, or the freedom that comes with deeply integrating an API resource into any system or app.
<p>Since I&rsquo;m talking about my dream APIs.json file, I&rsquo;m going to talk about two added property formats I&rsquo;m currently working on behind the scenes, adding to the stack of machine readable API definition formats..  These new areas, represent two areas I&rsquo;m working hard to define and understand, right after I hand-craft Swagger definitions for my APIs:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com/">API Pricing</a></strong> - taking pricing to the next level and making it machine readable.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">API Questions</a> </strong>- answering the important questions I need to know about each API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you imagine if API pricing was machine readable by default? Think of the options for building in a broker or market layer within the index of API platforms, and API collections, or even via an IDE. These two definitions are in an <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">alpha stage</a>, but are based upon data I've been gathering behind the scenes, so a lot of thought has gone into settling on these buckets.
<p>After that, I&rsquo;d say there are a handful custom properties I&rsquo;d like to see applied to each API indexed within an APIs.json:
<ul>
<li><strong>x-blog -</strong> where do I find your blog. (machine-readable below)</li>
<li><strong>x-blogrss - </strong>where can I just get an RSS of your blog stream.</li>
<li><strong>b-github -</strong> what is the primary Github account for the API.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-circuit-paths.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>That concludes my list of elements I&rsquo;d like to see available in my dream APIs.json file. You can see examples of this in action, with the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">700+ companies I've generated APIs.json files for, over at my API Stack Github repo</a>. There is a lot of work left to do, but this dream APIs.json file resembles a vision I have for the future of API discovery&mdash;which I see as the engine for the API economy.
<p>My goal is to get there I need the most important aspects of API operations machine readable. We aren't there yet, but I can see it. Taste it. Imagine what we can do when you can program against:
<ul>
<li><strong>Surface Area (Swagger, Blueprint)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blog (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Status (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forum (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Twitter (Twitter API)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Github (Github API)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pricing (api-pricing)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Licensing (API Commons)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Questions (api-questions)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I have been staying in tune with the API space using RSS feeds, and the Twitter and Github APIs for a couple years. I&rsquo;m just now developing a deeper understanding of the overall API space through the generation of machine readable API definitions for popular APIs. I can&rsquo;t do much on the API licensing front beyond launching <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, but I am working to define pricing with my <a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com">api-pricing</a> definition work, and also trying to capture the vital meta-data I need about API operations using <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com">api-questions</a>.
<p>This post ended up being longer than I anticipated, but it is helping me beter understand what some of the next steps are for not just APIs.json, but also my own monitoring of the space. My goal is to not just push forward the APIs.json definition, but push forward my understanding along the way. Who knows maybe I'll drag you along too! ;-)
<p>Ok, back to work. I just needed to wrap up these two posts about APis.json that were lingering in my outgoing story and idea queue.

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I had a conversation with some folks who are building a wikipedia of API definitions the other day, looking to employ formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to make an open, authoritative directory of machine readable API designs&mdash;something I can get behind 100%. I can even contribute the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">700+ APIs.json files, and the 250+ Swagger files I have generated</a>&nbsp;as part of my research.
<p>When I have discussions about APIs.json folks, I always find it helpful to summarize the vision we have for the API discovery format, and described it in a short, concise way. This time around I was able to clarify the vision, in a way I hadn&rsquo;t fully been able to articulate before. To help me remember what I said, I wanted to capture it here on the blog.Many people who have heard about APIs.json as a sitemap for your APIs, but in reality there are three distinct ways I'm putting APIs.json to work:
<ul>
<li><strong>Providing A Sitemap -</strong> This is the simplest approach to using API.json, is to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">create a simple index of the APIs that exist within a domain</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Defining API Collection -</strong> Defining a portable, machine readable collection of common, or disparate APIs, like I&rsquo;ve done with my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/making-sure-my-api-roundup-stories-are-machine-readable-by-designing-them-as-apisjson-collections/">SMS messaging API stack</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Establishing New Definitions - </strong>A place to define the next generation of API definitions that support Swagger, Blueprint, adding licensing layer with <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, or maybe pricing, and the ability to answer service related questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be easy to call APIs.json a sitemap for APIs, but it is much more. It has a lot of potential for defining API collections while also making them portable, and machine readable by default. Where I really get excited for the potential is when it comes to defining new definitions that can work in conjunction with existing definitions, like Swagger and API Blueprint.
<p>The last thing I want to leave you thinking about when it comes to APIs.json, is that it is designed to map out the world of public APIs we have, and the even larger layers of private APIs that exist behind the firewall, and make sense of this mess we&rsquo;ve created. Then with a rough blueprint, we can all work to define some new definition formats that help us bridge where we are currently at, to the next step of where we should be.
<p>In the near fture, I'm focused on educating API providers on how to use APIs.json as a sitemap, and help API evangelists, brokers, and tech bloggers understand the potential that arises when you define API collections using APIs.json. When it comes to establishing new definitions, I think this will take longer to play out. I&rsquo;m working to help folks understand the importance of licensing their API using API Commons, and I&rsquo;m also playing around with some alpha formats for identifying some of the common questions that arise around API operations, and how companies are monetizing their APIs, but there is a lot of work to be done before this bears fruit.

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-rolodex-card.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>When I come across a new company, during the course of my monitoring and information gathering across the API space, I enter them into my company API. Once a company is in there, and I&rsquo;ve deemed it worthy enough for a closer look, I profile their operations.
<p>For my own organization, and in the spirit of transparency and collaboration, I wanted to breakdown what I mean by profiling. First I start with the basics:
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - The official name for any company or project. APis aren&rsquo;t always clearly defined corporate entities.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A short, concise description of what a company does. You&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is.</li>
<li><strong>Logo</strong> - A clean, simple, medium resolution logo for company. Again, you&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I dive into the common URLs that I care about, that provide me with the best signals possible:
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - The heartbeat of any company, and API operations. In my opinion, the blog is one of the most important aspects of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Blog RSS</strong> - A simple, machine readable blog stream &mdash; blown away by how many companies don&rsquo;t have.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active, engaged Twitter account, providing me easy access via the Twitter API.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - A complete, active Github user or organization, where I can access code, and other aspects of API operations via Github API.</li>
<li><strong>Crunchbase</strong> - A business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Crunchable API.</li>
<li><strong>Angelist</strong> - Similar to Crunchbase a business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Angelist API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I tackle the API, or APIs, and profile each API they have by gathering:
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - A clean, portable name that describes the API, but keeps context of company or organization running it.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A short, concise description of what an API does &mdash; this is another pain in the ass to find most of the time.</li>
<li><strong>BaseURL</strong> - The base url for API calls. The process of finding this, will often determine for me, whether or not an API is worth monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - Doing the deep dive on an API, and generating a machine readable definition of at least the API surface area, and include underlying data model, and authentication when I can.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I sweep through the rest of the API program looking for:
<ul>
<li><strong>Management Building Blocks - </strong>Run through my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common API management building blocks</a>, and record if any are present.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication Building Blocks - </strong>Track what type of authentication is available for the API, including supporting building blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Definition -</strong> Profile how money is made around an API, even if their are indirect benefits when possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once done, I have everything I need to establish a robust profile of an API provider, and add them to my monitoring. To assist me in my profiling, I then generate an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a> for the company, providing a machine readable version of all the information I&rsquo;ve gathered in my profiling. This doesn&rsquo;t always happen all at once, the companies usually queue up, then I go through and do full profiles in controlled sprints.
<p>As with all of my research, y<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">ou can find the resulting APIs.son files on Github</a>, and as my monitoring continues, I will aggregate more companies doing interesting things with APIs, and as I have the time I will generate full profiles for each one.
<p>If there is a specific company you&rsquo;d like profiled, please let me know.

<p><em>I am giving each of my primary API research sites a refresh, and first up is the home page of my&nbsp;<a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery research</a>. As I update each home page, I'm going to publish here on API Evangelist to help bring more awareness to each of the main areas I'm studying.</em>
<p>This is one of my API research sites, focused specifically on API discovery. My name is <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, and I am the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a>, working as hard as I can to understand the world of the Application Programming Interfaces, widely called an API. This network of API research projects all run on Github, and is my real-time workbench, which means there is a lot of finished work present, but occasionally you will also come across areas projects that are unfinished--you have stumbled in my API discovery research, you will find the main <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist site over here</a>, with other links to my work.
<p>This site is where I publish news that I have read, stories I&rsquo;ve published, company I&rsquo;ve profiled, and valuable tools I&rsquo;m stumbled on across while researching API discovery. Finding APIs, and having your APIs found is a pretty significant pain point, and in the last ten years, little has been done to provide adequate solutions. API discovery is an area I've been monitoring, ultimately have been unsatisfied with what I've seen, I've take matters into my own hands, and created <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, a machine readable API discovery format, any API provider can use to describe their APIs.
<p>There are several API management companies, including Apigee, Mashery, and Mashape who have put forth API discovery solutions, and while these offerings are valuable, I feel they lack the openness necessary to truly move the API space, and the API discovery conversation forward. APIs.json was created to help make sense of the API space, in partnership with 3Scale API management infrastructure, CEO Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>). Together we are working to define as much of the public APIs space as possible using APIs.json, and encourage the development of open tooling around the format, with the first major addition being an open source API search engine called, <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>
<p>Next I am working with other providers like Socrata, WSO2, and others to develop additional tooling, to serve all levels of the API sector. I do not feel API discovery is something that simply happens via an <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">API directory like ProgrammableWeb</a>, or even via <a href="http://apis.io">API search engines like APIs.io</a>--in the future API discovery will also occur in the browser, via our IDEs, and seamlessly within modern clients. In 2015, you'll see many more APIs.json driven efforts to help alleviate API discovery pain, and we hope the format, and supporting open tooling will stimulate other complimentary, or even competing efforts. API discovery is long overdue for some investment by the community, helping us get past some of our PTSD of the SOA era--we can do it!
<p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">All my research is openly licensed CC-BY</a>, and is meant to help grow the awareness around healthy API discovery practices. I try to be as fair as I can when covering companies, individuals, and the tools they provide, but ultimately you will notice I have my favorites, and there are some areas I only touch on lightly, for a variety of personal reasons. I try to stay as neutral as I can when it comes to technological dogma, and company allegiance, but after almost five years, I have some pretty strong opinions, and can&rsquo;t help but try and steer, and influence things in my own unique way. ;-)

        <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2015</span>

<p>I was reviewing one of the many entries in my review queue of companies who are doing interesting things with APIs, and stumbled across the data visualization API&mdash;<a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">Lightning</a>. Their implementation grabs my attention on several fronts, but their focus on delivering their API within your own infrastructure via a Heroku button, is one of the most relevant aspects.
<p>This approach reflects a seismic shift occurring in how we deploy APIs, and how we deploy architecture overall.  You need a <a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">data visualization API</a>, let me deploy my API into your cloud, or on-premise infrastructure using popular approaches to virtualization&mdash;developers do not need to go to the API, the API will now come to you, and live within your existing infrastructure stack.
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/a-wholesale-onpremise-version-of-my-api-for-sale/">wholesale APIs a lot lately,</a> showcasing the<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/a-peek-at-the-future-with-white-label-apis/"> white label approach by some API providers</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/blog/">exploring within the evolution of my own infrastructure</a>, and as more savvy API providers jump in on this opportunity, you&rsquo;ll see more stories emerge trying to understand the shift going on. <a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">Lightning</a> is accomplishing this with Heroku, and their embeddable button, but companies who embrace a containerized micro-service centered approach to API deployment, will have a wide open playing field for buying and selling of the wholesale API driven technology being deployed across the emerging API economy.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/05/api-evangelist-call-thursday-summary-for-march-5th-2015/">API Evangelist Call Thursday Summary For March 5th, 2015</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-headset.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>I work to isolate all of my calls on Thursdays, leaving other days of the week to more asynchronous forms of communication, and deep dives into coding, research, and storytelling efforts. Last Thursday was interesting, but this weeks conversations has spurred me to summarize some of the conversations that occurred on this busy day. This isn't something I'll do every thursday, and not all conversations will make it in, but I figured it would help me process, as well as share some insight into the types of conversations I'm having being the scene.
<p>Here is a breakdown of the conversations I&rsquo;ve had today, anonymized to protect the lives of those involved:
<ul>
<li><strong>API Evangelist at Major Media Company </strong>- I usually dodge recruiter calls early on in the process, but this one got through because it came in as a referral from someone I knew. This was regarding a lead role at a major media company you all know, a position I&rsquo;m not interested in, but willing to help talk through what is next for companies who can&rsquo;t find the right person for the role of lead API Evangelist! </li>
<li><strong>Available API Deployment Resources -</strong> I&rsquo;ve had a lot of trouble finding competent resources for any stage of the API lifecycle, but when it comes to API deployment, it has been impossible to establish relationships development shops I can refer work to. I had a very promising conversation about scaling an existing team I&rsquo;ve work with to successfully deploy APIs at scale in the past, opening up the opportunities for a scalable resource I can tap for designing, developing, deploying, and even the ongoing management of API resources. #fingerscrossed</li>
<li><strong>Developing a Wikipedia for API Definitions -</strong> I&rsquo;m working hard to develop a public catalog of open API designs via <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> and the <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> using the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a> format, and I had an interesting conversation with a group that is working on the "Wikipedia for APIs", using machine readable formats like Swagger, and APIs.son. We'll see where this goes, but I&rsquo;m excited about the number of conversations I&rsquo;m having in the area of API discovery, and design. </li>
<li><strong>Containerized Micro-Service Orchestration - </strong>I've been immersed in my own version of micro-service orchestration, using Docker, but today I got a look into other approaches, helping me better understand the bigger picture, and how I can apply existing practices, and tooling to better orchestrate this new world I&rsquo;m creating. </li>
<li><strong>An APIs and IPAs Podcast -</strong> Three of my favorite letters, rearranged into a single podcast conversation. <a href="https://readme.io">Readme.io</a> has asked me to participate in a beer fueled conversation about the API space. Talk about being privileged, I couldn't think of a better career where I get to talk about publicly, what I do for a living, while drinking the best quality beer possible. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done the APIs and IPAs podcast yet, that is up next&mdash;so I need to get ready. I'll have to consider more about how my Thursday conversations compare with the other, asynchronous conversations I&rsquo;m having through the week. At first glance, they seem very similar, but as I continue to get into the groove having my phone conversations only on Thursdays, and do these summaries&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;ll begin to see other patterns emerge.
<p>Anyway you look at it, being in the center of the API economy is pretty exciting in 2015. I thought the buzz in 2010 was significant, but I had no idea of what it would be like in 2015. Lots going on, lots of important technological shifts, and lots of important industries, and companies turning their focus to the world of APIs. Sometimes it can make my head swim, but at the end of the day I&rsquo;m stoked to be where I am, as all of this moves forward--no matter how fast.

<p>This site is where I publish news that I have read, stories I&rsquo;ve published, company I&rsquo;ve profiled, and valuable tools I&rsquo;m stumbled on across while researching API design space. I&rsquo;m in the middle of carving off a couple individual projects from this API design research including <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/">hypermedia</a>, and a soon API definition specific projects. As with my other research projects, there can be a great deal of overlap with other projects, when it comes to defining exactly what is API design. This research isn&rsquo;t about being complete, or finished, it is about maintaining a liquid understanding of what API design is, and be as comprehensive as a one man operation can be.
<p>I execute on my API research by focusing in on specific areas like API design, getting to work understanding who the key actors are, which may include individual personalities, or corporate, government, or institutional entities. I profile each actor, and establish monitoring streams using Github, Twitter, RSS, Stack Exchange, and any other relevant channels. Throughout my monitoring I keep an eye out for interesting articles, white papers, announcements, and tooling that contribute to, and expands upon my definition of what is API design.
<p>The more I research an area like API design, the more I&rsquo;m able to identify common building blocks, that make up the space. For API design, this can be as fundamental as API definitions, or as specific as publishing and sharing interactive documentation. My interpretation of these building blocks change over time, and sometimes I will link up these building blocks with other research projects, or spin off as independent projects, allowing me to dive even deeper&mdash;for example, Swagger began as a building block on API management, and is now its own research area entirely.

<p>Making a list of valuable APIs has been a staple of my tech blogging for 10 years now, and as I work to find even more meaningful ways of defining the API space, I&rsquo;m pushing the envelope on how I do API roundup stories. Instead of just finding a handful of valuable APIs, and providing an HTML list of them, I'm going to use <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, to make sure all of my collections are machine readable by default.
<p>For each API I profile, it is valuable to have a nice logo, name, short description, and a link to the developer portal. However I want to also make sure other valuable, machine readable resources are also present like Twitter, Github, and Blog RSS. This is just the start, I want each API to also have a machine readable API definition using Swagger and API Blueprint as well--all indexed using an APIs.json file.
<p>I&rsquo;m using APIs.json in two ways, as an index for each API, as well as an index for the overall collection I&rsquo;m building--you will find the overall collection using the big {A} below, and each API has its own little {A}. To show you this in action, here is an <a href="http://sms.apievangelist.com/">SMS API collection</a> I've built:

You can use the APIs.json to further pull activity for each API using the Twitter and Github APIs, as well as via RSS. You can also programmatically evaluate, compare, and generate client-side code, documentation, testing, monitoring, and other essential elements using the machine readable Swagger definitions I&rsquo;ve included.
<p>In the future, each time I post a roundup of APIs blog post, I will publish the list of APIs, using this APIs.json approach. There is a lot of work still to be done in, identifying, and indexing APIs in this format, as well as clarifying more detail about each API, like underlying data models, authentication, and pricing, but having a standard approach is a damn a good start.  This is the standard format I will be using for all my API Stack profiling--<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">you can find a complete list of APIs.json files, and Swagger definitions over on the Github repository for the work</a>.
<p>As soon as I finish my API Blueprint tooling, I will also be providing each API in the API Blueprint format, as well as in Swagger, offering some variety, when it comes to understanding the surface area for each API. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/looking-beyond-the-number-of-apis-or-just-new-apis-and-working-harder-to-find-only-the-most-important-apis/">Instead of tracking on the number of APIs across the industry</a>, I&rsquo;m going to be tracking on the number of APIs that are fully defined, using APIs.json, providing full access to each API operations, as well as providing machine readable API definitions in Swagger and API Blueprint.

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-building-blocks-design.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I am adding four new building blocks, to my list of suggested <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that API providers should consider when crafting their API management strategy</a>. These four building blocks, are based upon several things I&rsquo;ve seen in the space, and how some current deficiencies I&rsquo;ve identified that could slow things, and hold us back.
<p>These new building blocks are all about API providers practicing what they preach, and making the account for API consumers, and developers, programmatic through an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">API management API</span>. As I was profiling the <a href="http://dev.mailjet.com/email-api/v3/metadata/">Maijet API</a> as part of my <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">email API research</a>, I noticed <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">they had an API for their developer accounts</a>, and with the growth in the number of APIs being consumed, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">the need for account automation is only going to incease</a>, something that is only getting even more critical when you think about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/api-management-infrastructure-and-service-composition-is-key-to-orchestration-with-microservices-in-a-containerized-world/">API service composition overhead needed to support the containerization and micro-services movement.</a> To help stimulate this area, and encourage API providers to automate their API accounts, I&rsquo;m adding these four separate APIs building blocks, providing an overall blueprint for how API providers can launch a developer account API for their own API.
<p>I used Mailjet&rsquo;s approach as a base model, but quickly began looking at <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">3Scale own API design</a>. 1) I use 3Scale, so I&rsquo;m familiar with their approach to user management 2) Their API was simple, robust, and clearly a proven approach that was working.  I broke 3Scale&rsquo;s own endpoints down into four logical groups for v1 of this API management API blueprint. There were a number of features they had, that I wanted in there, but figured it was better to start out simple, and meet most of the common needs I'm seeing from my own experiences.
<p>Here is what I came up with, after taking a look at 3Scale&rsquo;s active docs.
<p><strong>API Management API - User Management<br /></strong>Allow API API consumers to manage their own accounts via an API management API, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete information associated with their account--fields may vary, depending on what information each API requires for user accounts.
<ul>
<li>User Create</li>
<li>User Read</li>
<li>User Update</li>
<li>User Delete</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Management API - Account Management</strong><br />Beyond the user profile, allow API consumers to manage the billing related account information, enable the programmatic adjustment of credit cards, and being able to check in on invoices, and payments through the API management API.
<ul>
<li>Account Set Credit Card</li>
<li>Account Delete Credit Card</li>
<li>Invoice By Account</li>
<li>Invoice Line Item List</li>
<li>Invoice Payment Transaction List</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Management API - Service Management</strong><br />Enable API consumers to retrieve information about plans available for a specific API, or stack of APIs. Allow for listing of plans, and the features available for each plan. Also recommend considering the ability to set default plan for an account, enabling smooth application management.
<ul>
<li>Service Plan List</li>
<li>Service Plan Feature List</li>
<li>Service Plan Set To Default</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Management API - Application Management</strong><br />Ideally each user can have multiple applications, consuming API resources at various rates. This allows for the most flexibility in API consumption, but may vary depending on what API management infrastructure employed. This API should allow for management of all applications, with secure control over application keys. Additionally, there should be analytics available, with a short, simple, but robust list of metrics.
<ul>
<li>Application Plan List (per isolated service)</li>
<li>Application List</li>
<li>Application Create</li>
<li>Application Read</li>
<li>Application Update</li>
<li>Application Change Plan</li>
<li>Application Key List</li>
<li>Application Key Create</li>
<li>Application Key Delete</li>
<li>Application Usage by Metric</li>
</ul>
<p>This represents the v1 stack I&rsquo;d like to see every API provider offer, as well for my own portable stack of API management APIs. I don't just want my core APIs to have these features, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/making-my-3scale-api-management-portable-with-a-containerized-microservices/">I want every wholesale API I deploy in other companies infrastructure to be equipped with the same basic stack</a>. I can add in more features later, but I think this represents the minimum viable stack for automating API consumption at this point.
<p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll build a docker image for deploying this API management infrastructure, alongside other APIs as a single virtual stack of loosely coupled micro-services, when bundled with the service composition 3Scale affords me, it will give me an unprecedented ability to orchestrate my API infrastructure.  Hopefully it can also provide a blueprint for others to use, and evolve beyond what I can do on my own.
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner.</em>

<p>I had the pleasure of finally meeting someone in person, that I feel like I&rsquo;ve known for years, while I was over in Australia, for <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days Sydney</a>&mdash;Keran McKenzie (<a href="https://twitter.com/keranm">@keranm</a>), API Evangelist for <a href="http://developer.myob.com/">MYOBapi</a>. I got to drink, and talk with Keran (finally), but more importantly I got to listen to him talk about his approach to evangelism at the accounting API.
<p>I have given, and listened to more talks on evangelism and advocacy than I care to remember. I always work hard to make sure I sit and list to as many evangelism talks as I can&mdash;there is always something to learn. Keran's talk was informative, thorough, and most importantly it was genuine. Keran discussed many of the proven areas of evangelism we all share, but not in a robotic or corporate way, he shared his, and MYOB&rsquo;s philosophy, and told the honest story about the challenges and triumphs.
<p>Keran gives an energetic talk, but it wasn&rsquo;t just the high energy that sold it for me, it was demonstrating that he actually gives a shit about how to do it right, admitting he doesn&rsquo;t know everything, or nails it in all categories, and he gives an honest, friendly, approachable, and genuine story of what is API evangelism at MYOB.
<p>This approach to API evangelism is critical to success. You won&rsquo;t last long as an evangelist if you are full of shit, or the company behind you is, sorry&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been in this position too many times. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, every API evangelist role is difficult, and full of compromises, challenges, and things that are out of your control&mdash;even in my world. In the end, the only thing you can do is be honest, genuine, and as transparent as you can, and never be afraid to tell you story like Keran does.

        <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/press-release.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I spend a lot of time wading through press releases at the number of the dominate aggregate news outlets, looking for API news. I also have a number of scripts running, keeping an automated eye on the press sections for some of the companies I track on. The number of press releases available in corporate press areas vs. the number of press releases submitted by PR outlets, is much larger--which is a missed opportunity in my book.
<p>Each day I look through PRWeb, PR Newswire, Business Wire and others trying to find the latest API stories. This is a process that will always be partially a manual process, as you just can&rsquo;t look for API news without getting petroleum, education, pharmaceutical, and other API news&mdash;which has nothing to with my beloved application programming interface. In short, these sites suck. Their UI is crap, and their search mechanisms are shit.&nbsp;
<p>The biggest problem with these news outlets do not usually even have RSS, let alone an API, requiring me to go to each site, each day, and sift through the search results.  The world of press releases is like many other industries I engage with&mdash;needs a dead simple API driven solution. I want a press release API that allows any company to submit for free, but the problem is nobody will in the beginning, so it also needs to go out and find the direct corporate press sources as well, and scrape this long tail of the PR world.
<p>I&rsquo;d pay a monthly fee to be able to search this vast PR database via an API, and be able to integrate directly into my API monitoring system. It is something I could build, but I just do not have time, and as I do with my other ideas, I am putting out there for someone else to do. The API would be a very simple design, but the legwork to make it truly a rich, and valuable source of press, would take a significant amount of time.
<p>This is one of the ideas I hope someone does not do, thinking it is a VC level start-up idea. It really is something that a handful of folks could bootstrap, and do very well in monetizing premium services, but if you go get VC money you will probably fuck it all up, and have to chase some unnecessary approaches to making money. If someone doesn&rsquo;t do soon, I&rsquo;m going to have to build an API focused version, because I am spending about 1-2 hours a day on this each day.

        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm just getting started exploring the ways to use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;when it comes organize my new Docker fueled, micro services stack. I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/use-apisjson-to-organize-my-swagger-defined-apis-running-in-docker-containers/">using APIs.son to describe each micro service</a>, as well as define the overall collection of almost 20 micro services. I&rsquo;m using the include collection, as a <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery/">navigation for the loosely coupled stack of micro-services</a>, and my friend <span>Chris Spiliotopoulos (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/chefarchitect">@chefarchitect</a><span>)</span>, has done some more work with <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed">his Swagger.ed</a>, delivering some <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> goodness that is in alignment with where I want to take all of this.
<p>Adding to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">discovery and visualization work he did for Swagger</a>, Chris enabled Swagger.ed to look for valid APIs.son files as well, so when you browse to any APIs.son, like the one I have for my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master">micro services stack</a>, you see the little APIs.son search icon in the address bar.
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/apis.json"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-json-in-browser.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a>
<p>When you click on the APIs.son search icon in the address bar, you get a very cool visualization. Its pretty basic at the moment, just a visual catalog of the APIs available in the include collection of my stack, but when you connect up with the Swagger visualization work he's already done, we could have a pretty cool API catalog for managing and exploring microservices.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-catalog.png" alt="" width="90%" />
<p>I have almost 20 micro-services listed, and Swagger.ed gives me the ability to navigate it in a very interactive way.  Whats next? We don&rsquo;t know&hellip;it is about exploration, and finding out the most meaningful way of exploring the APIs I deploy and aggregate into APIs.son collections.
<p>I can see having a visual catalog of all of my API design that I collect, then deploy, and evolve them as needed for various parts of my infrastructure or for my clients, into other sub-collections? Disconnected collections? Loosely coupled collections? Not sure how tight I want things, part of <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/how-much-api-surface-area-before-it-stops-being-micro/">the micro service definition for me</a> is the size of the network connecting the services, as well as the services theselves.

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/03/significance-of-the-we-the-people-api-being-first-modern-read--write-web-api-in-government/">A topic I've written about before</a>, and one that I answer regularly on forums, via email, and on Twitter is, &ldquo;Are there any write APIs in the federal government?&rdquo; It is a valid question, and as I said in my <a href="http://govfresh.com/2014/01/next-us-government-api-strategy/">strategy suggestions for the federal government,</a> write APIs are a critical aspect of all of this moving forward in a healthy way.
<p>Rebecca Williams (<a href="https://twitter.com/internetrebecca">@internetrebecca</a>) pointed me to a <a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/4466/are-there-good-examples-of-open-read-write-apis-in-federal-government">recent discussion on this topic</a> earlier today, to which I added a couple of suggestions, but ultimately it is something I would like to see a more progressive solution emerge, something that can answer it real-time, and change as the API inventory in the federal government changes and evolves. Keeping a list, <a href="https://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/write_apis-notes">like 18F is doing</a>, is a start, but we need more.
<p>One of the side projects that I work on a couple of hours each week, is the profiling of federal government APIs using APIs.json, and Swagger, for use in my <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/stack.html">federal API stack</a>. I only have a handful of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">120+ APIs that I&rsquo;m profiling</a> completed, but once done, you will be able to search for APIs based upon whether or not an API uses the verbs GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE&mdash;giving you a much more detailed picture of how government APIs function.
<p>Generating machine readable API definitions in Swagger and API Blueprint are time consuming, but once you tie it together using a discovery format like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, it opens up a lot more opportunity to answer questions about government APIs. I&rsquo;m doing a lot of the heavy lifting currently, to establish a critical mass of API definitions in federal government, then I am hoping that each agency will take ownership over maintaining their own definitions--if not, I think it can just as easily be done from the outside-in, by the community.
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for the potential, when all of the meta-layer of APIs and open data in government is rich, well defined, and machine readable by default. The continuing data.json work out of the government, and our own APIs.json format is looking to help with this over time. There is a lot of work ahead, as well as education to occur, before the meta data layer for government APIs is machine readable by default, but once it is, we&rsquo;ll be able to answer questions like this in a much more efficient way.

<p>I had the pleasure of attending a gathering at <a href="http://www.heavybit.com/">Heavybit Industries</a>&nbsp;last week, a community for developer-focused entrepreneurs, where one of the headlining speakers was Nike CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrissatchell">Chris Satchel</a>l. I wish I had taken better notes, but the one thing that stuck with me from his talk was his story about moving beyond their love affair with almost any software vendor that came along, and diligentlywork towards a micro-service oriented environment.
<p>As the CTO, Satchell was working to clean up the message of legacy applications used across the enterprise, which was the result of years of, as he put it, saying yes to almost any software vendor that came along. Music to the ears of the San Francisco audience, he was now working to move the company out of a single data center, into the cloud, redefining operations as micro-services, and instituting a devops mindset along the way. They are a long way away from achieving their goal, but I found the change in their mindset about how they acquire software, was extremely relevant to all the API talk in 2015.
<p>While i&rsquo;m sure there will still be plenty of opportunities for old school software vendors to hock their wares, I think this was a pretty clear sign of the API-centric approach that is changing not just how we develop and deploy software, but also how we buy software. If you are looking to sell software solutions to the enterprise in the future, you are going to need more than just yesterdays software, and a sales team&mdash;you are going to need the most agile, flexible, stack of micro-services possible, and let companies choose exactly the resources that they need.

        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-gears.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>This post has been open for almost two weeks now in Evernote. It began as a simple story about the possibility for generating code samples and libraries using Swagger. The longer it stays open, the wider the definition becomes, so I have to post something, just to draw a line in the sand. I&rsquo;m not talking about generating code that runs on the server, this post is all about everything on the API consumption side of things.
<p>Shortly after Wordnik launched the machine readable API definition format&nbsp;<a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, they launched a <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">library for generating client side code samples in a variety of languages</a>. This was something that was evolved upon by <a href="https://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, with the launch of their API design platform, and introduction of <a href="https://bit.ly/1arUHCU">API Blueprint</a>. Even with these advances forward, there were still many shortcomings, and debate around what you could actually auto-generate on the client-side using a machine readable API definition continued. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many random Tweets I get from people saying, &ldquo;Oh is auto-generation of code cool again?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I thought you couldn&rsquo;t auto-generate client code or SDKs ;-)"
<p>Amidst the debate about what is really possible, and the jokes about our SOA past, new players have emerged like <a href="https://bit.ly/1qnXcI0">Apimatic</a> that are looking to raise the bar when it comes to generation of not just simple code samples, libraries or stubs, but sophisticated API SDKs. I am sure the jokes about automating client code will still occurs, but there is no denying that the overall conversation is moving forward.
<p>As I&rsquo;m exploring my own limitations of what is possible when generating client-side code with Swagger, I also come across new players like <a href="https://bit.ly/1DwAaXo">Lucybot</a>, who are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/24/driving-your-single-page-applications-and-api-cookbooks-using-api-definition-formats-like-swagger-and-api-blueprint/">moving the conversation forward with API cookbooks, and Single Page App (SPA) generated from Swagger definitions</a>. I&rsquo;m not in denial that there is a lot of work ahead, but in the two weeks that I&rsquo;ve been crafting this post, I&rsquo;d say I have gotten a glimpse of what is next. When you bundle the latest movements in virtualization and containerization, and using API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint to auto-generate client side code, I feel like the current potential is unlimited, and things are just heating up.

<p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">talking about the possibilities around wholesale APIs for a while now</a>, something that is only going to become more prevalent with the popularity of micro services and containers. I thought <a href="http://www.rechargkit.com/white-label-api">this company's approach to white label APIs</a> was pretty basic, but worth showcasing, providing a glimpse of what is possible when you are talking about B2B APIs.
<p>Recharge kit provides 15 separate APIs for wholesale usage. I thought it was a telco stack of APIs when I first landed, but it is an interesting mix of telco, utility, travel, and more. I predict companies will emerge with a much more nuanced stacks of micro-services than Recharge Kit, but their approach shows some of the thinking occuring in the space.
<p>As part of the Recharge Kit white label package you also get a handful of API management tools, ranging from user management, and advertising, to billing, and support. The overall presentation is not that professional, but a lot of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">essential API management building blocks</a> are present.&nbsp;
<p><a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/making-my-3scale-api-management-portable-with-a-containerized-microservices/">Delivering API management resources in this portable, and flexible way is reflected in my recent exploration with my 3Scale API management infrastructure on Alpha API Evangelist</a>. I'm looking to understand how not to just manage my B2D or B2C API consumption, but also allow me to deliver on a new wholesale side of my operations. Wholesale APIs deployed as micro services via Docker containers adds a whole new dimension to API management, opening up more B2B, wholesale, and white label API opportunities like this.

<p>The <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist network</a> is my open workbench, and I understand for many, it can be confusing to see some of my half-baked ideas alongside some of my more hardened API 101, business of APIs, and politics of APIs work. I try to keep the API Evangelist blog containing information for the API newbie, as well as my more advanced API leader crew--something that is tough to do.
<p>I have a lot of ideas coming off the assembly line around my own infrastructure, Docker, microservices, and other more forward leaning areas. Normally I dump a lot of this mundane exhaust from my world over on <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, but that site gets picked up by DZone, due to historical connections, and that audience is pretty trollish, second only to Hacker News. I'm not looking to get into petty fights over choice I made around my own infrastructure.
<p>To support my newer ideas, I launched&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">Alpha API Evangelist</a>, which will act as a kind of staging ground for many of the ideas you may eventually see here on API Evangelist. I do not want to alienate my just getting going audience, with rants about Docker and microservice orchestration, and I definitely do not want some of my unproven thoughts to getting taken out of context alongside some of my rants around important API topics in the business and politics of APIs.
<p>I know some of you are like WTF, another blog, you are diluting your brand, blah blah. If you saw the API Evangelist Network like I do, as this open workshop for API research, and storytelling, you&rsquo;d understand. Anyhoo&hellip;.long story short&hellip;90% of the Docker, microservices, orchestration, Github API blah blah blah, is now over at <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">alpha.apievangelist.com</a>.

        <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/lucybot/lucybot-full-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" />
<p>During my monitoring of the API space this last week I had one of those rare discoveries, amongst thousands of misses, and around a hundred slightly interesting nuggets, a simple move forward called <a href="https://lucybot.com/">Lucybot</a> emerges.&nbsp;
<p>I want to walk you through what I experienced as I had the tab open in my Chrome browser for the last week, in Lucybot's own words:
<blockquote><em>LucyBot is a tool for on-boarding new API developers, and is meant to be used alongside traditional API documentation such as Swagger and I/O Docs.</em></blockquote>
<p>I really like this sentence when they start talking about generating API cookbooks:
<blockquote><em>LucyBot generates cross-language cookbooks for any REST API. Design step-by-step walk-throughs for any use case, and LucyBot will provide cross-language code snippets, which expand into a working, visually-rich demo.</em></blockquote>
<p>Now you are talking my language. Swagger on Github is a powerful combo:
<blockquote><em>LucyBot can also push the code to GitHub, where users are free to build it out further, e.g. by pulling in data from their own servers or other APIs.</em></blockquote>
<p>Add some <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> to the mix, and now you have some serious API coverage. It can be difficult to understand the vision behind a new API driven start-up&mdash;I look at quite a few new companies. To help move the process forward, let&rsquo;s start with the basics of what is significant about Lucynbot&rsquo;s perspective n API. There are two things that stand out for me:
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning About APIs - </strong>Lucybot takes an API definition like Swagger, and turns it into an interactive walk-through for on-boarding with an API. Think Swagger UI, but more interactive walk-through than interactive documentation--now add in a little Swagger driven <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> to help you authenticate, and navigate the request and response of each API. #Boom</li>
<li><strong>API Driven Clients -</strong> Lucybot isn't just generating interactive documentation or walk-throughs, they are generating a single page application (SPA). Another move forward in how we learn about valuable API driven resources, how we on-board them, and how we engage with them, all in a single, fluid, API definition driven motion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to admit, after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">exploring my thoughts around API visualization using Swagger from Chris,</a> and seeing what is possible in generating &ldquo;API Cookbooks&rdquo;, and Single Page Apps (SPA), with Lucybot, I&rsquo;m about to go into cardiac failure from the movement in the space over the last week. I&rsquo;m excited about what Lucybot brings to the table. I haven&rsquo;t even used their offering, but I can see the potential, and when you line up with the other movement in the API definition world around visualization, and the <a href="https://blog.apiary.io/2015/02/17/Utilising-API-Blueprint-in-API-Clients/">addition of hypermedia using API Blueprint</a>, I can begin to see some of one possible future I&rsquo;ve been imagining for the API Economy.
<p>I am excited to see what Lucybot can deliver when it comes to cookbooks and SPAs. If they can deliver on the vision they are bringing to the table, it could further move the overall client and integration side of the API conversation forward pretty significantly. I&rsquo;m seeing many of the important elements of delivering API and microservices coming together in 2015, and <a href="https://lucybot.com/">Lucybot</a> reflects this. Adding yet another bonus incentive for creating machine readable API definitions using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> to the API game.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/scaling-what-i-do-at-api-evangelist/">Scaling What I Do At API Evangelist</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-scale.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>In my day to day operations, I get regular calls from VC's (Venture Capitalists) looking to better understand APIs, the role they are playing within specific industries, working towards a better awareness of how they will impact their portfolio. These conversations almost always end with the question, <em>"what can I do for you?"</em>, something that always leads to the next question,<em> "what does scale look like for API Evangelist?"</em>. A verty interesting set of questions...
<p>Interestingly, the answers to these questions are directly related to another common question I get from people in the space, <em>"how do you make money?"</em>. I'm fortunate. I get to scale API Evangelist exactly as I see fit, because I get to choose who I take money from. All money has strings attached, and I want to make sure these strings lead me in positive directions, and never hold me back, or force me to make decisions that would be negative for the API space. This is something that is much easier to do in 2015, than it was in 2010, when I first started API Evangelist.
<p>This leads me to yet another question I get from people, <em>&ldquo;how do I do what you do?&rdquo;</em>. A question which I do not have a good answer for. Honestly I do not fully understand how I got here, and not sure folks can deal with being as broke as I&rsquo;ve been over the last five years, something that only recently has changed with the support of my partners, <a href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://ws02.com">WSO2</a>, and <a href="http://restlet.org">Restlet</a>. I did not set out to build API Evangelist using a single plan, I&rsquo;m making this shit up as I go along, and honestly I do not remember all the decisions I&rsquo;ve made over the last five years, resulting in my current position.
<p>So why am I rambling on about this? Because it brings home what scale actually means to me at API Evangelist. There is no scaling API Evangelist in a Silicon Valley VC sense. It isn&rsquo;t something you can throw money at, come up with an algorithm, and grow. I&rsquo;m obsessed with the API space, and the potential (good &amp; bad) of APIs, which motivates me to read, hack, and tell stories that share my experiences&mdash;that is it. The only way to scale that is to incite others to embark on similar journeys, share the stories I&rsquo;m telling, fork my code and projects, and hopefully begin developing their own stories, and tools, so that I can depend on them, in the same way.
<p>I get a lot of people who engage me daily, and most of them want something from me. Some of these folks are on their own true API journey, sometimes running parallel to mine, but often times they are not, or maybe they are for just a short period of time. I just wrote about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">being Swagger.ed Last Week, and Now I&rsquo;m Seeing Visualizations</a>, showcasing Swagger driven API visualization work by Chris Spiliotopoulos (<a href="https://twitter.com/chefArchitect">@chefArchitect</a>), who fits into this story, because he is what I envision when it comes to scaling API Evangelist.
<p>Chris has been in the shadows, reading my work, listening to my ideas, and internalizing them in his own world, then he works to find something he can contribute that doesn&rsquo;t just augment my own ideas and work, but advances them forward, potentially delivering value for the entire API space. Chris doesn&rsquo;t need anything from me. He is looking to find his own way, and add value in a way that matches his own skills, wherever he can, in a way that amplifies the overall value generated. I wish I could explain this type of scaling to everyone, but hopefully the handful of folks who actually get what I am rambling about, will step in an help me scale the API Evangelist network over the next five years--thanks Chris!

        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apiblueprint-swagger.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about this topic before, in an effort to understand the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">possible incentives for API providers to generate their own machine readable API definitions</a> in formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>. These machine readable definitions for APIs and microservices are important to have, but not everyone produces them by default for their APIs, and honestly nobody is going to create them until there are enough incentives to sweeten the pot.
<p>It helps me to walk through this story again, understand the incentives for generating API definitions to date, in hopes of better understanding where we are going. Early on Wordnik developed <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, to generate:
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation -</strong> Making learning about an API, a hands-on experience, accelerating time to first API call.</li>
<li><strong>Generate Server-Side Code -</strong> Automatic generation of server side skeletons that take out much of the repetitive work of API deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Generate Client-Side Code -</strong> Automatic generation of client side code samples, and libraries, making API integration a much quicker process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then <a href="https://apiary.io/">Apiary</a> came along and moved the needle back, making API definitions more about API design than just API management and integration, with the introduction of <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, with:
<ul>
<li><strong>API Design Editor -</strong> Apiary introduced the concept of API definitions and API design, with their introduction of their cloud-based API design tooling.</li>
<li><strong>Mock API Generation -</strong> API definitions aren&rsquo;t just for managing API deployment anymore, you can mock APIs, saving costly development cycles, early on in the life cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we are seeing other providers like <a href="https://apimatic.io/">Apimatic</a>, <a href="http://ardoq.com/">Ardoq</a>, and others step up to continue expanding what you can do with machine readable API definitions. I wanted to take a moment to brainstorm everything I am seeing, and would like to see emerge along the API life cycle, that could be driven by Swagger and API Blueprint API definitions.
<ul>
<li><strong>SDK Generation -</strong> Going beyond auto-generation of simple samples and libraries, and generating full SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong> - Allowing the visualization of not just API metadata, but also the resources available within.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong> - Understanding more about what an API does, evaluating the interface, and resources available within.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Allowing the automatic deployment and scheduling of API tests, based upon the defined surface area.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Enable automatic generation and scheduling of API monitoring, based upon the defined surface area.</li>
<li><strong>Difference</strong> - Comparing two or more API definitions, and providing more insight into the differences present.</li>
<li><strong>Annotation</strong> - Opening up an annotation and communication layer around an APIs surface area, on any site or network.</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary</strong> - Helping organize, and bring coherence to the language involved with crafting an API surface, as well as existing APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Client Generation -</strong> Allowing the auto-generation of more sophisticated client, single page app, and other interfaces for API consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Search Discovery - </strong>Taking API discovery to the next level, allowing for searching across an APIs surface area, as well as other supporting building blocks, using formats like APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>Collection Discovery -</strong> Allowing for controlled API discovery in curated API collections, using formats like APIs.json to build collections. </li>
<li><strong>IDE Discovery -</strong> Introducing API discovery directly in the IDE, using cloud platforms like Codenvy to bring APIs to developers, instead of requiring developers to find the APIs they need.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time - </strong>Marry the real-time work occurring from providers like Firebase, PubNub, and Fanout with the API definition layer.</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocity -</strong> Expose the integration, interoperability, and automation layers like IFTTT and Zapier that we are depending on as machine readable API definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregation -</strong> Allow for the bridging, and daisy chaining of machine readable API definitions, aggregating many APIs into single, common, machine readable definitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a brain dump, of of possible ideas that could be developed and generated using machine readable API definitions. Some of it represents patterns I&rsquo;m already seeing, while some of it represents existing API driven areas, that haven&rsquo;t been touched by API definitions, but should be (aka opportunity). Swagger and API Blueprint provide a common language for communicating around the central truth that is the API definition, and the more tooling that is developed around these common language, the more incentives there are for API providers and consumers to use them.
<p>I believe we are reaching a tipping point with the tooling that already exists. Interactive documentation, and client and server side code generation is already proving to be enough of an incentive for many, but if you bring in the API design benefits from platforms like Apiary and <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, the  search discovery benefit introduced by <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and <a href="http://apis.io">Apis.io</a>, the IDE discovery brought to the table by <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>, and visualization tools I&rsquo;m seeing from Ardok, and now Swagger.ed&mdash;things really look like they are tipping. Now I am looking to organize the current tools that are available, and better educate API providers and consumers that they exist, while also looking to stimulate the next wave of API lifecycle tooling that is driven by&nbsp;API definitions.
<p>API Blueprint <a href="https://blog.apiary.io/2015/02/17/Utilising-API-Blueprint-in-API-Clients/">recently took a big step forward by embracing hypermedia</a>, bringing actions into the API definition layer. In my opinion, all of this tooling is beginning to go beyond just the API meta layer, and permeating potentially every aspect of the API life cycle, and beginning to add more value to the data, content, and other digital resources being made available via APIs. The big picture benefits of API definitions are really coming into focus for me, but there is still so much work to be done, when it comes to properly defining the current API landscape, let alone keeping eye on what is just over the horizon.

        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-ruler-2.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I constantly struggle to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/21/weekly-apireport-for-february-20th-2015/">stay in tune with the scope of the API space, and keep pace with its rapid expansion</a>. As part of this struggle,&nbsp;I am always on the hunt for new ways to shift the way I look at the space&mdash;as long as it helps me understand things better, while also contributing as much valuable, and open information back to the API space. The With this in mind, the API Evangelist monitoring algorithm is always in flux, with the latest change being the elimination of the <em>&ldquo;number of APIs&rdquo; </em>or <em>&ldquo;number of new APIs&rdquo;</em>, from the monitoring equation.
<p>I have showcased the growth in public APIs for a long time now, and for a while, it was what I needed to motivate my research and storytelling, but after almost five years, these two data points are becoming a liability for me. As I go through the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies that are doing interesting things in the space</a>, and generate <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">APIs.json profiles, and machine readable API definitions using Swagger and API Blueprint</a>, I realize quantity or number of APIs has no bearing on my research, and it is just a distraction. Any number of APIs is meaningless if I cannot understand what these APIs do, their pricing, quality of service, terms of these services, and easily match with my own business objectives&mdash;elements I&rsquo;m working hard to define, and quantify in a machine readable way using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.
<p>In the everyday reality of the API space, there is no reason for me care about how many APIs there are, a goal that comes bundled with the desire to chase new APIs, in support of this metric. Sure I want to be informed about new, and interesting APIs that come into the space, but chasing them in the support of some data point, that actually has no bearing on my research, is a waste of my time.  When you couple this with my struggles to keep up with &ldquo;dark APIs&rdquo;, the APIs that are driving mobile applications, and the dizzying number of private APIs that startups, up to the enterprise, are deploying&mdash;it is game over, I just don&rsquo;t think you can quantify it (or at least I&rsquo;m not the guy to do it).
<p>To better help me understand these data points, I asked Jakub Nesetril (<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>) the CEO of <a href="https://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>, where their numbers are&mdash;how many APIs are lit up on the <a href="https://apiary.io/">API design and collaboration platform</a>? He said, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>"It has crossed 130,000 APIs a couple weeks ago&rdquo;</em></span>. I&rsquo;m sure I can get similar counts from other API providers, but ultimately it doesn&rsquo;t do anything for me. what then? More APIs doesn&rsquo;t do API Evangelist any good. Being able to find the most valuable, and interesting APIs, is what I&rsquo;m looking for. I&rsquo;m driven to find stories of successful and interesting APIs, to evolve my API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">monetization</a>, and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a> strategy and storytelling&mdash;there are only so many APIs I can look at. I'm looking for the interesting conversations going on around the most important APIs, that platforms like Apiary are powering.
<p>Until an API provider does something interesting, or someone does something interesting with an API, that API doesn&rsquo;t exist to me-there is no reason for me to chase any API, until it stands out in one of these ways. However, this is just my perspective, in relationship to my own goals. However, where it begins to apply more universally, and provides something that I think API consumers could walk away with, is that an API really doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, until it is actually being used.
<p>I was talking with John Sheehan, the CEO of Runscope over the weekend, and the common question came up, &ldquo;<em>What are some of the interesting APIs you are seeing out there</em>&rdquo;? To which John replies, &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>None of them, until they are used in your app</em></span>&rdquo;! I think John&rsquo;s answer reflects this seismic shift for me in 2015, which is the year I stop counting and referencing the number APIs in the space, and chasing new APIs in support of this delusion and work harder to find, design, and share the most important API definitions that I possibly can.

<p>Some of the side effects of being so open and transparent about my ideas, like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/someone-please-build-my-open-interactive-portable-and-visual-api-documentation-toolkit/">the one I had around API visualizations</a>, is that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/06/my-wish-has-been-granted-swagger-driven-api-visualizations-from-ardoq/">people who are doing similar things, like Ardoq</a>, eventually find you. Even better, is when someone closely follows your thoughts, and takes your ideas, and sets into motion, your original idea, in a way that will allow it to become bigger than the original idea.
<p>Last week Chris Spiliotopoulos (<a href="https://twitter.com/chefarchitect">@chefarchitect</a>) sent me an email, with a <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed">simple Chrome extension</a> attached, asking what I thought. After installing the add-on (just drag onto your Chrome extension page), I visited <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">my notebook of Swagger defined APIs over at API Stack</a>, and when Twilio&rsquo;s Swagger definition loaded in the browser, I saw a little Swagger icon show up in my browsers address bar&mdash;you know kind of like when there is an RSS feed available.
<p><a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger-ed/swagger-ed-address-bar.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a>
<p>I click on the icon, and a new layer to my browser opens up, with a simple, crude, yet potentially powerful visualization of Twilio&rsquo;s API surface area.
<p><a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger-ed/swagger-ed-visualization-1.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a>
<p>Honestly, the visualization does little for sorting out the complexities of the API, but it demonstrates a possible future, where we can browse the Internet, stumble across APIs, and their machine readable definitions, and open up an entirely new, visual layer that helps us quantify, and make sense of what an API does. APIs are a very abstract concept, and helping developers understand the scope and value of an API can be difficult, the introduction of API definition driven visualizations go a long way in helping speed up the conversation.
<p>Imagine being able to immediately understand the scope of a microservice. How big is micro? Can I see a tag cloud of parameters? Is there a visualization layer to explore the underling data model? Can you provide me with a visualization diff between two similar APIs, defined using Swagger or API Blueprint. I&rsquo;m just getting going on brainstorming ideas for visualizations, and so is Chris&mdash;a conversation that I think will be never-ending as we continue to work to understand the digital resources being deployed across the API landscape.
<p>I have an alpha version of an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and Swagger editor, that I&rsquo;m using for the <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">redesign of my platform using microservices</a>, and don&rsquo;t just see the conversation Chris is started exclusively being about visualizing on the meta layer of APIs, but also directly connecting and exploring the valuable data, content, and other digital resources being made available via APIs. I also envision being able to explore collections of APIs defined using APIs.json, allowing not just software to navigate between many APIs, but also humans&mdash;something that is core to the APIs.json vision.
<p>Swagger.ed is open source, and <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed">available in a Github repo</a>. It is just an initial prototype, but imagine what is possible when you can take a machine readable Swagger or API Blueprint file, and instantly explore the meta layer to any API, then also visually explore data returned, like the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/">FDA is doing with clinical drug trials</a>. If you have any visualizations you&rsquo;d like to see, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed/issues">submit as an issue</a> on Chris&rsquo;s work, or in the comments here. I would love to better understand how visualizations can better help you understand your own APIs, and the APIs that are littered across the online landscape, thta you depend on.

<p>I have API tooling on the brain, a result of conversations on multiple fronts, and the evolution of my own thoughts on creating what I&rsquo;d see as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">the perfect API design tool</a>. My thoughts on API tooling, reflect my general API philosophy, and focus on developing small, meaningful tools that truly make an impact.
<p>First, nobody likes being dependent on bloated software products. The age where software  looks like Microsoft Office in my opinion, is over, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to a brighter future.  I feel pretty strongly that we need small, simple tools, that work in concert, not via a single client I have to pay for 100% of features, to get just 2% of the features I actually need to get done, what I need.
<p>One of my popular Github repositories is my <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/csv-converter/tree/gh-pages">CSV Converter</a>, which is just a reworking of <a href="https://github.com/shancarter/Mr-Data-Converter">Mr. Data Converter</a>, to which I added the ability to save XML, JSON, and CSV files directly to Github, making a completely client-side data management tool that runs 100% on Github pages. I like this idea developing small, stand-alone tooling for the API space, and is something you will see a lot more from me in coming months.
<p>As I work to refine, and evolve my thoughts on the perfect API designer, I&rsquo;m engaged in several conversations, about what the tooling could look like to support this vision, and the consensus seems to be that the next generation of tooling has to reflect an API philosophy&mdash;simple, small, stand-alone tools that do one thing and do it well. Something you can see this in popular API tooling like <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a>, and <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>.
<p>In recent times, I have been very adverse to developing any web or mobile client that someone else will depend on, stemming form PTSD developed by owning so much legacy code over my 25 year career. I'm happy to see that it isn&rsquo;t just me, and that there are so many other souls out there who are tired of legacy software bloat, and ultimately becoming slave to this, from both a provider, and end-user perspective.
<p>The moral of this story (for me), is that any client I build from here forward will be simple, small, and add real value to my operations, or it will be tossed. This approach reflects the way I see APIs, and if a service, or its resulting clients are not delivering value, they shouldn&rsquo;t exist&mdash;something that isn&rsquo;t possible, if you don&rsquo;t have a modular, bite-size approach to developing your technology solutions. I'm fortunate...

<p>I was just listening to segment on NPR, All Things Considered, about <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/16/386758778/science-standards-draw-climate-change-debate-back-into-wyo-classrooms">educating students around the environment</a>. Throughout the program I couldn&rsquo;t help be reminded of a similar imbalance in the world of APIs. Throughout my API experience I&rsquo;m constantly faced with a separation between what I hear is possible, what I would like to see, and what actually occurs on the ground in startups, small businesses, and within enterprise organizations, and government agencies.
<p>You might have to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/16/386758778/science-standards-draw-climate-change-debate-back-into-wyo-classrooms">listen to the segment</a>&nbsp;to fully grasp what I mean, but essentially it comes down to this: we&rsquo;d like a perfect world where we do not negatively impact the environment, and everyone understands the urgency, but in reality there are a lot of real world constraints that prevent us from truly realizing this vision. In the world of APIs, these same constraints exist. We&rsquo;d like to achieve API harmony in everything we do, but in reality there are a lot of real world constraints we have to navigate, from knowledge and education, to the time and resources needed to implement.
<p>This chasm reflects the challenge in my API Evangelist mission. How do steer clear of selling people a single product, platform, or holistic vision of an API strategy, and break things into small, bite-size chunks of information that anyone can use (or not use) as they see fit, in the environments they operate within.  I don&rsquo;t believe there is a silver bullet, or single religion to follow here, it is all about staying in tune with what is working, and what is not&mdash;then making your own decisions about what is appropriate on the ground.
<p>API Evangelist was born out of my success and failures working at SAP&mdash;which was all about striking a balance between what I knew was possible, what I wanted, and what was really possible in the environment I operated in. Alright, enough pontificating, and back to understanding all of this. I guess my point is, that this isn&rsquo;t just about understanding where are going, where we&rsquo;ve been or where we are currently&mdash;it is also about actually making meaningful connections that guide us, incrementally, in the right direction.

<p>There is an interesting story about <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/twitter-trolling-victims-mercy-daunting-100000942.html">Twitter trolling over at Yahoo News from CBCNews.ca</a>, which includes recommendations from Adria Richards (<a href="https://twitter.com/adriarichards">@adriarichards</a>) for using the Twitter API to crack down on trolling, based upon her own experiences. Here is the specific API mention from the story:
<blockquote><em>Richards has shared her own recommendations for Twitter to clamp down on trolling, which include making trending harassment patterns available via the application programming interface (API) and allowing users to subscribe to blacklists to exclude words from their timelines.</em></blockquote>
<p>I think APIs can playing a larger roll when it comes to online trolling, but we&rsquo;ll need someone to step-up and own the topic, working with Twitter, and other social networks to expose the right APIs, and give more control to end-users. Then also help encourage the development of open tooling on top APIs, that help users manage their online profiles, manage filter settings, manage black and white lists, and other key features.
<p>I'll continue to consider the potential of anti-trolling APIs, alongside other account, security, and privacy considerations, and see if we can start identifying some potential API patterns and approaches that can be re-used across the space.

I&rsquo;m a big fan of these types of efforts, that help humanize API operations, and bring API providers closer to API consumers. From the outside, it is difficult see behind the API curtain, and showcasing the team, is one of the best ways to break down barriers.
<p>Simple things like showcasing the team, let each one tell their story, and providing Twitter accounts for each team member goes a long way in helping me connect with what an API does. Something that will continue beyond just this one post, because I followed each team member that is active on Twitter, and will be able to stay in tune asynchronously.
<p>In the technical shuffle of API oeprations, it can be easy to forget about little touches like this, which is why I&rsquo;m going to <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">add team showcase as a building block to my API management list</a>.

<p>If you were at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag in Colorado last November</a>, or in <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">Sydney, Australia for API Days last week</a>, you&rsquo;ve heard me talk about what containers are doing to APIs. There is a subtle, but important shift in how APIs are being deployed occurring right now, and as John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>&nbsp;says, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">containers are doing for APIs, what APIs have been doing for businesses</a>.
<p>As I was processing news for <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a> this morning, I found more evidence of this, with the <a href="http://api.report/2015/02/14/logentries-releases-logging-container-for-docker-15-stats-api/">release of logging API container from Logentries</a>. APIs have made resources like &ldquo;logging&rdquo;, much more modular and portable, for use in multiple channels like mobile or via websites. A containerized logging API makes the concept of a logging API much more portable, by adding an entirely new dimension for deployment. You don&rsquo;t just have a logging API, you now have a logging API that can be deployed anywhere in the cloud, on-premise, or on any physical object.
<p>This opens up a whole new world of APIs, one that goes beyond just a programmable web, quickly evolving us towards a programmable world, for the better, and the worse. Last month <a href="http://kinlane.com/2015/01/21/when-will-my-router-have-docker-containers-by-default/">I asked, when will my router have docker containers by default</a>? I received an email from a major network equipment manufacturer this week, letting me know that they are working on it. This means little containers on the Internet enabled objects across our worlds, ushering in the ability to deploy localized, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale APIs</a>, giving us the ability to manifest exactly the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a> that we need, for any objective.
<p>I try not to hype up where things are going in the API space, so I will stick with calling containers a significant evolution in how APIs are done. This new way of deploying APIs will push the evolution around the business of APIs, changing how we make generate revenue from valuable resources, while also putting even more stress on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">politics of APIs</a>, with introduction of more privacy and security concerns&mdash;not to mention adding a whole new dimension of complexity.
<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure where all of this is going. As with the rest of the API space, I struggle with making sense of all of this in real-time, and the allocation the mental bandwidth to see the big picture. All I can say at this moment, is to make sure you work to better understand various approaches to containerization, and adopt a microservice approach to your API design. Beyond this, all we can do is keep an eye on what companies like <a href="https://logentries.com/">Logentries</a>&nbsp;are doing, when it comes to containerized API deployment, and try to learn as fast as we possibly can.

        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/linkedin/linkedin-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/blog/posts/2015/developer-program-changes">LinkedIn recently announced some changes to their developer program</a>, which involves further tightening down the screws on who has access to the API, limiting public access to only a handful of very superficial APIs. If you want greater access to the business social network API, you will need to be an officially approved partner.
<p>As a result of LinkedIn&rsquo;s announcement, you will hear more discussion about the demise of public APIs, as this is narrative many API providers would like to employ, to support their own command and control positions around their client, or very own API driven resources. There is nothing wrong with having private APIs with supporting partner programs, but this has no bearing on the viability of publicly available APIs.
<p>In reality, LinkedIn&rsquo;s API never really was open. Sure it is a public API, but the API has never been developer friendly, often times taking a very adversarial stance with its community, as opposed to embracing, nurturing, and investing in its developer ecosystem. Honestly, this is ok. Not every company has the DNA, or business model to make public APIs work&mdash;this latest move by LinkedIn reflects their ability, and not the potential of public APIs.
<p>We can&rsquo;t expect all companies to be able to make public APIs work, it isn't easy. When it comes to making money around valuable content and data online, a closed ecosystem is seen as being better. Tighter control over your users data exhaust, allows you to decide who can do what, limiting to just the partners who have business relationships with you. You just can't monetize user generated to the extent LInkedIn would like, without taking away users control and access to this data.
<p>Even with LinkedIn stance, there are a number of lessons to be learned by studying their approach. Like Twitter and Facebook, there are plenty of positive moves to analyze, as well as numerous other negative elements, that you can learn from when crafting the tone for your API. As an API provider do not dismiss what you can take away from LinkedIn&rsquo;s platform, and as a consumer LinkedIn is a valuable lesson in what you should look for in an API platform.
<p>Ultimately, the move by LInkedIn is no surprise to me, and the platform is purely a distribution channel for me, and has been for some time.. Meaning I only syndicate content there, and you will never find me actually engaging very deep on the platform, building relationships there, because along with other platforms like Quora I do not have any ownership over any of the exhaust I generate. As a professional this is unacceptable to me, as I have a valuable brand that I carefully maintain. As other professionals realize this, they too will mostly abandon the business social network, leaving it to be a spammy corner of the Internet where HR professional prey upon the semi-professional, aspiring employee types.

<p>After seeing the conversation around my In The Future There Will Be No Public vs. Private APIs, I'm reminded of my own mission. I write on API Evangelist first and foremost for my own education, and secondarily I do it to help educate the normals about the importance of APIs. Not page-views. Not to educate the API echo chamber. Not to drive conversation over at <a href="https://www.dzone.com/links/two_api_pundants.html">DZone</a> or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9010304">Hacker News</a>. Definitely not to insult anyone.
<p>That story was me working through my own service composition, and looking at one possible future. That exchange you hear in the story, and all my stories, is the conversation between the voices in my head, and is never mean to insult anyone (think Michael Keaton in Birdman). All of this has reminded me that API Evangelist is not about cutting edge stories, like the unproven stuff I'm doing with my own API architecture, docker and microservices. However it is critical that I still flush out my ideas, in my own way, so I'll move these stories to my personal blog <a href="http://kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a>.
<p>As I re-read that post, I&rsquo;m faced with the link-baity title, which was not crafted with that intent, and the error and brevity in one statement that was singled out and ultimately fueled the conversation. I&rsquo;m always happy to see conversation stirred, but not in the way it was around David&rsquo;s post. It is ridiculous that I would allude to privacy being gone from the conversation around APIs (really?), but ultimately I was pleased to see most people make the same argument that I was having in my own head.
<p>I&rsquo;m super thankful for having APIEvangelist.com, and my readers. It makes it possible that to bring in the little bit of money I do from 3Scale, Restlet, and WSO2, to pay my rent, and fund my research and learning. I&rsquo;m also thankful for moments like this that help me remember why it is that I do this, and stay true to my API Evangelist mission.

<p>I'm going to go ahead and use their own description, as it sums it well, no augmentation needed. Using the code generation API, you can generate SDKs for your API directly from your Github repository.&nbsp;
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Describe you API using some format. You may choose from Swagger, RAML, APIBlueprint, IODocs, and Google Discovery formats. Automatic code generation makes use of information in your API description to generate method and classes names. Please be as expressive as possible by not leaving out any optional fields as applicable e.g., not leaving out types and schemas for your parameters and fields.
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Define meta information about your API using API Commons manifest format. You can generate your API Commons manifest using the <a href="http://apicommons.org/manifest-generator.html">API Commons Manifest generator.</a> Be sure to enter all relevant information. Upload the generated manifest as a new file in the root directory of your Github repo by the name "api-commons- manifest.json". Be sure to have the correct name and location of this file.
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open/Create a markdown file (README.md is a good candidate). Add the following markdown syntax to render an image link.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[![apimatic][apimatic-{platform-name}-image]][apimatic-{platform- name}-url]
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[apimatic-{platform-name}-url]: https://apimatic.io/api/github/{account-name}/{repo-name}/{branch- name}?platform={platform-name}
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[apimatic-{platform-name}-image]: https://apimatic.io/img/github/{platform-name}.svg
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Replace the {platform-name} token with one of the following values: windows, android, ios<br />Replace the {account-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github account name <br />Replace the {repo-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github repository name <br />Replace the {branch-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github branch name where the API Commons manifest file is present. ï¿¼
<p>To validate, open the following url after replacing tokens. This url should open the raw manifest file. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{account-name}/{repo-name}/{branch- name}/api-commons-manifest.json
<p>You can see an example <a href="https://github.com/apimatic/videos">here</a>. Commit changes and navigate to your Markdown file in your browser. You will see apimatic widgets (image links), which you can click to generate SDKs for your API. To see an example, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apimatic/videos/gh- pages/README.md">open this link to view the README.md </a>file in raw text form.
<p>The Apimatic team is owning the conversation when it comes to generation of full fledge SDKs for your APIs. I always hear folks talk about the limitations of auto-generation of client side code, but the Apimatic team is pushing the conversation forward with their persistent approach.

        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm continuing my work to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/04/what-exactly-is-api-commons/">help people understand what APIs.json is</a>, and the varying ways that it can be put to use.  My post the other day, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">breaking down Fitbits APIs.json file</a> is a good example of where to get started, but I wanted to help further set the bar for a minimum viable APIs.json.
<p>APIs.json starts with a basic set of descriptions of who you are, the API provider. Each header of an APIs.json file gives you a handful of parameters for describing who you are:
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - your individual or company name, who is managing the APIs.json file.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of your company and / or the API collection you are building.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes yourself or your company.</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe your API collection.</li>
<li><strong>created</strong> - the first date in which an APIs.json file was created.</li>
<li><strong>modified</strong> - the last date in which an APIs.json file created.</li>
<li><strong>url</strong> - The url of where the APIs.json lives, allowing your file to be portable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those seven parameters provide details on who you are, and what the API collection is all about. Remember an API collection doesn&rsquo;t always have to live under a specific company domain, it could be a temporary or more permanent collection, which is part of specific project or application.
<p>The next essential element of an APIs.json file, is the APIs collection, providing you the ability to describe one or many APIs as part of this collection. Similar to the parameters provided for the header, each API entry is allowed a handful of parameters that describe the API:
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - the name of the API.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of the value an API delivers.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes an API.</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe the API itself.</li>
<li><strong>humanURL</strong> - The url any human should visit to learn more about an API.</li>
<li><strong>baseURL</strong> - The base url any machine should follow to start using an API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each API should have at least this information, at a minimum. I could stop here, with my minimum viable APIs.json definition, but I encourage you to take one more step, and put the properties collection to use for each of your API. Using the properties collection, you can provide any other URL you want for an API--I recommend starting with four basic properties:
<ul>
<li><strong>X-documentation</strong> - Where the documentation resides for the API.</li>
<li><strong>X-signup</strong> - Where a user can signup to use an API.</li>
<li><strong>X-pricing </strong>- What is the pricing for using an API.</li>
<li><strong>X-tos </strong>- Where do I find the legalize behind AP operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately you can define any property you wish for an API, but recommend with these essential building blocks that all API consumers will need. After that each API has a contact collection, allowing you to provide some basic support for API operations:
<ul>
<li><strong>FN</strong> - The name of person to contact.</li>
<li><strong>email</strong> - The email address to contact.</li>
<li><strong>X-twitter </strong>- A twitter user for the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>These contact properties, follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">vCard format</a>, and provide what API consumers will need to get support for an API. The same properties are available again for the overall APIs.json file, as a maintainers collection, which provide contact information for the overall APIs.json maintainer. This will often be a duplicate of information for each API, but allows for ultimately flexibility in aggregating many disparate APIs, into a single collection.
<p>That is it. That is a minimum viable APIs.json definition. We now know who maintains the collection, and essential details about API operations. This goes well beyond just the technical definition of an API, and provides essential business and political elements of API operations, that all API consumers will need to be informed of, and are something that developers will often overlook.
<p>With an <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json file</a>, <a href="http://apis.io/">open source API search engines like APIs.io</a> will be able to index your APIs, and any API directory like <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> can do the same. The definition of your API(s) is now machine readable, and is portable, allowing this definition to live on any website, or within any desktop, web or mobile application.

<p>David Berlin has a rebuttal post on ProgrammableWeb to my recent post&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/03/in-the-future-there-will-be-no-public-vs-private-apis/">In The Future There Will Be No Public vs. Private APIs</a>, called <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/long-live-private-api/analysis/2015/02/06">Long Live The Private API</a>. I&rsquo;m a big fan of doing story responses using our blogs versus the sometimes difficult Twitter conversations that occur--so I am happy to craft a response as well. I&rsquo;m less of a fan of playing into page view games of fabricated kerfuffles, and link-bait titles, which after re-reading, my own blog title was a little link-baity. However in reality, my story came from my workbench as I was reworking some of the service composition stack, and reflect that process, not the conversation it seems to have created, but hey, I am all about embracing unintended consequences.
<p>First, let me address my mistake. I said <em>"If it has an http:// in front of the address, it is a public API&mdash;sorry.&rdquo;</em>, which is total bullshit. As John Sheehan reminded me after I posted, at the point of DNS is what I should have meant, you can definitely use http:// on a totally private network, and what I meant to articulate was once you start making call via http://, using a DNS address.
<p>Second, David really makes my case for me, so in reality we are in agreement, it is all about semantics&mdash;which really is the core of my argument. Private, like the term open is thrown around a lot, usually by marketers, who want to elicit some sort of emotion response from their intended audience, much like David is with his story. All I&rsquo;m pointing out, in my own journey, is I used to have two buckets, public, and private. Then I had three buckets internal, public, and partner. Now I have mulitiple buckets that reflect products, projects, dev groups, and the organic organizational structure that has emerged around the resources I manage, and put to use.
<p>Private just doesn&rsquo;t describe my organizational structure anymore. My organization spans the globe, and has overlap with numerous other organizations, and individuals, and my service composition needs to reflect this change. If my statement: "the concept of public and private doesn't exist. This is a reality that plays out in conversations between people who don&rsquo;t fully understand the world of API management&mdash;aka the tech blogosphere.&rdquo;..is an insult to you. Maybe you can channel that anger into a blog post, and get some page views. ;-)
<p>David is 100% right. It is your right to continue describing things as public vs. private, and I&rsquo;m completely confident that many of you will continue doing this in the future. Describing very public infrastructure as private, describing very closed things as open, what I&rsquo;m trying to do is move the conversation forward. When you are ready for a nunanced discussion about who has access to your API, API management, and service composition, I am here.
<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> Look ma! I did it without a second page, to drive page views!</em>

        <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2015</span>

<p>I'm a big fan of putting my ideas for new tools, services, and other stuff out on the Internet, for public consumption. My mother taught me how to manifest things in my life, and this is my digital version of her teachings. By putting my ideas out there, a) I don't actually feel compelled to do them b) someone else might think it is good idea and build it, and c) when someone does build it and they start looking to publicize, they will find you. c) happened today.
<p>One idea that I put out there recently, that I really wanted to manifest, was a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/30/swagger-visualization-layer-using-d3js/">visualization layer for APIs using Swagger</a>. My wish has been granted, and a startup called <a href="http://ardoq.com/">Ardoq</a>, has done just that, developed a <a href="http://ardoq.com/visualizing-swagger-api-documentation/">visualization layer using Swagger</a>. As they were taking their new product public they came across my story, and pinged me this morning. I&rsquo;m going to follow-up, with a link to the story, and get a full tour of the product, talk with the team, and better understand what they are up to.
<p><a href="http://ardoq.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/ardoq/IBM_API_Swagger_To_Ardoq.gif" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>Ardoc is an important next step for machine readable API definition conversation, adding another <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">incentive for API providers to generate definitions for their APIs in API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML</a>. I really see three main phases of the evolution so far in this conversation, 1) when Wordnik introduce Swagger and Swagger UI, 2) with introduction of Apiary.io moving the conversation further upstream to API design, and now 3) more meaningful visualizations built on top of APIs and microservices.
<p>Machine readable API definitions have done many significant things for the API conversation, allowing us to deploy interactive documentation, mock interfaces, ultimately giving us a common language that we can use to communicate around some very abstract concepts. I&rsquo;m excited to see visualizations enter the discussion, which will allow us to build powerful visual tooling around APIs, like being able to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/30/how-to-generate-an-api-surface-area-map-for-a-microservice/">map the scope of a microservice</a>, or provide a map for a whole stack of microservices.
<p>I think visualizations generated for machine readable API definition is just the beginning of a whole <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">new world of UI elements developed on top of APIs,</a> and we will also see more analysis, interoperability, integration, and discovery tools emerge as well. API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger will continue to evolve as a central truth throughout the API lifecycle, providing as set of instructions for everything from design and deployment, to management and integration.

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/article.xsp?id=05.02.2015092629NHEBWM.htm"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ibm-bluemix-third-party-services.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p>I've been talking about developing <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks for a while now</a>, and as I continue understand current shifts in cloud computing, I am doing my own&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/api-management-infrastructure-and-service-composition-is-key-to-orchestration-with-microservices-in-a-containerized-world/">reshuffling towards a more microservices, and docker-centric way of life</a>. When I say the phrase &ldquo;virtual API stack&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m talking about the ability to deploy a stack of APIs you need for a specific organization, project, app, or other configuration. In 2015, you should be able to quickly define exactly the stack of private, and public API services you need to accomplish exactly what you need--nothing more.
<p>As part of my research in this area, I&rsquo;m tracking on similar patterns, that I see occurring at platform providers--today I found an example of <a href="http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/article.xsp?id=05.02.2015092629NHEBWM.htm">defining virtual API stacks</a> using the <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html">service broker API </a>over at <a href="https://www-01.ibm.com/software/bluemix/">IBM Bluemix</a>. Using Bluemix, you can build virtual API stacks from existing services they have setup, including Twilio, and Sendgrid, or register your own APIs using service broker, via their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/partner-landing.html">cloud marketplace</a>&nbsp;(you have to be partner). The services deploy in this way, need to implement a common API surface area dictated by the platform (I&rsquo;d love to see a Swagger spec for this IBM).
<p>IBM is blending several areas I&rsquo;ve been tracking on, starting with&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">defining of virtual stacks</a>, but also the aggregation of 3rd party services which opens up a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale layer of valuable API resources</a>, and sets up world where <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API brokers can emerge</a>, and prosper. I see that <a href="https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZFB2_3.0.1/com.ibm.apimgmt.apionprem.doc/create_api_swagger.html">IBM has embraced machine readable API definitions like Swagger</a> as part of their operations, and I&rsquo;d love to see them <a href="http://apisjson.org/">adopt APIs.json for defining of their virtual API stacks or collections</a>. APIs.json would make the API collections that users define, much more portable, shareable, indexable, and ultimately discoverable. If you need example of APIs.json + Swagger working, look through <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">my API Stack inventory</a>, as I map out the top APIs.
<p>My vision of a future with API stacks and collections, is a world where we can buy and sell these modular resources, in IBM&rsquo;s, Amazon&rsquo;s, Google&rsquo;s, and anyone other marketplace, but we can also run them in any infrastructure we choose. We would all possess our own stacks of resources, be able to choose from a wide array of public and private 3rd party resources, and deploy, remix, and re-use these resources in any way we choose, to drive websites, desktop solutions, system integrations, mobile apps, and devices.
<p>It is good to see these patterns emerging over at IBM, via their Bluemix platform. This type of modular service definition, design, deployment, management and reuse is something I&rsquo;m talking with several other companies about as well--making for a very &ldquo;containerized microservice&rdquo; 2015, from what I can see.

<p>As I travel around talking to folks about APIs, I spend as much time as I can educating folks about <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, and I&rsquo;m constantly reminded how little people, who have even heard, and read about API Commons, really understand what it is. With this in mind, I will be regularly publishing examples of what API Commons is, to help onboard everyone to mine and Steve's (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) vision of API Commons.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API Commons is a machine readable pointer to the license of your API</span>. As I talk with folks, and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ3-yFWYtrk">videos like this one at APICon in UK</a>, I realize how many misconceptions there are about it. Many folks emphasize the Creative Commons license we&rsquo;ve chosen, or the listing of APIs we&rsquo;ve had added to our version of the commons, by publishing an API Commons manifest, which references a CC-BY or CC0 license.
<p>If you feel your API should be covered under an open source license, or covered by your patent, or not covered by any sort of license, create an API Commons manifest that points to your API, references your license, and you&rsquo;ve created your own commons. Now you can spider, and aggregate any API providers who have used the same license, into your own definition of what is the API Commons.
<p>API Commons is not an API directory. API Commons is not a push for copyright in APIs. API Commons is a machine readable format for taking a stance on the licensing (or not) of your API definitions, and data models. Please join us today, by <a href="http://apicommons.org/">letting us know your stance on licensing of your API</a>, we&rsquo;ve love to hear your voice, and better understand your stance.

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/global-change-information-system/global-change-information-system.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I remember the vision clearly from 2004, when I first changed the URL for my Delicious social bookmarking account to make it return a list of bookmarks as XML instead of HTML. It was a vision of the programmable web--where everything I explored on the Internet, wasn&rsquo;t just consumable, and right below the surface of any website or application I was using, there was also a machine readable version, allowing me to build whatever I desired.
<p>People are often surprised when they realize I do not have anything to sell them, and that I evangelize that APIs are not some new product, but just the next step in the evolution of the web. This is easy to say, however it can be much harder to demostrate to the &ldquo;normals&rdquo;, leaving me always hundting for easy to understand API implementations I can use to help bring me people closer to understanding.
<p>Steve Ziegler (<a href="https://twitter.com/Stevezieglerva">@stevezieglerva</a>) introduced to me to a great new example of this in the wild. An API I haven&rsquo;t come across before, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it was a partnership between Department of Commerce, Energy, Interior, State Department, Transportation, EPA, Health &amp; Human Services, NASA, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian, USAID, and USDA.
<p>According to their own description the <a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/">Global Change Information System</a> is:
<blockquote><em>The US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) has established the Global Change Information System (GCIS) to better coordinate and integrate the use of federal information products on changes in the global environment and the implications of those changes for society.</em></blockquote>
<p>For me the Global Change Information System is an example of how websites, linked data, and APIs should work in concert, but is something I understand very little about how to actually do. The <em>GCIS&nbsp;</em>platform organizes an amazing amount of information, all the people, organizations, and relationships involved, in a very elegant way-you can start seeing in action by browsing the database, by clicking on the menu in top left corner.
<p><a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/global-change-information-system/gcis-api-report-view.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></a>
<p>Immediately I notice how structured everything, then as I scroll to bottom I see that everything is available in a machine readable format. What is even cooler, is that it isn&rsquo;t just available as JSON, you get it in YAML, Turtle, RDF, and some formats I&rsquo;m not familiar with. Then  of course, you get a robust, yet simple web API as well.

<p>I&rsquo;m impressed with the amount of detail available in the Global Change Information System, and the amount thought put into the relationships between all the information, and actors involved. It makes me optimistic for what can come out of government, and that something so forward thinking is being applied to an area as import as the environment.
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting going reviewing the <a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/api_reference">Global Change Information System API</a>, and will make more time to evaluate how it works under the hood, maybe generating a Swagger spec for the interface, to help me better understand how it works. I&rsquo;m also going to reach out to them and see if I can get more information on the story behind, and possibly what the roadmap looks like&mdash;making it likely you will see more stories about it in the near future.

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/ed/fafsa-form.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>My work on <a href="https://ed-data.github.io/developer/">APIs for the Department of Education</a>, and the <a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">FAFSA API</a> began while I was working in Washington DC as a Presidential Innovation Fellow. Shortly after leaving DC, I was informed that conversations around an API for the FAFSA had been put on back-burner, and in response I developed a prototype FAFSA API to help jumpstart the conversation.
<p>In December 2013, I went to one of the two data jams put on my the White House and Dept of Education, up in Palo Alto, CA at Stanford. Then, in January 2014 I heard there was talk at the secretary level, about officially pursuing a FAFSA API. Yay! By February I got an email that there was an opportunity for funding such an initiative, if there was a technical specification available. Three days layer <a href="https://ed-data.github.io/developer/2014/02/20/fafsa-api-technical-specification-draft-raw/">I finished a couple of options</a>, which ultimately resulted in a <a href="https://ed-data.github.io/developer/2014/02/21/fafsa-api-technical-specification-draft/">draft technical proposal for a possible FAFSA API</a>.
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard nothing about the outcome of these efforts. I provided some thoughts on <a href="https://ed-data.github.io/developer/2014/06/02/my-response-to-how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">APIs in general, in June of 2014, in repose to their RFI</a>, but beyond that it has been radio silence at Department of Education when it comes to a FAFSA API. Granted, I&rsquo;m not pursuing this, but when it comes to FAFSA API discussion, I own the SEO conversation, so if it came up, I&rsquo;m sure someone would ping me.
<p>I have no confidence that the Department of Education will pursue a FAFSA API. My motivations around contributing to the conversations stem from a desire to jumpstart investment from both the public, and the private sector. While jumpstarting conversations in the federal government, I was hoping I could also jumpstart the development, and deployment of a federated FAFSA API, which in turn would apply pressure on the federal government to participate. Doing this is not trivial, and a cause that needs a champion or full time evangelist&mdash;I&rsquo;m not your man.
<p>The FAFSA API is an excellent example of the technology, business, and politics of APIs, something that is more art, than science. If it is going to become a thing, I think it has to happen inversely to the way the IRS ecosystem has occurred, from the outside in. I just don&rsquo;t have confidence that the Department of Education can own this one, I think multiple leaders from the private sector have to make it happen, get private sector buy-in, then convince the Department of Ed to play nicely in a federated FAFSA API ecosystem.
<p>Which is no small task.
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>This post is meant to help several groups understand where I am at with the FAFSA API. I just posted a round of updates directly to my <a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">FAFSA API research</a>, as well as my overall <a href="https://ed-data.github.io/developer/">Dept of Education research</a>.</em>

<p>I've been pretty focused on web APIs in my API Evangelist world, steering clear of hardware, networking, desktop software, and the American Petroleum Institute. While you will never catch me paying attention to oil, I am slowly changing my tune on other types of legacy APIs.
<p>As I read through <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html">the first 700, of the 16K API related patents I&rsquo;ve harvested from USPTO XML files</a>, I initially started dismissing hardware related patents, and then some of the more network related ones as well. Then I started evaluating the impact these patents could have on the Internet of Things (IoT), and I am beginning to shift my stance.
<p>I may not fully profile the approaches of some of these API providers, but I think I will at least bookmark, and consider the approach, and how its being applied, while also putting on my web API architect hat. As I read through a press release today on <a href="http://api.report/2015/02/04/infolytica-corporation-releases-motorsolve-v5/">Infolytica corporation releasing the next generation of their MotorSolve software</a>, complete with mention of an API, I can&rsquo;t help but think of the implications if Infolytica embraced a web-API strategy.
<p>Imagine the potential, if MotorSolve was broken up, migrated into the cloud, and containerized? Then add in the necessary business building blocks like docs, code, pricing, and the requisite political building blocks like rate limits, terms of services, etc. This is the lens I am looking at older patents I am reading through, that may not 100% reflect modern web APIs, but because our virtual and physical worlds are increasingly merging with the growth of Internet of Things (IoT), and Software Defined Networking (SDN), might have significant impact if just looked at a little differently.
<p>Overall I see an pretty interesting opportunity in trying and consider all types of APIs, no matter their origins, reconsidering them in light of shifts in compute like the cloud, mobile, IoT, and SDN, and see what we can learn. You&rsquo;ll see more news reports of more &ldquo;low level&rdquo; APIs on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, and some of what I learn evolving my analysis here on API Evangelist.

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-traffic-fast-lane.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I get a lot of folks who come to my blog, see the title, read one or two posts, and assume that I&rsquo;m a blind lover of API technology, and that I see APis as a solution to everything. While some of this is true, I do love APIs, and think they are a great solution (in some cases), at the same time I&rsquo;m also an outspoken critic of APIs, and work hard to be a voice of reason when I see people doing stupid shit with them.
<p>With this theme in mind, I want to once again remind everyone that APIs are neither good, nor bad, nor neutral by themselves, they are merely one of the tools companies can wield, and completely reflect the motivations of their masters. One such example of this in action, where I believe an API is being used for some pretty bad reasons is with the <a href="https://developer.att.com/apis/sponsored-data">AT&amp;T sponsored data API</a>.
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to support AT&amp;T as much as I can, because I really want to help the enterprise make sense of web APIs, and teach them to wield them in positive ways, but I have to say the sponsored data API is not something I can get behind. Upon closer examination this API is working to close down, control and meter the Internet, rather than opening up the Internet making it more accessible, and usable by AT&amp;T customers.
<p>Allowing for mobile users to get their music, video and other content delivered in a way that doesn&rsquo;t impact their phone bill seems like a good idea, and allowing companies to step in an sponsor the delivery of data and content for users, may smell like a good opportunity when you own the pipes, but this is leading us down a dark road. I&rsquo;m sorry, there are much more interesting ways to optimize the delivery of content, and make money off the Internet pipes you have--AT&amp;T you lack imagination, and creativity.
<p>I'm sure you are well aware, but what you are doing with sponsored data delivery to mobile phones is another push for allowing the prioritization of Internet traffic, and being able to pay for a better Internet experience for those who can afford it, rather than making the web accessible to everyone. Additionally if you consider that many providers will actively work to slow the Internet delivery of content behind the scenes just so they can generate revenue using approaches like sponsored data, things really start to get really ugly. I'm not ok with you doing this via APIs, and helping your customers see API as something attached to their bill, and speeding up the Internet
<p>This use of an API to close the Internet down, and such bad examples of API monetization really bum me out. There is so much opportunity for monetization if everyone has open, free access to the Internet. We can get more creative than this, when it comes to monetizing the pipes, and approaches like this from AT&amp;T is just going to continue fucking up the Internet, similar to what we are seeing come from Verizon, and the other leading telcos who don't get Internet, let alone APIs.

<p>I spent a portion of my time each day reviewing press release sites, in addition to the 1000+ blogs I keep an eye on, for syndication to <a href="http://api.report/">API.Report</a>. During the course of my work this year, I'm noticing an uptick in the number of press releases that are about some new app, feature, and partnership that has an API at its core.
<p>Telling the story of prominent integrations is something I am a big advocate for, but I think the growth in the number of official press releases about API integrations shows that the mainstream SMB and enterprise markets are putting APIs to work more, and looking to showcase. For me, this demonstrates that APIs are playing more of a central role in not just the deployment of apps, but the course of regular business for an increasing number of companies in 2015.
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that many more companies will be showcasing the API integrations that they achieve, long before they talk about the APIs they posess, let alone make publicly available. Ideally, everyone would be both a public API provider and consumer, but I&rsquo;m afraid that many companies just don&rsquo;t have the culture for such a thing&mdash;keeping their APIs closer to their chest, while still beating the API integration drum. Because it is what you do in 2015.

<p>I spend a significant portion of my day looking for company logos, for use in the API stories I tell. When I come across a proper implementation of a logo page, one of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">business building blocks I recommend employing</a>, I have to showcase it.
<p>I got an email from my friend and fellow API evangelist Keran McKenzie (<a href="https://twitter.com/keranm">@keranm</a>) about updating the listing for the <a href="http://developer.myob.com/">MYOB API</a> on my <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=accounting-stack">API Stack</a>. He sent me a better description, and a couple of new links that I didn&rsquo;t have, including <a href="http://developer.myob.com/program/myob-developer-logos/">a link to their logo page</a>.
<p>One thing that I think is particularly interesting about the MYOB logo approach, is that they offer an assortment of designs:
<ul>
<li><strong>Corporate Logo -</strong> The MYOB name and logo represent the MYOB business and is protected by copyright and trademark laws.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Logos -</strong> The MYOB Premium Developer Logo is reserved for the exclusive use of MYOB Premium Developer Partners.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Add-On Logos - </strong>The MYOB Certified Add-On logo is exclusively available to Add-Ons that have completed the MYOB Add-On Certification process. Product Logos - A full collection of product specific logos.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, a logo page is essential in assisting the media, and other folks like me, who will be talking about your services, be more successful. Second, their assortment of logos, shows MYOB has a well thought partner framework, that encourages developers to work hard, obtain premium status, and build certified add-ons.
<p>A logo page, with a rich set of, well-planned embeddable logos, and other images, is an important <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building block</a>&nbsp;that tends to also be a signal of APIs who have their operations in order.

<p>I'm on the hunt for new ways to deploy attractive, interactive API documentation, from machine readable API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint. I am <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">advocating for the development of new approaches to deploy UI documentation</a>, and part of this showcasing what I find along the way.
<p>In the spotlight today is <a href="https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio">Aglio</a>, which they describe as:
<blockquote><em>An API Blueprint renderer that supports multiple themes and outputs static HTML that can be served by any web host. API Blueprint is a Markdown-based document format that lets you write API descriptions and documentation in a simple and straightforward way.</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aglio-html-docs.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>Aglio is significant because it is driven from the machine readable format API Blueprint, and produces static HTML that can be served up anywhere, specifically on Github or Amazon S3 deployed using Jekyll. Additionally it just makes your document simple, easy to follow, and just damn sexy.
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see a Swagger generated version of Aglio, allowing you to deploy the attractive API documentation from both Swagger or API Blueprint. If more API documentation looked like Aglio, I would be a seriously happy camper.

<p>As I continue to evovle my service composition definition, using my <a href="https://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale API infrastructure</a>, across my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">microservices stack</a>, the thought of public vs private doesn&rsquo;t even enter the equation. I am doing my APIs using the Internet pipes, so they are public by default&mdash;then using my service composition I define the layer that actually regulates what is openly accessible by the public, what resources have limited access, and specifically how much of any resource any single person can access.
<p>When I&rsquo;m working through my API Stack, the concept of public and private doesn't exist. This is a reality that plays out in conversations between people who don&rsquo;t fully understand the world of API management&mdash;aka the tech blogosphere. If it has an http:// in front of the address, it is a public API&mdash;sorry. You need to secure it like it is public, and you need to approach service composition in a sensible way, that deals with identity, and access management across all your public infrastructure.
<p>As we move towards a world where the Internet isn&rsquo;t just on our desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile environments, it is everywhere in our homes, business, cars, and public space, there will be no separation between public and private API resources. Everything will be public, it will just be a matter of properly defining who has access, exactly how much they can consume, and in what way they can actually engage with the valuable API driven resources emerging all around us.

<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html">reading API related patents</a>&nbsp;lately. I downloaded all of the patent applications between 2005 and 2015, filtered for all patents that mention &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo; in the title, abstract, or description of the API, resulting in a database of 16,485 patents. Currently I&rsquo;m reading the 700+ that just mention API in title or abstract, and once done I&rsquo;ll take a look at the rest.
<p>First, let me state that patents are not a concept I subscribe to. Personally, I do not believe in defining, and locking up ideas, but I do not live in the world I&rsquo;d like, and after beginning my patent API search, I see patents are a concept that like API copyright, will be  increasingly wielded across many industries where APIs are being put to use. For this reason, I engage in my research, and overall patent awareness journey, not because I&rsquo;m a believer in the patent system, or am looking to submit any patents--I want to better understand how patents are being used to define API processes, and help see the evolving role APIs are playing in the larger patent story over the last 20 years.
<p><strong>First, What Exactly Is An API Patent?</strong><br /> There are many incarnations of API, and making sense of whether a patent directly describes a specific API, or is more API adjacent can be very difficult to do. I&rsquo;m operating under the assumption that if &ldquo;application programming Interface&rdquo; is present in title or abstract, it is likely that the patent describes an API fueled process, and my initial review of the 700+ patents support this. This realization moved the conversation in my head from &ldquo;will patents affect APIs&rdquo; to &ldquo;APIs are being patented&rdquo;, and we need to better understand what is going on, regardless of the precise definition of what an API is. Whether an API is more hardware related, system or specifically a web API as we know it today, becomes somewhat blurred on the current Internet landscape.
<p><strong>Precise vs. Broad Stroke Patents</strong><br /> One thing that really stands out as I read these API patents, is the varying scope of the API definition. Some are very precise, talking about a specific API call, to accomplish a very specific, granular task. While others are very broad, talking about using APIs, for an industry-wide use. This distance, represents the rapid expansion of the API space, and how the vision from technologist to technologist will vary widely on how aware of change they are in their specific domain. Some companies seem to just cast a wide net, claiming a whole region of cyberspace, as operating under their patented idea, with little or no regard for many iterations that have evolved within this very space, in just the time they've submitted the patent.
<p><strong>Internet of Things Blurring The Landscape</strong><br /> As I read through patents, it is easy to dismiss some of the application because they are very hardware focused, but when you consider the bigger Internet of Things (IoT) picture, where everyday, common devices are being connected to the Internet, using APIs&mdash;things get very blurry. A hardware API in the 1990s was definitely something that was pretty novel, and useful, but in 2015 these concepts are rapidly expanding, becoming commonplace, with the iterations and variations of process occurring at a staggering rate. I&rsquo;m considering pulling patents all the back to 1995, to evaluate telecommunication era APIs, for re-use, and applying in the IoT era, in hopes of bringing more focus to this blurry portion of the API patent landscape(or quite possibly confusing myself further). What was once a pretty specific hardware specific API in 1998, could have thousands of uses, in an IoT crazy 2015.
<p><strong>The Pace of Change &mdash; New &amp; Useful Processes At A Breakneck Speed</strong><br /> After reading the handful of patents that I have, as an API architect, my brain immediately sees the variances in their patent ideas, that when actually applied as an API would become the  programmatic points where I can add variety, and iterate on the process being  defined. If it's a new and useful way for analyzing network traffic using an API, I can immediately define hundreds of network scenarios with software defined networking, and then exponentially augment with different user and device scenarios on different ends of this patented process. At what point do all my variations fall prey to this patent, requiring me to cut a deal with patent owners, and at which point do my variations begin breaking the established patent idea, as the world that the definition applies to continues its rapid expansion. The automobile patent was new and novel until Henry Ford came long, and the automobile became ubiquitous, Amazon Web Services implementation of compute and storage was new and novel when it came out, at what point does is it just become the way things are done. The Internet is just escalating this process, which each passing moment&mdash;something the patent process doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge.
<p><strong>How Does US Patent Office Maintain The Army Of Domain Experts To Determine What Is New &amp; Useful?</strong><br /> As I read a patent about a specific API analytics patent, something I&rsquo;d consider myself a domain expert in, I&rsquo;m thinking this isn&rsquo;t that novel or new, and is something that has been going on a while, and then I find several more variations on the same subject, with varying scopes, muting each patent along the way. As I read through some of the networking based API patents, which I probably do not consider myself a domain expert, I think WOW, that is pretty new and novel idea, to almost each one, with very little awareness of scope of each idea. I have to ask myself, how does the US patent office maintain the army of domain experts needed to keep pace with what is truly new and useful in this digital age? There is no way this can occur under a single government or institutional entity anymore, it has to be done openly on the Internet, in real-time.
<p><strong>APIs Are All About Re-Use, Remix, And Defining New &amp; Useful Processes</strong><br /> As an API architect, I can confidently say that APIs are all about establishing definitions of new and useful processes, that if you do properly, allows you to re-use, remix, and redefine a sometimes dizzying amount of variants in that new and useful process. Each API or microservice is a single, potentially well defined process, and when you start daisy chaining, stacking and remixing with APIs, you can rapidly rethink legacy processes, with an agility that is seldom seen in the physical world, or earlier evolutions in software development. Ultimately I feel that the patent process is the antithesis of an API, but at the very least, I would make the argument that it is a very antiquated way to look at how we operate in a digital world.
<p><strong>1000LB Gorillas Are Filing Patents &mdash; Not The Doers, Defining Next Generation Processes</strong><br /> Another thing that stood out to me, when evaluating the 16K API patents I&rsquo;ve targeted, is  exactly who the characters are that apply for API patents. The two leading the charge are Microsoft and IBM, with a who&rsquo;s who of enterprise dominating the list after that. The companies and individuals doing patents, are not the doers, at the forefront of each business sector, who are actually defining the next generation of new and useful processes using APIs, that are increasingly spanning both our virtual, and physical worlds. While I don&rsquo;t have the research done to back this claim, at first glance at the areas in which API patents are being defined, this world does not reflect the API space I&rsquo;ve been mapping the expansion of. Which tells me that there are two distinct layers to this API expansion, those that are defining and moving almost every industry being touched by APIs forward, and those that are filing definitions with the patent office to define, make bets on, and ultimately lay claim to what might be.
<p><strong>Doing Patents As A Defensive Measure &mdash; Its How You Play The Game!</strong><br /> I am sure there are numerous motivations for filing a patent on an API, and the popular claim is to say you are doing it as a defensive measure. Clearly software patents is a game of hardball, where companies can make or break your cool new startup, by burying you in legal woes&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been there myself. Companies like <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you">Tesla</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/">Google</a> are making an open patent pledge, stating that they only do patents as a defensive maneuver. I get this. I can&rsquo;t argue with companies defending what they&rsquo;ve built against the more aggressive corporate personalities in the space. I guess this is why I am building, and curating my database of API related patents, and the companies behind them, so that I can eventually connect it to actual litigation by these companies&mdash;only time will tell which open patent pledges actually hold out to be true.
<p><strong>Patents Are Rich Person&rsquo;s Game &mdash; We Don&rsquo;t All Have The Resources To Play!</strong><br /> To play in the patent game, you need money. You have to be able to afford to file your patents, and you need to be able to afford to defend them in court. This is not a doers game, it is a rich person&rsquo;s game. My everyday world would be an extremely fertile environment for the defining of patents, as I spend my days playing with thousands of API resources, and deeply thinking how these APIs could be used in new an novel ways in our personal and business lives. However without the resource ($$) to be able to file the patents, and defend these virtual, API driven spaces, in a court of law, patents are a game I will never participate in. I can guarantee there are thousands of patentable ideas laying around my workbench, but because patents aren&rsquo;t a concept I subscribe to, and I don&rsquo;t have the resources to play in the game, you will never see a patent with my name on it.

<p><strong>Still Not Convinced You Can Define And Lock Up Ideas, Let Alone API Driven Ones</strong><br /> Even after about 60+ hours of <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">patent API research</a>, I&rsquo;m still not convinced the patent process is something that is applicable in the API space. I&rsquo;m barely sold on the concept when it involves the assembly of gears, conveyer belts, and physical elements, let alone with the new and useful process is algorithmic, allowing me to orchestrate infinite number of processes using APIs. I&rsquo;m preparing a keynote talk in Sydney Australia next week, about the opportunities for orchestration with microservices and docker containers, using machine readable definitions like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. As part of my work, I defined 18 specific processes that I depend on to operate as a business, and as soon as those were defined and deployed, I quickly define 8 new iterations on top of the existing processes. I&rsquo;m still defining my overall approach to API orchestration with virtualized containers, but once ready, I will be able to define a new node on my network in seconds, and remix with other resources instantly, reworking existing processes and defining entirely new ones each day&mdash;why would I want to lock these up, I need these ideas to flow to be successful. Execution trumps definition.
<p><strong>If We Are Going To Apply Patents To APIs, We Need A Process That Will Keep Pace</strong><br /> Ok, say patents are even a thing we should be considering applying in the API space. At the very least we need a process that will keep pace with the world of APIs, and acknowledge not just the accelerated pace of change and iterations, but also the exponential variations that can occur, and the potential change of scope, in near real-time. I do not manually apply copyright to all my writing in 2015, because of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> I can apply copyright across all of my digital exhaust&mdash;why are processes and workflows any different?
<p>I strongly believe the concept of patents is counter to the essence of what an API is, but if we insist on defining our new and useful processes in this way, we need a real-time way of capturing the intellectual exhaust from processes we execute, map out the new and useful processes that exist, in a way that requires them to &nbsp;have to actually be useful and implemented, while also having a way to share and vet these definitions with the public audience, whether it be industry, government or both.  I&rsquo;m just getting started with my API patent research, and as with my other research in the API space, I&rsquo;m sure my awareness will continue to expand rapidly, something I doubt I will also see with the patent process itself.
<p>Ultimately I&rsquo;m left thinking what my friend, and fellow API Evangelist Mehdi Medjaoui&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/medjawii">@medjawii</a>) said in his very forward thinking post, <a href="http://api500.com/post/46951162382/open-apis-are-the-new-software-patents">that APIs are the new software patent</a>.

        <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/2016_budget_header.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>The release of the the <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data">president's fiscal year 2016 budget in a machine readable format on Github</a> was one of the most important things to come out of Washington D.C. in a while when it comes to open data and APIs. I was optimistic when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">the president mandated that all federal agencies need to go machine readable by default</a>, but the release of the annual budget in this way is an important sign that the White House is following its own open data rhetoric, and something every agency should emulate.
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done to make sense of the federal budget, but having it published in a machine readable format on Github saves a lot of time, and energy in this process. As soon as I landed on the Github repository, clicked into the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/2016-budget-data/tree/master/data">data folder, and saw the three CSV files, I got to work converting them to JSON format</a>. Having the budget available in CSV is a huge step beyond the historic PDFs we&rsquo;ve had to process in the past, to get at the budget numbers, but having it in JSON by default, would be even better.
<p>What now? Well, I would like to make more sense of the budget, and to be able to slice and dice it in different ways, I&rsquo;m going to need an API. Using a Swagger definition, I generated a simple server framework using Slim &amp; PHP, with an endpoint for each file, budauth, outlays, and receipts. Now I just need to add some searching, filtering, paging, and other essential functionality, and it will be ready for public consumption--then I can get to work slicing and dicing the budget, and previous years budgets in different ways.
<p>I already have my eye on a couple <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js visualizations</a> to help me make sense of the budget. First I want to be able to show the scope of budget for different areas of government, to help make the argument against bloat in areas like military. Second, I want to provide some sort of interactive tool that will help me express what my priorities are when it comes to the federal budget--something I've done in the past.
<p>It makes me very happy to see the federal government budget expressed in a machine readable way on Github. Every city, county, state, and federal government agency should be publishing their budgets in this way. PDF is not longer acceptable, in 2015, the minimum bar for government budget is a CSV on Github&mdash;let&rsquo;s all get to work!

<p>I was having a Twitter conversation with John Sheehan(<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) about the easiest way to generate interactive API documentation this weekend, without getting all tangled up in having to get into the weeds of <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>. I love me some Swagger UI, something I think has transformed how we engage with APIs, but the JavaScript for it can be inaccessible, and difficult to customize--to say the least.
<p>There are other UI solutions to API documentation, projects like <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate from Tripit</a>, from <a href="https://readme.io/">Readme.io</a>, and some cool <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">UI stuff over at OpenFDA</a>, but really I haven&rsquo;t seen much evolution beyond Swagger UI. Sure, <a href="https://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a> has a great UI, but it isn&rsquo;t the portable, customizable vision I have in my head (they are working on this, BTW). I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/someone-please-build-my-open-interactive-portable-and-visual-api-documentation-toolkit/">envision a whole gallery of simple, UI templates that you can choose from</a>, driven by machine readable <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint </a>API definitions.
<p>Looks like the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">gov hackers over at 18F</a> feel the same way, and are working on something like this&mdash;"<a href="https://github.com/shawnbot/swagger-static">a suite of tools and templates that faciliate the generation of static, human-readable documentation to replace SwaggerUI</a>&rdquo;. <a href="https://github.com/shawnbot">Shawn Allen</a>, has created two repos:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shawnbot/swagger-template">swagger-template</a>, just some HTML files that should theoretically be useful for generating static HTML documentation for a Swagger-compliant API.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shawnbot/swagger-enhance">swagger-enhance</a>, a little Node utility for grabbing a Swagger API's JSON and "enhancing" it with JSON data from each of its own endpoints (confusingly, "apis", in Swagger parlance).</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes me happy to see some brainstorming to push the conversation forward. I&rsquo;m able to deploy Swagger UI pretty quickly to support my APIs, using Github Pages, but when it comes to extending, and transforming the UI, I hit a wall pretty quickly. I've created some custom UI solutions, to help me manage my own infrastructure, driven by Swagger, but nothing that contributes to the larger conversation.
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see API design, deployment, and integration tools I depend on like <a href="http://studio.restlet.com/#/">Restlet Studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> provide more support for easy deployment of UI elements, driven by machine readable API formats like Swagger and API Blueprint. Making API documentation more interactive with Swagger UI was an important step forward, but we are ready for the next step in the evolution of API UI generation.

<p>As I work to r<a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">edefine my world using microservices</a>, I have this sudden realization how important my API management infrastructure is to all of this. Each one of my microservices are little APIs that do one thing, and do it well, relying on my API management infrastructure to know who should be accessing, and exactly how much of the resource they should have access to.
<p>My note API shouldn&rsquo;t have to know anything about my users, it is just trained to ask my API management infrastructure, if each user has proper credentials to accessing the resource, and what the service composition will allow them to do with it (aka read, write, how much, etc.) My note API does what it does best, store notes, and relies on my API management layer to do what it does best--manage access to the microservice.
<p>This approach to API management has llowed me to deploy any number of microservices, using my API management infrastructure to compose my various service packages&mdash;this is called service composition. <a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">I employ 3Scale infrastructure for all my API / microservice management</a>, which I use to define different service tiers like retail, wholesale, internal, and other service specific groupings. When users sign up for API access, I add them to one of the service tiers, and my API service composition layer handles the rest.
<p>Modern API management service composition is the magic hand-waiving in my microservice orchestration, and without it, it would be much more work for me to compose using microservices in this containerized API world that is unfolding.

<p>In 2010, when I started API Evangelist, I sat down to create a logo, and after six hours of frustration in photoshop, I eventually just typed out my logo as a basic JSON representation, kind of as a joke, which I eventually planned on changing, but it stuck.
<p>With the latest batch of t-shirts I've ditched the "logo" portion, but will keep this legacy version floating around, here and there for nostalgic purposes. Along the way, I've added what I consider the function version of the logo, which I use for each of my research sites.
<p>I'm starting so many new research areas lately, I decided to create a logomaker API, so I can make new logos, and anyone else can make their own as well. There are three API endpoints for the <a href="http://logomaker.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist logomaker API</a>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Single</strong> -&nbsp;<a href="http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/single/?value=[value]" target="_blank">http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/single/?value=[value]</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The API is completely open, but I will be cleaning out the images each day, so if you truly want to keep one, save it locally. Have fun playing. I will actually be using it to generate headers for my research sites. If you want to use any of my logos, make sure you follow my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/branding-guidelines.html">branding guidelines</a>. ;-)

API skeptics also give me material for stories, so I thoroughly enjoy coming across them, and telling these stories is how keep polishing my argument for the next API skeptic encounter at campus IT, at the higher educational institutions that I visit.</span>
<p>During the discussion I was posed several interesting questions, and one of them was: why would you ever give students API access to the Student Information System (SIS), and let them build un-sanctioned apps that we will end up have to support?
<p><strong>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</strong><br /> FERPA gives students the right to review, control disclosure, and request amendment of their education record. Increasingly this is going beyond just via a web interface, PDF, or printed copies. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">President Barack Obama mandated that all federal agencies begin providing information in machine readable formats</a>, and many cities and states are putting it into law as well. A student should always have access to their data, and they should be able to choose to do this via campus applications, or be able to obtain a portable copy of their record for storage in a location of their choosing, or possible use within a 3rd party system of their choice&mdash;it's their data. Period.
<p><strong>Un-Sanctioned App Concern Is Just A Red Herring</strong><br />Modern API management infrastructure like <a href="https://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://wso2.com/">WSO2</a>, provide an unprecedented level of control over managing API access, requiring secure on-boarding of new developers, the establishment of service composition definitions, which provides rich real-time analytics on how APIs are used, and by whom&mdash;while also seamlessly integrating with existing identity and access management solutions. The university gets to choose who has access to which services, revoke access when abused, while also better understanding how resources are really being accessed and put to use. Ideally this applies to all campus-wide usage, as well as with external 3rd parties&mdash;modern approaches to API-centric operations, include the management of internal, partner, and public resources in this way.
<p><strong>A More Balanced Governance Across Campus Resources</strong><br /> Modern API management was born out of traditional IT governance, but is something that is more focused on giving access and control to the end-users who are the actual owners, of the valuable data, content, and other digital resources being made available.  Legacy campus IT models provide a governance model that involves IT, administrative and faculty stakeholders, but rarely includes the students. APIs give students secure access to their data, and standards like <a href="https://oauth.net/">oAuth</a> opens up the ability for them to have a vote in who has access to their data, with oAuth scope being defined by existing institutional governance efforts. When APIs enter the conversation, governance expands to be more self-service, real-time, and within the control of students, as well as administrators, faculty, and campus IT.
<p><strong>Possibility Of Good Things Happening Closer To The Student</strong><br /> In the current educational environment, where students are often more tech savvy than faculty and administrators, why would we want to eliminate serendipity, and the possibility that new things might happen. Solutions to problems that students actually face everyday, that campus administrator may never think of, because they see technology through a very different lens. The days where IT knows best, regarding what devices, browsers, apps, and websites are optimal for getting things done, are in the past. Shadow IT demonstrates this, where students, and even faculty are using un-sanctioned solutions to get their work done. Campus IT should be empowering students, encouraging a more digitally literate individual who soon will be entering the workforce, not suffocating this.
<p><strong>Easy For Campus IT To Miss The Big Picture</strong><br /> I am a recovering IT administrator, so I understand the challenges a skeptic campus IT administrator faces, but ultimately by restricting access to campus resources just makes your job harder, making you the bottleneck that everyone's so commonly complains about, when it comes to IT. APIs don&rsquo;t create more work for you, it makes you much more agile and nimble in how you integrate systems, build new web and mobile applications, and provide 3rd party vendors access to campus resources&mdash;as well as potentially opening up self-service access to students.
<p>With an API-centric approach you will know exactly who is accessing resources, and how they are using them--in real-time. I&rsquo;m betting that you don&rsquo;t have this visibility across all of your IT resources right now. When I put on my IT director hat, I prefer the API model, because then all resources are self-service, available to only those who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHOULD</span> have access, all without them having to talk to me. I&rsquo;m left alone to do what I do best, and can also monitor new signups, real-time usage, and manage support tickets in accordance with wider IT support strategies.
<p>I understand you are a skeptic about APIs being a thing students should have access to, and in reality most students will not care, but there will be a long tail of student users who will do things you never imagined, and potentially change how you look at scheduling, document management, or other staples of campus operations&mdash;something that will never happen if you don&rsquo;t make students a priority when it comes to your digital resource management.

What A Security Risk!</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-unhappy.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>I went up to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/30/talking-apis-up-at-california-state-university-channel-islands/">California State University Channel Islands the other day to talk APIs with their tech team</a>, and I was happy to find at least one strong API skeptic on the team. API skeptics also give me material for stories, so I thoroughly enjoy coming across them, and telling these stories is how keep polishing my argument for the next API skeptic encounter at campus IT, at the higher educational institutions that I visit.
<p>During the discussion I was asked several interesting questions, the first one was: why would you want to list of your web services (APIs) for your public university, out in the open, via a central portal?? What a security risk!!
<p><strong>Sorry, But Security Through Obscurity Is Not A Strategy</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m sorry, hiding things, and hoping nobody finds them is not a valid IT strategy. You are a public university, and you should have a sophisticated identity and access management, as well as well tight approach to security. If you can&rsquo;t properly secure an API resource available at a public URL, you shouldn&rsquo;t be running campus IT, sorry.  You should be able to provide a public description, of what resources are available, without giving away the farm.
<p><strong>The Feeling You Have &mdash;It Comes From Legacy Power And Control</strong><br /> As an IT professional, if you don&rsquo;t acknowledge that power and control exists within classic IT processes, you are in denial. I&rsquo;ve taken over numerous company IT operations, and there is ALWAYS political struggles between IT and the rest of operations. If you list all digital resources in a single portal, and make them available in a self-service way, it disrupts existing power and control structures. When you make things hard to find, you play a central role in people finding these resources, and you are in power&mdash;adding to decades of legacy stories about IT being a negative force in operations. Self-service access to campus resources is the future, no matter how much you resist.
<p><strong>Centralized  Location To Aggregate All Digital Resources</strong><br /> A centralized API portal provides a single place for anyone to discover or share their digital resources. Like the main website, administrators, faculty, students, parents, and the public will know there is a single place to find machine readable versions of campus resources. API portals are more than just a listing of APIs, it includes documentation, code samples, widgets, buttons, spreadsheet connectors, visualizations, blogs, twitter accounts, and other resources that can turn a simple portal into an active ecosystem where everyone collaborates around campus resources.
<p><strong>Self-Service Access For 3rd Party Vendors Delivering Vital Campus Services</strong><br /> It takes resources to engage with 3rd party vendors on campus, and a single, self-service portal provides a standardized way for vendors to access the institutional resources they need to deliver the services they are bringing to campus operations. There is no reason that IT or departmental contacts should ever be bottlenecks in delivering the information vendors will need. API portals should provide them with the access they need, along with proper identity and access management, and monitoring of exactly how vendors are accessing, and putting campus resources to use (or not).
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/web-services-listing.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p><strong>Interoperability Between Higher Educational Institutions</strong><br /> Most higher educational institutions are part of a larger network of institutions, and at the very least have relationships with other schools, in which information, and resources are shared. As with vendors, much of this can be provided via a self-service API portal, where institutions can find the data, content, and other resources they need, able to access only the resources they are supposed to during the fullfillment of established relationships.
<p><strong>Smoother Interactions With Local, State, And Federal Government</strong><br /> Higher educational institutions have regular integration points with local, state, and federal government agencies. Data is reported on a regular basis, back and forth, and a central API portal is excellent for aggregating the commons resources a government agency will be asking for. API portals are not just for student hackers, or 3rd party developers, they are increasingly how government agencies are sharing, and getting what they need to regulate, monitor industry, and govern more effectively.
<p><strong>It Is About People Getting Access To What They Need</strong><br /> Central API portals are about making sure people get access to what they need, and at a public university, this should be priority number one. You have data, content, and other digital resource students, faculty, administrators, vendors, government, parents and alumni need, and because you aren&rsquo;t confident in securing it, from a handful of hackers you are going to hide this away, and forgo all the benefits? I&rsquo;m sorry, the perceived negatives just don&rsquo;t out-weighs the positives. There are proven ways to secure APIs, and for much of university operations, it won&rsquo;t hurt to provide a title, description, and location of a resource, and let identity and access management handle who should be able to get at resources&mdash;or not.
<p><strong>Bringing IT Out of Shadows Across Campus Operations</strong><br /> Security is a concern, and should be front-and-center in all conversations, but it is too often used to hide away insecurities, incompetency, and shortcomings in security, rather than actual address the root of security concerns. If a resource is accessible via Internet protocols, over campus networks, it should be mapped out, with the definition made publicly available in a sensible way. This conversation should involve careful consideration what resource should be public, and what should remain private, with a heavy emphasis on transparency at a public university.
<p>Between 2000 and 2007, we start seeing a shift of IT services into the cloud, and much of this has happened, as un-sanctioned shadow IT, by administrators, faculty, and students looking to get their work done, because IT hasn&rsquo;t been able to keep up.  The cloud evolution of IT has been all API driven, and making IT resources available to the public at Amazon sounded insane at first, but it has changed not just how Amazon operates, but has evolved the entire world deploys software architecture&mdash;using APIs.
<p>There are many great examples of leading companies, making personally identifiable information, banking, healthcare, and other vital data and content available on the open Internet, in a secure way. It is not a security risk to share information, and provide access to your valuable resources, in a central, publicly available portal--if you do it right. Who knows, if you do open up, there may be some unintended consequences, leading to IT being seen as positive influence on the education process, as opposed to the roadblock image it often has on campuses across the country.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apis-json-file/">Breaking Down The Fitbit APIs.json File</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2015</span>
        <p>The quantified-self API <a href="http://www.fitbit.com">Fitbit</a> recently added an <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/apis.json">APIs.json for their domain</a>. Their usage of APIs.json is a perfect, dead-simple, introductory example of how APIs can start putting APIs.json for their API platform. To help other providers understand, I wanted to take a look at the moving parts of Fitbits APIs.json, and to assist the conversation I labeled each part.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/www_fitbit_com-apis_json.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" />
<blockquote><strong>A) </strong>The heart of an APIs.json, providing a name, description, image, and tags for API platform and collection.<br /> <strong>B)</strong> The technical details of where this APIs.json came from, which version it is, and when it was created and last modified.<br /> <strong>C) </strong>Similar to the overall APIs.json collection, each API gets a name, description, image, and tags, but also as the default URL people should go to find the API, as well as the base URL actually make calls to the AP, which is used as the API identifier.<br /> <strong>D) </strong>Properties collection for the API. This is where the flexibility in the APIs.json comes in, and you can define any type of URL you wish. Ideally we establish a core set of machine readable properties, but providing human links to blog, documentation, etc are essential too.<br /> <strong>E) </strong>X-blog - a link to the Fitbit blog, providing a direct link that users can use to read the blog.<br /> <strong>F) </strong>X-blog-rss-feed -a link to the RSS feed, providing a machine readable link to stories, and updates for the platform.<br /> <strong>G) </strong>X-github - a link to the official Github account for the Fitbit platform, when you consider the Github API, this becomes a machine readable link to multiple aspects of API operations.<br /> <strong>H) </strong>X-twitter -  a link to the official Twitter account for the Fitbit platform, which again, using the Twitter API, this becomes a machine readable resources for accessing platform communications, updates, and resources.<br /> <strong>I) </strong>Contact information for the Fitbit API team, which they route you to a forum. Some platforms put their Twitter handle here, and others put an email or phone number.<br /> <strong>J) </strong>Maintainer for the APIs.json, which since it is Fitbit, helps provide authority, showing this APIs.json comes from the source, and is not a collection built by someone else, which includes the Fitbit API.<br /></blockquote>
<p>The initial APIs.json from Fitbit is simple, and while there is potential for additions like a Swagger or API blueprint definition, or maybe terms of services, and client code, would be an excellent start.
<p>So what now? What does this do for Fitbit?
<p>It makes the definition of their API portable. It acts like a sitemap.xml for their API program, allowing search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> to index Fitbit along with other APIs. You can also develop embeddable widgets, allowing the API information to be displayed on any site, and using Github and Twitter APis, and the Blog RSS, you could also pull other relevant information for display, and search within the widget, on any website or mobile application.
<p>We are just getting going with APIs.json tooling, that will help add to the benefits of having one. I know of several projects in the works, developing internal APIs.json search engines, directories, and when you include API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint in your APIs.json, things get even better. I&rsquo;m using APIs.json for microservice discovery, navigation, and indexing, and as a way to connect API interfaces  with containers that deliver on the promise an API is supposed to deliver.
<p>I am seeing more API providers begin to deploy APIs.json for their providers, and I have two of the leading API management providers about to release APIs.json as a native part of their API management workflow, with others in the works. It is good to see APIs like Fitbit see the potential of indexing their API operations with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, something where the benefits are only going to grow over the coming years, as new tools, and services emerge that depend on APIs.json for engaging in the API economy.

<p>I started doing <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/25/doing-the-research-in-preparation-for-my-patent-on-a-patent-api/">research on API patents recently</a>, and after about 5 days of processing XML files from the US Patent Office, I'm going to stop processing at the year 2004 (way back). This gives me 2005 through present day, and provides more than enough information for me to evaluate the role APIs are playing in the patent process, and inversely how patents are affecting the API space.
<p>In 2004, the XML data files I'm processing start to change, and I'm getting errors, resulting in me having to reconfigure my script, in addition to downloading the numerous, large XML files. I think I have enough of a sampling to start building a wider awareness of what is going on with patents and APIs, I can always come back and download 1995 through 2004.
<p>So far, I have found 16,485 patent applications that had the phrase "application programming interface" in either the title, abstract, or full description for the patent. I found <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html?filter=name">151 patents that specifically mentioned API in the patent title</a>, and <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html?filter=abstract">569 that specifically said it in the abstract</a>. Here is the breakdown by year:
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/patent-diagram.jpg" alt="" width="350" align="right" />

</ul>
<p>I'm going to continue my API patent journey by reading the 151 patents that specifically mentioned API in the patent title, and the 569 that specifically said it in the abstract. From there, I will expand into the other patent applications and try to understand if the API is more hardware API, or more API adjacent.&nbsp;
<p>I have a lot of learning ahead, so I don't want to make to many assumptions early on, but looking at the <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/companies.html">list of companies who have filed patents</a>, it becomes very clear to me that if you want to conduct business in the API economy, you are going to have to at least take a defensive patent stance for your APIs, or these companies will bury you in legal attacks.
<p>There are a number of thoughts swirling around in my head around patents, but a few of them that keep floating to the top are around how damaging the antiquated patent process could be to the API economy, and around why there hasn't been much conversation in this area, as the world of APIs has been heating up over last four years.
<p>After I read more of the patents, I'm hoping I'll better understand what companies are up to, and possibly the motivations behind the patents. Then I'll begin making my own assumptions about how positive or negative patents are to the API economy.&nbsp;
<p>All I can say now, is what a strange world to try and make sense of. In my opinion the concept of patents apply to a very physical world, and much like Creative Commons has helped evolve the world of copyright in an Internet era, we need something to bring patents into a digital world. A conversation that gets even more complicated when you start thinking about the Internet of Things.

APIs.json provides a simple, machine readable way to index the technology, business, and political elements of each microservice I deploy.
<p>As I was auditing the <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">18+ microservices I&rsquo;ve setup for my core operations</a>, I wanted to audit each one, and make sure I had included various elements in each APIs definition, like where developers can onboard, terms of service, and where to find related code samples. To accomplish this, I was able to just compare each microservice APIs.json, with a master APIs.json template I had established while planning my original microservice stack.&nbsp;
<p>Sometimes it is just as important to know what is missing, right alongside what is available for all of my microservices, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> is proving to be a simple way of understanding this layer of my API operation at scale.

<p>I spent the day yesterday up in Camarillo, at<a href="http://www.csuci.edu/"> California State University Channel Islands (CI)</a>. Half my time I spent speaking with a mix of folks from the campus tech team about APIs, and the other half I spent learning about video production at the university. I wanted to thank , Chris Mattia (<a href="https://twitter.com/cmmattia">@cmmattia)</a> Director of Academic Technology, CSU Channel Islands, Michael Berman (<a href="https://twitter.com/amichaelberman">@amichaelberman</a>) VP Technology &amp; Communication, California State University Channel, Mikhail Gershovich (<a href="https://twitter.com/mgershovich">@mgershovich</a>) for having me up.
<p>The conversation I had with their tech team around APIs reflected other conversations I&rsquo;ve been having with other higher educational institutions. It was a mix of business and technical talent from the school, ranging from instructional technologists, to front-end, and backend data people. The spectrum of personalities range from the API literate, to API curious, and of course the API skeptic&mdash;which demonstrates their is a healthy balance to the tech team the university, in my opinion.
<p>I walked everyone through the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/20/history-of-apis/">history of APIs</a>, and showcased a couple of <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/universities.html">the other universities putting APIs to work</a>, then I just opened up the conversation to the technology, business, and politics of APIs on campus. The leadership at Channel Islands can see the potential of APIs, but just like every other sensible institution, they have to cautiously evaluate where the low hanging fruit is, get some small API wins, before tackling any larger API projects.
<p>These types of conversations are something I will be encouraging more of in 2015, and I&rsquo;m looking to bring together the 10 institutions I&rsquo;ve had discussions with so far together for an API event, while also opening up invitation other institutions who might want to participate. If you would like to jump start an API discussion at your higher education institution, please let me know.

<p><a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a> is a simple, <a href="https://github.com/APItools/monitor">open source</a>, API middleware that allows you to &ldquo;track, transform and analyze the traffic between your app and the APIs&rdquo;. With just a few clicks you can proxy any API you use, and when you make calls through the proxy, you get a bunch of valuable  information in return.
<p>One thing APITools does, that is extremely valuable to me, is it generates Swagger definitions, mapping out the surface area of an API, with each call I make. These API definitions have a wide variety of uses for me, ranging from better understanding the API designs of popular services, to providing API search services through open API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>.
<p>If you are regularly developing against a public API, can you take a moment to swap the baseURL with one created in APITools, make all of your calls to the API, then send me a copy of the Swagger definition? I would sure appreciate the help in creating Swagger definitions for all of the popular APIs available today.

<p>I was struggling with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/how-much-api-surface-area-before-it-stops-being-micro/">exactly how much API surface area can exist for a service before it stops being micro</a>&nbsp;the other day, and while I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever find a precise measurement for this, I&rsquo;d like to have a fluid definition that I can use to automatically evaluate, how big an API is.
<p>So, what data can I gather, to help me quantify the surface area of my API? I&rsquo;ll start with each endpoints, then count each verb, parameter, and potential response. Since I use <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> for all of my API definitions, I can easily do this, and I can also understand each API response better because also I have them linked to the underlying data model.
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how this surface area definition will work, ultimately I&rsquo;d like to be able to separate verbose APIs by different layers, like the number of endpoints or parameters, or maybe the lack of verbs, or responses (not what is there, but what is missing)--I'm not sure. I&rsquo;m just getting going with my API surface area map.
<p>My goal is to be able to list 20-30 microservices, and generate a basic visualization showing the approximate scope. Then I can use this in my decision making around whether or not I add features to an existing service, or spin it out as an entirely new service.

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-twitter-bot.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the rise of Twitter bots. Little automated bundles of social media joy, built to spew mostly nonsense, but everyone once in a while you find nuggets of wisdom in the Twitter API fueled bots. Personally I have never built a Twitter bot, only because I don&rsquo;t need another distraction, and I can see the addictive potential of bot design.
<p>My partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), who has hands on experience building her own bots, said something interesting the other day while we were partaking in our daily IPAs&mdash;the wordnik APIs it the base building block of any Twitter bot.
<p>Sure enough, when you search &ldquo;<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=twitter+bots+wordnik">twitter bots wordnik</a>&rdquo; on the Googlez, you get a wide variety of python, nobde.js, php, and other recipes for building Twitter bots, with almost all of them using the Wordnik API as the core linguistics engine for the bot.
<p>Two overlaps with other stories I written here. 1) <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/04/twitter-api-is-gateway-drug-for-internet-of-things/">I feel the Twitter API holds a lot of potential as a training ground for IoT connectivity</a>, and 2) I think APIs, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/01/i-find-it-interesting-that-wordnik-created-the-api-definition-format-swagger/">specifically the Wordnik API, and the work to come out of Wordnik, like Swagger, has a significant role to play</a> in the future of the Internet.
<p>I know many of us technologists have grand visions of where the Internet is going, and would like things to happen faster. but I think the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; everything we are looking for is going to take some time, and is something you can see playing out slowly in things like Twitter bot design. I&rsquo;m sure there are many negative incarnations, but many of the Twitter bots I&rsquo;ve seen have been interesting little nuggets of API driven (Twitter &amp; Wordnik) chaos, driving us towards an unknown, but definitely Internet connected, online world.

        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/swagger-api-docker.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm rebuilding my underlying architecture using microservices, and docker containers, and I'm <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery/">using APIs.json for navigation and discovery within these new API stacks</a> that I use to make my world go around. As I assign each microservice, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">APIs.json file</a>, taking inventory of the building blocks that make the service operate, I also begin including docker into the equation, and I find myself using Swagger definitions as a sort of fingerprint for my docker powered microservices.
<p>Each microservice lives as its own Github repository, within a specific organization. I give each one its own APIs.json, indexing all the elements APIs of that specific microservice. This can include anything I feel is important, like:
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Signup -</strong> Where to signup for the service.</li>
<li><strong>X-Twitter -</strong> The twitter account associated with the service.</li>
<li><strong>X-Samples -</strong> Where you can find client side code samples.</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as you put X- before the property, you can put anything you want. There are only a handful of sanctioned APIs.json property types, and one of them you will find in almost all my APIs.json files generated for my platform is:
<ul>
<li><strong>Swagger -</strong> A reference to a machine readable Swagger definition for each API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another one I&rsquo;m starting to use, as I&rsquo;m building out my microservice infrastructure, is:
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Docker-Image -</strong> A link to a docker image that supports this API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of my microservices I have a supporting Docker image that is the backend for each API. Sometimes I will have multiple Docker images for variant back-ends for the same API fingerprint. Using APIs.json I can go beyond just finding the API definition, and other supporting building blocks. I can also find the backend needed to actually deliver on the API I have defined by a specific Swagger definition. I&rsquo;m just in the early stages of this work, and this series of posts reflects me trying to work much of this out.
<p>You can <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">browse my work on Github</a>, most of it is public. The public elements all live in the gh-pages branch, while the private aspects live within the private master branch.  It is all a living workbench for me, so expect broken things. If you have questions, or would like more access to better understand, let me know. I&rsquo;m happy to consider adding you to the Github organization as collaborator so that you can see more of it in action. I will also chronicle my work here on the blog, as I have time, and have semi-interesting things to share.

<p>I&rsquo;m rebuilding my underlying architecture using microservices and docker containers, and the glue I&rsquo;m using to bind it all together is <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>. I&rsquo;m not just using APIs.son to deliver on discoverability for all of my services, I am also using it to navigate around my stack. Right now I only have about 10 microservices running, but I have a plan to add almost 50 in total by the time I&rsquo;m done with this latest sprint.
<p>Each microservice lives as its own Github repository, within a <a href="https://github.com/kin-lane">specific organization</a>. I give each one its own APIs.json, indexing all the elements APIs of that specific microservice. APIs.json has two main collections, "apis" and "include". For each microservice APIs.json, I list all the properties for that API, but I use the include element to document the urls of other microservice APIs.json in the collection.
<p>All the Github repositories for this microservice stack lives within a single Github organization, which I give a "master" repo, which acts as a single landing page for the entire stack. It has its own APIs.json file, but rather than having any API collections, it just uses includes, referencing the APIs.json for each microservice in the stack.
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/kin-lane-api-navigation-2_png.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>APIs.json acts as an index for each microservice, but through the include collection it also provides links to other related microservices within its own stack, which I use to navigate, in a circular way between all supporting services. All of that sounds very dizzying to write out, and I&rsquo;m sure you are like WTF?  You can <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">browse my work on Github</a>, some of it is public, but much of it you have to have oAuth access to see. The public elements all live in the gh-pages branch, while the private aspects live within the private master branch.

        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-carrot.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>I spend time each day reviewing about 15 different press release distribution websites, looking for API related news for <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, and potentially seeds for stories elsewhere on the API Evangelist network.
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m noticing a lot, are companies who reference their API as bullet point in a release, or sometimes as a footnote in their about section at the end of the release, but when you go to their website you can&rsquo;t find any mention of API.
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing for many, they just haven&rsquo;t thought about making the API something that is front and center, relinquishing it to just "feature status". There are also others who do not believe in the whole &ldquo;public&rdquo; API thing, and see their API as more secret sauce, something that should be kept close to your chest.
<p>Whatever the reason, I&rsquo;m looking to better understand how I can help companies be more public with their API presence, even if the API itself isn&rsquo;t open to the public. My first instinct is to just email the company, and ask why they aren&rsquo;t more public with API, but I know from experience it isn&rsquo;t the best approach. ;-)
<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;ll be exploring new ways I can encourage companies to be more public with their API presence, and help them understand the benefits of this approach&mdash;let me know if you have any good ideas.

<p>I have most of the core platform that I run API Evangelist on <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">re-engineered as individual microservices</a>, defined on Github, and running using Docker instances. I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery">APIs.json for discovery, navigation</a>, and to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-swagger-as-fingerprint-for-my-microservice-docker-containers">connect swagger API definitions, to their docker backends</a>.  So far I have 18 microservices, which I define as very simple APIs, that do one thing, and focus on doing it well.
<p>I&rsquo;m very critical about any feature I add in, working hard to keep each service as micro as I can, reducing complexity, and bloat in any single API.  However, with each service I reach the point where I have to cut off feature creep, and establish an entirely new API definition--I am at this point with my link service.
<p>I have a pretty bloated link management system in the legacy version of my platform, something which handles links for functions ranging from <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:kinlane">Pinboard</a> integration, to handling linkrot on my public website. My legacy system runs using an API too, but it is a sloppily designed API, with a wide surface area, something I&rsquo;m looking to prevent in the next version.
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve broken out a single API into three separate microservices:
<ul>
<li><strong>Link -</strong> A dead simple link management tool, allowing me to add a title, and url to a simple link data store, for future use.</li>
<li><strong>Curated - </strong>A service to manage links I curate from many sources, including additional bells &amp; whistles, like pulling text body, taking screenshot, and much more.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Linkrot -</strong> A link storage system designed for a singe purpose&mdash;to address link rot on my public websites. The API works with a simple JS library to store, monitor, and take screenshots of websites I link to across my network.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have about five other simple, link related, microservices I&rsquo;m planning, but these three designs represent the main link resources I need to make API Evangelist work. All of the microservices I&rsquo;m designing will be open sourced at some point, but the linkrot implementation is one I may also be offering as a service. I&rsquo;m enjoying the feature across my sites, and is something that I think has some viability as a basic service.
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my own definition of what a microservice is--will evolve, ebb and flow, but for now the first rule of microservice club for me, is keep things doing one thing, and doing it very well&mdash;enforcing simplicity in every decision.

<p>I cringe, when I think about the number of mobile applications out there, that people depend on in their personal and professional lives, that are using insecure APIs, allowing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">personally identifiable information (PII)</a> to flow across the open Internet. I&rsquo;m a big advocate for helping <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">mobile developers understand the important role that a public API can play in this situation</a>, but another side of the discussions that also scares me is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that also emerges as part of this conversation.
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered recent security and privacy involving mobile usage of APIs at <a href="http://101.apievangelist.com/2014/01/08/are-your-api-security-practices-in-better-shape-than-the-snapchat-api/">Snapchat</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">Moonpig</a>, and was processing the API news this morning for inclusion on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, when I came across this press release, <a href="http://api.report/2015/01/27/wandera-finds-official-nfl-app-to-be-leaking-users-personal-data-just-days-ahead-of-the-big-game/">Wandera Finds Official NFL App to be Leaking Users' Personal Data Just Days Ahead of The Big Game</a>. I can get behind the NFL securing their users personal data, but have a hard time jumping on the bandwagon when this is used as PR for a mobile security service, in the lead up to the Superbowl.
<p>Understanding how everyday mobile apps are using APIs to communicate in the cloud is important. Sharing stories about how to map out this very public surface area, and secure it properly, while giving end-users more awarness and control over their PII is critical. Doing this in the name of marketing, PR, or to ride a fear hype wave is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not ok</span>. Yet, I fear this will become commonplace in coming months and years, as security breaches, cybersecurity, and privacy are front and center in the media.

<p>As we get close to wrapping up the first month in 2015, it is clear that Internet security and privacy will continue to be front and center this year. As technology continues to play a central role in our personal and business lives--security, transparency, and respect for privacy is only growing more critical.
<p>I know I'm biased in thinking that APIs will continue to take a central role in this conversation, but I feel it is true. Many of the existing conversations around security about platforms like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">Snapchat</a>, and <a href="http://apivoice.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">MoonPig</a>, are directly related to APIs, while other security scope at companies like Sony, JP Morgan Chase, and beyond could easily be reduced with a sensible API strategy.
<p>Companies are increasingly operating online, but do not act like any of information lives in an online environment. Adopting an API approach to defining company resources, helps map out this surface area, acknowledging it is available over the Internet, and works to define, secure, and monitor this surface in a healthier way.
<p>Mobile users need access to their data, and by applying an API centric approach, providing account management, data portability, and access and identity controls using oAuth, you can increase transparency, while also strengthening overall security. If your company operations is centered around customer and end-user data transactions, you should be making all data points available via an API, accompanied by a well oiled oAuth layer to help end-users manage their resources, playing a significant role in their own privacy and security.
<p>I'm not delusional in thinking that APIs provide a perfect solution for all our security and privacy woes, it doesn't, but it does set a tone for a more healthy conversation about how companies are doing business on the open Internet, and how we can better secure the online web, mobile, and device-based applications we are increasingly depending on in this new world we have created.

<p>When you start talking about generating server or client side code for APIs, using machine readable API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, many technologists feel compelled to let you know, that at some point you will hit a wall. There is only so far you can go, when using your API definition as guide for generating server-side or clienit-side code, but in my experience you can definitely save some significant time an energy, by auto-generating code using Swagger definitions.
<p>I just finished re-designing 15 APIs that support the core of API Evangelist, and to support the work I wrote four separate code generation tools:
<ul>
<li><strong>PHP Server - </strong>Generating a Slim PHP framework for my API, based upon Swagger definition.</li>
<li><strong>PHP Client -</strong> Assemble a custom PHP client of my design, using Swagger definition as guide.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Client -</strong>&nbsp;Assemble a custom JavaScript client of my design, using Swagger definition as guide.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL Database - </strong>Generate a MySQL script based upon the data models available in a Swagger definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Swagger, I can get myself 90-100% of the way for most of the common portions of the APIs I design. When writing a simple CRUD API like notes, or for links, I can auto-generate the PHP server, and a JS client, and underlying MySQL table structure, which in the end, runs perfectly with no changes.
<p>Once I needed more custom functionality, and have more unique API calls to make, I then have to get my hands dirty, and begin manually working in the code. However auto-generation of code sure gets me a long way down the road, saving me time doing the really mundane, heavy lifting in creating the skeleton code structures I need to get up an running with any new API.
<p>I&rsquo;m also exploring using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, complete with <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> references, and Docker image references to further bridge this gap. In my opinion, a Swagger definition for any API, can act as a fingerprint for which interfaces a docker image supports. I will write about this more in the future, as I produce better examples, but I'm finding that using APIs.json to bind a Swagger definition, with one or many Docker images, opens up a whole new view of how you can automate API deployment, management, and integration.

<p>With the other other 1231 mentioning application programming interface or API in the description of the patent. It will take time to understand the scope of role APIs play when APIs are just a metnion in the description, where patents that directly mention in title, and abstract, carry a little more weight. (at least for now)

<p>I&rsquo;m still learning, understanding, and making sense of these API related patents I&rsquo;m mining. I will work to read, and separate out the hardware related APIs, but only slightly off to the side, as I still think hardware APIs are extremely relevant with the latest IoT evolution. During the process, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll come up with other buckets to put APIs into, but ultimately looking to understand the role that APIs are playing in the patent game.
<p>I suspect that downloading the last 20+ years of patents, processing them looking for the phrases &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo;, or the acronym API, is just the beginning. As I read through the patents, learn about the ideas, people, and companies behind them, I&rsquo;m sure my understanding will expand greatly. I&rsquo;ll check in with more data after each import of files, and discovery of any new insights, and as always, you can find my <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">patent API research repository on Github</a>.

        <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-certificate.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>David Berlind&rsquo;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/dberlind">@dberlind</a>), <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/amid-api-copyright-controversy-api-patent-claim-surfaces/analysis/2015/01/23">Amid The API Copyright Controversy, An API Patent Claim Surfaces</a> story from this last Friday, planted some ideas in my head around APIs and patents&mdash;something that once takes hold, becomes hopeless for me to resist, and 48 hours later, here are my initial thoughts.
<p>Before I begin, let me state, patents and APIs, much like copryight and APIs, are not concepts I subscribe to, but because they are concepts that are being wielded in the API space, I am forced to enter the conversation.
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you read David&rsquo;s piece on Pokitdok&rsquo;s claim regarding their &ldquo;patent-pending API&rdquo; for yourself, something I find very troubling (about Pokitdok). My post is about my journey, after I read David's story, resulting in yet another&nbsp;<a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">research project into the politics of patents involving APIs</a>. After reading David's story this Saturday AM (yeah I need a life), I started &ldquo;googling&rdquo; the concept of API patents, just to educate myself&mdash;my eternal mission at API Evangelist.
<p>I was very surprised to find the number of results that come up when you search <a href="https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;gws_rd=ssl#tbm=pts&amp;q=application+programming+interface">Google Patents for the term &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo;</a>&mdash;about 552,000 results (0.32 seconds), to be precise. What does this mean? I start reading, and 48 hours later I&rsquo;m still reading. Sure there a number of older patents for hardware APIs, and even many APIs that were established during the web service heyday of the late 90&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s, but there is much more than that. I was surprised to see the number of patents with APIs as the main focus from API sector leaders like AWS, Twilio, Apigee, and Google.
<p>I have to start with two of the most ironic API patents i have found so far, during my search:
<ul>
<li><strong>Google</strong> (<a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/2012/04/google-acquires-unisys-patents/">Through Unisys Patent Portfolio Acquisition</a>) - <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US7437740?dq=Generation+of+Java+language+application+programming+interface+for+an+object-oriented+data+store&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5qDFVKq2BIaGyQTRyIC4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA">Generation of Java language application programming interface for an object-oriented data store</a></strong> - An embodiment of the present invention is a technique to interface to a repository. A connection between a client and a repository database is established. The repository database has a repository application programming interface (API). The repository database contains objects related to a project management process. The repository API is communicated with to perform an operation based on parameters passed from the client via the connection. A return value associated with the operation is returned to the client.</li>
<li><strong>CopyRightNow</strong> - <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20140214700?dq=Disclosed+herein+is+a+method+and+system+for+providing+copyright+protection+for+creative+works+from+within+a+running+content-creating+software+application&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IqHFVOqDDIOxyQSorIKwAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA">CopyRightNow Application Programming Interface</a></strong> - Disclosed herein is a method and system for providing copyright protection for creative works from within a running content-creating software application by assembling and submitting a copyright application on the creative work to the United States Copyright Office through the use of a portable application programming interface, which may be utilized by third-party content-creating applications.

</ul>
<p>I spent most of the day Saturday looking through API patents, trying to separate the hardware from software, and the API adjacent to the specific API patents. I began my journey at <a href="https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;gws_rd=ssl">Google Patent Search</a>, and eventually find myself using <a href="https://developers.google.com/patent-search/">Google Patent Search API</a> (now deprecated), until I hit the wall, and I end up at the original data source, processing XML files. I&rsquo;m only now getting to year 2013, after 24 hours or making sense of, writing a processing script, and downloading of patent XML files&mdash;so far I have 428 patents where &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo; shows up in the title, abstract, description, or anywhere else in the content of a patent application.
<p>You can view the <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html">entire patent listing here</a>, and get the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/patents/blob/gh-pages/data/patents.json">JSON file driving the listing here</a>--as I process each year, going back to 1990, I will publish the resulting JSON.
<p>My head is swimming. Once again I find myself neck deep in a concept I fundamentally disagree with, in hopes of understanding where the battle line exists within the API space, and educate myself enough so that I can articulate a line on this battlefield, in a war I refuse to participate in, yet I find myself sucked into.
<p>From what I can see, API related patents are not something that that will happen in the future, it is already happening, and has been for quite some time. Sure there are many things that need separating when evaluating the 550K API related patents, but after 48 hours of research, I have to say that APIs are being patented at an increasing rate, and is something we just don't talk about publicly.
<p>As I read through many of the titles, and abstracts, of the patent applications within each XML download I&rsquo;ve been processing, I feel like I&rsquo;m reading the antithesis of API Evangelist. On my blog I work every day to better understand how APIs are being used across each business sector, while looking to educate everyone about what is possible, sharing the best practices I discover along the way&mdash;when I read through the API patent abstracts, I see some very educated, and other not so educated bets on how APIs are being used, and where the future might be going, hoping to lock in these ideas, and extract value at some point in time.
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I understand that patents are a necessary evil in the world of big business and in startup-land, but it doesn&rsquo;t change my contempt for them. I&rsquo;m sure many of my API heroes like AWS and Twilio are just submitting patents in a defensive stance, but yet again it doesn&rsquo;t shift reduce my concern. To channel my worr around patents being applied in the world of APIs, I&rsquo;m kicking off <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">deeper research, and monitoring in this dark, un-discussed alley of the API economy</a>.
<p>To help me with my research I dowloaded all of 2014 patent submissions,  pulled out all the API related ones, and published as a patent API. To keep up with the amount of patent absurdity that I have read over this beautiful weekend, I have to state my own intent to submit a patent on providing patent APIs. I will take my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/patent/swagger.json">patent API design</a>, and ensure if you intend to ever organize your patents, and make accessible via APIs you have to pay the piper&mdash;cause you know, this is how this shit gets done!!

<p>i&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately, playing around with different approaches to deploying APIs in Docker containers. Part of this is because it is the latest trend in API deployment and management, but also because I&rsquo;m preparing for my talk at <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days in Sydney Australia</a> next month.
<p>I am always working to keep my keynotes in sync with not just my own work, but in alignment with where the wider conversation is going in the API space. I&rsquo;m building off my talk at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag last November</a>, which was titled, "<a href="https://kinlane.github.io/talks/defrag/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies.html">containers will do for APIs what APIs have done for companies</a>".
<p>The title of my talk at API Days in Sydney is, <em>"The Programmable World With APIs And Containers"</em>. While some of my talk will be inspirational, trying to understand where we are headed with APIs and containers, much of it will also be rooted in my own work to run my own business world using APIs and Docker, and using APIs.json and Swagger to help me orchestrate my resources.
<p>I apologize for the gaps in my normal writing, and the heavy focus on Docker lately, but it is where my mind is at, from an operational standpoint, in preparation for the conversation in Australia, and from what I&rsquo;m seeing, it is in sync with the wider API and cloud computing conversation.

<p>The API space is continuing its rapid expansion, and along with the number of API design, deployment, management, and integration providers, and the number of API conferences, there are some new sources of discussion around APIs--one as a YouTube Channel, and the other as a SoundCloud podcast.
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">API Workshop</a> -</strong> We'll discuss topics around API Design, including: sustainability concepts: how to design APIs that last, new ideas in API design, voices and posts from the API blog world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/apisuncensored">APIsUncensored</a> -</strong> The official home of the APIs Uncensored podcast, a monthly series where Ole Lensmar and Lorinda Brandon blather about all things APIs with experts in the industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>API Workshop is a production by J(a)son Harmon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jharmn">@jharmn</a>), and APIsUncensored is from the smart folks over at <a href="https://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a>(when describing them I always feel tricked into saying they are smart). I was honored to have mentions in both of them, and you can read <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/rest-api-design-bridging-what-we-have-to-the-future-by-organizing-the-json-junk-drawer/">my response to API Workshop here</a>, and to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/23/a-conversation-about-my-subway-map-api-on-the-apisuncensored-podcast/">APIsUncensored over here</a>.
<p>In my opnion, it is a healthy sign for the space to see more video and audio outlets emerge&mdash;the space needs as many open voices, educating the masses as it can possess. Maybe soon we'll need an aggregator of all the sources of great information! (get to work on that please)
<p>I posted a video in response to my reference in the API Workshop episode, in addition to my blog post. Something I&rsquo;m working on for APIsUncensored as well, continuing to expand my presence on these important channels. Personally I&rsquo;m a big podcast listener, over YouTubing, but everyone has a different set of frequencies they tune into, and I think it is important to maximize the reach.
<p>Now if only we could get the next episode of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic &amp; Weather!</a> Wink, Wink!

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/subway-map-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>There is a new podcast on SoundCloud called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/apisuncensored">APIsUncensored</a>, from the folks over at SmartBear. I was honored to have a mention in the first episode, where they brought up a project I did a couple of months back, which I called the <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html">Subway Map API</a>. I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/my-turkey-holiday-project-a-subway-map-api/">published a full story on what I was doing</a>, and launched  supporting Github repo, and API, but the work was very much a weekend side project, and something that will need a lot more love before it goes anywhere.
<p>Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>) admitted that when he introduced the project, he didn&rsquo;t really get it, but ultimately in their segment, they accomplished what I was looking to do&mdash;stimulate conversation. The Subway Map API isn&rsquo;t about the ideas I plotted on the map for API Evangelist, it is about the format for grouping, and mapping out iof deas&mdash;then evolving them through conversation. Don&rsquo;t get hung up on my groupings of API design, deployment, management, etc., because my mission is to help introduce people to the world of providing and consuming APIs.
<p>The goal of the project is to provide a platform where anyone can step up and frame a conversation about the lifecycle that means the most to them, their company, their products, and industry. When I first published the proejct, I quickly sent it out to two groups:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a></strong> - Life-cycle to 3Scale is about helping people manage the APIs they&rsquo;ve deployed, and I will be helping create a v1 map, based upon great work that Manfred has done on this subject.</li>
<li><strong><a title="SmartBear" href="https://bit.ly/1oy8CIN">SmarBear</a></strong> - Life-cycle to SmartBear is about helping people monitor, test, and understand the APIs they posses, and if you guys have any stories on your blog to help me see this vision, I can help translate into a map.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get hung up on the maps I created, and don&rsquo;t even get hung up on it being a subway map. As Ole mentioned you can add bus routes, train routes, etc. Via the API you can control the color, shapes, direction, connectors and labels for every aspect of the map. If you want to draw a straight line with 10 dots in a row, go for it. If you want to draw a big circle with 10 stops along the way, going all the back to the beginning, go for it.
<p>The <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html">Subway Map API</a> project was a fun thing I did for the weekend, and was looking to jump-start the conversation, something I think I did--eventually I&rsquo;d love for someone to build an interface for facilitating this conversation. John Musser nailed it when he articulated the overall objective, and that is to create the most meaningful visual as possible, to help someone understand a Wycliffe related to the world of APIs. Think of John&rsquo;s series of hockey stick API growth charts, or his API business  models diagrams, these have become ubiquitous in API discussions, and if you create the next generation one for API design, deployment, management, integration, or other&mdash;you win!
<p>I'll work on a video response to go with this story. I&rsquo;m neck deep in API-micro-service-docker-land, and don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth to pull head up, I love the conversation!

        <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Httphub-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I come across a lot of API related companies during my monitoring of the space, which I queue up, and as I have time, I work to explore and understand what they do. One company that I&rsquo;ve had open in a tab for the last week is <a href="https://www.httphub.com/">HTTPHUB</a>.
<p>HTTPHUB is very interesting. It starts by giving you a root namespace, like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://kinlane.httphub.com</span>, and from there I can add on any resources on, and make it either public or private&mdash;then I can POST any JSON to this resource in the body. So I could create <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://kinlane.httphub.com/notes/</span>, and craft a simple form + script to post any data I submit to my HTTPHUB resource.
<p>I think that HTTPHUB captures the simplicity of APIs. Obviously the system will have some limitations, but ultimately it makes on boarding with the concept of APIs, and getting up and running with an API backend as frictionless as possible. HTTPHUB also gives you logging, and user management for your namespace, adding some other essential elements you will need for your API backend.
<p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Httphub-examples.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>Here are some of the features of an HTTPHUB account:
<ul>
<li>Unlimited requests (rate limited)</li>
<li>3Gb of storage space</li>
<li>300.000 resources</li>
<li>3.000 namespace users</li>
<li>3Mb Max POST size</li>
<li>Signup and quota management for namespace users</li>
<li>Authenticate with credentials or IP address</li>
<li>Register up to 5 different accounts using the same email address</li>
</ul>
<p>HTTPHUB also provides a pretty slick demo feature, using demo test data, in conjunction with <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>. They provide you with a link to the Postman Chrome app, and a link to a collection file that you can import. This gives you a listing of all of the base endpoints for HTTPHUB, which you can then use to expand, and manage your HTTPHUB API backend--no programming necessary.
<p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/">HTTPHUB</a> is most interesting to me because its simple, intuitive, and potentially something you could self-define exactly the backend resources you need, as you need them. Imagine if applications could grow its own backend? Allowing end-users to add to their world, changing how they store contacts, or take notes&mdash;using a backend that flexes, grows, and fits end-users needs like a glove.

        <p><a href="https://www.postman.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>I've been a <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> user for a while, as a tool for quickly making API calls against the APIs I use most, and explore the new APIs I discover daily. As I use Postman, I can't help but think the concept of assembling collections of API calls using Postman, is in sync with part of our vision for <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>--we just need a common way to communicate.
<p>APIs.json is not just for defining the API operations that exist within a specific domain, which is the most common approach, it is also about assembling collections of multiple APIs, for a specific purpose. In my mind, the motivations for assembling Postman collections, and APIs.json collections are definitely in alignment.
<p>Similar to providing resources for translating between popular API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, I want to make sure and translate between emerging API discovery and collection formats. While I&rsquo;d love for APIs.json to become the default standard for API discovery, I&rsquo;m happy to embrace other formats, designed for other API tools&mdash;as long as they are striving to be as open as they can.

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-hourglass.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" />
<p>I sign up for a lot of APIs, and when I encounter a frictionless on-boarding process, I feel the need to showcase, and help everyone understand how important it is to make the process as easy as possible. I'm still amazed at how many new APIs make this really, really hard. I will write a separate story after this about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how not to on-board with an API</span>, but for now lets take a look at a kick-ass example.
<p>This example comes from the&nbsp;<a href="https://niaid.github.io/3dpx_api/">National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange API</a>. When it comes to signing up for API access, the only thing that can make this easier is providing an API for the process, but for right from the home page you can signup for an API key.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-1.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" />
<p>Once I provide my first name, last name, email, and optionally some details on how I will use the APIs, I am given my API key. I don&rsquo;t have to click again to find my API key, and I&rsquo;m given an example API call, complete with my API key.&nbsp;
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-2.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" />
<p>My first click gives me the instant gratification I am looking for via a simple API call, resulting in an example JSON response. I do not have to work to find my key or figure out how to make my first API call, it is all given to me immediately.
<p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-3.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" />
<p>I'm up and running with the&nbsp;NIH 3D Print Exchange API in two clicks. I don't have to fill out a long form, wait for access, or work to find my keys, and fumble with how to make my first API call. To reenforce this, I look in my email inbox, and there is an email providing my API keys again, along with the link to make my first API call.
<p><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-4.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" />
<p>Like I said above, the only thing that would make that easier, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">is for all of this to be a series of API calls, which would make the on-boarding process programmatic</a>. Eventually I could see this being essential, but for now I'm happy to see them not only standardizing API on-boarding across federal agencies, but making it as dead simple as you possibly can.
<p>I'm a big fan of frictionless API on-boarding, and I applaud NIH and 18F for their work on the&nbsp;NIH 3D Print Exchange API. I will keep an eye on future releases, for more stories on healthy patterns I'm seeing in API deployment in the federal government.
<p><em><strong>Update: </strong>I'm aware I left my keys in these pics, it was easier to reset them, then to blurr them out, and I think it helps with point. ;-)</em>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://ridb-dev.nsitellc.com/docs/api/v1/#introduction"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ridb-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I referenced the <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/">Recreation Information Database (RIDB)</a>, in my story late last year, when I was <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/16/i-need-help-to-make-sure-the-dept-of-agriculture-leads-with-apis-in-their-parks-and-recreation-rfp/">asking for your help to make sure the Department of Agriculture leads with APIs in their parks and recreation RFP</a>.  I'm not exactly sure where it fits in with the RFP, because the RIDB spans multiple agencies.
<p>Here is the description from the RIDB site:
<blockquote><em>RIDB is a part of the Recreation One Stop (Rec1Stop) project, initiated as a result of a government modernization study conducted in 2004. Rec1Stop provides a user-friendly, web-based resource to citizens, offering a single point of access to information about recreational opportunities nationwide. The web site represents an authoritative source of information and services for millions of visitors to federal lands, historic sites, museums, and other attractions/resources.</em></blockquote>
<p>When I wrote the post last October, I referenced the <a href="http://ridb-dev.nsitellc.com/docs/api/v1/RIDB_API_Requirements_20150113.pdf">PDF for the REST API Requirements for the US Forest Service Recreation Information Database (RIDB</a>), but this week I got an update, complete with <a href="http://ridb-dev.nsitellc.com/docs/api/v1/#introduction">fresh links to a preview of a pretty well designed API</a>, complete with <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">documentation developed using Slate</a>.
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually hacked on the endpoints, but I took a stroll through the docs, and my first impression was it is well designed, and robust, including resources for organizations involved with the RDB, recreational areas, facilities, campsites, permit entrances, tours, activities, events, media, and links.  The RIDB documentation also includes details on errors, pagination, version, and a data dictionary, and the on-boarding was frictionless when looking to get a key.
<p>Everything is in dev mode with the RIDB API, and the team is looking for feedback. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure they wanted me to publish as story on API Evangelist, but I figure the more people involved the better, as I&rsquo;m not sure when I&rsquo;ll get around to actually hacking on the API. I&rsquo;m happy to see such a quick iteration towards the next generation of the RIDB API, and it makes me hopeful to be covering so many new API efforts out of the federal government in a single day.

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MBXsmSrKE8"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/REST-API-Design-Avoid-future-proofing-with-the-JSON-junk-drawer-YouTube.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>API storyteller J(a)son Harmon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jharmn">@jharmn</a>) has a new YouTube channel up called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">API Workshop</a>. He's going to be publishing regular API design workshop episodes, with the latest one titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">REST API Design: Avoid future proofing with the JSON junk drawer</a>. J(a)son provides a nice overview of how you should be structuring the JSON for your API, focusing on the usage of key / value stores. Ironically he uses APIs.json as an example of why you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SHOULD NOT</strong></span> use custom key / values within your JSON. What is ironic about this, is that he makes the case for APIs.json properties, giving me a great starting point for helping folks better understand <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and why properties are key to its evolution, and flexibility.
<p>The process J(a)son outlines in the portion of this segment that referred to APIs.json, describes the lifecycle of an APIs.json property, towards becoming more of a "first class property". There are three phases of an APIs.json property:
<ol>
<li><strong>X-Property - </strong>A user defined property, allowing anyone to craft exactly the properties that matter to them</li>
<li><strong>Property - </strong>An official machine readable APIs.json property element, acknowledging its wide usage, potential as common blueprint</li>
<li><strong>"First Class Property or Collection"&nbsp;</strong>- Baking a property into the specification as default property of APIs collection, or establishing as sub-collection for the API</li>
</ol>
<p>The lesson J(a)son provides, describes the journey of each APIs.json property, the difference is in that his lesson provides best practices for API providers who are designing new APIs, helping them avoid the creation of a junk drawer, and the APIs.json property format is being applied to define the junk drawer that we have (aka the public API space). This represents the fundamental separation between my approach to defining the space vs. many other technologists&mdash;I am trying to map out what we have, and get us the next step in our evolution, while others are working hard to define where we should be going.
<p>When Steve and I originally hammered out the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a>, we couldn't 100% agree on what should be first class properties and collections for each API defined using an APIs.json file&mdash;what you see in version 0.14 is what we agreed to, the rest needs to be defined by the community, through actually implementations and discussion on the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">APIs.json Github repo</a>.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-recycling.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>When you are crafting the JSON, for a new API, J(a)son&rsquo;s lesson is very important, but when you are evaluating hundreds of APIs, and trying to define a common pattern for representing not just the tech, but the business, and politics of an API&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have as much control over how things get defined. I&rsquo;m not worried about the overhead involved with adding a little more complexity to my code, to bridge the well-defined aspects of API operations with the lesser-defined parts of the space.
<p>Ideally, in one of the next iterations of APIs.json, the official properties of Swagger, RAML, Blueprint, and WADL can move up into a first class collection for each API called definitions, and maybe also consider moving API Commons up to be a first class licensing collection as well.  I&rsquo;m also looking to graduate some X-properties to official status, based upon <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">creating APIs.json for over 700+ companies</a>, and having identified almost <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/properties.json">150 separate properties that can be used to describe API operations</a>. All of this represents the API sector coming into focus, and I do not think all of these properties should become "first class" properties or collections&mdash;I am just trying to make sense of the "junk drawer" that we have, and help provide a blueprint for a machine readable formats that can help us evolve it towards the future we want.
<p>I have been asked by several folks to better explain Steve and mine APIs.json vision, and J(a)son&rsquo;s story gives me the opportunity to help kick off this storytelling. In an effort to keep this story short, I&rsquo;m going to follow J(a)son&rsquo;s lead and move the rest of this story on to YouTube, so if you want to better understand APIs.json properties, you can watch my video response to J(a)son's story, which augments this post, and hopefully provides some better examples, along with narrative.

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-no.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" />
<p>I wrote a piece earlier today about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/this-is-how-you-onboard-with-an-api/">kick-ass on-boarding process at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange API</a>--within two clicks I had my API key and was making an API call. To contrast this post I wanted to provide an example of how not to on-board with an API.
<p>I am always amazed at how hard people make it to sign up and play with an API in 2015. Today's example of on-boarding with the most friction you can imagine comes from the <a href="https://developer.garmin.com/wellness-api/request-the-api/">Garmin Wellness API</a>--I think their API signup form speaks for itself.
<p><a href="https://developer.garmin.com/wellness-api/request-the-api/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/garmin-onboarding-form.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a>
<p>I understand you are worried about what people might do with your API, but that is kind of the whole point of doing an API. If you are looking to encourage innovation on your API, this is not how you want to on-board your developers, and make a first impression.
<p>There are other ways to manage API integrations without restricting users from day one. Make sure and help make API on-boarding as frictionless as possible, there is no reason to use a form like Garmin has.
