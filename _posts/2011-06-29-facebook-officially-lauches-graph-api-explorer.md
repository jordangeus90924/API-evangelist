{% include JB/setup %}<p>Facebook just officially launched the Graph API Explorer, a tool allowing developers to quickly explore the social graph of people, photos, events, pages and the relationships between them, via the Facebook Graph API.Like other API explorers, the Graph API Explorer allows developers to make requests against the API and see formatted results in-line.The Graph API Explorer interface allows you to obtain an access_token with the specific permissions necessary to access data, navigating the same permissions dialog users will see when permissions are requested in a production app.The Graph API Explorer then allows developers to switch between HTTP GET, POST and DELETE to get, create, update or delete objects.When POSTing to the API, you can also provide a list of fields and values that you want to send as parameters to the API.</p>
