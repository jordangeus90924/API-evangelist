It will be [3 months since the White House CiO Steven VanRoekel released a federal API strategy][1], entitled "[Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People][2]", part of the [Executive Order 13571][3], directing all federal departments and agencies to make open data, content and web APIs the new default.

This Thursday, August 23rd 2012 will be the first major milestone for departments and agencies, where they should have met two goals:

  * **2.1 -** Engage with customers to identify at least two existing major customer-facing services that contain high-value data or content as first-move candidates to make compliant with new open data, content, and web API policy
  * **7.1 -** Engage with customers to identify at least two existing priority customer-facing services to optimize for mobile use

Iâ€™ve been [monitoring 246 departments and agencies][4] and so far three have released drafts of their strategy:
