			<p><em>30 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>While writing about the&nbsp;history of APIs, it is easy to be so focused on just APIs, that you overlook the single most important player in the entire history of the web API--ProgrammableWeb. In July 2005, John Musser started ProgrammableWeb. According to his original about page: ProgrammableWeb is a web-as-platform reference site and blog delivering news, information and resources for developing applications using the Web 2.0 APIs. I started this site because I couldn't find what I was looking for: a technology focused&nbsp;starting point for web platform development. (For a bit more see my initial post.) Although no guarantees, the last time I started a reference site it somehow became Google's highest rated link on the topic. Given that this site will be a collaborative effort with community input as well, this can be what we make it. I hope you find the site useful. John Musser - Seattle, August 2005 I think John&rsquo;s&nbsp;original blog post&nbsp;on why he started ProgrammableWeb, says it all:&nbsp;Why? Because going From Web Page to Web Platform is a big deal. Web APIs are a big deal! Whether its social networking, government, healthcare or education--having a programmable platform to make data and resources available will be a critical part of how commerce and society operates from here on forward. &nbsp;&nbsp; John made a early decision to showcase open and RESTful approaches to deploying APIs vs. parallel attempts of&nbsp;Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) and&nbsp;Web Services, and focused on telling stories about open APIs--way before it was the thing to do in Silicon Valley. When I started API Evangelist in July 2010 (5 years after PW), and started talking about the business of APIs, the technology of web APIs was already widely accepted in Silicon Valley, because of the stories John Musser and Adam Duvander have told on ProgrammableWeb. As we close 2012, a year in which I think we can confidently say APIs are moving mainstream, and I feel we owe much of the success...[<a href="/2012/12/30/history-of-apis-programmableweb/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>Here is a video of one of my talks from&nbsp;API Days in Paris, France where I walked the internal side of APIs. This talk is derived from my post, the secret to amazons success is internal and stories I've written on Netflix's success with internal APIs.
The presentation for this talk is available in my talks section at The Secret to a Successful ApI is Internal.

You can find another video from API Days by me called Business Models For Your API as Startup from API Days, in a nearlier post.

			<p><em>28 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>
You can learn a lot from the history of APIs, and following what the pioneers are doing. &nbsp;Salesforce isn't the coolest API within the Hacker News community, but when it comes to building an API ecosystem--Salesforce knows what they are doing.
I was reading through the Salesforce top developers highlights of 2012. &nbsp;Their highlights doesn't just showcase the success of the community, but what Salesforce feels is critical to keeping their ecosystem healthy.&nbsp;

800,000 developers and climbing:&nbsp;the Salesforce Platform Developer Community is growing at an unprecedented rate.
Cool new Salesforce technologies:&nbsp;Identity,&nbsp;Salesforce Touch Platform,&nbsp;Force.com Canvas, and&nbsp;Java on Heroku&nbsp;for the Enterprise were released.
Content is king:&nbsp;Great books such as&nbsp;The Salesforce Touch Platform Mobile Development Guide&nbsp;and Dan Appleman&rsquo;s new book&nbsp;Advanced Apex Programming for Salesforce.com&nbsp;hit the shelves.
Community is making noise:&nbsp;Salesforce Stack Exchange&nbsp;launched and is already at&nbsp;1,000 users.&nbsp;Developer User Groups&nbsp;have grown to 60 groups across the globe and climbing.
New leaders have emerged:&nbsp;Andy Boettcher,&nbsp;Junji Imaoka,&nbsp;Keir Bowden,&nbsp;Sanuki Ikou,&nbsp;Simon Goodyear&nbsp;&nbsp;are the most recent MVPs to join ranks of the&nbsp;Force.com MVP Program.
We are staying connected, more often and in more ways:&nbsp;Webinars,&nbsp;CodeTalks,&nbsp;Google+ Hangouts,&nbsp;Facebook,Twitter,&nbsp;Discussion Boards, and the list goes on.
Developer Events of Epic Proportions:&nbsp;10,000 Developers at Dreamforce &lsquo;12 with close to&nbsp;300 sessions, Developer Zones at Cloudforce in New York, Tokyo, and London, and Developer Weeks in Brazil and India.

What I hear when I read this list is that to get to 800K developers (holy shit), you need to constantly release new technologies, product resources and content to support your platform, give your community a voice with an emphasis on showcasing the leaders--while also engaging with developers both online and offline.

Salesforce has been building their API ecosystem for 12 years! &nbsp;Twice as long as Twitter. &nbsp;What they highlight as part of their developer community in 2012 is something you should be doing in your own developer community.

			<h3><a href="/2012/12/27/new-api-stories-in-2013/">New API Stories in 2013</a></h3>
			<p><em>27 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Storytelling in the API industry is critical to the healthy growth of the space.  John Musser and ProgrammableWeb have been telling great stories in the tech industry, since way before APIs were all lthe rage they are now.
While I was at API Days this year,  I was speaking with Mike Amundsen (@mamund) of Layer7, and we started talking about how Amazon, Netflix (and I&rsquo;d add Twilio) tend to dominate the API discussion.  I considered my talks from API Days, and sure enough--Netflix and Amazon were in there multiple times!
There are other stories we tell around Twitter, Facebook Google and other smaller APIs, but Amazon, Netflix and Twilio were cornerstones of API folklore in 2012.  While I will keep telling these pillar stories (because they matter), as well as evolving other pioneers from my history of APIs section, I want to develop a fresh lineup of amazing API stories for 2013.
Stories like Johnson Control's, Panoptix API, and how a 125 year old company can change their culture and embrace a new way of doing business via APIs.
I will make sure there is easy access to the classic Amazon, Netflix and Twilio API stories.  I will also be adding new versions of some other classic stories from Salesforce, eBay, Flickr and other API pioneers.  But in 2013 I will be working to find a new set of API stories from brands and companies we know.
If you have an API success story you&rsquo;d like to share, please let me know.

			<p><em>27 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>I'm immersed in deep thought around my personal data, asking some important questions about my digital self--which includes the state of my online personal data. After reading 14 big trends to watch in 2013, by Alex Howard (@digiphile), I got immersed in World Economic Forums Personal Data: The Emergence of a New Asset Class paper. I'm still processing all of my thoughts around the paper, but one statement really stands out: The issues surrounding personal data &ndash; political, technological and commercial alike &ndash; are numerous and complex. The choices stakeholders make today will influence the personal data ecosystem for years to come. The World Economic Forum then outlines five key area that require action: Innovate around user-centricity and trust. The personal data ecosystem will be built on the trust and control individuals have in sharing their data. From a technological, policy and sociological sense all stakeholders need to embrace this construct. One particular area of focus is the continued testing and promoting of &ldquo;trust frameworks&rdquo; that explore innovative approaches for identity assurance at Internet scale Define global principles for using and sharing personal data. Given the lack of globally accepted policies governing the use and exchange of personal data, an international community of stakeholders should articulate and advance core principles of a user-centric personal data ecosystem. These pilots should invite real-world input from a diverse group of individuals who can not only articulate the values, needs and desires of end users, but also the complex and contextual nuances involved in revealing one&rsquo;s digital identity Strengthen the dialog between regulators and the private sector. Building on a collective sense of fundamental principles for creating a balanced ecosystem, public and private stakeholders should actively collaborate as the ecosystem begins to take shape. Those responsible for building and deploying the tools (the technologists) should more closely align with those making the rules (regulators) Focus on interoperability and open standards.

			<p>The end of the year is a great time to reflect--looking back at the year with a desire to quantify and understand ourselves. With our increasingly digital (social, cloud, mobile, APIs) lives, there are more opportunities than ever to ask our digital self very specific questions, and with the power the API get an answer back. Over the holidayz, I spent some time asking some questions I wanted to know about my world in 2012--things that were important to me, and help me feel healthy, happy, accomplished and ultimately successful. (aka.&nbsp;Optimize for Happiness) I broke these questions up into interest areas, then using APIs set out to find the services I use, or could use, that would help me answer these questions.

			<p>I was scrolling through my feeds today and I came across, "Earth As Art" from NASA. I clicked on the homepage and didn&rsquo;t think much, and moved on. Then I came across Earth as Art book from NASA on Flowing Data, where they showed an actual image from the &ldquo;Earth As Art&rdquo; collection. Sure, I suffer from ADD. But so does much of the world. I work through huge amounts of data on a daily basis, looking for gems. Sometimes I can find them myself, and sometimes I need help. The &ldquo;Earth as Art&rdquo; is an amazing collection of satellite photos from NASA. I feel the entire collection could be made into an exhibit, allowing us to experience, take in and discuss the meaning of art, created from space of the planet we live on. I also feel NASA&rsquo;s Earth as Art I think is a poster boy example of how APIs can open up and provide access to content, but also work as conduit for syndication, sharing, remixing and expression around content the owner may not have been able to see. The deployment of the Earth as Art collection at NASA has a title, description and meaningless photo thumbnail--accompanied by a PDF and iPad app. Obviously NASA saw the value in delivering an iPad app, and making the content accessible to the masses via a PDF. As soon as I saw the images I want to create something that would share, syndicate and bring awareness to their beauty. My hands are immediately tied, with only a PDF and iPad app--I am not equipped with the tools of a developer. If there were simply a JSON file of all images, titles, locations and details. Before I got to work, I looked around, but couldn&rsquo;t find any raw data for the project. So I created my own JSON representation of the Earth as Art PDF. JSON output is so much more valuable than PDF output. It...[<a href="/2012/12/22/amazing-visuals-but-lack-of-api-imagination/">Read More</a>]</p>

There is an OG API t-shirt that recirculated this week for me--the You Can't Spell Capitalism Without API. &nbsp;This is an awesome shirt from the social advertising platform, 140 Proof. &nbsp;
140 Proof launched the shirt at the Twitter Chirp Conference, and I think it is a classic, that should never go away.

			<p>In addition to helping people understand the history of APIs, I'm looking to help people grasp what the future holds, when it comes to APIs.&nbsp;So, while tracking on the API industry, I'm always on the lookout for patterns of API usage that can help me understand what might be next for the web API movement.&nbsp;
Based upon what I'm seeing across the space I launched a new trends section to API Evangelist, where I'm gathering news, analysis and company data in seven separate areas:

			<h3><a href="/2012/12/20/history-of-apis/">History of APIs</a></h3>
			<p><em>20 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>The history of APIs is something I discuss a lot. &nbsp;The history of modern web APIs is something I include in all my talks, and I'm always surprised by how little people understand some of the more popular APIs that got us to where we are at. To further support this area, I've launched a History of APIs section where I've hung the stories I've already done in this area, and will be looking to dig up the history on other APIs that are shaking things up. When I'm talking to people about APIs, the term APIs can mean many different things. Sometimes it means hardware APIs, or the Java API or various other technical incarnations. Right now when you hear the term API, it probably means web API or an API built using REST, running on the same infrastructure the World Wide Web runs on. When it comes to APIs, I strongly feel that to understand where we are, we need to understand the short, modern history of the web APIs. There are several patterns to why the modern web API movement has worked, that I think you can take home and use in your own API strategy. Commerce While modern web APIs were officially born with&nbsp;Roy Fieldings dissertation Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures in 2000--Web APIs first appeared in the wild with the&nbsp;introduction of Salesforce&nbsp;on February 7th, when the company officially launched its API at the IDG Demo 2000 conference. Salesforce was an enterprise-class, web-based, sales force automation as a "Internet as a service", with XML APIs were part of Salesforce.com from day one. &nbsp;Salesforce&nbsp; Later in the year, on November 20, 2000,&nbsp;eBay launched the eBay Application Program Interface (API), along with the eBay Developers Program--which was originally rolled out to only a select number of licensed eBay partners and developers. &nbsp;Ebay Then on July 16, 2002,&nbsp;Amazon launched Amazon.com Web Services&nbsp;allowing developers to incorporate Amazon.com content and features into...[<a href="/2012/12/20/history-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Here is a video of one of my talks from API Days in Paris, France where I walked through potential thoughts on business model for a hypothetical startup. &nbsp;I had a separate talk prepared, but after attending the first day I went and found a french cafe, drank a couple bottles of wine, took what I learned and produced this talk.

If you want to see my slide deck from this talk, you can find a published version business for your API as a startup, using deck.js off my talks sections of API Evangelist.
Thanks again to Faber Novel and Webshell for putting on such a great event, and producing these cool videos.

			<p><em>19 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m working hard to understand the emerging patterns of of how APIs used, work through the details, and grasp the differences in competing approaches--in hopes of identifying what is next when it comes to web APIs. One trend I&rsquo;m tracking on is the emergence of API scripting platforms. This is a difficult are to track on, because we script against APIs all the time, right? This is different. Scripting platforms are providing platforms and libraries to support easily scripting against multiple APIs. To help me understand this new approach to using APIs I&rsquo;m studying three separate approaches: Webshell - Authentication, integration and scripting platform. Temboo - Beyond&nbsp;code snippets, into ready-to-use processes, that simply API integration, taking care of authentication, credential management, updates and more Google Apps Scripts -&nbsp;A JavaScript cloud scripting language that lets you extend Google Apps, integrate 3rd party services and build mobile and web applications. All three of these platforms are bringing together valuable API resources, from multiple sources into not just a common interface, but providing a language library you can use to build apps efficiently across multiple API resources. I&rsquo;m still working to understand the nuances of each approach. For example, Google provides its JavaScript like, stripped down language, where Webshell focuses on JavaScript and CoffeeScript. Temboo provides ready to go processes or what they call choreos, with language SDKs in Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby and Python. Google Apps Script provides access to Google APIs and services, but recently opened up scripts to acts as connectors, that can be developed by 3rd party providers. Temboo has over 100 APIs in its library, while Webshell is just getting going with less than 25. I see what Webshell, Temboo and Google are doing as similar to the aggregation, integration and some times automation we are seeing in other trending API areas, but these approaches are actually building languages that allow you to be more expressive with not just single APIs, but fluently...[<a href="/2012/12/19/taking-apis-to-next-level-with-api-scripting-platforms/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I'm working on a new trends section of API Evangelist. &nbsp;One area i'm tracking on is the opportunities around 3D printing and APIs. &nbsp;
I did some fun research, and laid down some interest thoughts on APIs and 3D printing in 2011. &nbsp;This was part of some research I was doing while working at Mimeo. &nbsp;
As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts. With this trends research into 3D printing, I am working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact.&nbsp;
I've identified 10 major components of 3D printing:

Creators&nbsp;- 3D designers of virtual print objects
Scanners&nbsp;- Scanning hardware for generating 3D models
Modeling Software&nbsp;- Applications for building 3D models
File Formats&nbsp;- File formats for storing 3D models
Warehousing&nbsp;- Virtual storage for 3D models
Marketplaces&nbsp;- Arenas for showcasing, distributing and ordering 3D products
Printers&nbsp;- Companies and hardware that deliver 3D printing
Process &amp; Materials&nbsp;- The process and materials that go into 3D printing
Makers&nbsp;- The people who understand 3D printers, process, materials and industries
Delivery&nbsp;- Logistics behind getting 3D printed products to consumers

Of course this is just my perspective of the industry and can evolve as I learn more, and collaborate with other industry players.&nbsp;
This series was just to help me understand the major components, and I will do another series on how APIs can impact these areas. &nbsp;I also have a summary post on&nbsp;ProgrammableWeb.com&nbsp;about the role of APIs in 3D printing.
3D Printing is something I will be talking about a lot in 2013. &nbsp;I think all of these areas I laid out have the potential to be radically transformed by APIs. &nbsp;I will be taking my original research on 3D printing from 2011 and see where I can evolve it based upon what is going on in the 3D printing space in 2013. &nbsp;&nbsp;

The number of available APIs is growing at a neck breaking speed.  I have trouble keeping up with individual APIs, and I feel I am losing touch with the nuances and trends within specific areas like music or travel.
I am getting more and more questions like this via email and twitter:

I am doing some research on music APIs. I am considering using one to integrate music streaming and relevant data into an app.  Can you recommend anyone who has technical or business expertise (or both) with these in particular?  I would love to speak with an expert to help lead me and my developers in the right direction.  Some points I am considering:

Technical capabilities (streaming speed, limitations of service, etc.)
Access to support from API parent company
Business opportunities or restrictions that arise when relying on the API


These are concerns that might be shared with other industries, but knowing the music industry--there are plenty of unique issues developers encounter when building applications and businesses around music APIs.
Back in February, I did write on how EMI is helping developers navigate building apps for the music industry, but beyond just shedding light on what others are doing, I don&rsquo;t have the time to specialize in the details of how APIs are transforming the music industry.
There is a huge need for more professionals to step up within specific industries and develop the domain expertise necessary to make sure APIs are being deployed with the proper technical, business and political building blocks, and help developers understand how to navigate the nuances of a particular industry being transformed by web APIs.
Could you be this person, feel free to connect with me. &nbsp;I see a desperate need for experts in the music industry, education, health care, government and other fast moving business sectors.

I had a chance to talk with the Johnson Controls, Panoptix API team this last week.  The Panoptix&reg; community&nbsp;offers:
a combination of software and services that easily and cost-effectively helps customers see more so they can do more to achieve optimized building performance and energy efficiency
To understand what Panoptix enables...imagine if all of our buildings:

Thought for themselves
Teach us to reduce energy consumption
Diagnose problems in real-time
Self correct when necessary
Call a service provider when they need repair or tuning

Panoptix starts with a cloud-hosted platform that enables buildings to collect and manage data, along with tools for automating operations at the building and space levels providing metering for electricity, water, gas oil steam, carbon and weather--with very granular level reporting up to overall trends of energy use.
To grow Panoptix, Johnson Controls introduced a marketplace of apps combined with supporting news, information, resources and entire community dedicated to building performance and efficiency management.
This marketplace and community is driven by an&nbsp;API developer area, allowing anyone to sign up and get to work developing apps and start selling them in the Panoptix marketplace.  The Panoptix API is free to use for anyone looking to developer one app, allowing you to collect 70% of revenue from app sales in the marketplace (an essential ingredient for developer success).
I like Johnson Controls approach to building a community around building management applications, data and resources--complete with a API driven developer area.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s great to see a 125 year old company open up their hardware and software with such an innovative approach.
I&rsquo;ll be digging further into how Johnsons Controls deployed the Panoptix API, with further entries to this blog series, and a full case study on their approach to delivering their API driven building management platform.

			<p><em>17 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Some great API questions for Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier over at Startup Juicer today.
Zapier is a company that couldn&rsquo;t have existed even a few years ago as API&rsquo;s were not commonplace. What other advanced do you envision changing the way businesses operate?
APIs are just the first piece, but it&rsquo;s still the wild west in the API world with APIs constantly changing. One thing that will happen is APIs will move away from polling driven to push driven. That way API consumers don&rsquo;t have to constantly asking providers for new data like a kid on a long trip asking &ldquo;are we there yet&rdquo; but can instead rely on the API provider to send us the data when we get to the proverbial travel destination.
What your thoughts are about the changing landscape of API access with some of the free big networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin are becoming increasingly restrictive in the way they allow developers to access their feeds?

The only services I&rsquo;m seeing become more restrictive in how they allow developers to use their APIs are free tools. Many those services are in the high growth stage and are starting to think about monetization and are experimenting with lots of different ways to make money. Unfortunately this means instability for developers. Zapier leans heavily B2B though. And B2B services are doubling down on their APIs. For them, more usage of the API leads to more usage of the core product and since their core product is a paid service that means more paying users and the paying users are upgrading to higher plans. That means a service like Zapier is highly valuable to both API providers and to consumers alike.
Those are just two of the questions Startup Juicer asked, head over to the full interview with Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier at Startup Juicer.

API service provider APIphany followed some of my advice this last week, and added support for Github, Facebook and Twitter in all of their developer portals.
Using oAuth from Twitter, Facebook and especially Github for API providers, just makes sense in this online world.  As a user, I don&rsquo;t want to create yet another login--I want to pick from my preferred social network.
It is good to see APIphany make sure their customers deliver friction-less onboarding for their developers, who are building mobile and web applications on top of their APIphany powered APIs.

			<p><em>12 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>I started tracking on Hackathons full time in 2011, as part of my API Evangelism toolbox. In 2012 I&rsquo;ve watched Hackathons explode and become a popular way for API owners to engage and build a relationship with developers. (if done right) As I do with other trending areas, I launched as its own site, hackweekends.com. I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of demand from hackathon organizers and sponsors to add events and other news and information. To support this I recently launched Hack Weekends on Github, so anyone can edit pages, write blog posts and add events to the calendar. A sort of crowd sourced hackathon hub. To further support the hackathon community I also wanted to provide an open source hackathon guide, helping anyone understand how they can throw their own hackathon. There were already two great hackathon guides out there which are Open Data Hackathon How to Guide and The Hack Day Manifesto---both licensed openly. So I took this excellent material and merged with my own material to create a Hack Weekends Guide. The Hack Weekends guide provides a very detail guide to throwing a hackathon, and I also included a website template that runs on Github Pages using Jekyll. My goal is to make it a plug-n-play guide with all the tools and resources you need to be successful in your communities hackathon Next I need to actually prove my &ldquo;open source&rdquo; approach to planning, designing and marketing hackathons. I&rsquo;m planning several hackathons to make sure the process works. The first hackathon I am planning is for OC Hackerz in Orange County, California. OC Hackerz is a big supporter of developers, and is in sync with my vision of what the hackathon space should look like, so they are a great partner to plan two initial hackathons: OC Hackerz Hackathon - Los Angeles - March 2013 The planning of the OC Hackerz Hackathon is meant to be an exploratory deployment of the Hack Weekends...[<a href="/2012/12/12/exploring-a-new-way-of-planning-and-executing-hackathons/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Singly is continuing its quest to easily explain what it does for developers. &nbsp;The San Francisco startup has re-launched defining itself as, fabric for connected apps, or AppFabric. &nbsp;
Singly puts it best:
Singly AppFabric empowers you to add social login, sharing and friend finding into your mobile and web applications.&nbsp;Singly DataFabric handles syncing, data formatting, de-duplication, and normalization letting you query by location, keyword, and more.
When building mobile apps you are going to need to bridge social networks for your users, allowing them to authenticate with their preferred platform as well as pull friends, images and provide sharing in a meaningful way. &nbsp;You either do this platform by platform, or you use Singly's AppFabric to do this for you.
The best example of this in the wild, is with Singly developed mobile app Timehop.

Timehop lets you see your photos and updates from this exact day in history.

To use Timehop, I need to sign up using Facebook (this is Singly).

Now I'm registered for Timehop and I have my Facebook history connected.

Using Singy AppFabric, Timehop allows me to easily connect my Foursquare, Instagram, Twitter and Flickr services.

Now Timehop can intelligently connect me to my friends across these networks and share my Timehop stories, where it is most important to me.
Singly is weaving together the most critical of social and personal APIs into an AppFabric, that developers can use to build the next generation of API driven mobile apps.
As a developer, you won't think of development with single APIs anymore like Twitter and Facebook. &nbsp;You can use AppFabric to build meaningful apps, knowing the social authentication, friends, sharing, photos and other objects across the multiple networks is at your disposal in a single, standardized interface.
Singly is AppFabric for our personal and social data, that developers can use to build the apps that we depend upon ever day.
Disclosure: &nbsp;Singly is an API Evangelist partner.

			<p><em>11 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>API Discovery is becoming an increasingly troubling problem. As an analyst, I see a dizzying amount of APIs each month. When I get asked to find a particular type of API, or group of APIs in a particular industry--it gets difficult to discover a meaningful results to any query. My options for API discovery historically has been ProgrammableWeb. The OG API Directory. Today there is a new player on the block, APIhub. APIhub is a fresh attempt at solving the API discovery, with over 13K APIs organized by category, type, protocol, format and security. API Hub is looking to provide a solution for two distinct groups: Developers - Developers need an ecosystem to discover, learn, test and use APIs Publishers - Publishers require a platform to publish, manage, engage customers, and monetize APIs With first release APIhub&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have much out of the gate that is different than ProgrammableWeb, except for a much cleaner layout, search tools that is not cluttered by news, mashups and advertising. Once you explore APIhub further, you start seeing early signs of deeper features. When you add or claim your API, your given the option to upload a API spec in a Swagger or WADL format, with more formats coming soon. If implemented for all 13K APIs, this could be a powerful discovery engine. Beyond programmatic discovery I see hints of ranking on the platform. Right now its just 5 star ranking, but have hopes for more sophistication on how developers, publishers and analysts can rank APIs in the future. Allowing consumers to find new and existing APIs in meaningful ways--other than just 5 star ranking or my number of followers and mashups built on an API would be extremeley valuable. APIhub, marketplace or directory is nothing new. You see folks like APIs.io trying to step up with a directory and startups like Mashape providing a hub of their own, in a similar attempt to create an API marketplace.

			<p>Hackathons have been a big part of current web API movement. They are one of the most meaningful ways API owners can connect with developers in person. &nbsp;Twilio, Amazon and Facebook have all used hackathons to build their ecosystems. I started a section on API Evangelist in 2011, dedicated to hackathons. And in early 2012 I rolled this section out as its own site, hackweekends.com. &nbsp;Over 2012 the number of hackathons has grown significantly--making it difficult to ignore hackathons as channel for reaching developers. This weekend I migrated the Hack Weekends directory to run on Github. It uses Github Pages and Jekyll for the blog. I deployed mustache templates and JSON files for the events calendar and curated news section. I&rsquo;m working on ways to easily crowdsource the management of Hack Weekends, while establishing it as an open source hub for the hackathon community. In addition to establishing Hack Weekends as a hub for the community, I wanted to create a guide to throwing hackathons. So anyone can organize their own event. To help feed this, I&rsquo;ve been gathering my own research on hackathons from attending, mentoring, hacking and organizing hackathons over last 2 years. I also knew that there was other really good information available from other hackathon experts. So I pulled together the best, open information on throwing hackathons and combined it with my own research. Pulling content from: Hack Weekends Open Data Hackathon How to Guide The Hack Day Manifesto With this content and my experience I wanted to organize into something more. Remixing and setting into motion, a guide that anyone can use to organize a hackathon. While maintaining the calendar for Hack Weekends, I see a lot of hackathon sites. To accompany the Hack Weekends Guide I wanted hackathon organizers to be able to easily deploy a website in support of the event. The Hack Weekends Guide comes with a hackathon website template as part of the Github repository.

			<p><em>09 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>At the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas, NV last week I discussed the "grass-roots web API movement" with quite a few enterprise folks. Walking through the exhibit floor, where I did my building blocks of an API workshop, I noticed the signage and discussions were all focused on APIs. During my discussions with multiple enterprise developers, analysts, architects and executives, one question seemed to come up a lot: Didn&rsquo;t we do all of this 10 years ago? What is different this time around? With a strong focus on the technology of web services, many in the enterprise fail to see the difference between SOA and API. In an effort to better tell stories in this area, I wanted to revisit the SOAP vs. REST argument, and refresh my thoughts. &nbsp;So I got to work pulling up old stories, and while conducting my research I noticed the same patterns I see in the REST debates--a heavy focus on the technical, with only a few discussions of the business and politics of web services. If you are new to the SOAP vs. REST debate, let me get you up to speed. Wikipedia defines SOAP as: SOAP, originally defined as Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of Web Services in computer networks. SOAP was designed as an object-access protocol in 1998 by Dave Winer, Don Box, Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein for Microsoft, with a specification of SOAP currently maintained by the XML Protocol Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). After SOAP was first introduced, it became the underlying layer of a more complex set of Web Services, based on Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI). SOAP, XML and Web Services are all part of earlier approach to APIs which is widely considered to be called Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). While SOA is still used in enterprise environments, it...[<a href="/2012/12/09/some-thoughts-for-the-enterprise-embracing-web-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been maintaining a calendar of hackathons for all of 2012. Originally it was just a section off of API Evangelist, but eventually the site needed to be its own project. Up until now its just been a blog and calendar of events I curate from Eventbrite, Twitter, Google, Eventful and event organizers. I spend about 8-12 hours a week curating the events and stories for blog posts, and with the increase in the number hackathons over 2012, so does the time I need to maintain. I was adding an API so other users can add to calendar or event guest post, then I decided I would like to also have databases of hackathon organizers, sponsors, vendors, venues and other key building blocks of hackathons. My goal is to create an information hub for the hackathon community. But an &ldquo;open API&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t seem like enough. I wanted everything about it to be open and accessible, as well as community owned. I decided to publish&nbsp;Hack Weekends on Github and run it like an open source project. I launched the site using Github Pages with Jekyll. These run the pages and blog for Hack Weekends. &nbsp;But, I needed something to run the calendar, and other systems. I wanted them to be simple--I went with Mustache Templates + JSON stores. The implementation isn't perfect. I had problems getting search and sort tools to work, so I scaled back to a minimal viable implementation. I got the following areas up: Hackathon Calendar - Listing of hackathons global, sorted by city (for now) Cities Hackathon Directory - Breakdown of hackathons by cities Hack Weekends Blog - Blog running on Jekyll, which I edit using prose.io Hack Weekends News - Curated, relevant hackathon links from my pinboard I will get all the bells and whistles in there soon. Before that, I&rsquo;m working on a basic Github template for planning and executing a basic hackathon.

			<p><em>07 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I had the pleasure of speaking at API Days in Paris, France this week.  The organizers originally asked me to do one talk, but after some speaker shuffle, I ended up with three separate talks on APIs.
The second talk I did at API Days was The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal. &nbsp;This material was evolved from past stories I've done on Amazon's and Netflix's success with internal APIs. &nbsp;
I really want to tell more stories about other companies who have had success with internal APIs. But these are the hardest stories to come by, and I feel they are some of the most important API stories we can tell. &nbsp;
If you have a great internal API story you'd like to tell, I love to hear more. &nbsp;Feel free to email or DM on Twitter, and we can figure out the best format to tell your story.
You can view my presentation of&nbsp;The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal from API Days, and I believe the session was video taped, so I'm sure there will be videos coming soon!

			<p><em>07 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>
The organizers of APIs Days asked me at the last moment if I'd like to do a third talk at the European API event, due to last minute cancellations. &nbsp;Of course, I jumped on the opportunity to generate to material and work through it in front of a live audience. &nbsp;
The talk was on business models for your API as a start-up. &nbsp;On the plane ride over I reviewed John Musser's great material on API business models, and prepared a walk through, from a startup's perspective. &nbsp;
Then after watching Guillaume Ballas (@guillaumebalas) from 3Scale give his talk&nbsp;APIs for Biz Dev 2.0, Which Business Model? &nbsp;And watching other speakers I decide to scrap what I had put together, and went an entirely different direction.
I decide to walk through the evolution of an imaginary startup, keeping in mind 3Scale's philosphy that:

Let's not ask what business model for my API.You should be deploying an API for your business model. @3scale @guillaumebalas #apidays
&mdash; Kin Lane (@kinlane) December 3, 2012

Then I walked through what I would consider a robust, healthy startup business model with five tiers:
 

Free users
Paid users
Free developers
Paid developers
Partners
Incubation

Of course, this approach isn't for every startup. &nbsp;I highly recommend checking out 3Scale's presentation if you want to better understand which API business model is right for your startup.
I wanted to tell the story of how you could apply some or all of the monetization strategies outlined by John Musser in his work, while also listening to Guillaume from 3Scale.
The talk is rooted in my research on the Business of Twitter's API and experience I've had in the field consulting and building strategies with existing API owners.
You can view the presentation of my Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up, and I believe the session was video taped so I'm sure there will be video coming soon.

			<p><em>07 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I gave a talk at API Days in Paris, France this week. &nbsp;This talk was using some of my usual material around the building blocks of an API. As I always do, I omitted some slides and evolved my presentation a little further. &nbsp;This is one benefit of using reveal.js, driven from the API Evangelist database--I can evolve my content and make better with each talk.
I discussed 5 main areas to consider when building your API developer portal:

History of APIs
API Design &amp; Planning
API Development
API Evangelism
Whats Next for APIs?

My goal is to keep organizing and sharing my view on API design, planning, development and evangelism so my readers can put to use in their own API efforts.
It was interesting to talk through my API building block approach with API owners in France, after giving my talk. &nbsp;I learned a lot by talking with folks there. &nbsp;And I really think Europe has huge opportunity in front of it, when it comes to the API economy.
You can view my Building Blocks (Bricks) for your Developer Portal from #APIDays, I hope to recreate as a Google Hangout Video and publish to YouTube as soon as I make time.

			<p>
I got back last night from France, where I spent the week at the #APIDays conference, billed as the first international event on APIs in Europe.  The two day event was organized by&nbsp;faberNovel, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and byWebShell, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs
After some scheduling shuffling due to speaker cancellations API Days asked me if I&rsquo;d do three talks on APIs, instead of just my one--resulting in these three presentations:

Building Blocks (Bricks) For Your Developer Portal
The Secret to a Successful API is Internal
Business Models for Your API as a Start-Up


While the building blocks presentation is my usual material (but needs to be told over and over to new audiences), the other two talks represents entirely new work based upon other stories and research I&rsquo;ve done in the past.
I learned a lot while at API Days.  It was about 200 people, discussing APIs over the course of two days.  I was really impressed with the passion everyone had for APIs and the genuine interest in understand the essence of the web API movement--discussing ideas, philosophies and approach rather than just the technology of APIs.

I feel an awakening occurring in Europe right now in regards to APIs.  My Twitter has lit up in the past three months with new European based followers focusing on APIs, and flood of new requests for discussions and information about APIs.
With a very healthy stance on transparency, privacy and data ownership I think the EU has an excellent opportunity to become a major player in the API economy, and I predict good things to come out of not just France, but other EU countries in 2013.
I look forward to getting back soon, and talking APIs!

I read a great post recently about how a company called Teenage Engineering has started providing 3D CAD files that allow their customers to 3D print replacement parts for the products they make.
It is awesome to see things I talk about become reality. &nbsp;I wrote about the concept of a 3D printed junk drawer last year, while doing research on 3D printing and APIs.
Teenage Engineering is taking a big step, and potentially leading the industry in new ways. &nbsp;Can you imagine if companies by default, provide 3D drawings of common replacement parts and pieces for their products?
There is still a lot of gaps in how all of this can work, 3D printing is widely available yet, but with retailers like Staples playing around with offering 3D printing on demand, the future for 3D printing is looking pretty bright.

			<p>
There was a great post last week on ProgrammableWeb from Curtis C. Chen (@sparCKL), on how a company called Spectagram has launched a new JavaScript library built on top of Instagram.
Spectagram uses JQuery to provide a basic set of embeddable tools for Instagram allowing users to embed widgets showing latest photos, popular photos, and photos by tag.
Instagram has been notoriously focused on their core product, which leaves a lot of areas open to its developer community.  Even the first version of the Instagram API was created by a passionate developer.
It is interesting to see such a sophisticated Javascript library developed by a developer, essentially rolling out something Instagram should be doing themselves, but obviously haven&rsquo;t prioritized.  Something I&rsquo;m sure many API owners would love to have happen in their communities.
For more information you can visit Spectagram for more deails, and get at full documentation at their Github repository.

I conducted two workshops this week in partnership with Intel at the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas.  Working from my Building Blocks of a Successful API material, I put together a 30 minute workshop that I conducted at 12 and 6PM on Tuesday.
My workshop started with the history of APIs, then walked through API building blocks in 3 areas:

API Design&nbsp;
API Development&nbsp;
API Evangelist

Then I stepped back and emphasized that APIs are all about research &amp; development and business development for your company.
After stepping back, I looked into whats next with APIs with API aggregators like Singly, API automation platforms like IFTT and new API programming libraries like Webshell.
The goal of my talk was to plant a few seeds in attendee&rsquo;s mind:

APIs Are More Than Tech&nbsp;
APIs Require a Business Approach&nbsp;
Politics Can Be Biggest Killer of APIs&nbsp;
Focus Delivering Value

You can view the slide deck below for the workshop.  If you&rsquo;d like a custom demo feel free to contact me and we can do a Google Hangout.

			<p><em>30 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I got an email from Anthony Wu over at LearnSprout yesterday.  If you are not following what LearnSprout is up to, they are bridging legacy student information systems (SIS) and providing easy to use web APIs that application developers can use to build educational apps.
The email from Anthony was in regards to a SIS LearnSprout was integrating with, which he said:
IlluminateEd is the best SIS API we've seen so far!   Clean &amp; simple. OAuth, JSON, no bullshit. If every SIS did this, we could just move on to greener pastures. This kind of thing should be encouraged!
I agree with Anthony. The&nbsp;IlluminateEd API&nbsp;is clean and simple.  They intelligently use common technical API building blocks like oAuth and JSON, while keeping the API interfaces intuitive and meaningful and provide simple, up to date documentation.
My only criticism is simple, and would be about the description for the API:  &ldquo;This API allows third party applications to interact and communicate with the Illuminate system&rdquo;.   This is a classic mistake from API owners.  Unlike Anthony I had no idea what the Illuminate system is.  I can assume its a SIS, but they should really make it a little more description for newcomers.
Even though the API isn&rsquo;t perfect LearnSprout says it is better than:

Humans as APIs (i.e. office secretary mashup with Excel)
CSV as APIs (the status quo)
Screen Scraping as APIs (for some, the ends justify the means&hellip;)
Legacy DOS terminal emulation

Learsprout sees a lot of different approaches to accessing and sharing data between SIS systems.  They have a lot of value to bring to the industry, and I enjoying telling the story about what they are experiencing.  And I agree with Anthony and this type of effort should be encouraged within the education space.  Nice work IlluminateEd.

			<p><em>30 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Right before the Thanksgiving holiday, in an effort to make the Facebook platform more responsive and dependable for developers, Facebook announced Developer Alerts.  Developer alerts are a way for Facebook platform developers to receive critical information about their apps via email or Facebook notification.
Facebook Developer Alerts provide the following for Facebook app administrators:

Breaking Changes - If your app is using functionality that FB is changing or removing, you will be sent an alert at least 90 days before the change goes into effect
App Status Changes - If you have submitted Open Graph actions or created an app detail page for App Center, FB will use Developer Alerts to notify you when the status of your submission changes
Policy Violations and Enforcement - If your app doesn&rsquo;t adhere to FB Platform Policies you will be notified through these alerts

Facebook Developer Alerts are more than notifications, it is an issue management system which will allow multiple developers on a project to known when action is required or things have been resolved.
It seems like a great approach to improving communications between API platforms and its API application developers.  I think I will add platform alerts as an official API building block, and recommend it as something API should consider when developing their platform.

Poster boy for how to properly run your API ecosystem properly, Twilio, recently updated their DOer Gallery to highlight developers in the Twilio ecosystem that build cool stuff on the popular voice and SMS API.
Twilio has the best record I&rsquo;ve seen of any API, when it comes to showcasing and being loved by their developer community, and I'm sure the DOer Gallery plays an important role in that.

The Twilio DOer Gallery has the following features:

Personal Details
Short Bio
Skills
Other Profiles
Projects

Devloper Galleries like Twilios might not be for every API platform.  But if you have a passionate base of developers you might want to consider giving them their own profile and a gallery where they can not just discover and interact with each other, it can let other companies find potential developers to execute projects via your API.
A Developer Gallery can be a great way to give your API developers some love and attention.  Twilio even features developers from their DOer Gallery on their blog in a "DOer of the Month".
Would showcasing your &ldquo;API DOers&rdquo; benefit your API community?

			<p><em>30 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
In 2012 the number of APIs has grown significantly.  We are transitioning from &ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t enough APIs&rdquo; to &ldquo;how do we more intelligently use many APIs&rdquo;.  As I track on this and the future of web APIs, I&rsquo;m noticing growth in the number of API aggregators like Singly.
A couple of weeks ago I was introduced Adigami, a "Singly for Analytics".  While Singly focuses on personal data API aggregation, Adigami is focused on aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today--covering seven key channels:


Web - Google Analytics
Search - Google AdWords, Microsoft Bing
Display - DoubleClick, Yahoo! APT, Facebook Ads, MediaMind
Social - Facebook Insights, Twitter
Mobile - Yahoo! Mobile, Verve Wireless
Email - MailChimp, SendGrid, ConstantContact, ExactTarget
Custom - Adigami can import proprietary data.

Operating your business on the Internet or "in the cloud" is a reality, and as we operate more and more in this cloud, each platform will have its own set of analytics--making the need to centralize and standardize analytics across channels and platforms more and more critical.
Adigami is just the tip of the iceberg.  I predict we&rsquo;ll see API aggregators emerge from top industries like government, healthcare and education.  In 2013 we will learn to more fluently communicate with web APIs with the help of API aggregators like Singly and Adigami.

			<p><em>29 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
The legal building blocks of an API can be just as critical as the technical and business building blocks.  It makes sense to version and communicate your API terms of use (TOS) , privacy policy and branding guidelines alongside your code.
Since Github will allow document types other than code, such as markdown and PDF, it can make sense to use Github for managing the legal side of your API.
Using Github for the legal aspects of API operation will provide a level of transparency developers will appreciate, allowing them to download and store for their own records while being able to see the difference between each version, in a format that makes sense to them.
Just as with all other areas of an API, Github will allow you to completely manage the evolution of your API terms, privacy and branding in a way that is in sync with all the other technical and business building blocks of your API.
Consider using Github for API legal building block management.

			<p><em>29 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I am heading to Paris, France next week for API Days.  API Days is December 3rd and 4th in Paris and is dubbed as the "First National Event on APIs in Europe".   The two day event is organized by faberNovel, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and by WebShell, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs.
API Days&nbsp;sees the API economy the same way I do:
The Web 1.0 was readable, the Web 2.0 was social, now the web is programmable through application programming interfaces, aka APIs. Web APIs are a unique opportunity for companies, governments and developers to either better organize the governance of their IT into a scalable and flexible model, either leverage a complete ecosystem around the organization, exchanging data through the web for trillion of applications on billion devices. Because each civilization has been described by the way it communicates and make exchanges, API are the beginning of a programmable civilization.

The API event is hosting over 50 sessions from over 30 speakers--including two of my own talks:

The Secret to a Successful API is Internal
Business models for your API as a start-up

I&rsquo;m excited to see APIs getting interest in Europe.  And after working with the Webshell team for several months and learning more about FaberNovel, I'm excited to be working with both of them to drive API adoption in Europe.
If you are planning on going to API Days, let me know and I&rsquo;ll make time to talk.  If you aren&rsquo;t, I will publish more info about the event and my talks here on API Evangelist, when it is all wrapped up.

			<p><em>29 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>The team over at Chartboost have a pretty forward thinking blog post about what they see as the next generation of web application development. They feel that the future is about creating web applications, not sites. The server side should be an API and the client should be a self-contained app which uses the API as its back-end. With mobile applications following the same pattern. To practice what they preach, Charboost is overhauling their help site to be an API driven web app using the following approach: Push State - Provide site navigation without page refreshes by faking navigation and inserting JavaScript callbacks JSON-API - A REST API providing JSON to drive the site Responsive Design - Providing an application design that responds to mobile as well as it does laptops or desktop computers Vector (Icon Fonts &amp; CSS) - Using a combination of icon fonts and CSS3 to deliver the UI. SCSS - A new technology that uses CSS-preprocessing to make the CSS code cleaner and res-usable Markdown - Using the simple markup language to allow anyone on their team to write and edit help articles GitHub - Using Github to manage the help center as an open project I agree that their metholody has the potential to be one possible future of web and mobile application development. JavaScript and API development have both matured in the last 10 years, getting us to this point where you can build some damn sexy, but simple apps that run smoothly on the web or mobile devices. &nbsp; Or as Chartboost puts it: We believe that the web is finally reaching a tipping point. The culmination of a decade of incremental improvements to web technologies is upon us, and lets us do things in a way that is radically new and better. I&rsquo;m also playing around with my own approach to delivering apps in this way using Github + Jeckyll + Mustache Templates with JSON data stores,...[<a href="/2012/11/29/chartboost039s-api-driven-approach-to-application-development/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>Social analytics provider&nbsp;PeopleBrowsr&nbsp;has won a temporary injunction against Twitter today, with a complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court. It reads: PeopleBrowsr seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent Twitter from destroying its business, interfering with PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s contractual and prospective business relations, and restraining competition in markets using Twitter data. The complaint was filed in response to a trheat from Twitter to cut off PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s access to its Firehose by November 30, 201 &nbsp;PeopleBrowsr has had access to the full Twitter full firehose for over four years. According to the complaint: PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s products require the full Firehose feed. A mere sample of Twitter data is insufficient for PeopleBrowsr to provide the products its users expect. Though there are some data analytics companies that can provide certain limited types of Twitter data analysis based on sampling, PeopleBrowsr competes in a separate &ldquo;Twitter Big Data Analytics&rdquo; market, in which a few, highly sophisticated players analyze massive amounts of Twitter data to provide deeper insights. Twitter&rsquo;s decision to terminate PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s firehose follows a&nbsp;pattern of it consistently cutting off partner and developer access to the platforms and its data. In doing so Twitter&nbsp;has sought more control in their effort to monetize the social networking platform and provide&nbsp;investors with a return on their investment of almost 1.4B dollars. PeopleBrowsr states that it has &ldquo;invested millions of dollars and years of work in building a business based on the Firehose&rdquo;. It says it did so in rlying on Twitter&rsquo;s representations that it would maintain an &ldquo;open ecosystem&rdquo; and allow other companies to use of its data. Through agreements with Twitter PeopleBrowsr felt it could compete without fear that Twitter would cut off access to its data in order to influence which businesses succeed or to usurp business opportunities for itself. Twitter has consistently described&nbsp;the Firehose as a part of this open ecosystem that it would make available to &ldquo;everyone in the system&rdquo;, and this open approach was a key component...[<a href="/2012/11/28/peoplebrowsr-wins-temporary-injunction-to-keep-twitter-from-shutting-off-firehose/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Those of you who follow my blog, know my favorite API management service provider is 3Scale. It&rsquo;s no secret I&rsquo;m a fan of what they are doing. We share a vision of the API space and what a healthy API industry will look like. In support of that vision, 3Scale just launched a new open source API proxy build on the NGNIX web server technology--a move, I feel is important for 3Scale, as well as the entire API industry. What makes 3Scale&rsquo;s approach signficant, is that by deploying the NGNIX proxy, API providers don't need to rely on proprietary API proxy solutions, while also gaining additional benefits, such as acess to a library of 3rd party addons and modules available in the NGNIX ecosystem. All while employing an established technology that has been proven to deliver in highl volume production environments. In addition to the benefits provided by NGNIX, the proxy provides seamless integration with 3Scale&rsquo;s API management platform that delivers: API business modeling using service contracts, API rate limits and pricing rules API access control &amp; security with API key generation with user id, app id, oAuth API analytics &amp; reporting including alerts, statistics, business intelligence API billing &amp; payments supporting pre-paid, post-paid, PCI compliant, six separate payment gateways Developer portal for self-service registration and onboarding Interactive API Documentation for better adoption using Swagger This list represents everything you will need to get your API up and running. 3Scale enables you to do this both on premise or in the cloud, using a proxy that you cotrol--then alllowing you to choose which 3Scale API management services you need to use. But what is most important for me, is 3Scale allows you start off without spending any money. 3Scale has a free, entry level tier that will allow you to design, experiment and iterate until you find the meaningful API definition that works for your developers--at which time you can scale, paying for only what...[<a href="/2012/11/15/3scale-launches-open-source-api-proxy-built-on-ngnix/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was listening to a story about Nevada quietly starting their implementation of health insurance exchanges, as part of what everyone loves to call Obamacare. I&rsquo;m not even going to get involved in the politics and merit of making sure everyone is insured--I want to focus on the execution of it. Immediately I think: Where is the state health insurance exchange platform API? According to healthcare.gov an exchange is: A mechanism for organizing the health insurance marketplace to help consumers and small businesses shop for coverage in a way that permits easy comparison of available plan options based on price, benefits and services, and quality. By pooling people together, reducing transaction costs, and increasing transparency, Exchanges create more efficient and competitive markets for individuals and small employers. And the principles and priorities of state health insurance exchanges are: Establishing a State-based Exchange - Establishment of an Exchange is a critical step that States must take to be on track for achieving certification of an Exchange by January 1, 2013 under Section 1321. Promoting Efficiency - Exchanges must be mindful of costs for consumers, employers, and the federal government. Avoiding Adverse Selection - Successful Exchanges will avoid adverse selection by ensuring that those who buy through the Exchange are a broad mix of the healthy and the less healthy. Streamlined Access and Continuity of Care. Section 1311(d)(4)(F) requires Exchanges to evaluate and determine eligibility for applicants in Medicaid, the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and other health programs - Exchanges must also comply with all applicable federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. The federal government will provide critical building blocks and financial support for achieving an efficient enrollment process including verification of&nbsp;eligibility for tax credits. Public Outreach and Stakeholder Involvement - Section 1311(d)(6) requires Exchanges to consult with a broad range of stakeholders in carrying out their activities. Public Accountability and Transparency - Accountability requires transparency. Section 1311(d)(7) requires public reports on Exchange activities, and Section 1311(e)(3)...[<a href="/2012/11/13/where-are-the-apis-for-state-health-insurance-exchanges/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for meaningful API analogies, to stock my evangelism toolbox. Ways that I can relate the potential of APIs, in a way that anyone can understand, even non-developers. In my opinion, the success of the web API movement lies in the ability to extend, potentially complex resources in a very simplistic and universal way. So, as an evangelism I have to abstract away the complexities and make sure I connect with my audience. As I&rsquo;m tracking on the API space and working to quantify the potential future of APIs, I&rsquo;m struggling to find meaningful analogies to articulate where API driven platforms like Singly are moving the industry. But just as with the technology, leave it to the Singly team to do this for me. Singly made a slight shift in their branding recently, using the words API Fabric in the description of what they do. This seems like a slight change, but it truly is an exceptional way to describe the Singly approach to app development using social authentication and data.&nbsp; At first glance, to a non technical person, fabric may be defined as: fab&middot;ric/Ëfabrik/ Noun: Cloth, typically produced by weaving or knitting textile fibers With synonyms being cloth, material, structure, textile, texture and web. Using this definition of fabric as the source for my analogy can work by itself. It can help a non-technical person understand what is possible when you can quickly begin weave together apps using different APIs--visualizing some sort of woven textile, with unique meaning. Immediately helping anyone, visually relate to the potential when developing on top of social and personal APIs. If you are more technical, the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; might help you understand Singly at another level. In information technology, fabric is a synonym for the words framework or platform. In general, the term fabric can describe the way different parts of something work together to form a single entity.

			<p>BandPage, a hub for musicians to manage and control their online presence, just expanded their reach with BandPage Connect, an API, allowing developers to build apps for the music industry. I wrote about their update once, publish everywhere with an embeddable API strategy back in July, feeling an API would be next. When it comes to a Bands most treasured assets, music is always held up as the most valuable piece of the catalog, but band info, events, venues, videos and photos of the band are essential to the success of these artists--emotionally connecting fans with their favorite bands. This is where BandPage Connect comes in. The API will allow bands to provide content to open API developers, as well as their partners, in a self service approach. BandPage Everywhere allows bands to easily manage their presence with robust embeddable apps that they can easily distribute across the web, but BandPage Connect takes this to the next level--allowing developers define what is next, when it comes to building web and mobile apps that connect bands with their fans. BandPage Connect provides a solid approach for the music industry to provide access to valuable band assets, but also provides a centralized way to control presence. Ryan Kavontrka, Digital Manager for Maroon 5, Sara Bareilles, Gavin DeGraw, and Eve 6, says, "There are a lot of platforms out there that have our bio, photos, and videos, but the info they have about us is out of date and we don't have a way to change it. This makes it so that any member of a band or their manager/label can update the content, not just the guy who knows HTML.

			<p>
I don&rsquo;t know if you saw the big news last week, but software publisher Axway announced intent to acquire API service provider Vordel.  I&rsquo;m not a big fan of covering funding, acquisition or launch press releases, unless there a significant business story there.  But the acquisition of Vordel is another important sign for the API industry in 2012.
Financial terms of the deal haven&rsquo;t been disclosed, but the acquisition shows the API industry is maturing and producing desirable companies with proven API products, that larger software companies can use as a competitive advantage.  While Vordel's API management, SOA governance and identity management will help Axway&rsquo;s customers, I think Vordel&rsquo;s customers is probably the type of new client large software companies will want be also seeking out through acquisitions.

I always joke with John and Adam at ProgrammableWeb about, &ldquo;Is this the year of the API&rdquo;? They have been at it longer than I have, and are very hesitant to dub any particular year, the year of the API.  But, with the growth we&rsquo;ve seen in 2012, two open source API management platforms deployed and now a major acquisition in the space--I confidently would say 2012 is the year APIs came of age.
I predict in 2013-2015 we are going to see more of these types of acquisitions occuring.  Large software companies are going to need a robust set of API tools to bring legacy systems into the modern, API driven economy.  Companies that have invested in API management service providers like 3Scale and Mashape will see the return they are looking for, as the space continues to grow in the next five years.

			<p><em>12 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
When you operate an API, you need to make sure and communicate with your developer community about what your plans are for the future, so developers can plan their own roadmap, and keep in sync with the coming changes to the API.
In addition to issue management using Github, API providers can use Github to manage their roadmap using the milestones features of the social coding platform.  Milestones can be directly related to issues or can be larger goals around where you intend to take your API.
Milestones give developers insight into what the plans are the future of an API, using just a title, description and target date.  Milestones are one of the simplest aspects of an API, but can go a long way in creating goodwill with your developers.
API providers have to balance transparency versus giving away information to competitors, something that will take regular consideration.  A transparent roadmap for your API will let developers prepare properly, while also letting them know what features are coming in the future--eliminating the possibility of competing with your own ecosystem.
Consider what you can include in your Github roadmap, and using Github for issue management.

			<p><em>12 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Backend as a Service (BaaS) provider CloudMine and aggregated social API platform Singly announced a partnership today, to make sure the mobile applications developers are building using CloudMine have social baked in by default.
CloudMine is delivering on the BaaS promise and providing all the tools developers need to rapidly develop and scale their mobile applications, by providing a complete backend solution for developers including user management, object storage, push notifications, syncing and other essential tools developers need to be successful.

CloudMine + Singly Partnership Announcement from CloudMine on Vimeo.
Social is the logical next step in the BaaS evolution.  Social authentication, data, friends, followers are also essential for any developer building an app these days, so the partnership being CloudMine and Singly makes sense.  Instead of CloudMine aggregating these essential social tools, they can rely on Singly to bring this to the table for CloudMine developers--allowing CloudMine to stick with what they do best.
If you want more information, you can head over to CloudMine or Singly, and see how their approach can help your mobile app development.
Disclosure: &nbsp;Singly is a partner of API Evangelist

			<p><em>12 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>Mobile app development is at the center of API deployment in 2012. Much of the interest in designing, developing and deploying APIs is so that you can successfully launch one, or multiple mobile applications. I get a lot of questions from companies looking to deploy APIs, where they can find development talent that will help them with their API driven mobile initiatives. Up until now I didn&rsquo;t have much to offer them, any mobile developer I know that is good, is already snatched up, and without direct experience deploying projects with a development shop, I didn&rsquo;t have one to recommend. Now that has changed, I&rsquo;ve been working with a rock star web and mobile dev shop called Concentric Sky. And over the last couple years I have really gotten to know their team of developers and management--and I&rsquo;ve been blown away by some of the projects they are producing: Encyclopedia Britannica - for iPad and iPhone - The definitive encyclopedia app. Over 80,000 articles, and thousands of photographs - and the &ldquo;LinkMap&rdquo; lets you explore each article with a dynamic view of related topics. NSF's STEP Central - Commissioned by the National Science Foundation (NSF), we designed and architected a robust, online community for STEP grantees to present and share their project information in a centralized place. United Nations CountryStats - Developed for the United Nations, UN CountryStats is a data visualization app for iPhone and iPad that makes it easy to compare key economic, social, environmental, trade, and area &amp; population indicators for 216 countries and territories. All data drawn from the United Nations' unique and authoritative data set. Those are just a few of the amazing projects come out of Concentric Sky. I&rsquo;m psyched to not just have a mobile and web development partner, but one of such high caliber. I&rsquo;ve worked closely with their leadership, project managers and developers on a couple projects, lead their team on conference panels, and have made...[<a href="/2012/11/12/api-evangelist-development-partner-concentric-sky/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I was trying to explain the experience of being at the Defrag Conference, to a friend&nbsp;the other day.  We are both gearing up for the event, next week (November 14th &amp; 15th), in Broomfield Colorado, and he had never been to one so I wanted to share a little about what the experience is like.
The Defrag event is organized by Eric Norlin, who also organizes Gluecon and Blur conferences, all at the Omni Interlocken resort in Broomfield.  Each of Eric&rsquo;s events have evolved each year, but currently reflect the following focus:

Gluecon - Cloud, Mobile, APIs, Big Data for developers
Defrag - What's coming next  in technology
Blur - Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

Eric has a unique way of bringing together the leaders from the space to discuss relevant technologies in a very intimate space.  The Omni Interlocken resort is a very key element to the events, which makes it unlike other events I attend.
The first of Eric&rsquo;s events I attended was a Gluecon, several years back.  We drove out to the location, and I remember thinking, &ldquo;oh man we are going to be stuck way out here for 4 days&rdquo;.  But as I learned, that is the point.

You are stuck in a very intimate location where you will eat killer grub, including beef sliders and drink some kick-ass craft beers while rubbing elbows and having deep technical and philosophical conversations with the deepest thinkers and leaders in our space.
Defrag and Glue are part of a small group of events I recommend you never miss in the space.  I&rsquo;m pretty burnt out on large technology conferences, but the value you walk away with from Defrag can&rsquo;t be found anywhere else--putting Defrag in entireley different category for me.
I hope to see you at Defrag next week. If your there, I&rsquo;ll buy you an IPA, while we talk APIs.

			<p><em>08 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Github should be the center of your API operations, with the most obvious use being for SDK repositories, but Github offers a lot of other valuable tools that you can use to manage your API platform.
One great use of Github is as an API issue management tool.  The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories, for processing by your development team.
To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management.  Think of it as repository for your API itself.
Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentially be part of the API product development cycle.

			<p>
Github isn't just for code.  Github can be used for HTML documents and PDF's as well.  This opens up endless possibilities for management of documents you wish to share with your developer ecosystem.
One excellent example of this is publishing presentations from the various talks, hackathons and conferences you present at.  When you are done with a talk and would like to share with your community, you can just expose it as a PDF or HTML document, and push to Github.
You can also use this same approach for how-to guides and training materials you want to make available for your developers.  Allowing them to download and fork, or even follow the changes on Github, for the richest training materials an API provides.
Github provides a powerful way for you to version, evolve and share your essential API resources with the community--keeping them in sync with all other activity around your API.

			<p><em>07 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I'm digging on this statement from Gil Elbaz @ Factual. &nbsp;Gil is participating on a panel &ldquo;The Forest for the Trees: The Meanings of Data&rdquo; at the&nbsp;Techonomy Conference&nbsp;on Sunday, November 11th in Tucson, Arizona at the Ritz Carlton.&nbsp;
We live in a world of patterns. Now we&rsquo;re getting better at discerning them. As we see the big patterns in human behavior, and in the movement of money, products, jobs, weather, energy, disease, and even molecules and stars, a new era of understanding dawns. Can companies and governments draw proper conclusions fast enough? Where will this world of patterns discerned take us?
I've heard Gil talk several times, and I am a big believer in his views on data, and supporter of Factual as a platform. I firmly believe we can help companies and government draw proper conclusions, in very real-time ways, using APIs.

			<p><em>05 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>When it comes to measuring the success of an API, we often experience a lack meaningful metrics, with many companies only tracking the number of new developers and quantity of API calls. Going beyond these basic API metrics and identifying true performance indicators (KPI), will be essential if you want to find success with your API. To speak in a more traditional marketing sense, a pretty standard sales funnel can be used to set the stage, defining the intake of developers as the top of your funnel, paid accounts and production applications the bottom of your APIs funnel--giving you a common framework for hanging KPIs on. &nbsp; However, when using a sales funnel to frame your API marketing efforts, be careful of being blinded that success will all be all about moving developers from the top, to the bottom of your funnel. While this is definitely a large part of your efforts, there are plenty of good things that can happen within the funnel that will further drive users into the funnel as well as build trust and evangelism efforts that can be essential to the growth of your API ecosystem. When planning your API sales funnel, the top is all about bringing in new registrations and the bottom should reflect the business objectives of your API. But your funnel flow shouldn't always consist of direct flow to the bottom--think about what other beneficial activities can happen within the funnel: Talent Acquisition - Finding new developers who understand your API and market Social Media Marketing - Tweets and other social media exhaust for users Story Building - New stories you can tell about the value your API delivers Idea Generation - Creative ideas around how to use your API Feedback - Quality feedback from developers about how to make your API better Evangelists - Develop the next generation of developer evangelists and advocates Brand - Awareness of your brand and the value it represents Trust...[<a href="/2012/11/05/api-kpis-should-be-optimized-for-developer-success/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I call it being an evangelist, but it has other names, such as advocate or ambassador.  Someone who is good at evangelism, in my opinion, starts with a love of hacking but is also having a love of helping others learn and understand technology.  I can&rsquo;t help being an evangelist, it&rsquo;s just part of my personality.
These days, I get enough requests for evangelists, so I decided to start finding passionate hackers within specific communities to help fill requests.  Some requests for evangelists are full time positions, some part time, while others involve just going to meetups and hackathons in evenings and on weekends as needed.
Currently I&rsquo;m on the hunt for some passionate hacker personalities in New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Austin, Atlanta and Portland.  If you live in these cities, are passionate about API, mobile, social and the cloud--you should consider a life of evangelism.
Even if you aren&rsquo;t quite sure what an evangelist, advocate or ambassador does, feel free to reach out.  Chances are you are already attending meetups, hackathons and already doing evangelism activities--you just aren&rsquo;t getting paid or receiving incentives to do so.
Visit the interested in evangelism page and I can answer your questions and get you plugged in. &nbsp;

			<p><em>03 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>
One very powerful way to use Github within your API strategy is for developer profiling.  This approach requires the deployment of another Github solution, API Developer login using Github.
After you implement authentication for you API using Github, the Github API provides a wealth of opportunity for you to learn more about developers.
The types of developers you want for your API are also developers who have an active Github profiles.  Using Github, you can immediately tell if someone is an active developer based upon their presence and usage of the social coding network.
Github provides basic profile details, like where a developer lives and which programming language they use.  You can also see which other tools and code they following and commit to, giving an overall profile of their developer lifestyle.
Using Github you will also be able to tell if a user has downloaded or forked your own API SDK's, giving you insight into how well your SDK"s are being received and used.   There are endless ways you can use Github to stay in tune with your developers, but first you have to employ Github authentication as part of your API strategy--then get to work profiling developers, and better understand who they are.

Now, could you please create one for your company? &nbsp;You can copy my about.json above, go to JSON Editor Online, paste it in and create your own. &nbsp;When done, make sure and save to your desktop as text file and upload to the root of your site. &nbsp;
I'll always take a look at http://example.com/about.json first to see if a company has it, before Googling on my own for a logo and about blurb.
Maybe some day, every site will have one.

			<p><em>02 Nov 2012</em></p>
			<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) needs our help to explain to the Federal Circuit Court on why there should NOT be copyrights on APIs. As EFF published today: Earlier this year, we applauded District Court Judge Alsup for getting it right and holding that, as a matter of law, one could not copyright APIs. The case, Oracle v. Google, is now on appeal to the Federal Circuit, where a three-judge panel is going to revisit Judge Alsup&rsquo;s ruling. The EFF is soliciting the our assistance in how to help build the case, asking for feedback on two example areas: Software reimplementing someone else&rsquo;s API, calling someone else&rsquo;s API, or any other uses of third-party APIs for interoperability, competition, or innovation. Reimplementation of an API, where the resulting software benefitted the original API creator, perhaps by increasing the creator&rsquo;s user base or otherwise benefitted the developer community I think we are in the infancy of API deployment, so it&rsquo;s going to be tough to find many solid examples. &nbsp;But I think the two areas we can demonstrate the importance of no copyright on APIs, is within two business sectors that evolved on the web, using APIs and are critical to business and government today: Cloud - As EFF said, Eucalyptus reimplemented the Amazon API to offer a competing cloud storage service. You also saw the same with first implementation of Google Developer Storage and up to &amp; other providers: Dunkel Cloud Storage, âHost Europe Cloud Storage, GreenQloud Storage Qloud, ScaleUp Technologies, âConnectria Cloud Storage, Lunacloud, and DreamObjects Cloud Storage&nbsp;providing unprecedented interoperability for cloud computing. Social - Same as with cloud you have seen competition pop up for both Twitter and Facebook, mimicking their platform and APIs. Platforms like App.net have copied Twitter&rsquo;s social network providing competition, and potential value to Twitter users by allowing developers to use App.net for things they can't use Twitter for.

We are wasting no time getting the&nbsp;API Strategy &amp; Practice conference&nbsp;back on track, after being put on hold because of hurricane Sandy. With the current status of New York City, it&rsquo;s subways, airports, there is no way the event could have happened--we made the right decision to cancel.
We are currently discussing the best dates for rescheduling in January and February of 2013, and are hopeful that we will have date finalized next week.
While we are awaiting that process we figured we&rsquo;d spend some time and discuss the session lineup for the conference. We are rather proud of the keynote, panel and session lineup we&rsquo;ve pulled together, but we feel we can make it even better.
So we are going to hold a Google Hangout today at 11:30 AM PDT / 2:30 PM EDT, to discuss the API Strategy &amp; Practice session lineup and invite you to participate. If you&rsquo;d like to be a participant in the hangout, email me at&nbsp;[email&#160;protected]and if you&rsquo;d like to just watch the hangout, follow&nbsp;@apistrat&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ll tweet out the Youtube link right before.

			<p><em>29 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
When it comes to API service providers, there is one brand that I would say is widely known, but when we are talking about APIs, often gets overlooked.  That company is Intel.
In addition to a whole suite of SOA and Cloud Middleware, all with an emphasis on security--Intel has a REST Web Services Gateway.   This provides a simple solution to the number concern I get from potential API owners:  How do I secure my API?
The Intel REST Web Services Gateway provides:

Invoke Security Token Service credential mapping or validation
Ensure throttling and SLAs by REST service
Extend Enterprise audit and compliance to WOA and REST
Detailed XML threat prevention and payload inspection
Service virtualization, proxy, and abstraction as a policy enforcement point
REST API security and management

You can find a summary of the product, a&nbsp;full data sheet, as well as some video tutorials over at Intel.

If you would like to know more, or have questions make sure and come to API Strategy &amp; Practice this week in NYC.  Intel will have a session on their approach to APIs, as well as be on a panel that I&rsquo;ll be moderating on API service providers. &nbsp;Intel is also a gold sponsor of API Strategy &amp; Practice--the event wouldn't be happing if it wasn't for Intel. &nbsp;Thanks!
If that isn&rsquo;t enough!  I will also be doing some workshops with Intel at the Gartner AADI conference in Las Vegas, the end of November. &nbsp;So you will have another opportunity to speak with both of us.
If you can&rsquo;t make to either New York or Las Vegas, drop me an email and I&rsquo;ll get you in touch with Intel.

			<p><em>29 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>As with most social platforms, Github provides oAuth for their platform, allowing developers to provide secure credentials and authentication for their users via a Github account.
Service providers like Singly are providing two click authentication using Github's oAuth.  This allows any website or app to offer their users the ability to login with their Github profile.
Allowing authentication via Github is no brainer for API providers. Why require users to create yet another login, or even use Twitter or Facebook oAuth?  Allow them to login and retrieve API keys via the one social profile that reflects the programmer side of their online profile.
Github login can be implemented in any programming language, and because it is oAuth, it is something end users will understand.  In addition to providing easy authentication, you will be able to immediately see other important data about a developer that is available via their Github profile.
Consider the potential of using Github authentication as part of your API strategy.

			<p><em>28 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>One API I&rsquo;ve been watching grow and evolve from day one is the Pearson Developer Community. I first wrote about them when Peasron announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content in May of 2011. Then in August 2011 they launched three APIs: Longman Dictionary - The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English is the flagship Longman dictionary FT Press - FT Press provides essential insights from the best business books and original writings by leading business thinkers Eyewitness Guides - The DK Eyewitness Travel Guides show you what others only tell you After Pearson got acquainted with the ins and outs of API evangelism, and supporting the Pearson developer community, they released two more APIs this year: Pearson Kitchen Manager - Pearson Kitchen Manager is a valuable resource for food enthusiasts and chefs alike, featuring a vast collection of recipes from bestselling Pearson textbooks of top culinary schools Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API - The best-selling Pearson Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guide series is the UK's premier quick reference, aide memoire support for health and social care students and professionals while in practice and studying It looks like Pearson is really finding a rhythm with identifying content to make available, as well as the right approach to deploying as APIs. They have 3 more high value publishing APIs available: Penguin Classics API - The Penguin English Library is a collection of 100 of the best novels ever written in the English Language. Classics like Jane Eyre, Dracula and Great Expectations dkimages API - The dkimages API is an encyclopaedic collection of 90,000 high-resolution images Peachpit Visual QuickStart Guides API - With more than 12 million copies in print, Visual QuickStart Guides have been a vital part of the computer book category for years That is a total of 8 APIs endpoints Pearson has made available via their developer center--providing some valuable text and image content...[<a href="/2012/10/28/pearson-sets-example-for-other-publishing-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Code samples in a variety of languages are how API owners help developers understand an API in the language that makes the most sense to them.
Not all developers will understand REST, HTTP and other things you might take for granted.  Very simple code samples will help demonstrate an APIs functionality, making the learning process a hands-on experience.
Github provides a very lightweight tool for publishing API code samples, that can be embedded on any website, called Gists.  You can easily copy / paste a working code sample into a Gist and Github returns a lightweight, embeddable JavaScript that you can use in documentation, blog posts and any where you will need to share with users.
Github Gists can be a much sexier, and easier to implement alternative to html &lt;code&gt; tags. While also allowing easy management and versioning of API code samples alongside Github API SDK repositories.

			<h3><a href="/2012/10/25/sdk-management-for-your-api-with-github/">SDK Management for Your API with Github</a></h3>
			<p><em>25 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
The most common use of Github by API providers is to publish API SDK's to the popular social coding platform.  If you look at most of the the top API providers in operation today, you will find they are actively using Github to not just manage and publicize their API SDK's, but actively interact with their developer ecosystem in the process.
Github provides the necessary workflow for initial design, development and publicizing of API SDKs, allowing owners to create separate repositories for web-based SDKs like PHP, Python and Ruby and mobile SDKs for iOS, Android and Windows mobile.
By making API SDK's public repositories on Github you get all the code management benefits of Github, but also make them available for social interaction by your developers.  They will be able to download, fork and potentially commit additions and modifications back to an SDK's repository, allowing owners to harness the creative potential of the developer community.
Active Github repositories for an API are an essential part of any API ecosystem.  If you don't use Github for anything else, make sure you publish your SDK's as a public repository. It will make the development of your client libraries a much more social experience, providing huge benefits for your API.

On story I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write for almost 3 months now is about APIphany, one of the new generation of API providers. I met the APIphany team in person when I went out to Washington DC in August. The APIphany team was cool enough to come out and support my API Craft meetup in DC, then the next morning I went out to their offices and met the rest of the team. APIphany sees the industry very similar to me, and believe in self-service, pay as you go API services that allow for anyone to innovate around APIs. I&rsquo;ve been watching their progress and they have 3 very cool projects made public so far: Washington Post - Developer area for Washington Post, providing some endpoints including an Issue Engine API, White House Visitors Log API, and the Campaign Finance API Houston Metro - Developer portal for the Houston area, providing public transit in the Houston metropolitan area for bus and rail The Voting Information Project (VIP) - Offering APIs and developers tools to provide voters with access to customized election information, helping them navigate the voting process and cast an informed vote When I met the team in August, they described how they were building out so many custom projects for customers that were API driven, they decided to standardize their approach and offer a product. The APIphany API management solution provides all the standard offerings we are getting used to in the space: Administration Portal Developer Portal Key Management Access Control and Security Subscriptions and Billing Monitoring Analytics and Reporting APIphany also gives you the ability to host the API in a variety of cloud providers, and my favorite is they provide you with an API to manage your API.

			<p>
While I was out in Washington DC this week, one of the Presidential Innovation Fellows in my workshop was from the Department of Energy, and shared one of the best examples of APIs delivering value I&rsquo;ve seen in awhile.
The US Department of Energy has developed the Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework (KDF), which is a platform for researchers and engineers from national laboratories, academia, and private industries to upload files, customize information online, and exchange knowledge with each other.
The Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework provides acess to a landmark &ldquo;Billion-Ton&rdquo; bioenergy study on fuel resources, providing a wealth of information from a variety of researchers.   The study generated a large volume of interest, and resulted in numerous requests for raw data disclosure from the researchers.
In response the project deployed a web API, providing direct access to raw data, saving the resources necessary to reach out to researchers as well as the researchers valuable time in processing requests and providing data.
The US Department of Energy estimates they saved $882,000 in operational costs and researchers valuable time by bundling the API with the bioenergy study.
This is why I evangelize APIs.  The US Department of Energy case study demonstrates not just the value of APIs, but how they can actually make government more efficient and save tax payers money.
In addition I strongly advocate that&nbsp;APIs and raw data access should be default for all studies and resulting reports, allowing anyone to dive deeper into the research and provide additional insights.

			<h3><a href="/2012/10/24/version-control-your-api-documentation-with-github/">Version Control Your API Documentation with Github</a></h3>
			<p><em>24 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Out of date API documentation is by far the most common mistake API providers make, and also the number one pain point for API developers.  It makes sense that you will want to keep your API documentation in sync with each version of your API, and one way to handle this is to version them both, using Github.
To use Github for your API documentation, all you need to do is create an single public repository, which you can use to manage HTML versions of your API docs.  By putting your API documentation in its own repository you can keep the version of the API code repository in sync with it's corresponding documentation.
With the API documentation in Github, you can then easily publish to your API area or just allow developers to go directly to the Github repository and browse documentation there.
To help you edit your API documentation, you can use tools like prose.io,&nbsp;which will allow even non-developers to assist in maintaining API documentation, with all changes stored neatly in a central Github repository.
Storing API docs in Github will also make them more portable.  Some developers may wish to download a copy for offline work, or just prefer having locally for their own reference.
With the right approach to managing your API docs with Github, you can easily keep them up to date, in sync with your API, while also making them easily accessible by all API consumers--without much of the headache often associated with managing API documentation.

I spent two hours with a handful of the Presidential Innovation Fellows in Washington DC yesterday.  They were some super savvy folks from a wide variety of agencies and backgrounds including education, energy and health.
During my two hours with them I walked through several areas of  the API industry, from my perspective, including:

History of APIs
API Planning &amp; Design
API Development
Business of APIs
API Service Providers
API Tools, Services, Platforms
Politics of APIs
API Evangelism
What&rsquo;s Next for APIs

You can access my innovation fellows presentation off API Evangelist, I&rsquo;ll leave it up permanently.  It&rsquo;s minus all my commentary and banter, but hopefully it will give you an idea of what I covered.  If you&rsquo;d like a custom presentation on it, let me know and I&rsquo;ll see if I can find a slot to do a Google Hangout.
I had a blast talking to the Presidential Fellows, and I hope that I left them with some value that will help them be successful in their various initiatives.  They are already halfway through their sprint, and have a lot of expectations put on them.
I will be following their progress closely and publish any stories I can on their progress.

			<p><em>24 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>I had a great discussion with a friend who works in federal government yesterday. We were talking about various ways to &ldquo;successfully&rdquo; deploy APIs within the federal government. She gets APIs, understands the benefits, but she had some very realistic perspectives on where API deployment within the federal government can fail. While discussing this with her, we kept coming back to two points: API Garbage Littering the Internet - With some of the tools, making it easier to deploy APIs, the potential to just post meaningless and worthless data sets grows Lack of API Ownership - There are big movements to get APIs deployed, but then very little ownership once its up. Regarding worthless APIs being deployed, I think we can mitigate this by providing some sort of ranking or voting systems for APIs, allowing developers to upvote or downvote and add some critical feedback on what is right, or what is wrong. This will allow the &ldquo;cream&rdquo; to rise to the top, and everything else just disappear from view. Next, her perspective on lack of API ownership after an API is launched, is a very big problem. It is something I see in the public sector all the time. Everyone gets excited about standing up an API, but once it&rsquo;s in the wild, they lose enthusiasm--leaving the API to whither on the vine. APIs will not succeed if they do not have an owner. For technology companies, it might make sense for them to have an API as a product, assemble a team and dedicate resources to the API. &nbsp;Even hire an evangelist or advocate. When it comes to government, maybe we need a different approach. A sort of personal API deployment platform like Socrata API Foundry, that will let anyone publish a dataset as API--allowing any individual to achieve "machine readable by default", as directed by President Obama back in May. By empowering data owners within government to publish themselves, and give them...[<a href="/2012/10/24/a-problem-with-finding-api-owners-in-government/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>While doing the weekly hackathon roundup in September, I noticed an uptick in the number of Windows 8 hackathons that are going on. I decided to reach out to Microsoft and see if I can get more information on what they are trying to accomplish, and see what their perspective is on hackathons. After talking to several people I was directed to a gentleman by the name of Warren Wilbee (@wwilbee), Director of ISV Evangelism at Microsoft. Wilbee is a passionate evangelist, one that isn't just externally evangelizing, he is actively working to evolve internal culture and options about the value of hackathons at Microsoft. When I got on the phone with him, he said the reason I was directed to him is because he had recently circulated an internal memo regarding the makeup and value of hackathons. He feels strong that hackathons are very useful, you get the opportunity to get X number of people into a room, doing exactly what you want--delivering a very direct result. "Hackathons are purpose built", when you put on a hackathon for developers you get to define exactly what you, sending the desired message your company wants developers to receive, says Wilbee. By contrast, sponsoring a hackathon is a very different exercise and value proposition--proceed with caution. The hackathon organizer gets to define the purpose and drive the outcomes. The sponsor will not have access to this value, potentially excluding you from all the marketing or social "halo" produced at the event. Sometimes there are opportunities to offer a prize that will be in-line with the organizers purpose, but just flashing your logo will not deliver much value to your company. When you do put on a hackathon, Wilbee is passionate about it being a "participatory event". Get your people to come and participate, don't just require them to show up, make it part of their responsibility to be involved.

			<h3><a href="/2012/10/22/open-source-your-api-with-github/">Open Source Your API With Github</a></h3>
			<p><em>22 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Github&nbsp;is a frequently used service in the toolbox of API owners.  The most common use of Github is for publishing API SDKs in a variety of languages and platforms.  But when it comes to truly being an "open API", some API owners are actually open sourcing their API design using Github.
Open sourcing the design of your API will not be sensible for every provider.  Many companies are looking to ensure developers use their API, maintaining an advantage over competitors.  However in some cases, open sourcing the design of your API is a way to ensure interoperability between partners or among mutliple companies within a certain business sector.
Simple examples of an API design might be for common systems like blogs, news, links, calendars or other API designs that don't deliver any sort of proprietary offerings.  If you are looking to ensure synchronicity between say, the calendar of multiple organizations, developing a single API and open sourcing the design and possibly a version of it in multiple programming languages, might make sense.
With a consistent API design, and code to deploy the API, any organization can download or fork the Github code, deploy the API for themselves--ensuring consistency and interoperability between any deployment. If a single organizations has unique needs, they can extend and commit the code back to Github, allowing the central repository manager to decide if it is a change that should be added to the core offering.
Not all APIs are created equal. &nbsp;Consider the possibility of actually open sourcing your API, the benefits it might bring to others, as well as your organization--they might exceed keeping it closed and proprietary.
This approach to using Github, is by far the truest meaning of the word, "Open API".

When 3Scale and I first decided to do the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference in New York, one of the first people I reached out to about speaking and sponsoring the event, was Laura Merling (@magicmerl), SVP Applications Enablement Platform and Strategy at&nbsp;Alcatel-Lucent.
As soon as I told her about the event, she said &ldquo;We are in! What do we need to do, to support it!&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m stoked to have Laura kick off the event on Thursday, November 1st with a keynote as well as having Alcatel-Lucent as a gold sponsor.

If you&rsquo;ve never heard Laura speak, I highly recommend making sure you are there.  She always has great insight into the success Alcatel-Lucent is having within emerging markets and the telco space. &nbsp;Also, her talks are always positive, energetic and demonstrate leadership in the space--something I want my daughter Kaia to experience.
During Laura&rsquo;s keynote I&rsquo;m sure we will here more about Alcatel-Lucent's new open source offering, API Grove, as well as their openly licensed API lifecycle and methodology.
Make sure you get registered today, before the event is sold out--there aren&rsquo;t many tickets left. &nbsp;I'll see you there.

			<p>The API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference is kicking off in 12 days in New York City. The event will be keynotes, sessions and panels from over 60 leading individuals across all sectors of the API industry. I&rsquo;ve wanted to have an API industry event that was about ideas, practice and strategy, not just about companies, their products and clients for a while now. This is something that I could never achieve on my own. I just don&rsquo;t have the money or all the connections to bring everyone together. To make API Strategy &amp; Practice happen it took the right partnership. That partnership is with API service provider 3Scale. The 3Scale team views the industry much like I do, that by openly educating people about the benefits of APIs and discussing the technical, business and political challenges we face in the industry--we can truly make change across all business sectors. &nbsp;Allowing all of us to be succesful in whatever products and services we provide. Through the regular discussion I have with the 3Scale team, we discovered our shared desire to have such an API industry event. We discussed what the event would look like, then quickly started figuring out what it would take to make it happen. We felt we both had resources necessary to pull it off, and even though there is a lot of risk, that it was something that had to happen, for the benefit of the industry. Here we are, 8 weeks later, and the event is a reality. I just wanted to say thanks to 3Scale for not just sharing my vision of the API industry, but also partnering with me to make this event a reality.

I finished updating the speaker lineup for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference this weekend.  While we still have a couple of panels to finalize and keynotes to announce, the speaker lineup is almost final.
We have spent almost 8 weeks reaching out to leaders across the API industry, soliciting submissions for keynotes, panels and sessions.  It has been a lot of fun taking all the submissions and crafting the most compelling schedule as possible.
It was really important to me that we didn&rsquo;t just&nbsp;discuss the common areas of the API industry, like service providers, REST, etc.  Not that these aren&rsquo;t relevant--they are!  But I wanted to make sure we discuss some areas that are critical to the space, but do not get much airtime.  Topics like API design and API life-cycle methodologies.
I feel it is also critical to discuss where we are going, by covering topics like API automation, aggregation and building of programming frameworks on top of numerous APIs--trends that will allow us leap forward in how we consume and build apps on top of APIs.
In the next two weeks I will be going through our lineup in detail and talking about the various API session tracks like music, social, payments, government and education to name a few prominent session areas.

While I started getting excited about this event back in August, it is really starting to get real.  I&rsquo;m really psyched about how this event has come together.  There will only be 250-300 people at the event, so it&rsquo;s going to be a very intimate opportunity for network with these API industry leaders.
Make sure and register for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference ASAP, and I look forward to seeing you there.

			<p><em>13 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>As part of my research into how to create healthy developer communities, I've been spending time reaching out to organizers of developer meetups in different cities so I can get some insight into what it takes to successfully organize and run a developer meetup. I recently spoke to Jeremia Kimelman (@jeremiak)&nbsp;of Tout, who runs Mobile Monday Developers. Jeremia took over the Mobile Monday Developers with the idea that he would create a meet up format where tech companies could reach out to developers in a non-spammy way. Companies could sponsor workshops and come in to deliver on topics like HTML5 or HTML5 vs Native Apps, and do it in a way that would add value to developers worlds. This is a model that I'm sure many tech companies would drool over, and very often view meetups as a perfect medium for this type of sales pitch. As I reach out to meet up organizers I get the vibe that many of them already get solicited by companies in this fashion--either because they don't respond at all, or by being somewhat hostile to my questions about their meetup. Jeremia was able to grow his meet ups from about 40 to 140 members with this model, but when I asked him if this was a model that could be replicated, he replied, "definitely not". It doesn't create value. It doesn't solve the problems developers face and ultimately will doom your meetup to failure. As platform and API owners it's easy to drink our own kool-aid and think what we are offering is what developers want. Jeremia said it's easy to project your business understanding onto developers, and assume they are concerned with things like monetization and in-app payments, when in reality these things might be the furthest thing from their minds. In an effort to truly deliver value to developers, Jeremia decided to pivot, working to better understand better how to make it a community owned event....[<a href="/2012/10/13/thoughts-on-running-a-successful-meetup-from-jeremia-kimmelman-of-mobile-mondays/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was honored this month to receive an invitation from Todd Park (@todd_park), the U.S. Chief Technology Officer, on behalf of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program, to come out to Washington DC and spend an afternoon coaching and working with some of the Presidential Innovation Fellows on the Open Data Initiatives project. The Presidential Innovation Fellows program brings together top innovators from the private&nbsp;sector, nonprofits, and academia with top innovators in government to collaborate on solutions that aim to deliver significant results in six months, while being supported by a broader community of interested citizens throughout the country. The objective of the OpenData Initiatives are centered around: Stimulating a rising tide of innovation and entrepreneurship that utilizes government data to create tools that help Americans in numerous ways Working with the Innovation Fellows is just one areas I&rsquo;m working to change the way our government works using APIs. I strongly feel that opening up our government, and evolving how it operates using web APIs is fundamental in bringing democracy into the 21st century. While speaking with the Innovation Fellows I will cover the usual material I have published here on API Evangelist: History of APIs - Brief overview of the modern web API movement API Building Blocks - The essential building blocks to a successful API API Service Providers - Roundup of the service providers who can help deploy APIs API Tools - Pull together list of tools that can be used to design, deploy and manage APIs Industries - Some of the top industries putting APIs to use Hackathons - How hackathons are being used to drive innovation My intentions are to help share everything I know with the fellows to make sure they are well equipped to execute as part of the OpenData Initiatives. APIs will be the underlying technology that stimulates innovation and the interface that allows Americans to develop tools that utilizes government data.

Lots of big news coming out of Apple's World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC2011) in San Francisco today.
We saw major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion. What really stood out was their new iCloud.
iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.
This means documents you've written, presentations you've prepared are available on any IOS device. You can view and edit the same document, in its latest state, on all your devices. And since iCloud automatically updates any changes you make, you don't even have to remember to save your work. 
iCloud will also have a full set of APIs for developers to take advantage of, allowing them to implement iCloud storage, sync, and backup for documents into any application.
Apple's iCloud represents a continued evolution of the file system from being local to existing on the Internet and available on any device. This means that all design, collaboration, publishing and printing will move off the desktop as well. 
More to come on iClouds role in self publishing and print on demand integration.

			<p>Many folks who encounter API Evangelist think I'm working to evangelize a single API. &nbsp;I field so many questions about this I thought I would address by publishing an API Evangelist mission statement.&nbsp; The mission of API Evangelist is to educate business, nonprofit and government leaders about the value of APIs to their organizations. API Evangelist is made up of four properties: API Evangelist (apievangelist.com) - Business of APIs API Voice (apivoice.com) - Politics of APIs API Stack (theapistack.com) - API discovery and ranking Hack Weekends (hackweekends.com) - Hackathon news and calendar With API Evangelist I strive to be the independent voice for the industry, providing the public with information about API: Building Blocks Service Providers Industries Tools News Analysis The goal is to provide a wealth of resources for those looking to design, develop and deploy APIs without bias towards a specific platform--allowing them to make an educated choice about what path they should take. To stay independent and operate API Evangelist, I need to bring in revenue, and keep things moving forward. I strive to do this in as healthy of a way as possible, without giving away control over my attention and focus, and contribute as much as possible to resources I provide to the public. Areas I currently offer consulting services in are: Strategy API Evangelism - Design and oversight of companies API evangelism efforts Monetization Strategy - Design and oversight of a companies API monetization, business model and incubation approaches Hackathons - Targeting, planning and execution of hackathons Research Industry - Analysis of specific industries, API providers within and the opportunities available Markets - Identifying and deeper understanding of evangelism opportunities within specific cities and countries Developer Profiling - Targeting and profiling of developers within industries, markets and of specific, existing APIs Providers - Providing a deeper understanding of how specific APIs operate their API operations Speaking Webinars - Participating in webinars with companies and individuals Conferences - Speaking and...[<a href="/2012/10/12/the-api-evangelist-mission/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>NPR is defining new models for content distribution. One that other media providers can follow, when designing their API driven content delivery platforms. The NPR Story API provides digital access to NPR content and to other station content--allowing both NPR and stations to contribute and consume local and national news stories. In an effort to provide NPR stations with more control over the content they contribute to the platform for distribution, NPR Digital Services has introduced content permissions control via the NPR story API. Currently content stored on the Story API&rsquo;s platform can be retrieved by anyone with an API key--allowing content pushed across the network to be consumedd in 3 ways: Create Once, Publish Everywhere - Stations and npr.org push content into the API and then pull the content onto other platforms, such as other station-owned web properties and mobile apps Station Networks - Content is shared between multiple stations in a content network, both on web sites and mobile apps National - Station content is featured on npr.org and NPR mobile apps with links back to station digital properties Using the new content permissions, stations can now control who is allowed to pull their content from the API. The permissions work by allowing stations pushing content to specify whether the content should be: Public to all Public to the NPR station network Public to a group of stations listed in a whitelist Public to everyone except for stations on a blacklist The new changes allow stations to set these permissions at the individual story level, as well as create permission groups to add multiple stories to. NPR's approach is a great model for how APIs can facilitate content exchange across a large network of providers, allowing for the widest distribution possible-while also allowing content owners control over who has access to their valuable content in a very granular way. APIs are all about providing access to valuable content and resources, but should also...[<a href="/2012/10/10/npr-adds-content-permission-control-to-their-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Marketing to developers is no straightforward task, and with the growth in the number of APIs, platforms, tools and active evangelists and advocates, it is only going to get harder.
Developers just don&rsquo;t want to be sold anything.  We just want to do what we do, and just be left alone--until we need help and reach out.  Then we need you to be there.
With API Evangelist I&rsquo;m evangelizing the importance of APIs to a wider audience beyond developers, while also helping companies understand how they can market their services to developers.
Helping non-developers understand about APIs is getting easier each month, while helping API owners market to developers is getting harder.
Many companies are even opting to not use the term advocate or evangelist, as these names are beginning to have a negative impression with developers.
Developers are bombarded by one or many evangelists, everywhere they go, and many of these evangelists are more sales and marketing than developer support--giving everyone a bad name.
If you are looking to evangelize your API in the near future, deeply consider your approach.  Your objective is not to sell developers on your API, but to help them be successful in what they are doing--something that may or may not involve your companies API.
Your only option for evangelism is to be as authentic as possible and truly solve the problems developers face, otherwise developers will look elsewhere--and with the increased competition, developers have a growing number of options when it comes to APIs and platforms to get the job done.

I will be doing a webinar with Chris Haddad (@cobiacomm) of WSO2 on October 9th, where we discuss API management best practices for digital business ecosystem.
WSO2 is one of my partner API server providers.  I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what they do because they were the first open source API service provider to emerge out of the 20 API service providers in the space.
Chris and I will be exploring a couple are of specific areas, regarding the business of APIs:

Emerging API economy and digital business ecosystems
How to assemble the building blocks of a successful API
When a complete open source API management platform delivers business value
Future trends in maximizing the value of APIs

WSO2 brings a wealth of API experience to the table and I look forward to exploring these areas with Chris.    The webinar titled "WSO2 Case Study &ndash; API Management Building Blocks and Business Value", will be on Tuesday, October 9, at 9:00 a.m. &ndash; 10:00 a.m. PDT.
Look forward to having you there, visit WSO2 for more information.

			<h3><a href="/2012/10/06/github-is-the-social-network-of-the-future/">Github is the Social Network of the Future</a></h3>
			<p><em>06 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>There is a lot of news about social networks in the last couple of weeks, with Facebook reaching 1B users, a brand new look for MySpace giving people hope for the struggling social network, the great Twitter migration to App.net and what a master of improv Dick Costolo is, writing Twitters script. All of these news items are in some way trying to convince us of what the future of social networking will look like, declaring Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and App.net as a contender. While all of these social networks aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, I think there is one social network that represents the future of all social networks--Github. If you don&rsquo;t know what Github is, you probably aren&rsquo;t a programmer. Github is a social network built around the software version control software Git. &nbsp;Using Github, programmers can collaborate around repositories of code, which allows them to download, fork and commit back code in any format--making software development a social endeavor amongst potentially thousands of developers. While Github is primarily a social network of programmers, repositories don&rsquo;t have to be just code. Github repositories can contain HTML, text files and many other formats that can be edited by anybody--allowing the power of version control and collaboration to occur between anyone, in any business sector. I just finished watching Clay Shirky&rsquo;s talk on how the Internet will (one day) transform government, using the platform to deal with a flood of new, often times divergent, ideas. As always, Clay masterfully uses history to lay the groundwork for his argument, that social collaboration and version control with Github is in alignment with how democracy should work. While Twitter and Facebook have proven to evoke profound social change, I think Github holds amazing potential for change as well. And whether it is allowing developers to build open source software, government to make the legal process truly inclusive of its citizens or empowering our teachers to collaborate on classroom curriculum--Github holds...[<a href="/2012/10/06/github-is-the-social-network-of-the-future/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2012/10/04/hack-the-process/">Hack the Process</a></h3>
			<p><em>04 Oct 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Hackathons are a popular way for developers to come together and hack on mobile and web apps, in hopes of winning prizes and getting noticed for their innovation.  Silicon Valley has done a great job of keeping hackathons about building apps, but there are many other ways to apply the hackathon model.
One hackathon model that I&rsquo;ve seen a couple times now, is more about hacking a process, rather than hacking an app.  A hackathon where any company, organization or individual can come, with their existing process, and walk participants through what they are looking to accomplish--with the goal of making it better.
The process could be anything they already do on a regular basis and are looking to optimize, or a new process they would like to develop. In our ever-increasing digital world, where Software as a Service (SaaS) and APIs are becoming commonplace in our daily lives, there is an need for constantly identifying, refining and establishing new processes.
APIs open up huge opportunities for more efficient ways of getting things done, and a hackathon is a great way to pitch a process to a bunch of new users, form teams and spend some time hacking together a more efficient way to get it done.  The objective of this form of the hackathon is to refine a process and help make it better, using technology to better solve the problems we deal with every day.
While building apps is a great focus of a hackathon, they might be better used to help people gain efficiencies at their companies and organizations--allowing them to get access to creative new approaches, and knowledge about other potential tools and platforms they can put to use. &nbsp;
I predict hackathons will continue to grow in popularity, and hopefully we can continue to evolve them to reach the widest possible audience. &nbsp;

The Tumblr engineering team has been hard at work on a new Github page, showcasing the open source projects they've released. &nbsp;
Tumblr has also added a coming soon section, highlighting open source projects they are planning on releasing in the near future.
What's interesting is they have also included select presentations from conferences and events Tumblr has presented at.&nbsp;
The Github implementation by Tumblr is pretty unique, and to go even further, Tumblr has also&nbsp;open sourced their whole approach to deploying it on Github.

Tumblr's use of Github is worth showcasing. &nbsp;I think it's an innovative approach that other API owners could follow to showcase the open source project they are working on, as well as valuable event presentations.
I'm really impressed with the number of innovative uses of Github I'm seeing lately.

When it comes to any business, you want to showcase your team, and the value they bring to the table. &nbsp;
One of the things I do here at API Evangelist, is showcase great examples of technology across the API industry. &nbsp;
With this in mind I wanted to showcase the Singly team page. &nbsp;When you visit singly.com and click on team in the footer, you get immediately see a team member photo carousel:

Which isn't very unique, but next you get 3 things that are unique:

Average number of hours each Singly team member slept this week
Number of Github commits in the last 7 days
Distance walked by Singly team members


Singly team members provide this data using Quantified Self (QS) data from products like Fitbit and Runkeeper, and social programming networks like Github--driven by APIs. &nbsp;
Next Singly shows a map of their neighborhood in the San Francisco mission district:

Then they wrap up with Instagram photos from team members:

The Singly team page is the best company team page I have ever seen. &nbsp;It shows extremely personal data from their Fitbit and Rukneeper devices, as well as the day to day business of code pushes via their Github accounts. The team page also shows you where the team is located and some Instagram photos to help you get the vibe of the team.
What does your website team page tell about your companies team?

When you spend a lot of time going to conferences, hackathons and events, you start really getting picky about which events you go to. To disrupt my regular routine, I need an event that will always add value to my professional career, but also be a good time!
When it comes to the latest in Internet technolgy, I always make time each year for the Gluecon and Defrag conferences. Gluecon is usually in the spring and Defrag is in the fall--both occurring at the Omni Interlocken in Broomfield, CO.

Defrag is coming up November 15th and 16th--right after November 1st and 2nd for the&nbsp;API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC.
API Strategy &amp; Conference is psyched to be partnering with Defrag in our first year.  If you register for API Strategy &amp; Conference, you will get 10% off of your registration for Defrag.
The event combination will make November a great time to immerse yourself in the API industry, with API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference, then two weeks later, go further with Internet technology discussions at Defrag.
I look forward to seeing you at both API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference and Defrag in November!&nbsp;

			<p>Github should be the center of your API operations, with the most obvious use being for SDK repositories, but Github offers a lot of other valuable tools that you can use to help manage your API platform.
One great use of Github is as an API issue management tool. &nbsp;The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories.

To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management. &nbsp;Think of it as repository for your API itself.
Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentialy be part of the API product development cycle.
Along with API Issue Management with Github, you can link issues with the milestones portion of Github, providing deeper roadmap integration, but I will cover that in a separate post.

			<h3><a href="/2012/09/21/pulling-a-federal-agencies-digital-strategy/">Pulling a Federal Agencies Digital Strategy</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Back in May, when the White House CIO has released a strategy, entitled "Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People", which directs all federal agencies to publish HTML, JSON and XML versions of their digital strategy, I wrote a PHP script to monitor the progress.&nbsp;
To date, 25 federal agencies have successfully published their digital strategy, and I have been updating my script regularly to keep up. And while a few of the agencies still have querks with their HTTP Codes and with JSON formatting, the code is starting to stabilize. &nbsp;So I decided to start sharing it on Github, allowing others to put it to use.
The first sample script I'm publishing is a basic example of how to pull the JSON version of a single agencies digital strategy. &nbsp;Once it pulls the JSON, it then loops through each item and field on the strategy, and renders to screen. &nbsp;It doesn't make any assumptions on what you wish to do with data.
Next I will publish a more sophisticated version that stores values in a database. &nbsp;Here is the pull federal agency digital strategy PHP script:

			<h3><a href="/2012/09/18/will-your-company-be-found-in-a-siri-search/">Will Your Company Be Found In a Siri Search?</a></h3>
			<p><em>18 Sep 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m currently processing several discussion I&rsquo;ve had with folks about APIs and the future of search when it comes to voice enabled apps, like Apple&rsquo;s Siri.
It started with a discussion with the Webshell folks about their blog post, Webservices supply chain management : the SIRI case.  Next I was reading a presentation from Pat Cappelaere(@cappelaere) CEO of Vightel Corporation. called Building Tomorrow&rsquo;s Web Services API.
Pat has an interesting image in his deck, showing who the next generation consumer of your API will be:

These conversations reflect a whole new area of consideration for the future of web APIs.  Will voice be the dominant way to search via our mobile devices?  If so, how do we expose our companies resources, in a way that makes them easily consumed by voice enabled apps?
At the simplest, we need to discuss where REST fails us in this scenario, and at the most complex we need to discuss what &ldquo;activities&rdquo; will be consumed by voice apps and what types of &ldquo;supply chain management&rdquo; processes or framework will we need to manage all of this.
All of this will feed into to whether or not your company, its products and services will be found in a Siri-like search, when voice enabled apps become the default.
