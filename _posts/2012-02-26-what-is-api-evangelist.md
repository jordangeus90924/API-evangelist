{% include JB/setup %}<p>API Evangelist has grown beyond being just a research blog.It is time for me to update the about us page, and its time for me to tell the story of what is API Evangelist, and how I view my role in the API industry.API Evangelist started in July 2010.I was burning out in my job as VP of Technology for an events management company that managed events for SAP and Google.I was looking for a way to re-invent myself, doing something that I enjoyed, but also keep me employed for the next 5 years or more.</p>
