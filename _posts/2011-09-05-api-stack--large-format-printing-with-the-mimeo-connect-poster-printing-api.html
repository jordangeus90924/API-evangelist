     The Poster Printing API provides a RESTful interface, using application keys for authentication, with responses in XML or JSON. Â There are seven API methods for getting proofs, quotes, shipping options, place order and retrieve poster print order status.

     The Mimeo Connect Poster Printing API for large format printing is a perfect tool for the API stack.
