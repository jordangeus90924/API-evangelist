{% include JB/setup %}<p>Loggly recently changed the structure for their cloud-based logging service from a tiered pricing, to a user-defined variable pricing structure.Users can define their own pricing tier using two key variables: Daily Log Volume - 200MB to 8 GB Log Retention Time - 1 Week to 180 Days The pricing change was in response to a growing user base, and demand for volumes greater than 2GB/day.Loggly still offers a free plan which supports 200MB/day and retention of 7 days.There is also a beginning paid plan that starts with 200MB/day, but has retention of 15 days, starting at $8/month.Loggly is also adding support for secure syslog (TLS), HTTPs on web inputs, and log archives on all account levels including the free plan.</p>
