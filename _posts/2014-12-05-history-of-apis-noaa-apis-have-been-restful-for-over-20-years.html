<p><em>This post is a comment that was left on my&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/#comment-1725976136">Low Hanging Fruit For API Discovery In The Federal Government</a> post, showcasing some of the government API work I am doing. I get a lot of people who email me telling me that what I'm saying is nothing new, they've been doing APIs since 1492! ;-) Many of them are pretty hostile to the new API movement, but I love this comment from Bob Simons from NOAA, which is the exact opposite of many of the comments I receive.</em>
