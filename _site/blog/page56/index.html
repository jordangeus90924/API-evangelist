        <span class="post-date">17 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://zapier.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/zapier/zapier-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Some great <a title="API questions for Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier" href="http://startupjuicer.com/2012/12/wade-foster-co-founder-ceo-of-zapier/">API questions for Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier</a> over at <a title="Startup Juicer" href="http://startupjuicer.com/">Startup Juicer</a> today.</p>
<p><strong>Zapier is a company that couldn&rsquo;t have existed even a few years ago as API&rsquo;s were not commonplace. What other advanced do you envision changing the way businesses operate?</strong></p>
<blockquote><em>APIs are just the first piece, but it&rsquo;s still the wild west in the API world with APIs constantly changing. One thing that will happen is APIs will move away from polling driven to push driven. That way API consumers don&rsquo;t have to constantly asking providers for new data like a kid on a long trip asking &ldquo;are we there yet&rdquo; but can instead rely on the API provider to send us the data when we get to the proverbial travel destination.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>What your thoughts are about the changing landscape of API access with some of the free big networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin are becoming increasingly restrictive in the way they allow developers to access their feeds?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://startupjuicer.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/startup-juicer/startup-juicer.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>The only services I&rsquo;m seeing become more restrictive in how they allow developers to use their APIs are free tools. Many those services are in the high growth stage and are starting to think about monetization and are experimenting with lots of different ways to make money. Unfortunately this means instability for developers. Zapier leans heavily B2B though. And B2B services are doubling down on their APIs. For them, more usage of the API leads to more usage of the core product and since their core product is a paid service that means more paying users and the paying users are upgrading to higher plans. That means a service like Zapier is highly valuable to both API providers and to consumers alike.</em></blockquote>
<p>Those are just two of the questions <a title="Startup Juicer" href="http://startupjuicer.com/">Startup Juicer</a> asked, head over to the full <a href="http://startupjuicer.com/2012/12/wade-foster-co-founder-ceo-of-zapier/">interview with Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier at Startup Juicer</a>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/12/exploring-a-new-way-of-planning-and-executing-hackathons/">Exploring a New Way of Planning and Executing Hackathons</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hackweekends/oc-hackerz/oc-hackerz-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I started tracking on Hackathons full time in 2011, as part of my API Evangelism toolbox.  In 2012 I&rsquo;ve watched <a title="Hackathons explode and become a popular way for API owners to engage and build a relationship with developers" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/10/08/458-hackathons-in-the-united-states-so-far-in-2012/">Hackathons explode and become a popular way for API owners to engage and build a relationship with developers</a>.  (if done right)</p>
<p>As I do with other trending areas, I launched as its own site, <a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com">hackweekends.com</a>.   I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of demand from hackathon organizers and sponsors to add events and other news and information.  To support this I recently <a title="Open Sourced Hack Weekends on Github" href="/2012/12/08/open-sourcing-hack-weekends-using-github/">launched Hack Weekends on Github</a>, so anyone can edit pages, write blog posts and add events to the calendar.  A sort of crowd sourced hackathon hub.</p>
<p>To further support the hackathon community I also wanted to provide an <a title="open source hackathon guide" href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">open source hackathon guide</a>, helping anyone understand how they can throw their own hackathon.  There were already two great hackathon guides out there which are <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBuisDTIiBAz9u2tr7sgv6GdDLOV_aHbafjqHXSkNB0/edit">Open Data Hackathon How to Guide</a> and <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">The Hack Day Manifesto</a>---both licensed openly.  So I took this excellent material and merged with my own material to create a <a title="Hack Weekends Guide" href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">Hack Weekends Guide</a>.</p>
<p>The Hack Weekends guide provides a very detail guide to throwing a hackathon, and I also included a <a href="http://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">website template that runs on Github Pages</a> using Jekyll.  My goal is to make it a plug-n-play guide with all the tools and resources you need to be successful in your communities hackathon</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hackweekends/hackathon-home-2.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Next I need to actually prove my &ldquo;open source&rdquo; approach to planning, designing and marketing hackathons.  I&rsquo;m planning several hackathons to make sure the process works.  The first hackathon I am planning is for <a title="OC Hackerz" href="http://www.meetup.com/OCHackerz/">OC Hackerz</a> in Orange County, California.  OC Hackerz is a big supporter of developers, and is in sync with my vision of what the hackathon space should look like, so they are a great partner to plan two initial hackathons:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="OC Hackerz Hackathon Los Angeles" href="http://kinlane.github.com/oc-hackerz-hackathon/">OC Hackerz Hackathon - Los Angeles - March 2013</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The planning of the OC Hackerz Hackathon is meant to be an exploratory deployment of the Hack Weekends Guide, intended to make hackathon planning an open and collaborative process between organizers, sponsors and the local stakeholders.</p>
<p>Hack Weekends is all a work in progress.  So I&rsquo;m lookiking for feedback.  If you&rsquo;d like to get involved in hackathons or use the Hack Weekends process yourself, feel free to reach out.   The platform already has other supports such Singly, AT&amp;T and Hacker League.  My vision is to have everyone in the community contributing.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/11/what-does-singlys-appfabric-mean/">What Does Singly&#039;s AppFabric Mean?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/singly/Singly-Mobile-Fabric-Your-App.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> is continuing its quest to easily explain what it does for developers. &nbsp;The San Francisco startup has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/10/singly-launches-app-fabric-platform-for-developers-to-speed-up-integrations-with-dozens-of-services/">re-launched defining itself as, fabric for connected apps, or AppFabric</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Singly puts it best:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Singly AppFabric empowers you to add social login, sharing and friend finding into your mobile and web applications.&nbsp;</em><br /><em>Singly DataFabric handles syncing, data formatting, de-duplication, and normalization letting you query by location, keyword, and more.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When building mobile apps you are going to need to bridge social networks for your users, allowing them to authenticate with their preferred platform as well as pull friends, images and provide sharing in a meaningful way. &nbsp;You either do this platform by platform, or you use Singly's AppFabric to do this for you.</em></p>
<p>The best example of this in the wild, is with Singly developed mobile app <a title="Timehop" href="http://timehop.com/">Timehop</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://timehop.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/singly/timehop/timehop-1.png" alt="" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Timehop lets you see your photos and updates from this exact day in history.</p>
<p><a href="http://timehop.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/singly/timehop/timehop-2.png" alt="" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>To use Timehop, I need to sign up using <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> (this is Singly).</p>
<p><a href="http://timehop.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/singly/timehop/timehop-3.png" alt="" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Now I'm registered for Timehop and I have my <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> history connected.</p>
<p><a href="http://timehop.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/singly/timehop/timehop-4.png" alt="" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Using Singy AppFabric, Timehop allows me to easily connect my <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/foursquare">Foursquare</a>, <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a> and Flickr services.</p>

<p>Now <a href="http://timehop.com/">Timehop</a> can intelligently connect me to my friends across these networks and share my Timehop stories, where it is most important to me.</p>
<p>Singly is weaving together the most critical of social and personal APIs into an AppFabric, that developers can use to build the next generation of API driven mobile apps.</p>
<p>As a developer, you won't think of development with single APIs anymore like <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a>. &nbsp;You can use AppFabric to build meaningful apps, knowing the social authentication, friends, sharing, photos and other objects across the multiple networks is at your disposal in a single, standardized interface.</p>
<p><a title="Singly is AppFabric for our personal and social data" href="https://singly.com/">Singly is AppFabric for our personal and social data</a>, that developers can use to build the apps that we depend upon ever day.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/11/mulesoft-launches-api-discovery-hub/">Mulesoft Launches API Discovery Hub</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.mulesoft.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mulesoft/mulesoft-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API Discovery is becoming an increasingly troubling problem.  As an analyst, I see a dizzying amount of APIs each month.   When I get asked to find a particular type of API, or group of APIs in a particular industry--it gets difficult to discover a meaningful results to any query.</p>
<p>My options for API discovery historically has been <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.  The OG API Directory.</p>
<p>Today there is a new player on the block, <a href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a>.  APIhub is a fresh attempt at solving the API discovery, with over 13K APIs organized by category, type, protocol, format and security.</p>
<p>API Hub is looking to provide a solution for two distinct groups:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Developers</strong> - Developers need an ecosystem to discover, learn, test and use APIs</li>
<li><strong>Publishers</strong> - Publishers require a platform to publish, manage, engage customers, and monetize APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>With first release APIhub&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have much out of the gate that is different than <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, except for a much cleaner layout, search tools that is not cluttered by news, mashups and advertising.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apihub.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mulesoft/API-Hub-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Once you explore APIhub further, you start seeing early signs of deeper features.  When you add or claim your API, your given the option to upload a API spec in a Swagger or WADL format, with more formats coming soon.  If implemented for all 13K APIs, this could be a powerful discovery engine.</p>
<p>Beyond programmatic discovery I see hints of ranking on the platform.  Right now its just 5 star ranking, but have hopes for more sophistication on how developers, publishers and analysts can rank APIs in the future.  Allowing consumers to find new and existing APIs in meaningful ways--other than just 5 star ranking or my number of followers and mashups built on an API would be extremeley valuable.</p>
<p>APIhub, marketplace or directory is nothing new.  You see folks like <a href="http://apis.io/apis">APIs.io</a> trying to step up with a directory and startups like <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> providing a hub of their own, in a similar attempt to create an API marketplace.</p>
<p>I think there are several things that will decide whether <a href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a> is successful and it will center around their ranking and discovering algorithm, but also their ability to attract API owners to come, claim and enhance their listings.  But more importantly can APIhub and Mulesoft get developers to care and participate in curating, ranking and consuming APIs via the new APIhub? &nbsp;Just like the web API movement, developers will make or break APIhub. &nbsp;If it add values to developers worlds, they'll embrace it--if not, APIhub will have hard time staying relevant.</p>

        <p><a href="http://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/"><img style="padding: 15xp;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hackweekends/Hack-Weekends-Guide-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Hackathons have been a big part of current web API movement.  They are one of the most meaningful ways API owners can connect with developers in person. &nbsp;Twilio, Amazon and Facebook have all used hackathons to build their ecosystems.</p>
<p>I started a section on API Evangelist in 2011, dedicated to hackathons. And in early 2012 I rolled this section out as its own site, hackweekends.com. &nbsp;Over 2012 the number of hackathons has grown significantly--making it difficult to ignore hackathons as channel for reaching developers.</p>
<p>This weekend I <a href="/2012/12/08/open-sourcing-hack-weekends-using-github/">migrated the Hack Weekends directory to run on Github</a>.  It uses <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> for the blog.  I deployed <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">mustache templates</a> and JSON files for the events calendar and curated news section.  I&rsquo;m working on ways to easily crowdsource the management of Hack Weekends, while establishing it as an open source hub for the hackathon community.</p>
<p>In addition to establishing Hack Weekends as a hub for the community, I wanted to create a <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">guide to throwing hackathons</a>.  So anyone can organize their own event. To help feed this, I&rsquo;ve been gathering my own research on hackathons from attending, mentoring, hacking and organizing hackathons over last 2 years.</p>
<p>I also knew that there was other really good information available from other hackathon experts.  So I pulled together the best, open information on throwing hackathons and combined it with my own research.  Pulling content from:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hack Weekends</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBuisDTIiBAz9u2tr7sgv6GdDLOV_aHbafjqHXSkNB0/edit">Open Data Hackathon How to Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">The Hack Day Manifesto</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With this content and my experience I wanted to organize into something more.  Remixing and setting into motion,  a guide that anyone can use to organize a hackathon.</p>
<p>While maintaining the calendar for Hack Weekends, I see a lot of hackathon sites.  To accompany the Hack Weekends Guide I wanted <a href="http://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">hackathon organizers to be able to easily deploy a website in support of the event</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://hackweekends.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hackweekends/hackweekends-logo.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">Hack Weekends Guide</a> comes with a <a href="http://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">hackathon website template </a>as part of the Github repository.  So all you have to do is fork the Hack Weekends Guide, and you get a detailed guide in addition to a website. It is up to you, which parts of the guide you will use--as little or as much as you feel necessary.</p>
<p>The Hack Weekends directory, guide and website is meant to be community owned.  You can deploy any hackathon with the guide and site, and participate in marketing your hackathons using Hack Weekends and other partner sites.</p>
<p>I will be using the model to deploy 5 hackathons in the coming months, to contribute my own content and data, I hope you will get involved too!  I look forward to your feedback and hackathon expertise.</p>

        <p>While I was in Paris speaking at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io" target="_blank">API Days </a>last week, a drawing of me was circulated on Twitter. &nbsp;I was a little speachless when I saw them on Twitter. &nbsp;I am always looking for new graphics to use in API Evangelist. &nbsp;I worked for hours to come up with the logo I have, so I was stoked to see someone create something so cool, in the moment.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/enterprise-business.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>At the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas, NV last week I discussed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>"grass-roots web API movement"</em></span> with quite a few enterprise folks.  Walking through the exhibit floor, where I did my <a href="/2012/11/30/my-api-building-blocks-workshop-with-intel-at-the-gartner-aadi-conference/">building blocks of an API workshop</a>, I noticed the signage and discussions were all focused on APIs.</p>
<p>During my discussions with multiple enterprise developers, analysts, architects and executives, one question seemed to come up a lot:  <strong><em>Didn&rsquo;t we do all of this 10 years ago?  What is different this time around?</em></strong></p>
<p>With a strong focus on the technology of web services, many in the enterprise fail to see the difference between SOA and API.  In an effort to better tell stories in this area, I wanted to revisit the SOAP vs. REST argument, and refresh my thoughts. &nbsp;So I got to work pulling up old stories, and while conducting my research I noticed the same patterns I see in the REST debates--a heavy focus on the technical, with only a few discussions of the business and politics of web services.</p>
<p>If you are new to the SOAP vs. REST debate, let me get you up to speed.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">Wikipedia defines SOAP</a> as:</p>
<blockquote><em>SOAP, originally defined as Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of Web Services in computer networks. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em> SOAP was designed as an object-access protocol in 1998 by Dave Winer, Don Box, Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein for Microsoft, with a specification of SOAP currently maintained by the XML Protocol Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>After SOAP was first introduced, it became the underlying layer of a more complex set of Web Services, based on Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI). </em></blockquote>
<p>SOAP, XML and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Service">Web Services</a> are all part of earlier approach to APIs which is widely considered to be called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a> (SOA).  While SOA is still used in enterprise environments, it is considered in open developer circles to have been a failure in comparison to API efforts in the more grassroots, popular web API approach employed by companies like Flickr, Twitter and Amazon.</p>
<p>I will spare you much of technical detail of the SOAP vs. REST debate, but the the main advantages of a web API approach are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Simple and Lightweight</li>
<li>Human Readable Results</li>
<li>Easy to Build and Consume</li>
</ul>
<p>The SOAP advantages are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Rigid, Well Defined and Adhering to a Contract</li>
<li>Wide Variety of Development tools</li>
<li>Agreed Upon Standard</li>
</ul>
<p>SOAP is a very well defined, strict technical, industry defined set of rules for approaching APIs.  To the enterprise, SOAP and a SOA approaches appears to be the proper solution for the exchange of structured information.</p>
<p>But around 2003, outside the enterprise, we started seeing a shift in how developers viewed web services.  According to <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3005">Tim O&rsquo;Reilly of O&rsquo;Reilly Media</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>Amazon has both SOAP and REST interfaces to their web services, and 85% of their usage is of the REST interface. Despite all of the corporate hype over the SOAP stack, this is pretty compelling evidence that developers like the simpler REST approach. </em></blockquote>
<p>Over the course of the next nine years we see this trend continue with <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/1-in-5-apis-say-bye-xml/">REST + JSON</a> growing in dominance, wrestling control over web services and the term API from a more SOAP + XML approach.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/enterprise-business-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>After re-reading much of the SOAP vs. REST debate this weekend, I see the same as with the REST debate, where much of the discussion is technical.  But there are some great statements on what contributee to the success of API over SOA.  From <a href="http://supunk.blogspot.com/2012/08/rest-vs-soap-adoption-perspective.html">Supun Kamburugamuva on Life of a Software Engineer blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>REST as a framework gives the developers exactly that. The freedom to innovate. Developers love that. As a framework REST introduces very few rules. Most of them are not even rules. Rather they are soft guidelines. So building a proper powerful REST API is an Art and a challenging task. In my opinion this makes it cool. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>This is completely opposite to SOAP. SOAP gives the developer all the rules. First thing about SOAP is you get a SOAP envelope where you have to put your data according to some rules. So from start to end the system is pretty well defined. There are standards for doing even the simplest things. Top of all this SOAP is very complex to understand. So in my opinion SOAP doesn't give user the nuts and bolts to innovate. Instead it gives a half baked solution that user has to obey. I guess not all developers like to bog down by rules and they don't like to learn that kind of rules as well.</em></blockquote>
<p>Martijn Linssen at&nbsp;CloudAve also had a great statement:</p>
<blockquote><em>SOAP was originally introduced to and by Microsoft, and was one in a range of futuristic machine-to-machine self-describing protocols. Needless to say, the world wasn&rsquo;t ready then, nor is it now. Current implementations of SOAP are arbitrary, proprietary, bi-lateral human agreements at best. In their worst form, SOAP implementations are dictated by governments and other bodies of power and bring nothing else to the other party but a cumbersome and hard-coupled interface</em></blockquote>
<p>In my opinion SOAP vs. REST is about Structure vs. Simplicity, Defined vs. Organic, Control vs. Open.  The differences aren&rsquo;t just technical.  As technologists we like to see things through a certain lense, add in capitalists and we can really have our blinders on.</p>
<p>There are a lot of lessons in the modern web API movement that the enterprise can learn from.  SOA and API have a lot of parallels in trying to facilitate the exchange of structured information between applications, but where they begin to differ is that SOA was born within industry and within an enterprise.  API was born on the open Internet, where it was able to get the oxygen it needed to grow.</p>
<p>My advice to the enterprise is when you look at adopting a web API approach over SOA approach, you look beyond just the technology and vendor solutions--you need to look at a lot of the more human elements that exist in the business and politics of APIs.  Consider essential elements like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Keep things small, modular and intuitive</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong> - You should be widening access to your resources, not ever limiting</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong> -  While not everything should be 100% open, be as open as possible</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - Provide insight into operations and your roadmap allowing consumers to operate in alignment</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - Two way communication between you and your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Protect the privacy of your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong> - Be open to alternative licensing and ownership of content and data that is favorable to consumers</li>
<li><strong>Legal</strong> - Be as open as you can be with copyright, patents and trademark in API initiatives</li>
<li><strong>Terms</strong> - Establish terms of use that favor your business, but also the interests of consumers</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - Acknowledge the monetization needs of your consumers</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the key ingredients in the grassroots recipe that so many companies are following when deploying web APIs.  A balance of technical, business and politics has been found and is currently being explored in the web API movement. You can see examples of both success and failure in these areas, with APIs like Amazon and Twitter. Both API providers have found success technologically, but took different approaches to business and politics, delivering very different results within their respective developer ecosystems.</p>
<p>There is a reason web APIs have found success on the open Internet.  Web APIs require a certain amount of &ldquo;open&rdquo; to be present in not just the technical, but also the business and political layers.  When embracing APIs,  make sure you understand the full scope of why API is different than SOA--then internalize this difference and make it part of how you conduct business internally, with partners and the public on the open Internet.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://hackweekends.com/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hackweekends/Tag-Cloud-Hack-Weekends-Github.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been maintaining a calendar of hackathons for all of 2012.  Originally it was just a section off of <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, but eventually the site needed to be its own project.  Up until now its just been a blog and calendar of events I curate from Eventbrite, Twitter, Google, Eventful and event organizers.</p>
<p>I spend about 8-12 hours a week curating the events and stories for blog posts, and with the increase in the number hackathons over 2012, so does the time I need to maintain.  I was adding an API so other users can add to calendar or event guest post, then I decided I would like to also have databases of hackathon organizers, sponsors, vendors, venues and other key building blocks of hackathons.</p>
<p>My goal is to create an information hub for the hackathon community.  But an &ldquo;open API&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t seem like enough.  I wanted everything about it to be open and accessible, as well as community owned.  I decided to publish&nbsp;<a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com/index.html">Hack Weekends on Github</a> and run it like an open source project.</p>
<p>I launched the site using <a title="Github Pages" href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> with <a title="Jekyll" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.  These run the pages and blog for Hack Weekends. &nbsp;But, I needed something to run the calendar, and other systems.   I wanted them to be simple--I went with <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> + JSON stores.</p>
<p>The implementation isn't perfect.   I had problems getting search and sort tools to work, so I scaled back to a minimal viable implementation.  I got the following areas up:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Hackathon Calendar </strong>- Listing of hackathons global, sorted by city (for now)</li>
<li><strong>Cities Hackathon Directory</strong> - Breakdown of hackathons by cities</li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends Blog</strong> - Blog running on Jekyll, which I edit using prose.io</li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends News </strong>- Curated, relevant hackathon links from my pinboard</li>
</ul>
<p>I will get all the bells and whistles in there soon. Before that, I&rsquo;m working on a basic Github template for planning and executing a basic hackathon.  I would like to see hackathon organizers using a common, open approach to planning and delivering hackathons around the globe.  I&rsquo;m hoping it will work in conjunction with an open approach to Hack Weekends and other hackathon community sites.</p>
<p>Hack Weekends is a work in progress.  I went ahead and made it live, as its about 85% of what I had on the previous version.  Having it running as a completely client-side and static site on Github will force me to learn to approaches to manage my content and data in a way that is open and machine readable by default. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to fork <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends">Hack Weekends</a> and make contributions. &nbsp;You can add blog posts, news or calendar events. &nbsp;I will be building other client side tools for interacting with the site as time goes on. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of speaking at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> in Paris, France this week.  The organizers originally asked me to do one talk, but after some speaker shuffle, I ended up with three separate talks on APIs.</p>
<p>The second talk I did at API Days was <a title="The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal" href="/talks/apidays/internal-apis/" target="_blank">The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal</a>. &nbsp;This material was evolved from past stories I've done on <a title="Amazon" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon's</a> and <a title="Netflix" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/20/apis-power-netflix%E2%80%99s-move-to-cloud-enabling-world-domination/">Netflix's</a> success with internal APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I really want to tell more stories about other companies who have had success with internal APIs. But these are the hardest stories to come by, and I feel they are some of the most important API stories we can tell. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a great internal API story you'd like to tell, I love to hear more. &nbsp;Feel free to email or DM on Twitter, and we can figure out the best format to tell your story.</p>
<p>You can view my presentation of&nbsp;<a title="The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal" href="/talks/apidays/internal-apis/" target="_blank">The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal</a> from <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a>, and I believe the session was video taped, so I'm sure there will be videos coming soon!</p>

<p>The organizers of <a href="http://apidays.io/">APIs Days</a> asked me at the last moment if I'd like to do a third talk at the European API event, due to last minute cancellations. &nbsp;Of course, I jumped on the opportunity to generate to material and work through it in front of a live audience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The talk was on <a href="/admin/blog/Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up" target="_blank">business models for your API as a start-up</a>. &nbsp;On the plane ride over I reviewed <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmusser/j-musser-apishotnotgluecon2012" target="_blank">John Musser's great material on API business models</a>, and prepared a walk through, from a startup's perspective. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then after watching Guillaume Ballas (<a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebalas">@guillaumebalas</a>) from 3Scale give his talk&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323" target="_blank">APIs for Biz Dev 2.0, Which Business Model?</a> &nbsp;And watching other speakers I decide to scrap what I had put together, and went an entirely different direction.</p>
<p>I decide to walk through the evolution of an imaginary startup, keeping in mind 3Scale's philosphy that:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 35px;">
<p>Let's not ask what business model for my API.You should be deploying an API for your business model. @<a href="https://twitter.com/3scale">3scale</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebalas">guillaumebalas</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23apidays">#apidays</a></p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Then I walked through what I would consider a robust, healthy startup business model with five tiers:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15473323" width="342" height="291" align="right"> </iframe></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Free users</li>
<li>Paid users</li>
<li>Free developers</li>
<li>Paid developers</li>
<li>Partners</li>
<li>Incubation</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this approach isn't for every startup. &nbsp;I highly recommend checking out 3Scale's presentation if you want to better understand <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323">which API business model is right for your startup</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell the story of how you could apply some or all of the monetization strategies outlined by John Musser in his work, while also listening to Guillaume from <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>.</p>
<p>The talk is rooted in my research on the <a title="Business of Twitter's API" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Business of Twitter's API</a> and experience I've had in the field consulting and building strategies with existing API owners.</p>
<p>You can view the presentation of my <a title="Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up" href="/talks/apidays/business-models/" target="_blank">Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up</a>, and I believe the session was video taped so I'm sure there will be video coming soon.</p>

<p>I gave a talk at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> in Paris, France this week. &nbsp;This talk was using some of my usual material around the <a title="building blocks of an API" href="http://apievangelist.com/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">building blocks of an API</a>. As I always do, I omitted some slides and evolved my presentation a little further. &nbsp;This is one benefit of using <a title="reveal.js" href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a>, driven from the API Evangelist database--I can evolve my content and make better with each talk.</p>
<p>I discussed 5 main areas to consider when building your API developer portal:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>History of APIs</li>
<li>API Design &amp; Planning</li>
<li>API Development</li>
<li>API Evangelism</li>
<li>Whats Next for APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to keep organizing and sharing my view on API design, planning, development and evangelism so my readers can put to use in their own API efforts.</p>
<p>It was interesting to talk through my <a title="API Building Blocks" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building block</a> approach with API owners in France, after giving my talk. &nbsp;I learned a lot by talking with folks there. &nbsp;And I really think Europe has huge opportunity in front of it, when it comes to the API economy.</p>

<p>I got back last night from France, where I spent the week at the #APIDays conference, billed as the first international event on APIs in Europe.  The two day event was organized <span>by&nbsp;</span><a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a><span>, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and by</span><a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">WebShell</a><span>, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs</span></p>
<p>After some scheduling shuffling due to speaker cancellations API Days asked me if I&rsquo;d do three talks on APIs, instead of just my one--resulting in these three presentations:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Building Blocks (Bricks) For Your Developer Portal" href="/2012/12/07/building-blocks-bricks-for-your-developer-portal-apidays/" target="_blank">Building Blocks (Bricks) For Your Developer Portal</a></li>

</ul>

<p>While the building blocks presentation is my usual material (but needs to be told over and over to new audiences), the other two talks represents entirely new work based upon other stories and research I&rsquo;ve done in the past.</p>
<p>I learned a lot while at API Days.  It was about 200 people, discussing APIs over the course of two days.  I was really impressed with the passion everyone had for APIs and the genuine interest in understand the essence of the web API movement--discussing ideas, philosophies and approach rather than just the technology of APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://webshell.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-days-paris-france/webshell-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I feel an awakening occurring in Europe right now in regards to APIs.  My Twitter has lit up in the past three months with new European based followers focusing on APIs, and flood of new requests for discussions and information about APIs.</p>
<p>With a very healthy stance on transparency, privacy and data ownership I think the EU has an excellent opportunity to become a major player in the <a title="API Economy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>, and I predict good things to come out of not just France, but other EU countries in 2013.</p>
<p>I look forward to getting back soon, and talking APIs!</p>

<p>I read a great post recently about how a company called <a href="http://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/4979/Start-Up-Offers-Blueprints-For-3D-Printed-Parts.aspx">Teenage Engineering has started providing 3D CAD files that allow their customers to 3D print replacement parts</a> for the products they make.</p>
<p>It is awesome to see things I talk about become reality. &nbsp;I wrote about the concept of a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/08/01/my-3d-printed-junk-drawer/">3D printed junk drawer</a> last year, while doing research on 3D printing and APIs.</p>
<p>Teenage Engineering is taking a big step, and potentially leading the industry in new ways. &nbsp;Can you imagine if companies by default, provide 3D drawings of common replacement parts and pieces for their products?</p>
<p>There is still a lot of gaps in how all of this can work, 3D printing is widely available yet, but with retailers like <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/staples-3d-print-mcor-iris,19447.html">Staples playing around with offering 3D printing on demand</a>, the future for 3D printing is looking pretty bright.</p>

<p>There was a great post last week on <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> from Curtis C. Chen (<a href="https://twitter.com/sparCKL">@sparCKL</a>), on how a company called <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/11/22/spectragram-is-a-gateway-to-instagram-api/">Spectagram has launched a new JavaScript library built on top of </a><a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://lab.adrianquevedo.com/jquery-spectragram/">Spectagram</a> uses JQuery to provide a basic set of embeddable tools for Instagram allowing users to embed widgets showing latest photos, popular photos, and photos by tag.</p>
<p>Instagram has been notoriously focused on their core product, which leaves a lot of areas open to its developer community.  Even the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/">first version of the Instagram</a> API was created by a passionate developer.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see such a sophisticated Javascript library developed by a developer, essentially rolling out something <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a> should be doing themselves, but obviously haven&rsquo;t prioritized.  Something I&rsquo;m sure many API owners would love to have happen in their communities.</p>

<p>I conducted two workshops this week in partnership with Intel at the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas.  Working from my <a href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">Building Blocks of a Successful API</a> material, I put together a 30 minute workshop that I conducted at 12 and 6PM on Tuesday.</p>
<p>My workshop started with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=History">history of APIs</a>, then walked through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a> in 3 areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API Design&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Development&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Evangelist</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I stepped back and emphasized that APIs are all about research &amp; development and business development for your company.</p>
<p>After stepping back, I looked into whats next with APIs with API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, API automation platforms like <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTT</a> and new API programming libraries like <a href="http://webshell.io">Webshell</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of my talk was to plant a few seeds in attendee&rsquo;s mind:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs Are More Than Tech&nbsp;</li>
<li>APIs Require a Business Approach&nbsp;</li>
<li>Politics Can Be Biggest Killer of APIs&nbsp;</li>
<li>Focus Delivering Value</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view the slide deck below for the workshop.  If you&rsquo;d like a custom demo feel free to contact me and we can do a Google Hangout.</p>

<p>I got an email from Anthony Wu over at <a href="http://learnsprout.com/#home">LearnSprout</a> yesterday.  If you are not following what LearnSprout is up to, they are bridging legacy student information systems (SIS) and providing easy to use web APIs that application developers can use to build educational apps.</p>
<p>The email from Anthony was in regards to a SIS LearnSprout was integrating with, which he said:</p>
<blockquote><em>IlluminateEd is the best SIS API we've seen so far!   Clean &amp; simple. OAuth, JSON, no bullshit. If every SIS did this, we could just move on to greener pastures. This kind of thing should be encouraged!</em></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Anthony. The&nbsp;<a href="https://demo.illuminateed.com/dna/?ApiDocumentation">IlluminateEd API</a>&nbsp;is clean and simple.  They intelligently use common technical API building blocks like oAuth and JSON, while keeping the API interfaces intuitive and meaningful and provide simple, up to date documentation.</p>
<p>My only criticism is simple, and would be about the description for the API:  &ldquo;This API allows third party applications to interact and communicate with the Illuminate system&rdquo;.   This is a classic mistake from API owners.  Unlike Anthony I had no idea what the Illuminate system is.  I can assume its a SIS, but they should really make it a little more description for newcomers.</p>
<p>Even though the API isn&rsquo;t perfect LearnSprout says it is better than:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Humans as APIs (i.e. office secretary mashup with Excel)</li>
<li>CSV as APIs (the status quo)</li>
<li>Screen Scraping as APIs (for some, the ends justify the means&hellip;)</li>
<li>Legacy DOS terminal emulation</li>
</ul>
<p>Learsprout sees a lot of different approaches to accessing and sharing data between SIS systems.  They have a lot of value to bring to the industry, and I enjoying telling the story about what they are experiencing.  And I agree with Anthony and this type of effort should be encouraged within the education space.  Nice work <a href="https://www.illuminateed.com/">IlluminateEd</a>.</p>

<p>Right before the Thanksgiving holiday, in an effort to make the Facebook platform more responsive and dependable for developers, <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/11/15/delivering-important-alerts-about-your-app/">Facebook announced Developer Alerts</a>.  Developer alerts are a way for Facebook platform developers to receive critical information about their apps via email or Facebook notification.</p>
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts provide the following for Facebook app administrators:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Breaking Changes </strong>- If your app is using functionality that FB is changing or removing, you will be sent an alert at least 90 days before the change goes into effect</li>
<li><strong>App Status Changes</strong> - If you have submitted Open Graph actions or created an app detail page for App Center, FB will use Developer Alerts to notify you when the status of your submission changes</li>
<li><strong>Policy Violations and Enforcement -</strong> If your app doesn&rsquo;t adhere to FB Platform Policies you will be notified through these alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts are more than notifications, it is an issue management system which will allow multiple developers on a project to known when action is required or things have been resolved.</p>
<p>It seems like a great approach to improving communications between API platforms and its API application developers.  I think I will add platform alerts as an official API building block, and recommend it as something API should consider when developing their platform.</p>

<p>Poster boy for how to properly run your API ecosystem properly, <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, recently updated their <a href="http://www.twilio.com/doers">DOer Gallery</a> to highlight developers in the Twilio ecosystem that build cool stuff on the popular voice and SMS API.</p>
<p>Twilio has the best record I&rsquo;ve seen of any API, when it comes to showcasing and being loved by their developer community, and I'm sure the DOer Gallery plays an important role in that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twilio.com/doers"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/twilio/twilio-doers-gallery.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>

<li>Short Bio</li>
<li>Skills</li>
<li>Other Profiles</li>
<li>Projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Devloper Galleries like Twilios might not be for every API platform.  But if you have a passionate base of developers you might want to consider giving them their own profile and a gallery where they can not just discover and interact with each other, it can let other companies find potential developers to execute projects via your API.</p>
<p>A Developer Gallery can be a great way to give your API developers some love and attention.  Twilio even features developers from their DOer Gallery on their blog in a "DOer of the Month".</p>

<p>In 2012 the number of APIs has grown significantly.  We are transitioning from &ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t enough APIs&rdquo; to &ldquo;how do we more intelligently use many APIs&rdquo;.  As I track on this and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of web APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m noticing growth in the number of API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I was introduced <a title="Adigami" href="http://www.adigami.com/">Adigami</a>, a "Singly for Analytics".  While Singly focuses on personal data API aggregation, Adigami is focused on <a title="aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today" href="http://www.adigami.com/">aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today</a>--covering seven key channels:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adigami.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/adigami/adigami-data-visual.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web</strong> - Google Analytics</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - Google AdWords, Microsoft Bing</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - DoubleClick, Yahoo! APT, Facebook Ads, MediaMind</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Facebook Insights, Twitter</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Yahoo! Mobile, Verve Wireless</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> - MailChimp, SendGrid, ConstantContact, ExactTarget</li>
<li><strong>Custom</strong> - Adigami can import proprietary data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating your business on the Internet or "in the cloud" is a reality, and as we operate more and more in this cloud, each platform will have its own set of analytics--making the need to centralize and standardize analytics across channels and platforms more and more critical.</p>
<p>Adigami is just the tip of the iceberg.  I predict we&rsquo;ll see API aggregators emerge from top industries like government, healthcare and education.  In 2013 we will learn to more fluently communicate with web APIs with the help of API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a title="Adigami" href="http://www.adigami.com/">Adigami</a>.</p>

<p>Swag can be a critical tool in any API evangelist toolbox.  And stickers are one piece of swag that if possessing the right design, can be something developers will take home and put to use.</p>
<p>Earlier today Ari Fuchs (<a href="https://twitter.com/arifuchs">@arifuchs</a>), developer evangelist for <a href="http://www.aviary.com/">Aviary</a> asked, &ldquo;<strong><em>who do you use to print your sticker swag?</em></strong>&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 30px;">

<p>The legal building blocks of an API can be just as critical as the technical and business building blocks.  It makes sense to version and communicate your API terms of use (TOS) , privacy policy and branding guidelines alongside your code.</p>
<p>Since Github will allow document types other than code, such as markdown and PDF, it can make sense to use Github for managing the legal side of your API.</p>
<p>Using Github for the legal aspects of API operation will provide a level of transparency developers will appreciate, allowing them to download and store for their own records while being able to see the difference between each version, in a format that makes sense to them.</p>
<p>Just as with all other areas of an API, Github will allow you to completely manage the evolution of your API terms, privacy and branding in a way that is in sync with all the other technical and business building blocks of your API.</p>
<p>Consider using Github for API legal building block management.</p>

<p>I am heading to Paris, France next week for <a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>.  API Days is December 3rd and 4th in Paris and is dubbed as the <em>"First National Event on APIs in Europe"</em>.   The two day event is organized by <a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a>, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and by <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">WebShell</a>, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>&nbsp;sees the API economy the same way I do:</p>
<blockquote><em>The Web 1.0 was readable, the Web 2.0 was social, now the web is programmable through application programming interfaces, aka APIs. Web APIs are a unique opportunity for companies, governments and developers to either better organize the governance of their IT into a scalable and flexible model, either leverage a complete ecosystem around the organization, exchanging data through the web for trillion of applications on billion devices. Because each civilization has been described by the way it communicates and make exchanges, API are the beginning of a programmable civilization.</em></blockquote>

<p>The API event is hosting over 50 sessions from over 30 speakers--including two of my own talks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The Secret to a Successful API is Internal</li>
<li>Business models for your API as a start-up</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see APIs getting interest in Europe.  And after working with the Webshell team for several months and learning more about FaberNovel, I'm excited to be working with both of them to drive API adoption in Europe.</p>
<p>If you are planning on going to <a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>, let me know and I&rsquo;ll make time to talk.  If you aren&rsquo;t, I will publish more info about the event and my talks here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, when it is all wrapped up.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chartboost/Chartboost-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The team over at <a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank">Chartboost</a> have a pretty forward thinking <a href="http://blog.chartboost.com/post/36221629171/web-3-0-help-site?hn">blog post about what they see as the next generation of web application development</a>.</p>
<p>They feel that the future is about creating web applications, not sites.  The server side should be an API and the client should be a self-contained app which uses the API as its back-end.  With mobile applications following the same pattern.</p>
<p>To practice what they preach, Charboost is overhauling their help site to be an API driven web app using the following approach:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Push State</strong> - Provide site navigation without page refreshes by faking navigation and inserting JavaScript callbacks</li>
<li><strong>JSON-API </strong>- A REST API providing JSON to drive the site</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Design </strong>- Providing an application design that responds to mobile as well as it does laptops or desktop computers</li>
<li><strong>Vector (Icon Fonts &amp; CSS)</strong> - Using a combination of icon fonts and CSS3 to deliver the UI. SCSS - A new technology that uses CSS-preprocessing to make the CSS code cleaner and res-usable</li>
<li><strong>Markdown</strong> - Using the simple markup language to allow anyone on their team to write and edit help articles</li>
<li><strong>GitHub</strong> - Using Github to manage the help center as an open project</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chartboost/Chartboost-Help-Center-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I agree that their metholody has the potential to be one possible future of web and mobile application development.  JavaScript and API development have both matured in the last 10 years, getting us to this point where you can build some damn sexy, but simple apps that run smoothly on the web or mobile devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Or as Chartboost puts it:</p>
<blockquote><em>We believe that the web is finally reaching a tipping point. The culmination of a decade of incremental improvements to web technologies is upon us, and lets us do things in a way that is radically new and better.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m also playing around with my own approach to delivering apps in this way using Github + Jeckyll + Mustache Templates with JSON data stores, all running as open repositories using Github Pages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have more to publish on this in the near future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-access.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>Social analytics provider&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://www.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr</a>&nbsp;has won a temporary injunction against Twitter today, with a complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court. It reads:</p>
<p><em>PeopleBrowsr seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent Twitter from destroying its business, interfering with PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s contractual and prospective business relations, and restraining competition in markets using Twitter data.</em></p>
<p>The complaint was filed in response to a trheat from Twitter to cut off PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s access to its Firehose by November 30, 201 &nbsp;PeopleBrowsr has had access to the full Twitter full firehose for over four years. According to the complaint:</p>
<p><em>PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s products require the full Firehose feed. A mere sample of Twitter data is insufficient for PeopleBrowsr to provide the products its users expect. Though there are some data analytics companies that can provide certain limited types of Twitter data analysis based on sampling, PeopleBrowsr competes in a separate &ldquo;Twitter Big Data Analytics&rdquo; market, in which a few, highly sophisticated players analyze massive amounts of Twitter data to provide deeper insights.</em></p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s decision to terminate PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s firehose follows a&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">pattern of it consistently cutting off partner and developer access to the platforms and its data</a>. In doing so Twitter&nbsp;has sought more control in their effort to monetize the social networking platform and provide&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/07/22/investment-in-twitter/">investors with a return on their investment of almost 1.4B dollars</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/PeopleBrowsr-logo.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>PeopleBrowsr states that it has &ldquo;invested millions of dollars and years of work in building a business based on the Firehose&rdquo;. It says it did so in rlying on Twitter&rsquo;s representations that it would maintain an &ldquo;open ecosystem&rdquo; and allow other companies to use of its data. Through agreements with Twitter PeopleBrowsr felt it could compete without fear that Twitter would cut off access to its data in order to influence which businesses succeed or to usurp business opportunities for itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Twitter has consistently described</a>&nbsp;the Firehose as a part of this open ecosystem that it would make available to &ldquo;everyone in the system&rdquo;, and this open approach was a key component of Twitter&rsquo;s business strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The injunction PeopleBrowsr received today will keep their firehose access open until January, when further hearings on the case will be held. Until now, all the outcy regarding Twitter&rsquo;s restriction of access to the platform have been vocal, but without any legal action. The filing by PeopleBrowsr shows the situation has truly become serious and will move discussion about Twitter access from the tech blogosphere and hacker news into the U.S legal system.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Those of you who follow my blog, know my favorite API management service provider is <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a>.  It&rsquo;s no secret I&rsquo;m a fan of what they are doing.  We share a vision of the API space and what a healthy API industry <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> look like.</p>
<p>In support of that vision, 3Scale just launched a new open source API proxy build on the <a title="NGINX" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGNIX</a> web server technology--a move, I feel is important for 3Scale, as well as the entire API industry.</p>
<p>What makes 3Scale&rsquo;s approach signficant, is that by deploying the NGNIX proxy, API providers don't need to rely on proprietary API proxy solutions, while also gaining additional benefits, such as acess to a library of 3rd party <a title="addons" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/3rdPartyModules">addons</a> and <a title="modules" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Modules">modules</a> available in the NGNIX ecosystem. All while employing an established technology that has been proven to deliver in highl volume production environments.</p>
<p>In addition to the benefits provided by NGNIX, the proxy provides seamless integration with 3Scale&rsquo;s API management platform that delivers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API business modeling using service contracts, API rate limits and pricing rules</li>
<li>API access control &amp; security with API key generation with user id, app id, oAuth</li>
<li>API analytics &amp; reporting including alerts, statistics, business intelligence</li>
<li>API billing &amp; payments supporting pre-paid, post-paid, PCI compliant, six separate payment gateways</li>
<li>Developer portal for self-service registration and onboarding</li>
<li>Interactive API Documentation for better adoption using Swagger</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-API-Proxy-Admin-Panel.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This list represents everything you will need to get your API up and running.  3Scale enables you to do this both on premise or in the cloud, using a proxy that you cotrol--then alllowing you to choose which 3Scale API management services you need to use.  But what is most important for me, is 3Scale allows you start off without spending any money.  3Scale has a free, entry level tier that will allow you to design, experiment and iterate until you find the meaningful API definition that works for your developers--at which time you can scale, paying for only what you need, as you grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach is critical to success of individual APIs as well as the overall health of the API industry.  We need to allow companies to innovate without spending a fortune, give up control of their data, and being locked into unnecessary commitments--allowing the industry to go from thousands of APIs to millions of APIs as quickly as possible.</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;As of today this makes 3scale the API Management solution provider with the richest and most flexible set of technical options to manage API traffic,&rdquo; said Guillaume Balas, 3scale CMO. &ldquo;At 3scale we want companies with great and valuable APIs to be able to distribute them easily, rapidly, without hampering the economics of their API project and without disrupting their existing infrastructure: this what 3scale&rsquo;s API Management solution provides.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The 3Scale approach is in aligment with my industry philosophy, that we shouldn&rsquo;t stand in the way of API providers with costly, proprietary proxies.  We should leverage existing, proven, open technologies like NGINX to allow API providers to deploy wherever their infrastructure exists, either in the datacenter or the cloud--while enabling them to &ldquo;connect&rdquo; to the best of breed API management services, which allow them to scale, grow and evolve their API ecosystem in the healthiest way possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/State-Healthcare-Insurance-Exchanges.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was listening to a story about <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/165057222/nevada-quietly-starts-implementing-obamacare">Nevada quietly starting their implementation of health insurance exchanges</a>, as part of what everyone loves to call Obamacare.  I&rsquo;m not even going to get involved in the politics and merit of making sure everyone is insured--I want to focus on the execution of it.</p>
<p>Immediately I think:  <em><strong>Where is the state health insurance exchange platform API?</strong></em></p>
<p>According to healthcare.gov an exchange is:</p>
<blockquote><em> A mechanism for organizing the health insurance marketplace to help consumers and small businesses shop for coverage in a way that permits easy comparison of available plan options based on price, benefits and services, and quality.  By pooling people together, reducing transaction costs, and increasing transparency, Exchanges create more efficient and competitive markets for individuals and small employers.</em></blockquote>
<p>And the principles and priorities of state health insurance exchanges are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Establishing a State-based Exchange</strong> - Establishment of an Exchange is a critical step that States must take to be on track for achieving certification of an Exchange by January 1, 2013 under Section 1321. </li>
<li><strong>Promoting Efficiency </strong>- Exchanges must be mindful of costs for consumers, employers, and the federal government. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Adverse Selection</strong> - Successful Exchanges will avoid adverse selection by ensuring that those who buy through the Exchange are a broad mix of the healthy and the less healthy.</li>
<li>Streamlined Access and Continuity of Care.  Section 1311(d)(4)(F) requires Exchanges to evaluate and determine eligibility for applicants in Medicaid, the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and other health programs - Exchanges must also comply with all applicable federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination.  The federal government will provide critical building blocks and financial support for achieving an efficient enrollment process including verification of&nbsp;eligibility for tax credits.</li>
<li>Public Outreach and Stakeholder Involvement - Section 1311(d)(6) requires Exchanges to consult with a broad range of stakeholders in carrying out their activities.</li>
<li>Public Accountability and Transparency - Accountability requires transparency.  Section 1311(d)(7) requires public reports on Exchange activities, and Section 1311(e)(3) requires additional reporting, which should include standardized data reporting on price, quality, benefits, consumer choice and other factors that will help measure and evaluate performance. </li>
<li>Financial Accountability - Section 1313 provides for the efficient and non-discriminatory administration of Exchanges, and seeks to prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are going to successfully implement 50 state health insurance exchanges that meet the definition, principles and priorities of the federal government objectives, you will need an open source platform, complete with a robust API strategy.  Maybe it exists, and I&rsquo;m unaware of it.</p>
<p>If you know more about current initiatives in this area, please let me know.</p>

<p>Hackathons are a fertile environment for generating code based upon the ideas of its attendees.  However, much of the innovative programming that occurs at these events is forgotten the day after the event ends.  This process tends to leave developers working on the same ideas over and over, without much continuity.</p>
<p>To help remedy this, hackathon organizers can use Github to store code that is generated by all attendees. Organizers can encourage all developers to commit their code through-out the hackathon, and wrap up the event with a README file of their project as part of the presentation process.</p>
<p>Github can be a great way to showcase what was built over the weekend, make the intellectual property open and accessible for other people to use, and make it easier for other hackathon participants to build off what has already been created in the past.</p>
<p>Using Github for a hackathon can generate extra marketing for the event as well as the hackathon organizers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a href="https://singly.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/singly-logo_300.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for meaningful API analogies, to stock my evangelism toolbox.   Ways that I can relate the potential of APIs, in a way that anyone can understand, even non-developers.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the success of the web API movement lies in the ability to extend, potentially complex resources in a very simplistic and universal way.  So, as an evangelism I have to abstract away the complexities and make sure I connect with my audience.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m tracking on the API space and working to quantify the potential future of APIs, I&rsquo;m struggling to find meaningful analogies to articulate where API driven platforms like Singly are moving the industry.  But just as with the technology, leave it to the Singly team to do this for me.</p>
<p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> made a slight shift in their branding recently, using the words <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API Fabric</span></strong></em> in the description of what they do.  This seems like a slight change, but it truly is an exceptional way to describe the Singly approach to app development using social authentication and data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance, to a non technical person, fabric may be defined as:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>fab&middot;ric/Ëfabrik/</strong> Noun: Cloth, typically produced by weaving or knitting textile fibers</em></blockquote>
<p>With synonyms being cloth, material, structure, textile, texture and web. Using this definition of fabric as the source for my analogy can work by itself.  It can help a non-technical person understand what is possible when you can quickly begin weave together apps using different APIs--visualizing some sort of woven textile, with unique meaning.  Immediately helping anyone, visually relate to the potential when developing on top of social and personal APIs.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/mayan-weaving.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If you are more technical, the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; might help you understand Singly at another level. In information technology, fabric is a synonym for the words framework or platform.  In general, the term fabric can describe the way different parts of something work together to form a single entity.  Fabric can be used as a metaphor to illustrate the idea that if someone were to document computer components and their relationships on paper, the lines would weave back and forth so densely that the diagram would resemble a woven piece of cloth.</p>
<p>Bringing us back full circle to the visualization potentially related to non-developers.  The word fabric has deep meaning through our personal worlds, it might be your favorite jeans, blanket the uniform you wear to work every day.  APIs are fast being woven into every aspect of our lives, and the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; is an excellent way to relate what API providers like Singly are doing with specific groups of APIs, like personal and social data APIs.</p>
<p>Our sometimes very personal data and sometimes very public social data is fast becoming fabric of our daily personal and work worlds on the Internet and our mobile devices.  We are going to need to provide ways of assuring developers can build the most powerful, meaningful apps possible--by weaving together the best of breed data and resources into a strong API fabric!</p>

<p><a title="Socrata announced today that they are preparing to release an open source, cloud-based, open data system" href="http://www.socrata.com/newsroom-article/socrata-announces-open-source-option-for-leading-open-data-cloud-platform/">Socrata announced today that they are preparing to release an open source, cloud-based, open data system</a>, called the &ldquo;Socrata Open Data Server, Community Edition.&rdquo;  If you don&rsquo;t already follow what Socrata does, they are the data platform behind municipal open data initiatives like <a title="New York City Data" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/new-york-city/">NYC City Data</a>, <a title="San Francisco City Data" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/city-of-san-francisco/">San Francisco City Data</a> and <a title="Data.gov" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/data-gov/">Data.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The new Socrata Open Data Server is meant to be a reference for the <a title="open data standard" href="http://open-data-standards.github.com/">open data standard</a> they are actively evolving to promote data portability throughout open government data ecosystems, and support open source software policies in public organizations around the globe--called <a title="Open Data Substrate" href="http://open-data-standards.github.com/">The Open Data Substrate</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of the Socrata open source strategy is to enable customers to rapidly accelerate the process of breaking data out of traditional database &ldquo;silos,&rdquo; move it to the cloud and opening it for mass consumption to end users and developers. &nbsp;The Socrata Open Data Server will support the ongoing evolution of open data standards in three key areas, that Socrata feels are required for a thriving open data ecosystem:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Data Catalog Interoperability </strong>&ndash; Enable universal federation of different open data catalogs using a standard catalog schema, based on the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)</li>
<li><strong>Data Portability Based on Standard Data Formats &ndash;</strong> Standardize outputs including JSON, XML, and CSV, as well as RDF and other Linked Data standards. The goal is to evolve towards standard schemas that developers can use for popular data sets, based on real-world examples and collaboration between data publishers</li>
<li><strong>Application Portability Based on Open Data API Standards &ndash; </strong>Standardize the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used to programmatically access open data, using established paradigms and protocols such as REST, HTTP, and Structured Query Language (SQL)</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://open-data-standards.github.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/socrata/The-Open-Data-Substrate.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Socrata&rsquo;s move to open source their technology is in line with their mission:</p>
<blockquote><em>Socrata&rsquo;s mission is to help government organizations everywhere reap massive economic benefits from data liberation by promoting unfettered access, shareability, consumability and reuse of public data.</em></blockquote>
<p>And I share a similar vision with Socrata&rsquo;s CEO Kevin Merritt:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Socrata is constantly inventing new products that help people visualize and contextualize data in consumer-friendly web and mobile experiences, and as machine- and developer-ready APIs. We are part of a broader ecosystem that is creating massive downstream benefits and economic incentives for government to open the data floodgates,&rdquo; adds Kevin Merritt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough to reduce friction in the supply of data, we also need to hardwire interoperability and data portability into the open data experience, to keep everybody honest and create a financially-sustainable business model for the entire ecosystem to thrive."</em></blockquote>
<p>We need all city, county, state and federal goverment to have APIs.  Let&rsquo;s not stand in the way.  The same can be said about the private sector--which is why I have been a <a href="/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">proponent of more open source offerings in the API industry</a>.</p>
<p>The Socrata Open Data Server will be released in the first quarter of 2013, as freely downloadable open source software, but will also come fully integrated with other components of the company&rsquo;s commercial software products.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited by the opportunities for opening up government data with Socrata&rsquo;s approach, but we all have a lot of work to do.  We can&rsquo;t expect government to do it all alone.  Everyone needs to step up and help educated our local government about the potential of open data and APIs, and get involved and contribute to what Socrata has set into motion.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a href="https://developers.bandpage.com/home"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bandpage/BandPage-Connect-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bandpage.com/">BandPage</a>, a hub for musicians to manage and control their online presence, just expanded their reach with <a href="https://developers.bandpage.com/home">BandPage Connect</a>, an API, allowing  developers to build apps for the music industry.  I wrote about their <a title="update once, publish everywhere with an embeddable API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/25/update-once,-publish-everywhere-with-the-right-embeddable-api-strategy/">update once, publish everywhere with an embeddable API strategy</a> back in July, feeling an API would be next.</p>
<p>When it comes to a Bands most treasured assets, music is always held up as the most valuable piece of the catalog, but band info, events, venues, videos and photos of the band are essential to the success of these artists--emotionally connecting fans with their favorite bands.</p>
<p>This is where BandPage Connect comes in.  The API will allow bands to provide content to open API developers, as well as their partners, in a self service approach.  BandPage Everywhere allows bands to easily manage their presence with robust embeddable apps that they can easily distribute across the web, but BandPage Connect takes this to the next level--allowing developers define what is next, when it comes to building web and mobile apps that connect bands with their fans.</p>
<p>BandPage Connect provides a solid approach for the music industry to provide access to valuable band assets, but also provides a centralized way to control presence.  Ryan Kavontrka, Digital Manager for Maroon 5, Sara Bareilles, Gavin DeGraw, and Eve 6, says, "There are a lot of platforms out there that have our bio, photos, and videos, but the info they have about us is out of date and we don't have a way to change it. This makes it so that any member of a band or their manager/label can update the content, not just the guy who knows HTML. If you're connected with BandPage, you know your entire online presence is up-to-date."</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.bandpage.com/home"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bandpage/BandPage-Developer-Portal.png" alt="" width="525" /></a></p>
<p>All a band has to do, is manage their presence via BandPage, and they can use BandPage Everywhere to allow any fan or partner to easily embed content on sites and social networks, as well as allowing developers to build custom experiences--all while maintaining control over every aspect of a bands presence.</p>
<p>After diving into BandPage Connect they&rsquo;ve done a great job launching the API, providing valuable endpoints, and all the <a href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">essential API building blocks so developers can be successful</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;building apps on the platform.  I think the BandPage approach to their embeddable and API strategy, is a model for other industries that showcase artists, to follow--giving them the highest level of control over their presence, while achieving the large distribution and presence possible in an API driven online and mobile world.</p>

I&rsquo;m not a big fan of covering funding, acquisition or launch press releases, unless there a significant business story there.  But the acquisition of Vordel is another important sign for the API industry in 2012.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal haven&rsquo;t been disclosed, but the acquisition shows the API industry is maturing and producing desirable companies with proven API products, that larger software companies can use as a competitive advantage.  While Vordel's API management, SOA governance and identity management will help Axway&rsquo;s customers, I think Vordel&rsquo;s customers is probably the type of new client large software companies will want be also seeking out through acquisitions.</p>

<p>I always joke with John and Adam at <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> about, &ldquo;Is this the year of the API&rdquo;? They have been at it longer than I have, and are very hesitant to dub any particular year, the year of the API.  But, with the growth we&rsquo;ve seen in 2012, two open source API management platforms deployed and now a major acquisition in the space--I confidently would say 2012 is the year APIs came of age.</p>
<p>I predict in 2013-2015 we are going to see more of these types of acquisitions occuring.  Large software companies are going to need a robust set of API tools to bring legacy systems into the modern, API driven economy.  Companies that have invested in API management service providers like <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> will see the return they are looking for, as the space continues to grow in the next five years.</p>

<p>When you operate an API, you need to make sure and communicate with your developer community about what your plans are for the future, so developers can plan their own roadmap, and keep in sync with the coming changes to the API.</p>
<p>In addition to <a title="API issue management with Github" href="/2012/11/08/api-issue-management-using-github/">issue management using Github</a>, API providers can use Github to manage their roadmap using the milestones features of the social coding platform.  Milestones can be directly related to issues or can be larger goals around where you intend to take your API.</p>
<p>Milestones give developers insight into what the plans are the future of an API, using just a title, description and target date.  Milestones are one of the simplest aspects of an API, but can go a long way in creating goodwill with your developers.</p>
<p>API providers have to balance transparency versus giving away information to competitors, something that will take regular consideration.  A transparent roadmap for your API will let developers prepare properly, while also letting them know what features are coming in the future--eliminating the possibility of competing with your own ecosystem.</p>
<p>Consider what you can include in your Github roadmap, and using Github for issue management.</p>

<p>Mobile app development is at the center of API deployment in 2012.  Much of the interest in designing, developing and deploying APIs is so that you can successfully launch one, or multiple mobile applications.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions from companies looking to deploy APIs, where they can find development talent that will help them with their API driven mobile initiatives.  Up until now I didn&rsquo;t have much to offer them, any mobile developer I know that is good, is already snatched up, and without direct experience deploying projects with a development shop, I didn&rsquo;t have one to recommend.</p>
<p>Now that has changed, I&rsquo;ve been working with a rock star web and mobile dev shop called <a href="http://concentricsky.com/">Concentric Sky</a>. And over the last couple years I have really gotten to know their team of developers and management--and I&rsquo;ve been blown away by some of the projects they are producing:</p>

<p>Those are just a few of the amazing projects come out of <a href="http://concentricsky.com/">Concentric Sky</a>.  I&rsquo;m psyched to not just have a mobile and web development partner, but one of such high caliber.  I&rsquo;ve worked closely with their leadership, project managers and developers on a couple projects, lead their team on conference panels, and have made a habit of going out to lunch with members of their team when I&rsquo;m in town. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, in the future, when I get asked for recommendations of a mobile, web or API development shop, I&rsquo;ll be sending them to Concentric Sky.  Feel free to <a href="http://concentricsky.com/contact">contact them directly</a> and let them know I sent you, or you can contact me and I&rsquo;m happy to introduce you to their team.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://defragcon.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/defrag-2012/Defrag-2012-Conference.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was trying to explain the experience of being at the <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag Conference</a>, to a friend&nbsp;the other day.  We are both gearing up for the event, next week (November 14th &amp; 15th), in Broomfield Colorado, and he had never been to one so I wanted to share a little about what the experience is like.</p>
<p>The Defrag event is organized by Eric Norlin, who also organizes Gluecon and Blur conferences, all at the Omni Interlocken resort in Broomfield.  Each of Eric&rsquo;s events have evolved each year, but currently reflect the following focus:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://gluecon.com/2012/">Gluecon</a></strong> - Cloud, Mobile, APIs, Big Data for developers</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag</a></strong> - What's coming next  in technology</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.blurcon.com/">Blur</a></strong> - Human Computer Interaction (HCI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Eric has a unique way of bringing together the leaders from the space to discuss relevant technologies in a very intimate space.  The Omni Interlocken resort is a very key element to the events, which makes it unlike other events I attend.</p>
<p>The first of Eric&rsquo;s events I attended was a Gluecon, several years back.  We drove out to the location, and I remember thinking, &ldquo;oh man we are going to be stuck way out here for 4 days&rdquo;.  But as I learned, that is the point.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/defrag-2012/Omni-Interlocken.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>You are stuck in a very intimate location where you will eat killer grub, including beef sliders and drink some kick-ass craft beers while rubbing elbows and having deep technical and philosophical conversations with the deepest thinkers and leaders in our space.</p>
<p>Defrag and Glue are part of a small group of events I recommend you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span></strong> miss in the space.  I&rsquo;m pretty burnt out on large technology conferences, but the value you walk away with from Defrag can&rsquo;t be found anywhere else--putting Defrag in entireley different category for me.</p>
<p>I hope to see you at Defrag next week. If your there, I&rsquo;ll buy you an IPA, while we talk APIs.</p>

<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> should be the center of your API operations, with the most obvious use being for <a title="SDK repositories" href="/2012/10/25/sdk-management-for-your-api-with-github/">SDK repositories</a>, but Github offers a lot of other valuable tools that you can use to manage your API platform.</p>
<p>One great use of Github is as an API issue management tool.  The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories, for processing by your development team.</p>
<p>To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management.  Think of it as repository for your API itself.</p>
<p>Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentially be part of the API product development cycle.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> isn't just for code.  Github can be used for HTML documents and PDF's as well.  This opens up endless possibilities for management of documents you wish to share with your developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>One excellent example of this is publishing presentations from the various talks, hackathons and conferences you present at.  When you are done with a talk and would like to share with your community, you can just expose it as a PDF or HTML document, and push to Github.</p>
<p>You can also use this same approach for how-to guides and training materials you want to make available for your developers.  Allowing them to download and fork, or even follow the changes on Github, for the richest training materials an API provides.</p>
<p>Github provides a powerful way for you to version, evolve and share your essential API resources with the community--keeping them in sync with all other activity around your API.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/11/05/api-kpis-should-be-optimized-for-developer-success/">API KPIs Should Be Optimized for Developer Success</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/funnel.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When it comes to measuring the success of an API, we often experience a lack meaningful metrics, with <a title="many companies only tracking the number of new developers and quantity of API calls" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/15/developing-more-meaningful-api-metrics/">many companies only tracking the number of new developers and quantity of API calls</a>.  Going beyond these basic API metrics and identifying true performance indicators (KPI), will be essential if you want to find success with your API.</p>
<p>To speak in a more traditional marketing sense, a pretty standard sales funnel can be used to set the stage, defining the intake of developers as the top of your funnel, paid accounts and production applications the bottom of your APIs funnel--giving you a common framework for hanging KPIs on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when using a sales funnel to frame your API marketing efforts, be careful of being blinded that success will all be all about moving developers from the top, to the bottom of your funnel.  While this is definitely a large part of your efforts, there are plenty of good things that can happen within the funnel that will further drive users into the funnel as well as build trust and evangelism efforts that can be essential to the growth of your API ecosystem.</p>
<p>When planning your API sales funnel, the top is all about bringing in new registrations and the bottom should reflect the business objectives of your API.  But your funnel flow shouldn't always consist of direct flow to the bottom--think about what other beneficial activities can happen within the funnel:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition</strong> -   Finding new developers who understand your API and market</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Marketing</strong> - Tweets and other social media exhaust for users</li>
<li><strong>Story Building</strong> - New stories you can tell about the value your API delivers</li>
<li><strong>Idea Generation</strong> - Creative ideas around how to use your API</li>
<li><strong>Feedback</strong> - Quality feedback from developers about how to make your API better</li>
<li><strong>Evangelists</strong> - Develop the next generation of developer evangelists and advocates</li>
<li><strong>Brand</strong> - Awareness of your brand and the value it represents</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong> - The trust of developers who will use your API to solve problems in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these activities can boost the strength of your operations, others can feed the bottom line and meet your funnel objectives, but all of them will work to bring more developers into the top of the funnel--helping you scale.</p>
<p>To properly define your API funnel, you need to begin by profiling developers, as they come in the door, and try to figure out where they fit.  Don&rsquo;t assume all developers will be there to build production ready app and drive revenue for your company.  Developers come in all shapes and sizes.  Get to know your developers, who they are and understand where they fit into the equation.  Don&rsquo;t scare off developers who can benefit the ecosystem with an aggressive sales approach..</p>
<p>When establishing and evolving the key performance indicators for your API, make sure be developer centric in your measurements and decisions--don&rsquo;t make them just about monetization and the bottom line.  If you optimize for developer success, when it comes to web APis you&rsquo;ll often find success in all other areas of your API operations.</p>

<p>I call it being an evangelist, but it has other names, such as advocate or ambassador.  Someone who is good at evangelism, in my opinion, starts with a love of hacking but is also having a love of helping others learn and understand technology.  I can&rsquo;t help being an evangelist, it&rsquo;s just part of my personality.</p>
<p>These days, I get enough requests for evangelists, so I decided to start finding passionate hackers within specific communities to help fill requests.  Some requests for evangelists are full time positions, some part time, while others involve just going to meetups and hackathons in evenings and on weekends as needed.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m on the hunt for some passionate hacker personalities in New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Austin, Atlanta and Portland.  If you live in these cities, are passionate about API, mobile, social and the cloud--you should consider a life of evangelism.</p>
<p>Even if you aren&rsquo;t quite sure what an evangelist, advocate or ambassador does, feel free to reach out.  Chances are you are already attending meetups, hackathons and already doing evangelism activities--you just aren&rsquo;t getting paid or receiving incentives to do so.</p>

<p>One very powerful way to use <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> within your API strategy is for developer profiling.  This approach requires the deployment of another Github solution, API <a title="Developer login using Github" href="/2012/10/29/api-developer-login-using-github/">Developer login using Github</a>.</p>
<p>After you implement authentication for you API using Github, the <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/github">Github API</a> provides a wealth of opportunity for you to learn more about developers.</p>
<p>The types of developers you want for your API are also developers who have an active Github profiles.  Using Github, you can immediately tell if someone is an active developer based upon their presence and usage of the social coding network.</p>
<p>Github provides basic profile details, like where a developer lives and which programming language they use.  You can also see which other tools and code they following and commit to, giving an overall profile of their developer lifestyle.</p>
<p>Using Github you will also be able to tell if a user has downloaded or forked your own API SDK's, giving you insight into how well your SDK"s are being received and used.   There are endless ways you can use Github to stay in tune with your developers, but first you have to employ <a title="Github authentication as part of your API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/09/05/provide-api-developers-with-github-login-using-singly/">Github authentication as part of your API strategy</a>--then get to work profiling developers, and better understand who they are.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/no-copyrights-apis-help-us-make-case">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) needs our help</a> to explain to the Federal Circuit Court on why there should <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong> be copyrights on APIs.  As EFF published today:</p>
<blockquote><em>Earlier this year, we applauded District Court Judge Alsup for getting it right and holding that, as a matter of law, one could not copyright APIs. The case, Oracle v. Google, is now on appeal to the Federal Circuit, where a three-judge panel is going to revisit Judge Alsup&rsquo;s ruling.</em></blockquote>
<p>The EFF is soliciting the our assistance in how to help build the case, asking for feedback on two example areas:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Software reimplementing someone else&rsquo;s API, calling someone else&rsquo;s API, or any other uses of third-party APIs for interoperability, competition, or innovation.</li>
<li>Reimplementation of an API, where the resulting software benefitted the original API creator, perhaps by increasing the creator&rsquo;s user base or otherwise benefitted the developer community</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we are in the infancy of API deployment, so it&rsquo;s going to be tough to find many solid examples. &nbsp;But I think the two areas we can demonstrate the importance of no copyright on APIs, is within two business sectors that evolved on the web, using APIs and are critical to business and government today:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - As EFF said, Eucalyptus reimplemented the Amazon API to offer a competing cloud storage service.  You also saw the same with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/09/01/google-storage-for-developers-interoperability/">first implementation of Google Developer Storage</a> and up to &amp; other providers: <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/dunkel">Dunkel Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://www.hosteurope.de/produkte/Cloud-Storage">âHost Europe Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/greenqloud">GreenQloud Storage Qloud</a>, <a href="http://www.scaleupcloud.com/">ScaleUp Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.mh.connectria.com/rp/order/cloud_storage_index">âConnectria Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/lunacloud">Lunacloud</a>, and <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/dreamobjects">DreamObjects Cloud Storage</a>&nbsp;providing unprecedented interoperability for cloud computing.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Same as with cloud you have seen competition pop up for both Twitter and Facebook, mimicking their platform and APIs.  Platforms like <a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a> have copied Twitter&rsquo;s social network providing competition, and potential value to Twitter users by allowing developers to use App.net for things they can't use Twitter for.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think another clear example of open API design being used to help users is Pinboard&rsquo;s implementation of the Delicious API:</p>

<td><strong><a title="Pinboard" href="http://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard</a></strong> - Wherever possible the Pinboard API uses the same syntax and method names as the Delicious V1 API. This implementation allowed users to seamlessly export Delicious bookmarks accumulated over several years to Pinboard when Delicious was sold by Yahoo. &nbsp;If Yahoo had copyrighted their API design, Pinboard could never have done this.</td>

<p>A slightly different approach to offering benefit to users via an open API design is surrounding the Instagram API:</p>

<td><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/">Instagram API </a></strong>- In 2010, before Instagram itself launched an API, a passionate developer launched a rogue API for the popular photo sharing platform based upon Instagram's own internal API design they used to drive the popular iPhone application.  The move showed Instagram the demand for an API, and after designing and launching their own asked the rogue API to shut down.  A slightly different scenario, but if API design was copyright this may not have been possible.  We&rsquo;ve seen the same approach with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/25/lack-of-pinterest-api-is-a-lack-of-api-business-strategy/">rogue Pinterest API</a>, but it hasn&rsquo;t resulted in the same response from Pinterest unfortunately.   But community driven API design has a lot of potential for opening up companies and encouraging API innovation.</td>

<p>I strongly believe that APIs have massive potential for innovation across many business sectors.  The copyright of API design would eliminate much of this potential.  Open API design allows for healthy competition, interoperability and innovation as we&rsquo;ve seen with cloud and social.  But open API design can also augment the lack of standards through market leadership, helping grow healthy industries and essential online utilities.  Amazon EC2 and S3 design standards are clear examples of this in the wild.</p>
<p>Cloud and social are fast become essential components in our everyday lives, but open API have the potential to become mission critical with implementations like <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a>.  Some API designs are just too important to be proprietary.   I would argue Twitter, Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2 also fall into this category and need to remain open for the greater good.</p>
<p>Open API design reuse represents the future of API communication.  Companies like <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a>, <a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a>, <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> and <a title="Zapier" href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> are building API aggregation, automation, and languages that very much rely on flexible API terms of use, as well as API design reuse.  Copyright of API design would prevent companies from openly competing, offering redunancy as well as limit new and more meaningful APIs to be derived from existing API implementations.</p>
<p>Without the ability to copy, mimic, mashup, translate, emulate and re-define API design we won&rsquo;t be able to become more fluent in communicating via web and mobile apps using APIs.  We are just beginning to understand online communication via the power of mobile apps.  As we still grunt and groan while communicating via APIs--let&rsquo;s not stunt our growth and development with allowing API design to be copyrighted.</p>

<p>We are wasting no time getting the&nbsp;<a href="/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>&nbsp;back on track, after being put on hold because of hurricane Sandy. With the current status of New York City, it&rsquo;s subways, airports, there is no way the event could have happened--we made the right decision to cancel.</p>
<p>We are currently discussing the best dates for rescheduling in January and February of 2013, and are hopeful that we will have date finalized next week.</p>
<p>While we are awaiting that process we figured we&rsquo;d spend some time and discuss the session lineup for the conference. We are rather proud of the keynote, panel and session lineup we&rsquo;ve pulled together, but we feel we can make it even better.</p>
<p>So we are going to hold a Google Hangout today at 11:30 AM PDT / 2:30 PM EDT, to discuss the API Strategy &amp; Practice session lineup and invite you to participate. If you&rsquo;d like to be a participant in the hangout, email me at&nbsp;<a title="kinlane@gmail.com" href="mailto:kinlane@gmail.com">kinlane@gmail.com</a>and if you&rsquo;d like to just watch the hangout, follow&nbsp;<a title="@apistrat" href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@apistrat</a>&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ll tweet out the Youtube link right before.</p>

        <p>I spend a lot of time looking for a quick description or logo for companies. &nbsp;Finding a good quality logo is a pain in the ass!</p>
<p>To be the change I want to see in the world, I created an <a title="about.json" href="/about.json">about.json file for API Evangelist</a>.</p>
