{% include JB/setup %}<p>NPR announced their new NPR News application for Android 2.0 today.Normally I wouldnt cover just any new app or feature release, but there is more of a story here than just a new mobile app.I am interested in the way they went about designing it.Last summer they submitted designs for the new Android application to the open source community to discuss how to best move forward with designing the mobile app.</p>
