        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2015</span>
        <p>APIs are very much a virtual concept, something that is very abstract, often difficult to explain, and is something that very much lives in the online world. Spending much of my daily life in this world, I&rsquo;m always excited to come across APIs that bridge this digital world, with our existing physical worlds.</p>
<p>At first read, you might think I&rsquo;m talking about the recent growth of Internet of Things APIs, that are connecting physical devices like our thermostats and smoke alarms, to our mobile devices, using APIs. This is part of it, but for this post I&rsquo;m referencing APIs that don&rsquo;t just connect to objects in our physical world, but they actually bind to existing experiences, processes, and other aspects of our personal and professional worlds.</p>
<p>The Link Creation Studio from HP, is this. Using the web interface, or the API, you can create QR codes, and images with digital watermarks, which can be printed, then any user with a mobile device can snap a picture, which then triggers an action, that then takes the user to a specific location online--providing a bridge from a printed object in our physical world, to an online extension of that object.</p>
<p>This bridge comes with the ability to manage the action that is embedded in print, and the resulting online link destination. You can print the QR code, and digital watermarks, and over time see analytics for each user that traverses the bridge, from print to web page. Link Creation Studio users can also manage this experience, and change it over time to get the resulting experience, that both the publisher, and users desire.</p>
<p>The Link Creation Studio is a simple, but very powerful tool for building bridges between our physical and online worlds. The fact that it has an API is extremely significant, allowing these bridges to be built in real-time, from any system, whether that is a classic business print situation like business cards and product brochures, or something more ad-hoc like a individual person printing flyers, and hanging on telephone poles in their neighborhood, for a party that weekend.</p>
<p>This type of API implementation is more significant to me than just an API that connects, a single device to my mobile phone. This type of API can be used in a million different business, and personal scenarios, resulting in some potentially very interesting, and impactful implementations. These are the APIs that fascinate me, and hold the most potential for making big change in my opinion.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure: </strong>This story came out of a paid review I did of the HP Link Creation Studio, but as anyone who has paid me to do a review knows, a paid review does not equal a good review, let alone extra stories. These were actual thoughts I had while conducting the review, that I wanted to share once done.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-section-508.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is a topic I&rsquo;ve had an increasing number of conversation with folks about in the last couple months, and a friend of mine Tweeted in response to today, resulting in this lovely rant. This is about two very separate problems, in which the solutions are what I'd consider significantly overlapped. I&rsquo;m talking about the need to make sure the valuable metadata, as well as underlying resources made available via an API is accessible to search engines, while also making sure the it is all <a href="http://www.section508.gov/section508-laws">Section 508 compliant</a>, providing critical access to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>In response to my recent post, on "Why The New API Blueprint Sharing Button From Apiary Is So Important&rdquo;, said:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>I'm heavy user of <a href="https://twitter.com/apiaryio">@apiaryio</a> but disappointed with discoverability features of the product. Google just ignores them. <a href="https://t.co/w0hcGmpgMd">https://t.co/w0hcGmpgMd</a></p>
&mdash; Kristopher Kleva (@klevland) <a href="https://twitter.com/klevland/status/586289568632168449">April 9, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>First, this is another reason why the API Blueprint being more open is important, anyone can now come along and not just build an SEO API documentation solution, they can get access to Apiary.io users who desire such a solution. Ok, that might seem bad for Apiary, but in situations that Apiary is not concerned with, this allows the community to step up and serve the long tail, and if it is something that concerns Apiary, it lights the fire under their ass to consider adding to the road map (sorry Jakub &amp; Z, I know I"m a pain ;-).</p>
<p>Second, it allows the community to step up and serve what I'd consider the critical long tail&mdash;like Section 508. In our rush to deliver the latest in technological innovations, we often forget about significant portions of our society who, well, aren&rsquo;t like us. How many leading apps and platforms that you use are Section 508 compliant? I guarantee almost all API tooling is not&mdash;something we need to address now, and is a&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/us-government-apis/508/us-government-apis/dX34Bn5dcWQ/-Avg7rEbaNkJ">topic where discussion is currently happening the federal government circles</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a big fan of Swagger UI, and Apiary, and what they have done for API design, deployment, management, discovery, and evangelism, but we need to keep working on the next generation of UI, and UX that is easily indexed, and works well with assistive technologies. Ok, at this point the hypermedia folks want to kick my ass--bring it! ;-) Kidding. What I am talking about should happen in conjunction with well designed, hypermedia fueled clients, not instead--both camps should be addressing making sure all clients or SEO and 508 friendly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll close with a note on the opportunity here. There is huge potential to develop an open source API UI component that can use Swagger and API Blueprint as the core definition, implementing a more SEO and 508 compatible experience, something akin to <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate from Trippit</a>. I&rsquo;m thinking rather than a pull technology like Swagger UI does with its JS interface pulled from a Swagger definition, and I&rsquo;m guessing Apiary does a similar pull from API Blueprint docs?? A more of an HTML, CSS push or publish of functional, static API documentation, that uses JavaScript and APIs to operate&mdash;just some raw thoughts on how to take next steps, its now up to you.</p>
<p>I guarantee if you made an open source set of tools to support this, you'd get the attention of government at all levels, around the world, something that would open up significant other opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/kimono/kimono-black-square.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was just doing on of my regular check-ins with Pratap Ranade (<a href="https://twitter.com/pratapranade">@pratapranade</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono</a>. We try to make time to catchup on what each other are up to, and find where we can work together to incite API evolution. Pratap sees the space like I do, that APIs are more than tech, possessing huge potential when it comes to empowering folks to make change within their companies, organizations, institutions, government agencies, and the wider industries and countries they exist in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t go into too much detail about the projects we are working on until they are ready, but I just spend over an hour talking through some pretty interesting use cases that have occurred via Kimono Labs, in which Kimono users are scraping data and content from existing websites, and crafting some pretty interesting APIs. I&rsquo;m not just talking about the fun things like <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/marchmadness/explorer">March Madness</a> or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/worldcup/explorer">World Cup</a> going on over at Kimono, I&rsquo;m talking about influencing elections, addressing disaster recovery issues, and providing timely data that can influence how financial markets are working (or not).</p>
<p>The best part about these stories, is the work is being done, in many cases by people who don't have traditional programming skills, they are more hackers who have identified a problem, and <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">used Kimono to scrape the data, and generate simple APIs</a>, that help provide a new way of delivering API-driven solutions to the problem being targeted. Pratap said they are quickly becoming a big data company as well as a structured data API solution, because of the number of folks stepping up to address the long tail of data.</p>
<p>I just wanted to provide a taste of what we are working on. I&rsquo;m always left pumped up about potential of APIs, after hearing what Kimono is up to. If you want a taste of some of the stories I'm talking about, check out the <a href="http://blog.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono blog</a>.</p>

<p>This is another story that came to mind while listening to the last episode of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>. As John and Steve were talking about the API definition format Swagger switching from Reverb to SmartBear (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/30/quantifying-the-community-around-the-swagger-api-specification/">thanks for shout-out about my Swagger post</a>), they were discussing how Microsoft is using Swagger as part of platform operations, and made sure and reminded us listeners that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all this has been done before</span></strong>. Bringing up a never-ending theme &nbsp;in the world of APIs, that we just can't seem to shake loose.</p>
<p>When people bring this up, what do they mean? Yes, modern API definitions like Swagger, are very much like earlier incarnations of WSDL and WADL. Ok. What now?</p>
<ul>
<li>We shouldn&rsquo;t do it? It won&rsquo;t work? Don&rsquo;t even bother with Swagger?</li>
<li>We should learn from history, and earlier efforts, and make sure we don't same mistakes?</li>
<li>We should be scared of Swagger, and run for the hills, hide in a bunker?</li>
<li>We should all switch back to SOAP and use WSDL?</li>
<li>You just like to tell me I'm wrong, and has nothing to do with technology?</li>
</ul>
<p>Why I bring this up, is because more often than not, most of these conversation lean towards the first response &mdash; don&rsquo;t even bother, except you don&rsquo;t really know because people who state &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve already done this&rdquo;, often leave it open ended, offering no constructive criticism. Some even close it with, this is nothing new! Ok, so what then? How does that impact my decision making, now.</p>
<p>I guess, for me, I step back at look at how this applies to the rest of my world. Do we do this with all other trends in our lives? We already did short skirts, why do we gotta do them again? I heard on NPR the other day that open office plan was invented by the Germans in the 1950s, and proven in-effective by the 1970s, and here in this decade we are doing again. Don&rsquo;t you know we&rsquo;ve already done that?  C&rsquo;mon. Sheesh. Aren't there endless things we've already done in the past that didn't work, and we try them again in a different context, with potentially different results?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, the argument holds no weight for me. So what if we&rsquo;ve already done this, or it is nothing new. I had a shitload of WSDLs laying around in 2003, and now in 2015 I have a butt-load of Swagger laying around--in the end I'm optimistic for more meaningful tooling to emerge. Tell me some practical tip that was applied back in the good ol SOA days that I can use today, don&rsquo;t tear down what I do today. If Swagger isn&rsquo;t for you, cool, tell me what is. Tell me how you are solving defining your APIs, mocking servers, collaborating and iterating around the API designs in your world, how you generate server side code, or client side code, and setup your testing, monitoring, and QA, or maybe providing a discovery service, visualization, and IDE tools &mdash; the fact that we&rsquo;ve already done this, means nothing. We&rsquo;ve already done a lot of things.</p>
<p><em>P.S. I really wish I could import my shitload of Swagger 2.0 specs I having laying around in Runscope, but I have to generate Swagger 1.2, import into Postman, generate post man collections, and then import into my Runscope account. Sheesh! ;-)</em></p>

<p>Yay! Another story generated by listening to <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>&nbsp;(blame John and Steve). I do enjoy sharing my random thoughts while listening to those two. This one is around the SDK discussion during the latest episode, but as they noted, they&rsquo;ve talked about SDKs a lot in the past. This particular reference was again, during the their discussion about Microsoft using Swagger to generate code&mdash;a topic which brought up the usual grumbles from John about SDKs. He loves to hate on SDKs, obviously suffering from severe SDK PTSD.</p>
<p>I agree with his feelings about SDKs, they are well founded, but auto-generating code from Swagger doesn&rsquo;t always involve with the generation of full-blown SDKs. I save a huge amount of time, auto-generating different types of code and scripts from Swagger, which I further clean up and make work for my specific needs. My experience with generating code from Swagger, is more about saving time, than it is about producing production ready SDKs.</p>
<p>Maybe my development world is unique, but I find I still have to get my hands dirty, even when I generate server or client side code using Swagger, requiring me to still play with HTTP and understand response / request details. I get what John is saying, and he is right. I'm increasingly frustrated by companies producing platforms that are more SDK than API, something IoT engineers excel at.</p>
<p>I just wanted to point out there are many layers to the discussion, and that there are no perfect solutions when auto-generating code from API definitions, but it can sure save time in both API deployment, as well as API consumption, and unlike SDKs I still understand the inner working of my apps, integrations, and the APIs they are depending on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-skull-crossbones.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had one of my followers ask me if there as a &ldquo;gold standard for API deprecation policies&rdquo; out there. I&rsquo;d say that deprecation policies are a little different than some of the other legal building blocks of an API, where the legal is a small portion of it, with the majority really being all about communication.</p>
<p>To answer the question, I recommended Google. Not cause their deprecation policy itself is all the great, it is just because their overall approach to API deprecation is pretty robust&mdash;something I&rsquo;m sure is derived from their experience so far. (wink wink)</p>
<p>API deprecation at Google starts with some pretty clearly stated policies, but goes much further with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/terms">Deprecation Policy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-publishers/docs/deprecation">Deprecation Schedule</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v2/data-deprecation">Data Deprecation Details</a></li>
<li><a href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2014/12/announcing-deprecation-of-google-earth.html">Blog Communication</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the building blocks that Google employs as part of their approach to API documentation. This post is just result of a 15 minutes of Googling around, to respond to the question. Now that I have written this post, and put the topic of API deprecation back on my radar, the next step is to dive deeper and develop a complete picture of how Google approaches API deprecation, as well as other leading players in the space.</p>
<p>At first take, it appears to me that the legal details of API deprecation that are present in terms of use, or as standalone documents is only the start. The winning examples of API deprecation involve making sure deprecation details are always readily available, regularly communicated, and are comprehensive enough to cover the API, data, and other things that matter to developers and end-users.</p>

<p>If I find a new company during my research, it takes me about a minimum of 15 minutes to lightly profile what they are up, and add to my system, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/my-ideal-profile-of-companies-who-are-doing-interesting-things-with-apis/">if I do a full profile</a>, it can take several hours. All of this adds up to a lot of work, time that would be better spent on actually writing stories, hacking on the APIs, and publishing of the longer form research papers on what I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, <a href="http://apisjson.org/">each of these APIs would have an APIs.json in the root of their domain</a>, with details about the company and people responsible for API operations, and as much information about each API as possible. With a single click, I could import the entire profile of a company, and its valuable API resources into my monitoring system, ready for publishing to relevant areas of the API Evangelist network, as well as some of my partner sites like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>--the beauty is, so could anyone else. ;-)</p>
<p>If API providers used <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, I could be connected to their Blog via RSS, their platform Twitter account via the Twitter API, and their Github profile or organization using the Github API. Not only would I have relevant metadata about a company like their name, description, logo, and details about APIs, I would also be connected to a real-time heartbeat of API operations via the platform blog, Twitter, and Github accounts. This is just the start--there are numerous other building blocks you could wire up with an APIs.json file, to keep potential consumers up to speed.</p>
<p>I know it can be hard to se the potential for APIs.json, because there is limiting tooling available currently, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">beyond the open source search engine APIs.io</a>, Even before the next wave of tooling like the internal enterprise search engine, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">visualizations</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/apispots">browser plugins</a>, and other tooling are available, you can realize the benefit of being listed on <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and make sure you are fully plugged into my regular monitoring of the API space, which means the chances are much, much higher that I will write a story about what you, and your developers are up to. ;-)</p>

<p>This story is derived from listening to the <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">API podcast, Traffic and Weather</a>. One of the things John Sheehan (<a href="/admin/blog/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), and Steve Marx (<a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>) discussed during the recent show, was a post Steve wrote as part of his role as product manager, called "<a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2015/04/how-many-http-status-codes-should-your-api-use/">How many HTTP status codes should your API use</a>"? I think the story is extremely useful to read, helping us all think through how we use HTTP status codes in our own platform, but personally I think the real story, is Dropbox talking out loud about their strategy.</p>
<p>John and Steve pointed out on the podcast that someone had tweeted that the story was not in sync with the way Dropbox actually did their HTTP status codes. To which Steve replied, that is why he wrote the story, to talk it out, and solicit feedback. This is how you should be thinking through your API road map, out loud, on your platform blog. When I mention to API providers that the blog is the most important tool in their toolbox, this is what I mean. Your blog isn&rsquo;t just for broadcasting your platform message, it is also about you thinking through thoughts, sharing those thoughts with your API consumers, and potentially getting feedback, which you can consider as part of the overall decision making process.</p>
<p>I am addicted to thinking through my ideas publicly on my blog. For me, a thought isn&rsquo;t fully formed, until its published. I also depend heavily on the feedback from my audience to my stories, in their public comments on Disqus, and Twitter, as well as privately via email and DMs. Talking things through, publicly on your blog, teaches you to think outside the box, let the sunlight in on your thoughts, and forces you to (potentially) properly form your ideas (not always), at least enough to share with the public--even if you don&rsquo;t end up getting feedback, that process alone, is highly valuable.</p>
<p>The best part of this, is after you&rsquo;ve thought through your stories, received feedback from your API consumers, the story also has the potential to live on as a marketing vehicle, which is what I feel most people think of when I mention a blog for API operation. All of this creates a potentially virtuous cycle, that is essential to API evangelism and the overall road map. If you do this type of storytelling regularly, thoroughly thinking through your ideas, and opening them up to public comment before you finalize your road map, eventually you will find that you have momentum in some very positive directions, and are generating some extremely valuable exhaust from your efforts that also brings in new API consumers, and helps keep the existing API consumers engaged.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://3drobotics.com/home-2014/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/3d-robotics-drone.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As my Internet of Things (IoT) research continues, I&rsquo;m applying much of my API thinking from the mainstream API space to the world of IoT. A couple weeks ago I stumbled across the <a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/">3D Robotics Drone API</a>, which to my surprise, was documented using a Swagger specification, providing a machine readable definition of the API, which helped me quickly get up to speed on what the Drone API delivers.</p>
<p>I haven't put much thought into the detail for any drone APIs, something that has been adjacent to my mainstream research for over a year now, but I did have some basic opinions about what a drone API could have. So, when it comes to potential resources, I have to say the  3D Robotics Drone API delivers in all earlier areas I had been considering--with five main endpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Vehicle API </strong>- Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of vehicle, and retrieving single vehicle, including airspeed, ground speed, and battery.</li>
<li><strong>The Mission API -&nbsp;</strong>Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of mission, and retrieving single mission.</li>
<li><strong>The Administrator API </strong>- Access to administrative resources including debugging, logging, and flight simulation.</li>
<li><strong>The User API - </strong>Access operations for browsing and searching lists of user, and retrieving single user.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication </strong>- Session operations for logging in and out, and identifying user.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vehicle stuff I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the resources around logging, and specifically the mission API. When it comes to transparency, and accountability around drone activity, I feel pretty strongly that these types of resources will be essential, and eventually will be mandated by government entities. I&rsquo;m glad that 3D Robotics is ahead of the game, in providing API driven resources that deliver in this way.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect, when I stumbled across the user and mission management APIs, was the social, online layer. As part of the 3D Robotics Drone API platform, the company offers <a href="http://www.droneshare.com">DroneShare</a>, where you can publish your user profile, and your <a href="http://www.droneshare.com/mission">missions</a>. I was coming at this from the angle of a potential industry regulation tool, or possible drone pilot resource management&mdash;I didn't think it would be done as social, and potential entertainment platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.droneshare.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/Droneshare-Screnshot.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the description from the site:</p>
<blockquote><em>"This is the beta release of Droneshare. Droneshare is a mission viewing and sharing application that works with ground control applications to let you share your mission data. This project is open source, if you would like to improve it, it is probably best to start at our github repo."</em></blockquote>
<p>This is why I thoroughly enjoy doing my research, because it expands my understanding of specific business sectors that APIs are touching. While I was discovering DroneShare, I also learned about the existence of the "<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/drone/no-fly/">Don&rsquo;t Fly Drones Here</a>&rdquo; project, from Mapbox, which provides a database resource of restricted zones, where you can&rsquo;t fly drones. Which brought me back to my original thoughts, regarding what resource we will need to keep the drone industry sane, rather than just focusing on social and entertainment.</p>
<p>Ultimately I see a lot of patterns here, that reflect several possible drone futures we are potentially crafting. I see social networks, where drone pilots compete for the best jobs, based upon their missions, and equipment usage. I also see potential for entertainment--think about the networks that have arisen for watching people play videogames, and competitive gaming platforms, but apply that to the world of drones. I also see potential elements of government regulation, where the FAA and other agencies, require drone pilots to log their equipment, and activity, logging all drone flights, and potentially sharing publicly via drone social networks to increase accountability.</p>
<p><a href="http://3drobotics.com/home-2014/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/3d-robotics-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m thinking that the <a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/">3D Robotics Drone API</a> provides  a potential blueprint that could be used by other drone manufacturers, and cloud platforms that serve the drone industry. The 3D Robotics Drone API pattern could be held up as an open specification, that the government could weigh in on, making sure the proper regulatory resources are available, and that drone activity can be accessed, and audited via a secure API, available via the Internet.</p>
<p>The world of drones is fascinating to me. On one hand, the security and privacy considerations scare the shit out of me. On the other hand, they are endlessly fascinating to me, and ultimately I&rsquo;m going to be purchasing a drone, so I can play with more, and understand better&mdash;its a business expense you know!</p>
<p>Man, I have a great career. I'm so privileged to be doing what I do&mdash;even if our world is under a threat of attack by drones!</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://api.myfox.me/dev/introduction"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/myfox/myfox-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was dedicating some time to researching APIs in the Internet of things (IoT) space, and stumbled across the <a href="https://api.myfox.me/">Myfox API</a>, serving the <a href="https://www.getmyfox.com/us_en/">Myfox home security products</a>. While the developer portal for the Myfox API doesn't have everything I'd like to see in an IoT developer portal, it is one of the better one's I've seen.</p>
<p>If you think web or mobile app developers suck at providing a simple, and a coherent developer portal and experience, device platform providers are even worse. The Myfox API, has the essential building building blocks, with a simple overview, authentication info, simple Swagger driven API documentation, application management tools, and a clear terms of service for the platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a clear link between the primary Myfox website, the developer portal, and a <a href="https://myfox.me/">myfox.me user portal</a>, for device consumers and would-be developers to easily on-board with everything. I haven't fully profiled that Myfox platform, but at first glance it is clean, well laid out, and most importantly the link between the website, API, and user accounts is clear, and easy to navigate.</p>
<p>As I think this through, and after recently finishing a white paper called <a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/building-an-api-driven-ecosystem-for-the-internet-of-things/">Building an API-driven Ecosystem for the Internet of Things</a>, for the now defunct GigaOm, I can't help but think the IoT space is going to need to agree on some sort of standard approach for not just managing how they design, deploy, and manage APIs, but also how they deliver developer and user portals. To help you visualize what I mean, consider the number of Internet connected devices any single household will own, all with their own portal, and on-boarding process. #FUN</p>
<p>In short, developers, and end-users will get IoT account fatigue pretty quick. I don't think that we are going to standardize everything across the space, I am not delusional, but I can't help but think that the sharing of some common blueprints, could go a long ways in reducing friction for developers, and device consumers. I'll take my research from the GigaOm white paper and produce a blueprint, that IoT device makers can use, to to hopefully be more successful in deploying their developer portals, platform accounts, and maybe help influence a tiny bit of consistency in how IoT platforms function.</p>

<p>API design service provider Apiary, <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2015/03/26/ApiBlueprint-button/">quietly launch a new sharing button for API Blueprints, in their interactive API documentation</a>, the other week. They added a setting in their account area, which allows users to be more open with their API designs:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Start sharing your API blueprint with other API enthusiasts, by enabling this feature within your API settings. Simply toggle the &lsquo;Public Blueprint&rsquo; setting on and you&rsquo;re ready to start sharing your API blueprint.&rdquo; also stating that, &ldquo;this is just the beginning of being able to socialize and learn from other public API blueprints."</em></blockquote>

<p>The machine readable API Blueprint definition, driving the documentation now has the potential to be accessible. This may not seem like much, but it is actually fundamental to the health, and growth of the overall API industry. Developers cannot learn from other developers, and from leading API platforms, and share best practices for API design across the space without it&mdash;we need this to grow, and evolve.</p>
<p><a href="https://apiblueprint.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-blueprint/apiblueprint-logo-2.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This is one of the reasons <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/30/quantifying-the-community-around-the-swagger-api-specification/">Swagger has seen such wide adoption</a>, because it isn&rsquo;t just an open format, it is also because the API definitions that these public platforms generate are also available to share, and learn from. You can still lock down the valuable resources made available via an API, but the interface patterns we apply to our APIs should be shared as widely as possible, for everyone to see. This is why I&rsquo;ve been fighting so hard <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/amicus-brief-computer-scientists-scotus">to push back against Oracle in their API copyright case against Google</a>&mdash;API designs do not need to be locked up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to find API Blueprints on the open web, and on Github for some time now, but this opens up the playing field to be able easily discovery, and engage with existing Apiary, and API Blueprint driven APIs at a new level. Much of what I&rsquo;ve learned about Swagger and API design has come from being able to click on the raw link on Swagger UI, and reverse engineer the Swagger definition behind the curtain. I&rsquo;ve never been able to do this with API Blueprint, or Mashery I/O docs. I have been able to get at the WADL behind the Apigee Explorer, but it is a pain in the ass, and the definitions are usually out of date by the time I get to it.</p>
<p>The effects of Apiary&rsquo;s move won&rsquo;t be some immediate thing, it will take time, but the more API Blueprints that are shared, the more users will learn about the powerful API definition format driving many public APIs&mdash;this is good for Apiary, good for API providers, and good for API consumers. Thanks Apiary for doing this, it makes me happy. It also gives me a head start on making sure <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a> is API Blueprint fluent, and that more API Blueprint driven APIs are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">present in my research</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be able to cut back on my travel in 2015, and focus on some important research, coding, and writing. I apologize to all the events I&rsquo;ve said no to over the last couple months, but I hit a wall last year with speaking, and trying hard to make 2015 a much more healthier, and balanced year.</p>
<p>With that said, here is where you can find me this spring. I have three places you can find me in April and May:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>&nbsp;- You can find me in Berlin, putting on <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDays / @APIStrat, April 24th &amp; 25th</a></li>
<li><strong>Barcelona, Catalonia</strong> - I will be speaking at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIDays Mediterranea, May 6th &amp; 7th, in Barcelona</a></li>

</ul>
<p>That is all the speaking I&rsquo;m doing this spring, with one tentative date early in June at BYU. I won&rsquo;t be traveling again until the fall, when we do @APIStrat again, and of course @DefragCon!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be in Berlin and Barcelona, two of my favorite European cities, and of course Broomfield, CO (specifically the Taproom). I am also excited to not be traveling as much, and able to focus on my wider research, coding, and writing. #thanks</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-portal-developer-github.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time looking through the developer portals of API providers. I see a lot of things, both the good and bad, while navigating these  portals, and while some of the bad stuff I see are way too big for me to doing anything, there are many little things I see that I could help do something about. Sometimes it is just spelling mistakes, sometimes broken links, and other times I want to rewrite API descriptions, and add to the resources that are available for an API.</p>
<p>During these travels, I got to thinking...what if API providers published their developer portals to Github? Just like I do with my API Evangelist sites. Then I could fork their portal, and submit pull requests with rewrites of the description of what your API does, adding little tweaks, here and there, helping polish the portal--potentially making things easier for developers. I&rsquo;m sure this thought scares the hell out of some companies, who can&rsquo;t imagine, allowing outside input like this, but if you sit down and think about it for a while, it just might make sense.</p>
<p>When I was in Washington D.C., <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/dev-hub/">I created a default portal template that runs on Github</a>. I might upgrade this, and make it available for API providers to use as a forkable template, to seed any API developer portal. Doing this makes it easy to provide a base set of building blocks that every API provider should start with, allowing them to delete the elements that they don&rsquo;t want. I am also considering making a default one, that can be used as a starter developer portal for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy the pull requests that I get for spelling and grammar mistakes I made on API Evangelist, from some of my favorite grammar trolls. Running all of my websites on Github Pages has changed the way I tell stories, and interact with my audience. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">I&rsquo;ve always encouraged API providers to use Github for an increasing number of API management tasks</a>, but actually running your entire portal as a Github repo, would this to a new level. This approach could be used for larger, or smaller developer platforms, and <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/11/16/public-frontend-and-private-backend-for-my-sites-on-github/">I even use Github pages as a front-end for private API developer portals</a>--ask me how.</p>
<p>It is just a suggestion for you API providers, and soon to be API providers. Github provides a very low cost, scalable way to launch your portal, and you never know, people like me who spend a lot of time in your developer portal, might actually help make it a better place. I wish more API providers would publish their portal as a Github repository, as well as graphic designers in the space help craft template portals, that providers can put to work. My portal definitions will always reflect best practices that I see across the API landscape, but they won&rsquo;t always be the slickest looking when it comes to graphic design&mdash;just not my core competency.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/alchemy/alchemy-api-ibm-version.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was doing my regular monitoring, and found myself on the <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/">AlchemyAPI</a> site. Not exactly sure how I got there, but I stumbled across their <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/htmlc.html">HTMLGetCombinedData</a>&nbsp;API, which can be used for analysis on HTML content, and is one of 3 separate APIs, AlchemyAPI is calling "combined calls".</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with AlchemyAPI, the company has a number of valuable APIs, which you can use to make sense of content and data from on, or offline source. I use AlchemyAPI for API Evangelist, to pull keywords, and the content out of blog posts, helping me shed the overall look of a site, and any advertisements--getting down to the raw content. What I thought was particularly interesting about this API, was their approach combined calls, and specifically their approach to monetizing these aggregated API calls.</p>
<p>There are three specific APIs they are considering "combined calls":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/urls.html">URLGetCombinedData</a></strong> - Used for performing analysis on a publicly-accessible Internet web pages.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/htmlc.html">HTMLGetCombinedData</a></strong> - Used for performing analysis on uploaded HTML content.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/textc.html">TextGetCombinedData</a></strong> - Used for performing analysis on uploaded text content.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three APIs are only available in the AlchemyAPI&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/pricing">pro and enterprise packages</a>, which for me makes see this aa a potentially new approach to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>. I don&rsquo;t see it as something that works for all API providers, but when you have numerous decoupled APIs, which developers may also be implemented several of them at a time, or daisy chaining them together&mdash;a combined API call, might save some developers valuable time.</p>
<p>Combined API calls also seem like a potential opportunity for API platform developers themselves. If an API platform, provides tools for developers to aggregate, and stitch together multiple APIs, and publish their recipes, it is something that could produce some interesting patterns, that may better deliver solutions to the problems developers actually face during integration. At the very least, allowing developers to publish SDKs that accomplish the same thing, might achieve the same thing.</p>
<p>I am just looking to share my thoughts on AlchemyAPIs approach to aggregating their API calls, and specifically the focus on monetization, adding the concept to my research. Maybe it is something others can for their API platforms, or maybe API developers, could provide aggregated API recipes, for specific API platforms, or across multiple platforms.</p>

<p><span>My Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>Always a good report, when I start with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>101</strong></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sproutsocial.com/insights/what-is-an-api/">What Is an API, and Why Does It Matter?</a> - I love coming across other introductory to API material. The space if getting so wide, that there are many good opinions emerging.</li>
</ul>
<p>More on the legal side of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3D Printing</strong></span>, than API:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/blog/Past-Dangers-Can-Protect-You-from-Future-Threats">Protecting IP from 3D Printing: What Companies Need to Know</a> - An interesting thought on IP from 3D printing world. Something that will keep heating up in coming years.</li>

<p>An interesting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Account Management</strong></span> feature:</p>

</ul>
<p>A handful of interesting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Acquisitions</strong></span> to note:</p>

</ul>
<p>I'm calling these <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API Aggregation</strong></span>, but they are kind of a new take on the topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/urls.html">AlchemyAPI Web Combined Call</a> - I thought this was an interesting approach to monetizing APIs, by saving developers time. In a world where you have a bunch of microservices that do one thing, and do it well, I think aggregate or combined API calls ike this as premium service will be more common.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/alchemyapi-text-combined-call">AlchemyAPI Text Combined Call</a> - Seems to be something they are doing across the board. Will keep an eye out for others doing this too.</li>

        <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.blockspring.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The one thing I've learned in five years as the API Evangelist is that us technologists and developers don't always see the world like everyone else. We focus on the perfection of the technology, our own desires for the future, and often miss the mark on what end-users actually need. This is one of the hallmark success of APIs over SOA, is that by accident, APIs jumped out of the SOA petri dish (thanks Daniel Jacobson - <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), and was use solve everyday problems that end-users face, using the technology that is readily available (aka HTTP).</p>
<p>While I think us API folks have done a great job of delivering valuable resources to mobile applications, and a decent enough job at delivering the same resources to web applications, and I guess we are figuring out the whole device thing? maybe? maybe not? Regardless, one area we have failed to serve a major aspect of the business world, is delivering valuable API resources to the number #2 client in the world&mdash;the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>We have done a decent job of providing resources to data stewards, <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">helping them deploy APIs using spreadsheets using services like API Spark</a>, but other than a handful of innovative implementations from companies like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">Octoparts</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/route-sms-messages-to-google-spreadsheets-via-twilio-api-with-twiliosheet/">Twilio</a>, there are no solid API consumption resources that target the spreadsheet environment. Meaning there is no easy way for mainstream spreadsheet users to put common API driven resources to work for them within the spreadsheets that they live in daily--that is until today, with the launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://api.blockspring.com/blog/blockspring-for-google-sheets">Blockspring launched their Google Spreadsheets Add-On</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah I know, making APIs work in spreadsheets has been done for a while, via Google Spreadsheets and Excel Spreadsheets, but nobody has standardized it like Blockspring just did. So let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the implementation. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blockspring/aihldeahgcpbpmimkdpkafaedhbmfhoh">I went to the Google Chrome App Store, and downloaded the add-on</a>.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then using a new spreadsheet, I click on add-ons &gt; Blockspring, and logged into my account. After giving Blockspring access to the Google Spreadsheet via my Google Account oAuth, I was given an API console in the right hand sidebar of my spreadsheet interface. The API options I&rsquo;m given aren't the usual geek buffet, they are everyday use scenarios that would attract the average spreadsheet users.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-console.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I select the IMDB movie search, which once chosen, I&rsquo;m given the option to populate my spreadsheet with results, providing me with API driven resources, right in my worksheets. The best part is it is complete with one cell as a search term, allowing me to customize my IMDB search.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-imdb.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Using Blockspring, I&rsquo;m given easy to use, API driven resources, that anyone can implement, like visualizing the recent news:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-tools.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Or possibly evaluate stock volatility clustering, using stock market data APIs (cause you know we all do a lot of this):</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-tools-2.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p><br />Blockspring gives me over 1000 API driven functions that I can use in my Google Spreadsheet&mdash;kicking everyone&rsquo;s asses when it comes to potential API client delivery. While us technologists are arguing over whether or not we can automatically generated Swagger driven SDKs, and the importance of hypermedia APIs when deploying the next generation clients, someone like Blockspring comes along and pipes in APIs to the #2 client in the world&mdash;the spreadsheet. #winning</p>
<p>Now the game will be about getting the attention of Google Spreadsheet users, and developing comparable Microsoft Spreadsheet tooling, and getting mainstream Excel users attention as well. The rest of you will have to get the attention of Blockspring, and make sure your API resources have simple, meaningful endpoints that can be piped in as Blockspring Google Spreadsheet functions. Spreadsheet driven business units should not have to learn about APIs and go look for them, at each individual API portal&mdash;APIs providers should find and education business users about their resources, via one of the most ubiquitous tools in business.</p>
<p>Nice work Blockspring, in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/going-beyond-excel-as-a-data-source-for-api-deployment-and-focusing-on-it-as-an-api-client/">helping ensure the space move beyond excel as a data source for API deployment, and focusing on it as an API client</a>, delivering vital API resources to the business users who can potentially benefit the most, and are willing and able to pay for API access in my opinion.</p>
<p>P.S. As soon as I finished this I remembered this story from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/">last weeks API.Report&nbsp;</a>-&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/03/25/the-api-briefing-free-federal-energy-and-economic-information-delivered-straight-to-your-spreadsheet/">Free Federal Energy and Economic Information Delivered Straight to Your Spreadsheet</a> - not an standardized approach, but definitely an important implementation to showcase.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/streamdata-io-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was introduced to <a href="http://streamdata.io/">StreamData.io</a> the other day, by Gabriel Dillon (<a href="https://twitter.com/gjdillon">@gjdillon</a>) of <a href="http://readme.io/">Readme.io</a>. StreamData.io provides a caching, and push layer for apps to take advantage of, that can be deploy on top of existing APIs. I haven&rsquo;t implemented StreamData.io yet, I am still evaluating it, and at first glance it looks like an interesting new real-time layer, that you can use on top of APIs, to improve application performance and user experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add StreamData.io to <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">my real-time research</a> right now, however once I start playing with I may add as an API deployment resource as well. I have some verification to do, but I&rsquo;d love to test out the potential for StreamData.io to deliver cache and sync layer for common APIs, doing for APIs, what StreamData.io is doing for apps&mdash;delivering on one of my ongoing ideas for caching high use APIs.</p>
<p>When I was working in Washington DC, I had the pleasure of working during the federal government shutdown, where I wrote a piece <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/01/can-we-depend-on-federal-government-apis/">asking if we can depend on our federal government APIs</a>, and talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/12/caching-apis-with-cloudformations-or-openshift-/">caching APIs with AWS cloud formations, or Open Shift</a>. My objective is to ensure there redundant sources for APIs coming out of government, providing developers with a more stable solution, they can depend on. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/multiple-types-of-apisjson-for-discovery/">I even added this thinking into the early APIs.json design, allowing you to define cached indexes of APIs</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added <a href="http://streamdata.io/">StreamData.io</a> to <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">my real-time research</a>, and I&rsquo;ll get in there and play with more, as I have the time. Then I&rsquo;ll get a better understanding of what you can do with the API caching and syncing, seeing if it is possible to deliver this layer for my APIs as well as my apps&mdash;something that is even more appealing in this age of Docker containers. #FoodForThought</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-key-skeleton.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.bizcoder.com/are-you-or-your-customers-leaking-your-api-keys">Are You Or Your Customers Leaking Your API Keys?</a> from Daryl Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>) the other day, which spurred me to float up a story in my Evernote, from a couple months back. My thoughts are only related to Daryll&rsquo;s because it is about API keys, and their accessibility&mdash;the similarities stop there. Daryl is talking about a very different layer of key management, which we should all be thinking deeply about.</p>
<p>API key management is an API provider issue, as much as it is an API consumer issue. As an API provider I need to have an easy way to manage all the keys I provide to developers. As an API consumer, I need to have an easy to manage all the API keys I get across the API providers that I depend on. In short, key management isn&rsquo;t easy, and there are no clear solutions that serve both ends of the key management coin.</p>
<p>As an API provider, I use <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API Infrastructure to manage my API keys</a>. Using my API portal, developers can sign up for their own accounts, manage their apps, and the keys that are issued. 3Scale does all the heavy lifting for me, all I have to do is manage my API service composition, and keep an eye on dev usage, as well as keep an eye on my own app usage. I use all my own APIs for my apps too! Sometimes my apps are the bad actors, it not always the developers who abuse API access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an API consumer, I&rsquo;m working hard to pull my API key world together, using a <a href="http://api-keys.apievangelist.com/">home brew format I&rsquo;m calling simple api-keys</a>. I&rsquo;m am using Github for all of my API and microservice related projects, so I&rsquo;m beginning to centralize how I store keys, and how I manage them across all my apps. With a central storage, and management process, I&rsquo;m hoping to get a better handle on which APIs I use, and introduce more regular cycles of key management, where I refresh API keys on a strict schedule.</p>
<p>With the work I&rsquo;m doing on the API consumption front, and reading Daryll&rsquo;s post got me thinking about keys. If our API management house is in order, and we can manage different groups of API keys, monitor their usage, and revoke them at will, why can&rsquo;t we just have a pool of API keys that we can just leave laying around? I&rsquo;ve seen many APIs provider default keys, embedded in URLs available in API documentation, allowing you to make sample calls, why can&rsquo;t we apply this a little bit wider? It seems like we could have a rolling pool of API keys, that we leave laying around in code snippets, how-to guides, and stories, which allow instant access to APIs&mdash;which we monitor, and if we see abuse we can revoke, and refresh with new set--easily done if you use Github Gists for storytelling (snippet centralization).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through my entire API stack, and generating Postman Collections, and I&rsquo;m considering generating some API keys that are designed for use in specific stories, 101 resources, and other public and private evangelism efforts. It is just a thought at this point, that I wanted to put out there for discussion. Seems to me, if we really want to reduce any friction in on-boarding, we could start using &ldquo;some&rdquo; API keys in conjunction with SEO, SMM, and other existing evangelism metrics and analysis tools that are in our toolbox.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/30/quantifying-the-community-around-the-swagger-api-specification/">Quantifying The Community Around The Swagger API Specification</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2015</span>
        <p>This post is extracted from a deep dive I've been doing into the Swagger ecosystem, as part of regular conversations I have been having with Tony Tam (@fehguy), trying to understand how we can better tell stories about Swagger. I've been tuned into things for a while now around the Swagger community, and there is a lot going on, but from the outside, some of this can be hard to see. Seeking a better understand what is the Swagger community, I wanted to take a walk through the sites, forum, and Github repositories.</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s start with the basics, what is Swagger? Merriam Webster defines Swaggers as: : to walk in a very confident way : to walk with a swagger. ;-) Seriously though, Swagger is a machine readable format (either JSON or YAML), for describing an API, providing a description of API operations, in a way that other applications can read, and understand. Even though Swagger is machine readable, and designed for other applications, it has also become a language for humans to describe and collaborate, around a shared, quantifiable, vision of what an API can do, throughout all stages of the API life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to learn about Swagger yourself, you can tune into these channels to learn more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io/">Website</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SwaggerApi">Twitter</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api">Github</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swagger-swaggersocket">Google Group</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal with this post is evolve my understanding and awareness of what Swagger is, and hopefully along the way I can help increase yours as well. In my experience, many people have a very distorted, and limited understanding of what Swagger is, and I&rsquo;d like to take some time to evolve that. When I started this research, my objective was to help Tony deliver a new website, and on-boarding materials for Swagger, assisting people of all skill levels in finding all things Swagger. I am just taking this moment to walk through what at I have so far, and craft a more robust version 1.0 narrative about what Swagger is, something that blogging helps me work through.</p>
<p>One of the biggest misconceptions I find when I talk with folks about Swagger, is that it is interactive documentation, when that is actually Swagger UI--when it comes to Swagger all roads start with the Swagger specification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec)">Swagger-Spec</a> </strong>- The goal of Swagger is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md">You can find version 2.0 of the spec here</a>, which is the current active version in use. The Swagger spec lets you describe all the essential aspects of API operations, with information about the operator, the host and basePath for the API, details about what type of content it produces or consumes, like JSON or XML. Most importantly it lets you describe each of the paths for an API, with details on parameters, responses, and other details of each specific API path. Swagger also provides you with the ability to describe the underlying data model definitions, describing the valuable resources being served up via APIs.</p>
<p>To grasp the last paragraph, you have to have a pretty solid understanding of the moving parts of an API, but in short the Swagger spec gives us a language to potentially map out all of the common parts of an API. It also allows me to describe the security for each API, and tag to organize APIs into specific buckets. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">I use Swagger to describe the almost 20 APIs my business uses daily, with varying amount of detail about each resource, and the information it serves up</a>. All the 20 of the Swagger definitions provide me with a machine readable map of my own IT infrastructure&mdash;as well as a common language that almost any other developer, or potentially not developer can learn to read, and work with.</p>
<p>With Swagger we now have a common way to communication around the APIs we develop, and also map out the public APIs we also depend on like Twilio, SendGrid, or even Twitter. Now what? Why do we do this? <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">There are an increasing number of incentives emerging for why you generate machine readable API definitions like Swagger</a>, which is part of the reason I&rsquo;m looking to further quantify the Swagger community, so I can add to the master list.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what I&rsquo;d consider to be the primary building blocks of Swagger, developed by the Swagger team, as part of the core offering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">swagger-ui </a>- </strong>Generation of interactive API documentation, which Swagger is often known for.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">swagger-codegen</a> -</strong> Generation of client code in a variety of languages using a Swagger definition.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js">swagger-js</a> -</strong> A JavaScript library to connect to swagger-enabled APIs via browser or Node.js.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-socket">swagger-socket </a>- </strong>A REST over WebSocket tool for creating real-time integrations with Swagger.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node-express">swagger-node-express</a> -</strong> Swagger module for Node.js w/express module</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-scala-module">swagger-scala-module</a> -</strong>&nbsp;Swagger support for Scala.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor">swagger-editor</a> -&nbsp;</strong>A visual editor for Swagger.      
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those six repositories represent the core tooling that the Swagger team has evolved around the specification, providing what I&rsquo;d consider to be three stops along the API life cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Server Code</li>
<li>Client Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Swagger is often known for its interactive API documentation (aka Swagger UI), but there has also been a lot of work done on the codegen platform, and editor, taking things well beyond just API documentation. This is just the beginning of what is possible with Swagger. In an effort to find out what else is being done with Swagger, and what is being built with the specification, I wanted to see what the community is up to, which platforms they are integrating it into, and what other standalone tooling is being built using Swagger.</p>
<p>I want a better understanding of the core group of companies who have embraced the Swagger specification, and baked it into their own platform. I know there are hundreds of them out there, but finding them can be easier said than done, especially when I'm looking some sort of public announcement, blog post, press release, service description, to use as my reference. So far I have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">49 companies</span></strong> that I&rsquo;m tracking on, who have pulled the Swagger spec, and incorporated into their own platform and infrastructure.</p>

<p>This list represents a pretty interesting mix of folks who understand the potential of Swagger, and have invested in the community by making it a core part of their operations. I know there are more of these out there (a lot more), but they haven&rsquo;t talked publicly about what they are up to. This is just what I&rsquo;ve aggregated from going through the Swagger site, group, and Github repositories, and from what I already know of the API space, from my monitoring.<br /><br />After looking at the platforms who have pulled the Swagger specification into their operations, I wanted to see if I could also begin to quantify the community of APIs who have deployed Swagger UI, providing interactive API documentation for their own API platform. Since this is what Swagger is known for, I knew I would find quite a few to showcase. So far I have found 62:<br /><br /></p>

</table><p>Finding websites that have implemented Swagger UI is harder than you think. There are only three search engines I could find that let you search the source code of websites for JavaScript files and code. Ultimately I ended up mostly depending on my own ability to find new APIs, and manually uncover whether or not Swagger was actually in use. I&rsquo;m working on a stack of Swagger and API Blueprint discovery search engines, but they aren&rsquo;t quite ready for this dive.<br /><br />Next I wanted to look through some of the tooling that has evolved as part of the Swagger community, which Github is definitely the place to begin this journey. <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=swagger">When you search Github for the word Swagger, you get almost 1000 repositories</a>. I was going to programmatically explore these results, but found that manually browsing through them was the best path to take, allowing me to make a decision on what each developer was up to.<br /><br />The one thing I learned doing through this process&mdash;Swagger means many different things, to many different people. Most refer to Swagger, and mean Swagger UI, while others refer to it as generating server side code, or maybe client side code. Moving forward, there needs to be a lot of work done helped educate people about first, what Swagger is, a specification, and what are&nbsp; each of the areas of tooling that are built on top of the Swagger specification.<br /><br />Even after looking through the almost 1000 Swagger related Github projects, things are still very hazy for me, but I did learn a lot along the way, about what languages, frameworks and platforms developers are using Swagger, and the types of tools and integrations they are developing.</p>
<p>The best way to look at all of these projects is by language&mdash;here is the Github breakdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>411 JavaScript</li>
<li>135 Java</li>
<li>61 Ruby</li>
<li>41 Python</li>
<li>32 PHP</li>
<li>31 Scala</li>
<li>22 C#</li>
<li>17 Shell</li>
<li>13 Clojure</li>
<li>8 Groovy</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t accurate, because many of the JavaScript repositories are actually other languages. I forget to make sure Github knows what language a repo is sometimes too. Regardless, it gives you an idea of which programming languages developers are using to work with Swagger&mdash;one layer to look consider.<br /><br />Beyond the programming languages I want to know which platforms and frameworks developers are applying Swagger. Here are 36 frameworks and platforms I&rsquo;ve identified so far.</p>

<p>Beyond the programming languages, frameworks, and platform integrations I&rsquo;m looking to also understand the types of tools developers are actually building, and take Swagger beyond what the core development team, and working group could do. It is hard to understand the objectives of each of the developer projects I came across, but here are the X areas I&rsquo;ve identified so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converter</li>
<li>Generator</li>
<li>Parser</li>
<li>Schema</li>
<li>Validator</li>
<li>Server</li>
<li>Command-Line</li>
<li>Powershell</li>
<li>Client</li>
<li>Proxy Generator</li>
<li>Aggregator</li>
<li>Tester</li>
</ul>
<p>This added a couple stops along the API life cycle for me, that Swagger is serving. I hadn&rsquo;t envisioned a Swagger powered CLI or Powershell tool. I&rsquo;ve only lightly thought about proxies, and aggregators driven by Swagger. When you bundle this with the platforms above who have integrated Swagger into their products and services, it starts to paint an even bigger picture of what is possible with Swagger.<br /><br />I think I&rsquo;m going to wrap up this dive into the Swagger ecosystem here. I still have all of the contributors, watchers, and people who have forked the core Swagger products, and well as many of the people involved in Swagger discussions via the Swagger Google Group and Twitter account to consider. Plus I think this article will flush out some other projects that are out there, being executed by my readers. Storytelling along the way is the best way to flush out hidden details in my opinion, and is one of the main reasons I&rsquo;m so transparent--I depend on people emailing and tweeting at me about stuff.<br /><br />This exercise has given me a new perspective on the Swagger community, and introduced me to some new companies, and tools. If you are doing anything cool with Swagger, please let me know, and I&rsquo;ll add it <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/">to my research</a>. Remember, if you don&rsquo;t tell the story about what your are doing with APIs, nobody knows, including me&mdash;API evangelism 101. This is just my first attempt to better quantify the Swagger community, and I&rsquo;m happy to include what you are up to in future updates.</p>

<p>I've been tracking on the potential for voice APIs since Siri was first announced, a topic that often meant telephony like from Twilio, or audio transcription from Popup Archive and Clarify. When I close my eyes and think about the the future of APIs and voice enablement, it is more akin to the Siri example, where the digital world is (supposedly) just a voice command away.</p>
<p>Imagine making all your employee directory, company calendar, or product catalog available via voice commands. How do you do this? You do it with APIs, and a voice enablement platform in-between the application developers, and the available API resources. Much like all other voice enablement, I think we have a huge amount of work to get anywhere close to the pictures we all have in our head, when if comes to voice enablement.</p>
<p>It is my mission to find these signs across the API landscape, and keep an eye on what they are doing. One platform that is now open for beta is <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/community/post/Tx1HI1N5ZFX0PEK/Sign-up-Now-for-the-Amazon-Echo-Beta-SDK">Amazon Echo</a>. Amazon says, <em>"Echo is designed around your voice. It's always on&mdash;just ask for information, music, news, weather, and more.&rdquo; </em>APIs are how we will deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of this equation. The difference between Apple Siri, and Amazon Echo at this point, is Amazon will let you (API providers) help deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of Amazon Echo discovery equation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/community/post/Tx1HI1N5ZFX0PEK/Sign-up-Now-for-the-Amazon-Echo-Beta-SDK">signing up for the beta</a>, and if I get access, I will share more stories. I encourage you to sign up as well, and if you have any work your doing with Amazon Echo, or know of other API driven voice-enablement platforms I should be paying attention to, let me know.</p>

<p>I am evolving <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">my own personal microservices definition</a>, something that is constantly changing, as I work on my infrastructure, read other people&rsquo;s own definitions (no shortage these lately), and continuing having conversations with smart folks across the space. I had the pleasure of having Mike Amundsen over the other night for dinner, and after having some interesting discussions about community, and potential micro services design, I&rsquo;m adding a couple of elements to my microservice definition list.</p>
<p>In my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">last post</a>&nbsp;on this, I listed seven criteria I congress as part of my micro services definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal surface</li>
<li>minimal on disk</li>
<li>minimal compute</li>
<li>minimal message</li>
<li>minimal network</li>
<li>minimal time to rebuild</li>
<li>minimal time to throw away</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to add two elements to my list, considering some of the other elements I&rsquo;ve noticed at play when it comes to API bloat:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal ownership</li>
<li>minimal dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimal owners is a pretty easy one for me, as I&rsquo;m the owner of all my microservices&mdash;the buck always stops with me. However, It is a good reminder to make sure all of my services have a vCard applied to their <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son file index</a>. It is important to easily known who is responsible for any public or private API, and with APIs.son and Swagger, this is easy to do.</p>
<p>When it comes to minimal dependencies, this gets a little tougher for me. My world isn&rsquo;t too bad, because my systems are small, and I&rsquo;ve been the only developer.  The down side is I&rsquo;ve been the only developer, and I&rsquo;ve bee lazy about how many dependencies an API might have, and also been fairly sloppy about how I integrate with 3rd party APIs. Adding this item to my list will help me keep an eye on how I establish dependencies between services, keeping them minimal, and well documented.</p>
<p>That is it, I just wanted to add ownership and dependencies to my list of considerations&mdash;I just like making a production out of everything.</p>

<p>There are many areas I track on as part of my research. Things that do not show up on my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/23/weekly-apireport-for-march-23rd-2015/">weekly API.Reports</a>, or in my analysis on API Evangelist. One of these is the area of drones. I&rsquo;m fascinated by this potential area in the area of Internet of Things, but until now it was more of a side note, or one possible path for APIs and the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>Amongst the numerous drone stories I curate, I'm seeing more shift in the space towards a developer focus. It isn't just about the drone itself, its about customizing, developing and using the drone as a platform. One recent story I noticed was <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/26/drone-maker-3d-robotics-debuts-open-source-development-platform-to-advance-public-app-innovation/">3D Robotics (3DR), one of North America's largest consumer drone manufacturer, announcing the release of a new DroneKit, which includes an API for drone app development</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://dronekit.io/">DroneKit</a> has a <a href="https://developer.3drobotics.com/docs">web API defined using Swagger</a>, which is the first Drone API I have actually added to my system. I am sure there are more out there, and now that I&rsquo;m tracking on closer, I'm sure I'll find them. The number of drone related stories that flow through my feeds is getting pretty out of control, and I'm thinking the space needs some standard approaches to APIs identified, to help develop better drone solutions, but also potentially inject some transparency into this growing layer of IoT.</p>
<p><a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/"> </a></p>
<p><a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/"></a><a href="http://3drobotics.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/drone-kit-air-ground-cloud.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>Now that I have an API blueprint for a drone API, in Swagger too! ;-) I will be able to start thinking about what some of the API patterns for drones might look like, and what some of the common building blocks might be for managing the technical, but also business, and political side of drone operation. I&rsquo;m thinking that when it comes to drone operations, APIs might not just be a nice to have, they might be something that becomes mandatory in trying to bring this fast growing, not well defined space, under some control.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whatsapp/whatsapp-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There was a quick post from Mashable the other day about a conversation with <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> cofounder Brian Acton, called WhatsApp cofounder: <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/03/25/whatsapp-developers-api/">Sorry developers, no API for you</a>. Its pretty common argument you hear from business leaders, regarding why they won&rsquo;t open up APIs. It has been a while since I railed on this line of thinking, so I am taking the opportunity to share why this is such an un-informed, short-sighted view of APIs.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t at the conference, so I a completely dependent on Mashable for this, but apparently someone in the audience asked:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We have done a lot of transactional messaging using traditional email and SMS, and we've recently moved into the international market," the engineer explained to the audience, who clapped and hollered. "We're desperate to communicate with our members where WhatsApp would be a wonderful platform. We're good developers."</em></blockquote>
<p>Acton stated that they had no current plans to, adding:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We don't want to inundate users with messages they don't want," Acton explained of the choice. "I am very empathetic to your cause. I receive emails on a regular basis from people who want to run their business or want to run something using WhatsApp as the backbone for communication, but we're balancing that with the user experience."</em></blockquote>
<p>Before I point out how narrow this thinking, let&rsquo;s focused on why I use the word un-informed to describe this perspective. Let&rsquo;s say the motivation for not opening up an API at WhatsApp is purely about UX, let&rsquo;s explore some of the options on the table, for API providers to strike the balance they are looking for in this area.</p>
<p><strong>API Management Service Composition</strong> <br />With modern API management services, you have a critical concept called "service composition", where you the API provider, can carve up different levels of access to valuable API resources, deciding exactly who has access to what. API do not equal firehose to the public, where anyone can build whatever they want. If you still see APIs in this way, spend some time playing with the more successful APIs out there like Twilio, SendGrid, and expand your definition of just exactly what an API is, and the role service composition plays.</p>
<p><strong>oAuth For Platform Access &amp; End User Control </strong><br />oAuth is a pretty proven way for managing who is accessing API resources, in a way that the end-user has a say in operations. An API does not automatically open access to all users, when a developers signs up for API access. In the beginning, you have access to your own account as a developer, that is it. It is up to end-users to find these applications, and using oAuth, give (or revoke) access to whatever application they choose. As a platform owner you should consider giving end-users oversight, via oAuth, into how you the platform provider is accessing their data, and require <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL</strong></span> partners to follow this path. If you need example of this in action go look at your Google Account profile, you&rsquo;ll see Google Apps in the oAuth list.</p>
<p><strong>Branding And Design Guidelines</strong><br />What are the official internal branding and design guidelines you use to direct your own WhatsAp development teams&mdash;you have them right? So share these with developers, and give them a chance to share in your master UX vision of how the WhatsApp UX vision, is the one to rule them all. You should be able to articulate the platform UX vision as a set of professionally crafted, publicly shared, design guides, that everyone can see, and use to understand the vision--you never know maybe here would be someone out there in the world that could iterate on them in a meaningful way, that even you might even agree with.</p>
<p><strong>Starter Kits and UX Frameworks<br /></strong>Additionally, go beyond just design guides, and provide developers with HTML, CSS, Images, and JavaScript goodies that will demonstrate how visionary the WhatsApp UX vision is. Think <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.  I&rsquo;m not saying that Twitter nailed it on this front. They did well, but their overall timing and execution left a lot to be desired. As a platform provider who possesses a UX vision that works, open up the platform, provide developers with the proper starter kit, or UX framework that they need to succeed. As a developer, I fail to deliver on your UX vision, it is more a failure of your platform to provide me with proper tooling, than it is my fault as a dev.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Sandbox &amp; Simulation Environments </strong><br />A common approach to managing developer on-boarding, and overall quality control through an API and resulting app lifecycle, is done by providing developers with a sandbox. When nothing is live, and developers do not have any access to actual end-users, what harm is done? What harm to the overall UX experience is there, when developers are only building in sandbox and simulation environments? Until they prove themselves, no developer should move to a production environment, until their solutions is proven to meet WhatsApp strict UX guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Application &amp; Developer Certification</strong><br />Now let&rsquo;s talk about how WhatsApp could certify developers, giving them access to more resources, or possibly investment from the WhatsApp platform. Many leading platforms require developers to get certified, and / or their applications certified before they get full access to production environments, and end-users. How you craft your developer and application certification is a reflection of your overall UX requirements, and platform goals.</p>
<p><strong>Application Showcase</strong> <br />When you have proper branding and design guidelines, starter kits and supporting UI / UX frameworks, proper developer environments, and official application and developer certification, you should end up with a handful of apps worth showcasing. Maybe its not just a single, competing application, it could be integration with an existing platform (SalesForce, ZendDesk, etc.), or just providing access to valuable messages and conversations. With proper API ecosystem management, an application showcase provides an incentive for developers to build applications that work properly, and reflect the well defined UX vision of WhatsApp.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Program </strong><br />With a robust ecosystem of certified developers, and applications that meet the strict UX guidelines of WhatsApp, surely there will be the cream on top of what is developed on the APIs. Which apps, and platform integrations are the best designed, and provide the most value to WhatsApp end-users? These are the ones that WhatsApp should be investing in, bringing them closer to internal operations, and providing them with additional access to resources, investment when it makes sense. What does the WhatsApp partner program look like currently? I'm sure there is one, just not a formal approach, which includes any transparency, or public involvement.</p>
<p><strong>Zooming Back Out </strong><br />That represents just a handful of the common API management building blocks that are commonly put to work by API providers to help manage their API ecosystems. It doesn&rsquo;t just take technology to make APIs work, it takes a healthy business, and political approach to make sure any API actually works as an ecosystem. I could go on for days about how proper support, communication, and other proven elements, could also be used by WhatsApp to strike the API developer balance system they are looking for, and even possibly create a positive feedback loop with the community, that could be applied to the roadmap.</p>
<p>Now that we are paused, and zoomed out a little bit, let&rsquo;s talk about the narrow perception demonstrated by WhatsApp current stance on APIs. If you open up APIs, developers will just come and mess with your UX version. Nothing else will happen? This is where we shift from being educated about common building blocks, to the limited perceptions that results from this lack of awareness&mdash;you just don't know, what you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><strong>You Have APIs, You Just Aren&rsquo;t Open </strong><br />WhatsApp uses APIs. This is how the mobile app works. The company just does not want to share these resources with developers, because they fear losing control over the UX experience. I guarantee that WhatsApp is sharing data and resources with 3rd party provider, they are just very picky about who these are, and they don't have a formal process for doing so, so they keep their cards very close to their chest&mdash;aka, not open.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore the darker side of the WhatsApp API conversation. I&rsquo;m not alluding that WhatsApp has less than honorable intentions, my goal is to shine a line into the dark areas that exist, regardless of WhatsApp lack of education of modern API practices, and missing the wider picture of how APIs are actually put to work. This moves into the area of responsibility I feel that platforms assume, when they step up and invite end-users to sign up, depend on, and stay engage with any online, public, API driven web, mobile, or device based application.</p>
<p><strong>Data Access &amp; Portability </strong><br />WhatsApp end-user deserve access to their accounts, and their messages. APIs are not just about developers building the cool app that will compete with WhatsApp, or mess up the WhatsApp UX vision. APIs provide basic data access and portability to the information end-users generate via the WhatsApp platform. Platforms that do not empower end-user data portability, do not operate in the best interest of their own customers, removing from the overall user experience. Something you don't see, because your UX vision is so narrowly aligned with your business goals, not widely aligned with your end-users needs.</p>
<p><strong>Platform Reciprocity </strong><br />Using services like IFTTT and Zapier, API driven platforms are enabling users to to migrate their information between the services they depend on, and add to their own user experience on each platform they depend on, and most importantly between them. APIs, and oAuth enable the flow of information between cloud platforms in a way that protects the interests of users, as well as that of the platforms. APIs aren't just about developers building apps, they are also about users enhancing their own overall experience, on their terms&mdash;moving beyond the platform owners single UX vision.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity &amp; Platform Balance</strong> <br />I just can't imagine any single company, in 2015, thinking they have single UX vision, and nobody could possibly contribute to that, from an outside perspective. As a product owner, I would love to get as much input from my community regarding the next generation UX, because in the end, it is ultimately up to me what I incorporate into the roadmap, what are best practices in the API community, and ultimately which apps get certified, showcased in the application gallery, and pushed to end-users. When you operate a global platform like WhatsApp you can't address the diverse needs of end-users over time, around the globe, without the help of users augmenting and evolving exactly what is the WhatsApp UX vision. When you are a white dude in the U.S., you just aren't going to understand the UX for women of color in Africa, I don't care how much vision you think you have.</p>
<p><strong>In Conclusion, Just Shy of Innovation </strong><br />I&rsquo;m going to end this there. I&rsquo;m not even going to pull out the innovation card and talk about all the potential for new ideas, a WhatsApp API could generate. I&rsquo;ll stick with talking about a handful of common building blocks used across the space to mitigate the UX concerns that API driven platform providers have, and pointing out how narrow the UX concerns are. There are plenty of other reasons for having an API, beyond just developers building apps, that will mess with your UX vision.</p>
<p>Users should have a choice to use their preferred messaging channel (WhatsApp) in any platform they depend on, and be able to manage their experience using 3rd party services of their choice. With an informed&nbsp;approach to API management, you can do all of this, giving end-users more, without compromising the overall WhatsApp UX&mdash;you can carefully craft and evolve it, with the help of your community. As it stands, WhatsApp has an API, it is what the mobile app uses, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that WhatsApp does provide access to 3rd party partners of their choice, they just don't open that up to public knowledge&mdash;they are already doing what they say they don't do, they just aren't open and transparent about the process.</p>
<p>It doesn't take much to launch a proper developer portal, with the essential building blocks like documentation, code samples, and self-service registration. You don&rsquo;t have to give production access to every new developers&mdash;make them build something cool, and prove themselves first. That way you only deliver only the best to WhatsApp users. People are already building unsanctioned apps on WhatsApp (just Google WhatsApp API), not having an API isn&rsquo;t stopping these potentially bad seeds from entering the UX paradigm, there is just no sanctioned place for users to go, when they are looking to extend, augment, or make their WhatsApp work with other services they use, or assume control over their own account and data.</p>
<p>Alright, I'll stop ranting there. I know I&rsquo;m biased, but if you have a popular public mobile application in 2015, there is no reason you shouldn't have at least a public face of your developer program, to answer these question. In the end you are just hurting your own operations, as well as the overall experience for your users. Additionally, I just can't see how the leading position of any mobile is defensible for very long without an API. Things are just too volatile, and end-users are just too picky, someone will always come along and disrupt you, unless you can shift to deliver the UX consumers are demanding.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I started API Evangelist, I was all about the Business of APIs, something I still focus on, but increasingly over the last couple years I am focusing more on what I call the politics of APIs. In my opinion, the politics of APIs can be anything from terms of service and privacy policies, to rate limits, pricing, and security, all the way up to court cases, <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com">patents</a>, and government regulation.</p>
<p>Today I want to focus on the very top of that spectrum&mdash;government regulation. The government isn't just getting into the API game, by deploying their own APIs, they are going to also increasingly be getting more involved with private sector APIs. In my weekly monitoring I'm seeing more chatter across several industries, like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/382327/44695_Accessible.pdf">the UK treasury getting involved in banking API standards</a>, and <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/03/25/the-final-stage-of-meaningful-use-rules-will-ehrs-finally-pay-off/">a push in the healthcare industry for more interoperability via APIs</a>--just to highlight two recent stories.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t anything new, governments been defining API standards and pitching them to industries for a while now. I personally have been involved in healthcare and energy related standards, as part of Blue Button and Green Button data services. In coming years, what is going to increase, is the number of industries that the government is helping define standard, as well as beginning to get a little more heavy handed about mandating APIs as part of the regulatory process..</p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of government regulation, something I feel gets abused on both sides of the tracks, but I understand it is a necessary actor when it comes to balance in markets. To help address some of the abuse that occurs, I think APIs could significantly help bring much needed transparency, and self-service access to the process, for both the public and private sector. I feel the conversation in coming years will move beyond the government just defining industry API standards, but also pushing for real-time interoperability, and execution by companies who operate in heavily regulated industries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to keep track of the patterns I see emerging when it comes to API driven regulation, and try to stay informed regarding what is coming down the pipes across business sectors. At various points along the way, I&rsquo;ll do roundups of regulator related news, analysis, and API definitions, or platforms that focus on industry regulation. When it comes to API driven regulation, there will be no black or white, just high a high frequency blur, which will need transparency, and a machine readable interface to make any sense of.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/24/reflecting-on-api-management-and-the-apigee-ipo/">reflecting on API management and the Apigee IPO</a>, I&rsquo;m thinking deeper on how the API space has come to be a &ldquo;thing". To kick off this story, you have to start with the API itself, something very abstract, hard to see, let alone convey to the average person. A single API is difficult to quantify, let alone an entire sector, or the companies rising up to service this perceived sector&mdash;think of the argument from early API management service providers like Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee had to make to their VCs.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the API space has always been a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; to me, but along the road from 2010-2015, there has been plenty times, where I question the way things are. I have to give it to Mashery, they saw it early on, then 3Scale and Apigee joined in, and in 2015 we have a real industry, with <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">35 API management service providers</a>, in addition to the expanding number of service providers catering to API design, deployment, management, discovery, integration, and other evolving layers of the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>In 2015, I feel like the API sector is a real thing. Not because 3Scale is still growing, Mashery was acquired by Intel, Apigee is IPOing, or that there is over 35 API management service providers, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">including a number of open source solutions</a>. The API sector is a real thing because there are many other companies, in many supporting area who have emerged, and the overall awareness around the potential of API, by business leaders has grown significantly. How did this happen? It happened because people were telling the story of APIs, whether it was marketing for their products services, or stories on ProgrammableWeb and API Evangelist&mdash;working in concert to create an industry (something).</p>
<p>Within the same thought, I try to grasp how it was that I created API Evangelist. There sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t any strategy to do it. Early on I had a vision in my mind, but five years later, that vision is radically different. I did what I had to do, when the time came, and told the stories that mattered (at least I tried). I am not trying to connect API Evangelist to the overall existence of the API management space, I&rsquo;m trying to work through the details how you define something to a wide audience, in this very abstract world of APIs. I think this applies at the highest levels of industry like API management, to the lowest levels, at the microservice level (soon to be nanoservice, trust me it will be something ;-)&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t something, until it is something, and people believe.</p>
<p>I know. All of this sounds like bullshit. If you think about it though, it begins to make sense (hopefully). Web APIs weren&rsquo;t a thing until John Musser aggregated them together into a directory in 2005. API management wasn&rsquo;t a thing until Mashery, 3Scale, and APigee made it into something. API evangelism wasn&rsquo;t a thing until API providers like Twilio and Sendgrid started sending out armies of evangelists to hackathons. API design wasn&rsquo;t a thing until Tony Tam gave us Swagger to help us visualize our APIs, and Jakub Nesetril of <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a> allowed us to design, mock, and collaborate around an API Blueprint. None of these things were things, until people stepped up and worked really hard to convince others, that they were a thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working hard to understand this in action across the API space. The Apigee IPO, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/26/swagger-shifts-hands-from-reverb-to-smartbear/">Swagger changing hands</a>, and other shifts in the landscape are making me think a little deeper about how we got where we are at.  How did we all build momentum in API management, design, or now apply to world of API discovery? How do you make government APIs a thing? How do we ensure hypermedia becomes / is a thing? I mean, not just one possible design constraint, but well understood by all developers, and when it makes most sense to put to use. How has Swagger evolved? What is next for Swagger?  These are all things that make me curious for what the future holds, and how I can help get us there safely, with as few scratches as possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2015</span>

<p>The news came out yesterday that <a href="http://smartbear.com">SmartBear</a> was taking over ownership of <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, from Reverb. Swagger has been outgrowing its home at  Reverb for some time now, becoming much more than I think even Tony originally imagined. You can find the <a href="http://smartbear.com/news/news-releases/">official announcement from SmartBear on their site</a>, and <a href="http://blog.helloreverb.com/swagger-smartbear/">Tony&rsquo;s thoughts over on the Reverb blog</a>. No need for me to recap, but I did want to provide some of my personal thoughts on the shift in this very important project.</p>
<p>I feel like we are embarking on the next stage in the evolution of Swagger. Over the last couple of years, the Swagger community has see growth, adoption, and investment at an unprecedented pace, culminating in version 2.0 of the spec and now its transfer SmartBear. The scope and passion of the Swagger community and the investment that Tony Tam specifically and also the API community have made -- these have all brought us to this moment.</p>
<p>I've known the SmartBear team for years, and after speaking with them about this transition of the Swagger specification, I believe SmartBear is the right steward for Swagger, during its next stage of its evolution. SmartBear understands the gravity of what they are now taking charge of: the Swagger specification representing a central truth throughout the entire API lifecycle.</p>
<p>SmartBear fully understands too that it was organic growth that made Swagger the force that it has become, and SmartBear is aware that a unique balance of leadership, open governance, and a strong community pull will be just as essential during the next stage of growth. I look forward to working with the Swagger community and SmartBear team to ensure Swagger continues playing a vital role across the API space, meeting the demands of the fast-growing API economy.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I see Swagger as a central truth in the API economy, something I&rsquo;m invested in beyond just my own IT infrastructure, as Swagger is also the cornerstone of the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a>, that Steven Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I created to assist in the next generation of API discovery. I am behind Swagger because I believe in Tony&rsquo;s vision, and I also believe that the Swagger community will make this transition more about shifting gears for the Swagger spec and tooling, than it is about who is in charge of the project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tuned into the Swagger community since its inception, and the community support, contributions, and chatter has become pretty loud over the last year. I trust that SmartBear has experienced this scope as well, and understands the importance of Swagger having an open governance model, which would make this current transition all about shifting Swagger into 2nd gear,  and setting up of open governance representing about shifting into 3rd gear, putting the ability to shift into 4th and 5th gear up to the Swagger community itself.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to what SmartBear and the Swagger community can achieve out on the open API highway!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/24/reflecting-on-api-management-and-the-apigee-ipo/">Reflecting On API Management And The Apigee IPO</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apigee-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>It has been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/12/23/api-management-service-provider-roundup-for-2011/">a little over three years since I published my first roundup of API management providers</a>. I&rsquo;ve been tracking on this new breed of companies long before I started API Evangelist, but in 2011 I started formalizing how I monitored what these companies were up to. In 2015, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">I now track on over 35 API management service providers</a>, offering everything from simple proxies, to the full API management infrastructure stack you get from 3Scale.</p>
<p>I have met most of the API management providers, and after 5 years of covering them, it is no secret I have my favorites (you know who you are ;-). The business side of being an API management service provider has never really excited me, so I tend to stay away from the investment and acquisition stories, or speculating to much on who is winning the cash game. With that said, <a href="http://apigee.com/about/press-release/apigee-files-registration-statement-proposed-initial-public-offering">I think the Apigee IPO is a pretty significant milestone for the industry</a>, something I have to give pause to, and reflect on how far we&rsquo;ve come, and evaluate how an IPO compares to the acquisitions we&rsquo;ve seen in recent years, or the other significant industry milestones.</p>
<p>The acquisitions of Mashery, Layer7, Vordel, and Apiphany showed the space was really maturing, and the recent name change by SOA Software to Akana, shows the space has evolved over the last ten years. I think the Apigee IPO shows the overall space is actually growing up. I don&rsquo;t think Apigee had many other alternatives, with a gagillion dollars in funding, but I still think still it shows the space is moving out of its juvenile phase. I guess the actual IPO will be the true test of how grown up we all actually are eh?</p>
<p>For me, another thing to note is where 3Scale is at. You see, I consider Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee to be the OG three of API management service providers. Yeah, I know you have been around longer--SOA, Vordel, and other gateway solutions, but those three are the "OG API management&rdquo;. 3Scale has been plugging along slow and steady, taking on only the funding it needs, while Mashery was acquired, and now while Apigee is IPOing. I know I&rsquo;m biased when it comes to 3Scale, but I think their longevity, and success is as notable as any IPO, or acquisition milestones--its been a long haul.</p>
<p>Another thing to think about is the amount of open source tooling that is available in 2015--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">I was pleased by the amount of new players when I did my last roundup</a>. I was also happy to work with WSO2 early on to understand what the space needed with its open source API management solution, and also the API Umbrella platform as part of the federal government work I&rsquo;ve done. The amount of open source tooling that is available is a clear sign for me, that the API management is truly growing up, and API management is really a thing (was a little shaky there for a while, couldn&rsquo;t tell if I was dreaming, or awake ;-).</p>
<p>I would like to end this reflection, on the most important sign for me that the API space will continue its growth, and reach new heights in coming years. The fact that the conversation has moved way beyond just API management, with companies, services, and tooling emerging throughout the API life-cycle, stimulating design, deployment, discovery, integration, and management conversations that are generating the growth I speak of. Things were only about API management for a while, something that really worried me, but in 2015 the conversation goes much wider and deeper, pushing into even more exciting territory like visualizations, containerization, and objects.</p>
<p>In closing, congrats to Apigee, wishing you best of luck in your IPO--Its been a fun ride, and I&rsquo;m looking froward to it not ending anytime soon.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale, and WSO2 are API Evangelist partners.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://api.report/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-report/api-report-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Ok, it seems like Monday is going to be the regular posting day for my weekly API.Report. No matter how hard I try to get done over the weekend, something always seems to get in the way. Regardless, I'm still going to do, as the process is more than worth it.</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>A couple of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3D printing</strong></span> footnotes for the week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://3dprint.com/51988/3d-printed-twitter-mood-lamp/">3D Printed Twitter Mood Lamp Assesses the Emotional State of Denver Residents</a> - Not sure this is a realistic implementation, but I think the combo of 3D printing and social APIs, is an interesting crossover.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://hackaday.com/2015/03/18/adding-recycling-codes-to-3d-prints/">Adding Recycling Codes To 3D Prints</a> - Another potential interesting cross section of APIs and 3D printing. Seems like you could really go to down making 3D printed items that have a barcode, that is linked to online resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Accessibility</strong></span> is a critical aspect of the API space that needs more discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/16/web-accessibility-with-accessibility-api/">Accessibility APIs: A Key To Web Accessibility</a> - This is an important aspect of the API conversation that isn't discussed, let alone APIs delivering a solution. I'm going to break this down, and try to incorporate accessibly into my research more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>acquisitions</strong></span> I wanted to showcase this week:</p>
<ul>

We've seen this market stabilize with the world of social, but with the number of APIs out there, the Dataminr, Datasift, and other models will become relevant in other areas of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be tracking on more <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>annotation</strong></span> related discussions in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/16/youtube-introduces-interactive-cards-to-complement-annotations-and-they-work-on-mobile-too/">YouTube introduces interactive cards to complement annotations &ndash; and they work on mobile too</a> - I think normally I'd consider this an embeddable story, I'm going to be looking for annotation specific elements that are API driven.

</ul>
<p>Some <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API aggregation</strong></span> action, mostly from Google:</p>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>If you know of something I missed, feel free to email or tweet at me, and make sure I know about your company, and have a link to your blog RSS. If you don't tell the story and share, the world will never know it happened.</p>
<p>It is a good time to be tracking on the API space--lots going on!</p>

<p>I was <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/posts/2015/3/19/episode-28-everybody-likes-to-listen-to-people-searching-for-things-on-twitter">listening to too infrequent Traffic and Weather API podcast today</a>, and one of the topics John and Steve covered was an interesting approach to API consumption, and getting past API rate limits, with <a href="https://github.com/singingwolfboy/webhookdb">WebhookDB</a>. I agree with John, that WebhookDB is pretty clever, and represents what I'd consider classic API developer ingenuity, when it comes to getting access to the resources they need. I&rsquo;d have to give this one to my friend and API adversary Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>), when he says rate limits stimulate developer creativity. +1 Tyler.</p>
<p>So, what does WebhookDB do?</p>
<blockquote><em>...allows you to replicate Github's database over HTTP using webhooks. It's useful if you want to treat Github's APIs as a database, querying over pull requests and issues. Github doesn't like that, and you'll quickly hit the API's rate limits -- but if you use WebhookDB, you don't have to worry about it! Just populate the initial data into the database, set up the webhook replication to keep it in sync, and query your local database however you'd like...</em></blockquote>
<p>There is more back-story over at the <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201412/rest_api_gotcha_and_webhookdb.html">REST API gotcha, and webhookdb story</a> that Traffic and Weather linked to. I agree with John&rsquo;s thoughts, that this is an opportunity for a service provider to step up and deliver on. I envision a pretty simple, open source, containerized version, as well as a cloud-based version that people could tap into, and pay for more premium services on top of each index.</p>
<p>John is right, there will be significant overhead in defining the schema of each API you would support. Let me know, I can help with some of the targeting, alongside what I&rsquo;m doing for my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>. Each API would need some special attention, but with containers, you could easily build out a pretty slick deployment solution that runs in cloud, or in infrastructure of choice for end-users. With some heavy lifting up front, it would be a pretty viable solution for API consumers, but I also think provide an interesting cache opportunity for API providers--think <a href="http://datasift.com/">Datasift</a>.</p>
<p>I also see a higher, more analyst level view here, in helping establish a common definition of web hook patterns across the space, and identify common patterns, then bring much needed education and potential consistency to the API space when it comes to webhook execution. Kind of like what I work to do for API design, deployment, management, integration, and other key areas of the API space. People are hungry for this type of information, and I&rsquo;m happy to aggregate the work of anyone who steps up and delivers in this way.</p>
<p>I would also take this one step further, and charge someone with stepping up into more of a web hook advocacy role, where you could push back on some API providers to offer webhooks (many don&rsquo;t), and improve existing web hook designs, again helping establish consistency in the space. In my experience many API providers want to understand the bigger picture, but don&rsquo;t often have the time or awareness, and with a little education, and guidance, you could make a significant impact.</p>
<p>I look at webhooks as the important second lane, making APIs a two-way street, shifting API operations to be just as much push, as it is pull. Web hooks play a different role in potentially each APIs operations and ecosystems, but for many platforms, they will continue to play an important role in giving developers more control over API resources, while also eliminating much of the burden upon API providers.</p>
<p>Great idea John and Steve, thanks for sharing. One more reason to tune into <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>&mdash;startup ideas!!</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-bright.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">slowly migrating my own infrastructure, towards a microservice first approach</a>, something you can follow the details of on my <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">alpha.apievangelist.com blog</a>. I've been running on my own custom brew content management system (CMS) since I started API Evangelist in 2010. There are many APIs in use across my system, both external publicly available APIs like Twitter and Crunchbase, and a wide variety of internal APIs I've developed myself.</p>
<p>As I work to replicate each aspect of my CMS, carving off each potential micro service, I'm reminded of how much of what I do lives in the shadows. Little scripts I've written here, and there, jobs I haven't run in months, and just general code exhaust from years of operation. I&rsquo;m a little different than most shops, as I'm a one person operation, who codes all my own stuff, but based upon my experience in other shops, the same behavior exists in almost any organization.</p>
<p>Throughout this migration I&rsquo;m reminded of what I'd consider to be one of the biggest security lapses in my world, which is just about things being known. As I build out new features, jobs, bells, and whistles, are they all cataloged, mapped out, and consistently used, or deprecated. Anything that is unknown, unaccounted for, lives in the shadows of my operations, and potentially provides a security risk. Often times the culprit in any security lapse, is an unknown workstation, server, application, or single script.</p>
<p>Having a single doorway (micro service), with a single approach to authentication (<a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API Infrastructure</a>), and a map of my entire surface area, using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> + <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, I&rsquo;m getting a much better handle on things. It will take a while to clean up all my legacy stuff, and map everything out, but once I do, I can easily audit, monitor, deprecate, and ultimately secure the entire surface area of my infrastructure, because it is all done with an API first approach. Then I&rsquo;ll continue to address other aspects of my security like SSL, app management, and other critical areas, but for now, I feel like being able to map out my infrastructure, is doing wonders for bringing my infrastructure out of the shadows.</p>

<p>I am putting a lot of thought into the value of an API request and response lately. I've talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/postman-collections-as-unit-of-measurement-for-transactions-in-the-api-economy/">the potential of a Postman collection as a unit of measurement, for the API economy</a>. I&rsquo;m also spending time breaking down the monetization strategies of <a href="http://theapistack.com/">the 700+ companies I track on</a>, but I&rsquo;m really looking to get beyond just the API pricing, and actually measure any evidence of real value that I can.</p>
<p>This particular post is born out of a conversation with John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1rgh3wM">Runscope</a>, while we were in Sydney Australia last month for <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days Sydney</a>. John had mentioned that when people asked him which are the best APIs out there, he replies &ldquo;none of them, until they are used&rdquo;. Which when you think about it, it really is the truth--APIs do not offer ay value, until they are actually put to use in an app, or system integration.</p>
<p>It is easy to place the value in the actual API definition, or in the request, or response from the API. There is also a lot of talk about much of the value being in the documentation, or possibly the SDK. You can event point to the value being that it is a public API, with easy on-boarding, that you can rely on, and scale as you need. All of this may contribute units to the overall value, but at this point any API still doesn't have value to anyone.</p>
<p>As John says, the point at which an API has value, is when it is used. Until that point, an API isn&rsquo;t a thing. I&rsquo;m not saying the API call as a metric, is the single metric to rule them all, but it is at this point when I feel you can really begin to measure the value an API delivers, and capture the exhaust from it. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know what I mean by all of this, it really is just an exercise for me to break down the moving parts of each API, so that I can better understand how APIs will potentially fuel the API economy--think what Runscope does, but for the monetization portion of each API transaction.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2015</span>

<p>I'm working with multiple partners to define what I&rsquo;d consider to be the firsts stops along the API lifecycle, when you use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as the scaffolding for your API operations. APIs.json is a machine readable format for indexing APIs, that exist under a specific website domain, or are part of a aggregate collection designed for a specific project or objective.</p>
<p>To help me, and the folks I&rsquo;m working with to better see the API lifecycle that APIs.json is enabling, I wanted to take a stroll through each of the stops along the API lifecycle, and think through the potential for additional formats, services, and tooling throughout the entire journey. I want to explore the possibilities for individual API providers, API consumers, as well as API service providers, and the aggregate level, where companies and individuals are delivering valuable tools and services to the overall space.</p>
<p>First, lets start with what I envision APIs.json enabling at the direct one to one, API provider and consumer levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Metadata - </strong>Quick access to the most important info about any API, its title, description, image, endpoint, url and tags.</li>
<li><strong>API Surface Area - (The Truth) -</strong> Using Swagger and API Blueprint, any developer can quickly quantify the surface area of an API or microservice.</li>
<li><strong>Execute API -</strong> Include Postman Collections, allowing each API to be execute ready, allowing consumers to load in Postman and deliver the value behind any API.</li>
<li><strong>On-Board API -</strong> One click reference to where an API consumer can onboard with an API.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Server-Side Code - </strong>Locating of existing server-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Generate Server-Side Code -</strong> Locating of services for generating of server-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Supporting Container Images - </strong>Where Docker, and other container images reside, providing instant deployment opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Client Side Code - </strong>Locating of existing client-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-generate Client Side Code - </strong>Locating of services for generating of client-side code in multiple language.</li>
<li><strong>API Pricing -</strong> Understand pricing, access tiers, and partnership opportunities around API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Services - </strong>Access, and make sense of terms of services that apply to API usage.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing - </strong>Understand the licensing of an API, data, content, and code related with an API.</li>
<li><strong>General Questions -</strong> Be able to ask, and get answers to common questions about any API.</li>
<li><strong>API Conversations - </strong>Understand where to engage in conversations, and experience streams from common sources like Github and forums.</li>
<li><strong>Augment APIs - </strong>Add endpoints, verbs, and parameters to existing endpoints, augmenting what any single API provider can deliver.</li>
<li><strong>API Presets -</strong> Establish preset value for API entries, allowing the single, or bulk publishing of data, content and other values to APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Mapping and Domain Specific Language (DSL) - </strong>Bridging API definitions, and APIs, providing much needed aggregation and reciprocity for APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Sandboxes -</strong> Establish API sandboxes, based upon existing API designs, allowing developers to develop against alternative API than a production environment.</li>
<li><strong>API Simulations - </strong>Beyond just a sandbox, actually establish alternative APIs that provide specific simulations of production scenarios that an API would serve.</li>
<li><strong>API Cookbooks - </strong>Assemble API cookbooks that help onboard API consumers using wizards, blueprints, and other established orchestration patterns.</li>
<li><strong>API Testing -</strong> Initiate API testing tools and services, covering surface area of each API.</li>
<li><strong>API Monitoring - </strong>Initiate API monitoring tools and services, covering surface area of each API.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Security - </strong>Audit surface area of any API that is indexed using APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>API Adjacent Monitoring - </strong>Initiate monitoring of other API adjacent resources like documentation, terms of services, and other essential building blocks of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Visualize API Surface Area -</strong> Simple, embeddable visualizations that help us see the surface area an API provides.</li>
<li><strong>Visualize API Resources - </strong>Simple, embeddable visualizations that help us interact with the resources APIs deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze API Surface Area - </strong>Simple, plug and plug tooling and services for analyzing the surface area of any API.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze API Resources -</strong> Simple, plug and play tooling and services for analyzing the resources APIs deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Load API Response In Spreadsheet - </strong>Resource for loading, and importing API resources into an Excel or Google Spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong>Craft experiences -</strong> Weave together experiences made up of multiple API resources, and the resources that are available to support them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list represents my master vision for stops along the API lifecycle, that could be served via APIs.json, providing value directly to API providers, and their consumers. Each of these areas would benefit both sides of the API coin, but as you can see will add value to the APIs.json engine, in a way that goes well beyond just API discovery--which APIs.json is known for.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to articulate, and map out the opportunities that will be available when APIs.json is fully realized. Our goal is to push the number of APIs.json files available to a critical point, where this full lifecycle vision is a reality. Once this occurs, I see another plane of existence emerging, one that can be applied across hundreds, or thousands or public or private APIs and micro services.</p>
<p>Once a critical mass with the number of APIs.json files is achieved, the wider opportunities for expansion, growth, and monetization will span three main areas in my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definitions - </strong>Additional API definitions like Swagger, API Blueprint, and API Commons, providing machine readable access to vital components of API operations, that can be baked into the overall API lifecycle. 
<ul>
<li><strong>API Pricing -</strong> A machine readable format for breaking down pricing, access tiers, and partnership opportunities around APis indexed with APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>API Questions - </strong>A machine readable format for aggregating questions around API operations, including terms of service, privacy policy, and other elements that impact API integration.</li>
<li><strong>API Conversations - </strong>A machine readable for for aggregating conversations that occur around API operations, that occur on multiple channels like Github, Stack Overflow, Twitter and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>API Services -</strong>&nbsp;The opportunity for new API services to be developed on top of the APIs.json lifecycle.   
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing -</strong> Introduction of testing related services to known, and custom APIs definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring -</strong> One time and schedule monitoring services, triggered via APIs.json indexing.</li>
<li><strong>Security -</strong> Scanning of entire API surface area defined by an APIs.json definition.</li>
<li><strong>Broker - </strong>Use of APIs.json in API broker related activity, crafting custom API backends and stacks.</li>
<li><strong>Analyst - </strong>Delivery of vital industry and area data and content, using APis.json format, connecting analysis directly to sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>API Tooling&nbsp;<strong>-</strong></strong>&nbsp;The opportunity for new API tooling to be developed on top of the APIs.json lifecycle.  
<ul>
<li><strong>Search -</strong> Continued growth in the number of API search engines like APIs.io, providing options, and competition.</li>
<li><strong>Collections -</strong> Establishment of common tooling for doing API roundups, collections, stacks, or any other grouping that is defined.</li>
<li><strong>Notebook -</strong> Deployment of tools for saving, organizing, and remixing using APIs.json formats, either publicly or privately.</li>
<li><strong>Spots / Hubs - </strong>Deployment of API spots and hubs that allow aggregation of API definitions, supporting building blocks, and API consumers in a wide variety of API areas.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboards -</strong> Deployment of dynamic, APIs.json driven dashboards that generate visualizations, listings, and other detail via machine readable API definition formats.</li>
<li><strong>Infographics / Reports -</strong> Deployment of dynamic, APIs.json driven infographics, reports  that generate visualizations, listings, and other detail via machine readable API definition formats, in a portable format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is just a sampling of the definition, services, and tooling opportunities that are already, and will eventually emerge around an APIs.json driven lifecycle. The objective of this post was to flush out my ideas around the one to one, and the wider API economy opportunities using in APIs.json driven API lifecycle, for my own purposes, but also to communicate my thoughts to a handful of partners who are executing definitions, services, and tooling already.</p>
<p>If you are curious about what this all means, and get more clarification about how your company, its services and tooling fit into this, feel free to reach out, and I&rsquo;ll do what I can to help you understand where you fit. Some of the stops along this API driven supply chain, I&rsquo;m depending on existing efforts like Swagger and API Blueprint to execute, some of the areas I&rsquo;m pushing forward myself like API Commons, API Pricing, API Questions, and API Conversations, while other areas I&rsquo;m depending on 3rd party individuals and companies to step up and own. If you think you might be interested in delivering an API definition, service, or tooling somewhere in the areas I&rsquo;ve defined, feel free to reach out.</p>
<p>This post is a product of several conversations I&rsquo;m having with folks, and the regular conversations that Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of 3Scale, and I are having around the APIs.json format. Additionally we are currently working on the roadmap for APIs.io with Nicolas Grenie (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a>), which is the first of many tools that are being built on the APIs.json format. <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">You can influence the roadmap for APIs.json via the Github repo</a>, and the individual communities of each of the sub APIs.json API definitions formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, on their own working sites and repos.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, thanks for listening! ;-)</p>

<p>I was just talking with my friend Oliver Seiler (@0seiler) in New Zealand via email. Oliver is great at keeping me in tune with API related stories out of New Zealand. I was making sure he knew how much I appreciate people like him sending me regular updates, and that it is what makes API Evangelist go around&mdash;to which he replied, reminding of how important the work we are doing here in the US API space.</p>
<p>Oliver told me what I hear a lot, <em>"We still need to sell our story every single day and you wouldn't believe how much anything that comes from particularly you and 18F, but also ProgrammableWeb and GDS in the UK matters to our work."</em> This isn't an isolated case, I hear this a lot from people I talk to in government, enterprises, and other institutions around then globe--the stories we tell are used to make change in how they think and potentially operate. Our stories from the trenches, become the stories they use to sell APis to their bosses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These reminders are what keeps me going after almost five years of evangelizing. The stories we are sharing about API best practices, and the challenges we face across API design, deployment, management, monetization, evangelism, discovery, and integration, are important to not just the health of the overall API space, but to each public and private sectors that APIs are touching in 2015.</p>
<p>The message for me here, is that we all need to keep pushing forward, but also making sure we tell the stories publicly, sharing our knowledge in real-time, because people are watching, and depending on us to help influence how things work in their businesses, institutions, and government agencies around the world. #NoPressure</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://gsa.github.io/sam_api/sam/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/sam-api-gov.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Running the perfect API operation is pretty much a delusional dream. Even leaders &nbsp;like Twilio and AWS have platform, and ecosystem produced problems on a regular basis. In my opinion, API are all about the journey, and we may never get our strategy 100% perfect, we can communicate, and evolve along the way&mdash;this is what I consider the API journey.</p>
<p>To help demonstrate this in action, here a p<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/yBlLdvG2lmk">ost from the GSA, about the SAM API, on the US Government API Forum</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We've, rightfully, heard complaints about the SAM API languishing and the documentation not being as functional as it needs to be. We want to make sure users of the API feel comfortable using it to build real applications off of. We've adjusted how we're staffing the API as well as raised the priority the API in the eyes of our developers.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To you, this means this:</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>1) At a minimum, we're sweeping through new GitHub issues weekly, but we will do everything to go through those issues more rapidly.<br /></em><em>2) We're going to increase our transparency by making sure that anything in our backlog that's API-related is in a GitHub issue - if it's prioritized with a date, that'll be made clear, too. We want to make sure you know what's coming and on what days - and the docs will be updated to reflect what's currently implemented and what's coming.<br /></em><em>3) We're going to publish our version management plan to the SAM API site so it's more clear what's going to cause a version change. One of the things about the SAM data is that regulations may change our data, so we should be treating some of it (like reps and certs) as variable-length instead of fixed to keep systems from breaking, so we absolutely document that.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>We've already added some updates that include reference data that wasn't available before and a few minor cleanups. Expect the more as we ramp up our people at this to be worked through by the end of next week. We appreciate being held to task on this - IAE's larger strategy relies on usable, exciting APIs and we can't do that if we aren't serving you.</em></p>
<p>This is why I prescribe APIs, not because APIs are a technological wonder that magically fixes everything (they do, oh they do). I prescribe APis because of the API journey, and if done right, the API provider can change, evolve, and learn to better serve their consumers, and in this case constituents.</p>
<p>APIs are born out of breaking down legacy walls built up between IT and business operations, but they have also become about breaking down walls built up between inside the firewall, and outside the firewall. In the end I do not think APIs are the thing that will change government or companies, it is the process of doing them, learning to open up and communicate, that will move the needle forward.</p>
<p>Something that will not happen at your agency, organization, institution, or business if you do not start on the API journey yourself.</p>

<p>Like API, the term microservice has emerged as a force, along with a meaning that is very precise, or very broad, depending on who you are. The only thing I&rsquo;m sure of at this point, is the term microservice is very personal, and means very different things to different people, depending on where you stand in the industry.</p>
<p>Regardless I can't help but consider the implications of the term, internalize it, and see what value I can derive from its meaning in my own world. This exercise leaves me asking, what is a microservice? Over and over, acknowledging I may never fully know the meaning, and like API it will be more of a journey, then it never will be a destination.</p>
<p>First and foremost in my world a microservice means simple, and small. Simple and small. Simple and small. Say it until you can feel it, all Buddhist colliding with API Evangelist. Simple and small, penetrates all layer of meaning for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal surface</li>
<li>minimal on disk</li>
<li>minimal compute</li>
<li>minimal message</li>
<li>minimal network</li>
<li>minimal ui</li>
<li>minimal time to rebuild</li>
<li>minimal time to throw away</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately I want all of this, coupled with the ability to achieve maximum scale, with minimum effort. I want to do one thing, as well as I possibly can, with as minimal resources necessary, but delivering the maximum value at any scale&mdash;with value benefiting myself, my API consumers, and the end-users being served, equally.</p>
<p>None of this is set in stone for me. I acknowledge this is my own perception, and that others will see microservices as something entirely different. Even so, I share my definition publicly, as also I enjoy reading others definition. I kind of think that is part of the whole microservices thing, sharing your own personal definition. In reality microservices do not change my API mission, but it does allow the conversation to be distilled down, for a new generation of business leaders working to make sense of all of this.</p>

<p>Phew!! This week was hard. I just couldn't find the mojo to plow through, but I did it. A little late on Monday evening, but still so worth doing--putting the week into perspective.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to assess the best balance with what I post as individual news stories on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>. I think more of this could be pulled out as actual news stories, but will have to see if I have the time. Overall I am happy with how the weekly API.Report is evolving, but there is so much more I could do.</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>I track on a lot of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3D Printing</span></strong>, but few of them are directly API related, finallky one that moves the conversation forward:</p>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>As I did last week, I'm walking away with a better awareness of what is happening across the space. It isn't enough for me to read all of this API news in isolation, it helps to see it side by side with other news, allowing me to see and understand patterns that I may have missed.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-enterprise.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I would say the enterprise space fleet has successfully shifted their course, heading in the general direction of everything API. SAP, Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, and the rest of the usual suspects have pledged their faith to APIs, mobile, and IoT, all in a very public way. For those of us who jumped off the SOA bandwagon a while back (getting on the API bandwagon, yeehaw), this can be amusing to watch, cause the API bandwagon is better y'know?. ;-)</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that these large companies can make a shift towards an API way of life, or a microservice devops way of operating, or whatever the cool enterprise kids are calling it these days. Some companies will find success in these areas, while many, many others will just talk about it, and buy a wide range of vendor services that will help them talk about it&mdash;there will be a lot of money to be made (and spent).</p>
<p>The thing I fear, is that many of the core principles of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">why this whole thing is working</a> will go right over the heads of many technologies and business leaders in the enterprise. Elements like simplicity, transparency, openness, and functioning in a decoupled, decentralized way. You are the enterprise, many of the essential ingredients of API, are just fundamentally at odds with what you are. You are a big, complex, powerful, and political corporate presence&mdash;a beast that does not like being taken apart, reinvented over and over, and being forced to work in concert with other internal, partner, and public resources, in an open way.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that some enterprise entities won&rsquo;t be successful&mdash;some will. I will be carefully watching the waves of enterprise organizations, for these tech savvy few, who internalize the core philosophy around APIs, successfully uploading their corporate soul to the API singularity. However, I predict I will have to work very hard to find these companies amidst the wreckage of the enterprise organizations that make the same mistakes they did with SOA, because APIs are just not compatible with their DNA, and ultimately will be rejected for reasons that are more enterprise than they are API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm immersed in deep thoughts about the implications of machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collections,</a> which are being applied to APIs, in some very different, but overlapping, and complementary ways. Currently I&rsquo;m working to define the overlap between APIs.json and Postman Collections, and how they work together.</p>
<p>For me, any good API starts with a Swagger definition, or API Blueprint, which is the single, machine readable truth of what is the surface area of any API, which I consider fingerprint for what is possible with any API or micro service. Additionally when I am working with any API, or stack of APIs, I am using APis.json to organize them into a single coherent set of APIs, then rely on each APIs properties to point to essential resources like Swagger, terms of service, pricing, and anything else I feel is essential to operations.</p>
<p>In addition to providing links to Swagger definitions for each APIs.json API entry, I&rsquo;m also experimenting with adding a property that point to any Postman Collection for each API, and microservice.  I&rsquo;ll start by just calling the type &ldquo;x-postman-collection&rdquo;, and provide a URL to a Postman Collection I&rsquo;ve generated around the API call, providing a link between what an API is, and a measurement of the transaction an API produces.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that Swagger is the promise of value an API delivers, and Postman is a machine readable representation of the value, ready for execution&mdash;which acts as machine readable unit you can then load into Postman, or any other system, and actually experience the result. When this unit is sitting in your Postman client, you can see the value behind a single collection, but when you see a couple hundred of these collections in your Postman, you start seeing the important role they can play in the overall API economy, as portable a unit of measurement for API transactions.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-feedback-loop.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If you are following some of my recent stories, I&rsquo;m heavily focused on <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, as <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">I work to organize my own stack of microservices</a>, using APIs.son and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. I&rsquo;m working hard to define additional, machine readable layers to my microservices index that answer as many of the questions that I have about the microservices and APIs that I depend on.</p>
<p>The first machine readable definition I include in any <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/making-sure-my-api-roundup-stories-are-machine-readable-by-designing-them-as-apisjson-collections/">APIs.json collection</a> I&rsquo;m building is Swagger, which provides a JSON or YAML definition of the surface area for any microservice or API that I depend on. The second thing I put to work for my own APIs, is <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, which provides a JSON definition for the licensing of my APIs. Beyond that I&rsquo;m pushing forward a couple of other machine readable definitions, that help me make sense of not just a handful of APIs in my own collections, but potentially thousands of APIs in the public space.</p>
<p>I just published two potential new machine readable definitions to add to my stack of APIs.json properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com/">api-pricing</a></strong> - My quest to understand the API pricing across the API space, from providers like Amazon to Twilio, there are some healthy patterns to follow when crafting API pricing.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">api-questions</a></strong> - My realization that nobody would give a shit about a machine readable terms of service, so I created a simple JSON list of questions and answers that can be applied to APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are two areas that I am trying to better understand, as I build my machine readable index of the APIs, that I call <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>, which also helps fuel <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Another area I&rsquo;m struggling to get a handle on, is the message layer around APIs, and more widely what I&rsquo;d consider the feedback look around APIs. So, what the heck do I mean by this? I&rsquo;m not entirely sure, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure it out in real-time--which is why I'm writing this post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an API is one of my internal APIs, the messaging, communication, and feedback loop starts with issue management in Github. Each API has its own Github repo as its home base, and any communication around its design, deployment, and management, happens there. However there may be other references to the API made on Twitter, Stack Overflow, or other channel, and I am looking for a way to aggregate them all in a single machine readable away, that is connected to the API.</p>
<p>To do this, I&rsquo;m employing the same approach I&rsquo;m using to get a handle on pricing, and other questions I have around API operations, and creating a new APIs.json API property type, which I&rsquo;m going to call <span style="text-decoration: underline;">api-conversations</span>. Right now I&rsquo;m just going to include message entries for Github issues, but work to make as inclusive as I can, to include any possible channel. We&rsquo;ll see where I go with api-conversations, right now I&rsquo;m going to use it to manage the feedback loop within my own microservices stack, but then I&rsquo;m also going to apply to the API Stack, and see what it looks like when I try and aggregate the feedback loop around public APIs.</p>

<p>I've said it before, and I will say it again &mdash; <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">Excel and spreadsheets</a>&nbsp;will continue to be super critical for the growth of the API industry. There are an increasing number of solutions like <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark for deploying and managing APIs using spreadsheets</a>, something that will get easier over time, but so far I'm not seeing equal acknowledgment of the potential of Microsoft Excel as an API client.</p>
<p>The majority of the world's data is locked up in spreadsheets, and CSV files. Something I learned during my short time in Washington DC, is that the API community is going to have to court the legions of data stewards who spend their days in spreadsheets at the companies, and government agencies around the world, if we are going to be successful. The tooling for deploying APIs from spreadsheets has emerged, but we have a lot of work ahead to make them simpler and easier to use.</p>
<p>With the majority of the worlds data locked up in spreadsheets, this also means many of the business decision makers have their head in the spreadsheet on a daily basis, depending on the data, calculations, and visualizations that influence their daily decision-making. I&rsquo;m seeing only light efforts around delivering API driven services in the spreadsheet, something that is going to have to grow significantly before the API industry can reach the scale we would like.</p>
<p>I know that the spreadsheet does not excite API providers, and API integrators, but they are a comfortable tool for many of the business ranks, and if we are going to get them to buy into API economy, and play nicely, we are going to have to accommodate their world. When thinking of spreadsheets and APIs, don't just think delivering content and data to APIs, but also how APIs can deliver vital content and data back to spreadsheets users&mdash;acknowledging the ubiquitous tool can provide huge benefits as an API client, as well as data source.</p>

I was tweeting out my story "<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/going-beyond-excel-as-a-data-source-for-api-deployment-and-focusing-on-it-as-an-api-client/">Going Beyond Excel As A Data Source For API Deployment And Focusing On It As An API Client</a>&rdquo; today, and he tweeted me back his <a href="https://ecfs.link/search?q=12-83">slick usage of the ImportXML function to get Federal Communication Commission (FCC) Electronic Comment Filing System data into a Google Spreadsheet.</a></p>
<p>When you visit&nbsp;<a href="https://ecfs.link/search?q=12-83">ecfa.link</a>, and scroll to the bottom of the page you will see simple instructions on how to get the data into your Google Spreadsheet:</p>
<p><a href="https://ecfs.link/search?q=12-83"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ecfs-link-google-spreadsheet-importxml.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>This is what we need more of, something that should be default for all data APIs. There are some other RSS, JSON, and XML goodies on the page too, but that is another story. Providing a simple copy / paste option for taking API driven data and making available in Google Spreadsheets is what I'd consider fundamental building block, getting us towards what I talk about in my post. Spreadsheet users need a wealth of simple, copy and paste resources like this that they can tap, from both public, and private data sources.</p>
<p>You rock Alan! I think his approach to providing a copy / paste ImportXML standard should be standard for all data APIs. We can start simple, by building a library of simple data sources like cities, states, postal codes, but then graduate up to more advanced data sources, or even subscriptions to valuable, curated, premium data--the trick is going to be keeping it as dead simple as Alan made it.</p>
<p>I will have to think about adding the ImportXML copy / paste as a standard building block, along with RSS, XML, and JSON. It feeds nicely into my <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com">wider spreadsheet and API research</a> nicely. Thanks Alan for this story, keep up good work!</p>

<p>I use many types of APIs. Some are public APIs, operated by other people, and then there are the APIs I have designed, operate, and consume on my own. As I design, redesign, deploy, and manage my APIs, I'm in a fortunate place that I get to push the boundaries of API operations, without much of the friction of normal API platforms. I'm the only one providing and consuming many of my APIs, essentially running an API dictatorship.</p>
<p>Over time I have built quite a few APIs that are still up, active, but nobody is using them. I have built them during some specific research, or to support a prototype, which once I was done with core work, I do not need the API to actually be alive and running. At some point in the future when I revisit the research, I may want to fire back up the APIs, but for now its ok if they are down, with a dormant Docker image, and server-side code living within its requisite Github repo.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how I&rsquo;m building APIs that could possibly go away at anytime. It is an area that, as I think about more, the more use cases I come up with. It is helping me rethink some of my architecture, and workflow. Another potential approach I am contemplating involves having a single UI that may use one or many APIs, but those APIs aren't even live until I load the screen&mdash;which triggers the containerized deployment of the last known snapshot of each of the dependent microservices.</p>
<p>If nothing else I&rsquo;m having fun. I&rsquo;m not sure if all these scenarios are viable in the real world, but it makes for an interesting exercise, and provides me with a kind of fire drill approach to my workflow that lets me rethink my APIs, and the workflow around them, with each drill. For me, it shines a whole new light on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever-wait-nothey-can-go-away-at-any-time/">the old APIs can go away at any time, no wait you have to support them forever argument</a>. Docker and containerized deployment of my APIs are really warping how I see the services I depend on&mdash;fun, fun!</p>

<p>I was listening the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/apisuncensored">APIsâUncensored podcast last weekend</a>, where Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>), and Lorinda Brandon (<a href="/admin/blog/lindybrandon">@lindybrandon</a>) sat down for a conversation with Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>), the creator of API definition format Swagger. There are a lot of interesting API informational nuggets throughout the podcast, some of which I'll be writing about, but this one is about something Tony mentioned&mdash;called <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#vendorExtensions">Swagger vendor extensions</a>.</p>
<p>I've been using Swagger for a while, and specifically Swagger 2.0 since its release, and Swagger vendor extensions was new thing to me&mdash;most likly user error. I don't ever sweat things I miss, because I consume so much information each day, things are bound to get past me. Anyways, Swagger vendor extensions are simply the ability to add any property to an API definition by using the &ldquo;x-&ldquo; prefix&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is something we do with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as well, and is something that I think becomes the R&amp;D layer for any specification. Since I just learned about this ability, I do not have many examples of what has been done with these extensions.<a href="https://blog.apigee.com/detail/tutorial_using_apigee_127_to_build_apis_in_nodejs_swagger_20"> I found a post from Apigee</a> demonstrating how you can add "capabilities such as caching, quota, OAuth, and analytics to your API with Swagger vendor extensions via a <a href="https://github.com/apigee-127/volos)">project we call Volos.js</a>&rdquo;, and I came across <a href="http://rest.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/v1/?spec">Wikimedia using a "x-subspecs&rdquo; in the API definition for Wikipedia</a>&mdash;now that I&rsquo;m tracking on Swagger vendor extensions I will look for them in Swagger specs I come across.</p>
<p>I've come across blog posts about Swagger, where people outline how they don&rsquo;t use it because they can&rsquo;t define something they want. Maybe they just didn't know about Swagger vendor extensions like me, IDK. Regardless I will be tracking on how people are extending Swagger using the vendor extensions, and begin brainstorming some of my own ideas on how they can be used to craft exactly the API definition you need.</p>

<p>I am revisiting some work that I started when I was working in Washington DC as a Presidential Innovation Fellow(PIF). Actually there are several things going on here, a sort of perfect storm of API design thoughts. After reviewing hundreds of APIs, including APIs in the federal government, you start to want to either go mad, or start making changes to the API designs you are exposed to.</p>
<p>This leads me to the other layer to this story, a common question I get regularly, regarding <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/02/using-machine-readable-api-definitions-to-solve-a-persistent-question-are-there-any-write-apis-in-federal-government/">whether or not there are any write APIs in the federal government</a>&mdash;meaning, can you POST, or PUT to a common government resources. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/25/a-rare-beast-in-government-the-write-api/">Write APIs are important in government</a>, and their scarcity reflect some of the systemic illnesses I feel exists in government IT. With that in mind, bundled with the regular process of reviewing an API implementation out of government&mdash;you get this late night API Evangelist story. Enjoy. ;-)</p>
<p>I was profiling the <a href="https://data.usajobs.gov/Rest">data.usajobs.gov jobs API</a>, which included crafting a machine readable Swagger API definition:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7bccc3d914aae35003a0.js"></script>
<p>After crafting this machine readable definition of the surface area of data.usajobs.gov, I am once again reminded of the lack of write APIs in government--as the data.usajobs.gov API is GET only, which only provides a single search endpoint. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I am thankful for the work they&rsquo;ve done with the data.usajobs.gov jobs API, it is just my nature to study, then push and iterate on API designs anywhere I possibly can. Sorry, I have an addiction. ;-(</p>
<p>As I was profiling data.usajobs.gov, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/25/github-can-be-the-post-and-put-layer-for-federal-government-apis/">I remembered of the work I did as a PIF in DC, and how after the government shutdown, I wanted to see more APIs, have an augmented layer to their operations</a>&mdash;eliminating the ability to turn off the switch for government APIs. Meaning I would like read only APIs like data.usajobs.gov to have one or many other APIs that sync, and augment API functionality, beyond what the original government agency intended. It may sound radical, but I think it is how we are going to get this stuff done.</p>
<p>To help understand what I&rsquo;m talking about, I generated a basic evolution of the data.usajobs.gov jobs API design, allowing for potential POST, PUT, and DELETE capabilities, opening up the federal jobs API for community input:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/b5100f01f293cad858ea.js"></script>
<p>Of course, this API isn&rsquo;t a real API--It is just a Swagger representation of one possible API that could exist to augment the read only API provided by data.usajobs.gov. My goal is to just think through how we might be able to help iterate on existing API resources being provided by government agencies. Allowing for extending, building upon, and potentially crowdsourced assistance in the management public data. I&rsquo;m not saying this should be a fully open API, available to anyone, but the idea of a well managed, or possibly multiple well managed resources for the same public data is an interesting thought.</p>
<p>This approach would allow for the evolution of public data, beyond what the government can do on its own. External entities could build upon government data, like the jobs data from data.usajobs.gov, and then data.usajobs.gov could decide if any 3rd party resources becomes worthy of paying attention to. I&rsquo;m thinking about applying this type of model in other areas of government I am working through like with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/15/free-application-for-federal-student-aid-fafsa-api/">FAFSA API</a>, and some of the API efforts I&rsquo;m seeing out of Department of Interior and Department of Energy.</p>
<p>In the end this post is primarily about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/17/beyondget-or-otherverbs-an-augmented-api-platform-/">potential in augmenting existing read only APIs, with an external POST, PUT, and DELETE</a>. I&rsquo;m not saying the data.usajobs.gov jobs API needs this, it just happen to be the API I was profiling when this story came up, and it seemed as good of an API as any to leverage as part of this story.</p>
<p>Not much else will happen for me on this topic. I am not going to develop this API. <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">I just wanted to add the data.usajobs.gov job API to my federal API stack,</a> and along the way I got sidetracked with adding the POST, PUT, and DELETE layer of this story--damn ADD! ;-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find a couple of other federal government data sources to possibly push this idea forward, and eventually I&rsquo;d like to see a single API, developed on top of a government resources, surpass its original source in quality, and value, resulting in the original agency accepting the data back into their interanal systems. When it comes to data stewardship, open data, and APIs in government it is all about trust&mdash;without trust, any external, outside-in effort around open data and APis in the federal government, will be rejected.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/10/frontline-systems-rason-modeling-language-and-rest-api-make-advanced-analytics-easy-in-web-and-mobile-applications/">an interesting piece of technology today while doing new curation for API.Report</a>. <a href="https://rason.com/">RASON</a>,&nbsp;an interesting approach to API driven analytics and potential UI and visualization, that kind of resembles what I have been envisioning for one possible future. The analytics tool is created by a company called Frontline Systems, and I&rsquo;ll let them articulate what it is:</p>
<blockquote><em>RASON&trade; software is designed to make it much easier to create, test and deploy analytic models that use optimization, simulation, and data mining. RASON stands for Restful Analytic Solver&trade; Object Notation.</em></blockquote>
<p>RASON targets analytical professionals, excel power users, and web app developers, but here is where it gets over my head, "Problems you can solve with the RASON service include linear programming and mixed-integer programming problems, quadratic programming and second-order cone problems, nonlinear and global optimization problems, problems requiring genetic algorithm and tabu search methods -- from small to very large." &mdash; sounds impressive to me!</p>
<p>I signed up and played with RASON a little bit, but it wasn't as intuitive as I hoped. I think I have a little more to learn about RASON. <a href="https://rason.com/Home/About#rason_models">The RASON models are very cool, I like the airport hub</a>, I just don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge to make it work right now, however I&rsquo;m digging the idea, and it reflects what I&rsquo;ve been seeing in my head when it comes to defining <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com">API driven analysis</a>--when you connecting that with <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com">API generated visualizations</a>, <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a>, <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com">spreadsheets</a>, <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a>, and more&mdash;I start to get a little too excited.</p>
<p>Anyhoo. Just sharing a new technology that I found. Once I learn more about RASON, hopefully I will be able to see where RASON fits into the bigger API life-cycle, and share a little more.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/alps-io-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was watching an <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/api-craft/mSFq__019ik">open thread around ALPS over at API Craft</a>, something that is on my working list to better understand, apply more in my world, and tell the story all along the way. ALPS author, and API visionary (;-) Mike Amundsen (<a href="/admin/blog/mamund">@mamund</a>) responded to the thread with a nice overview, which I wantd to repost and share with you.</p>
<p>So, what is <a href="http://alps.io/">ALPS</a>?</p>
<ul>
<li>ALPS is not a runtime format like HTML or HAL</li>
<li>ALPS is not a designtime format like RAML or Swagger</li>
</ul>
<p>ALPS is a Profile format for describing the bounded context of a service.  ALPS can be used as source material for designtime formats like RAML, WADL, Swagger, WSDL, etc. on the server side.</p>
<p>ALPS can also be used as source material for client-side frameworks like Ember.js, Angular, etc on the client side.</p>
<p>ALPS describes the operations (actions) and data elements of a service. that's all. that description is the same no matter the designtime tooling, protocol, or message format used. that description is the same whether you are implementing code on the client-side or server-side.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Hence state is maintained SERVER SIDE by mapping the URL's when it is implemented... correct?"</em></blockquote>
<p>ALPS has nothing to say about how or where state is maintained. You can do whatever you wish when you implement the bounded context ALPS describes.</p>
<p>ALPS tells you the WHAT of the service, not the HOW.</p>
<p>For example, you can use the ALPS document to implement a services that employs your API Chaining on the server side. Or you can use the same ALPS document to implement a classic hypermedia-driven service using Cj or some other hypermedia-rich format. You can also use the same ALPS document to implement a simple JSON-object CRUD-style service.</p>
<p>When you use ALPS as the "shared bounded context" you can be confident that each of the services, regardless of their local implementation choices are supporting the same bounded context. this is especially handy when you want to provide the same operations using different implementations (e.g. JSON-object CRUD for mobile, HTML for browser, etc.).</p>

<p>There are lots of good visualization stories recently, or maybe I&rsquo;m more focused on API driven visualizations. Who knows? This particular post is an API story because <a href="https://www.moh.io/mohiomap/welcome.php">Mohiomap</a>, the company at the center is using APIs to accomplish their &ldquo;vision&rdquo;, not because they have an API&mdash;which actually would be a nice way to pay it forward, but that is another story. Regardless, I think what <a href="https://www.moh.io/mohiomap/welcome.php">Mohiomap</a> is up to, is interesting on a lot of levels, bur primarily because in coming years we need to be able to better understand this new, cloud-based world we are  creating for ourselves.</p>
<p>Why am I blogging about this? Because Mohiomap is driven with APIs, and if done right, it can make a big difference in how we see our virtual selves, whether the business or brand personas we are crafting online, or our personal self that is spread across Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, and other API driven platforms. We currently can easily see our personas within each silo, like Facebook profile, Twitter profile, or Github profile, but understanding ourselves across the places we frequent online is much more difficult&mdash;something only possible when you begin using APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a visualization research project on my radar for some time now, but I think its time that I start publishing it for everyone to enjoy. API driven visualization is an important layer to my overall API economy research, and whether its for the meta layer of APIs, or for the valuable resources they are serving up, like wall posts, messages, photos, videos, or business documents--visualizations will continue to drive how we evolve our understanding of the digital world that is unfolding at a breakneck speed.</p>
<p>With the addition of Mohiomap, I&rsquo;m starting to develop quite a list of API driven visualization services and tooling. Enough to warrant its own research area, and be given a certain amount of attention each week. Ultimately it will depend on what the community delivers, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that visualizations will dominate the stories here on API Evangelist for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>As I look through more APIs, and I don&rsquo;t just play around in their developer portal, and look at documentation, I am actually get my hands dirty generating Swagger definitions, and authenticating and making calls to an API. There is no better way to get to know an API, that generating a Swagger definition, and integrating with it&mdash;something when done, you always walk away with a new perspective.</p>
<p>Once I get more of the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">APIs profiled in my API Stack</a>, I&rsquo;m going to see if I can configure my API editor to let me iterate on other people&rsquo;s API designs a little bit. As an API consumer, you don&rsquo;t always get a voice in the design of the next version of an API, but with API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, you can actually make edits, and then share them back with a provider. Of course it is still up to a provider to decide on what they accept, but there is not better way to make suggestions than a machine readable API definition, that is ready to go.</p>
<p>When I get around to doing some housecleaning on these API designs I generated, and possibly make some design iterations, I&rsquo;ll focus on some of the smaller operations, leaving the bigger teams to do their own heavy lifting. Also, my goal isn&rsquo;t just to iterate on API designs to help the original provider improve on their design, my goal is to iterative and improve on the API designs in my stack. The more designs I play with, more designs I have in my library, and the more I get a feel for what I think API designs could, or should look like.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t fix all the APIs in the world, but I can improve on the hard work that has already occurred, and who knows, maybe some providers will see it for the compliment that it is, and listen to some of my API designing that is occurring out loud.</p>

<p>While processing the news today over at <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, I came across a <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/10/broadcom-open-switch-apis-drive-innovation-in-network-infrastructure/">story about Broadcom delivering an API for managing their latest network infrastructure</a>. The intersection of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Application Programming Interface (API) is something I&rsquo;m paying closer attention to lately. Hmmm. SDN + API = Brand New Bullshit Acronym? Meh. Onward, I just can&rsquo;t slow down to care--{"packet keep moving"}.</p>
<p>At the networking level, I&rsquo;m hearing <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/">Broadcom</a> making a classic API infrastructure argument, "With the OpenNSL software platform, Broadcom is publishing APIs that map Broadcom's Software Development Kit (SDK) to an open north bound interface, enabling the integration of new applications and the ability to optimize switch hardware platforms.&rdquo;, with examples of what you could build including "network monitoring, load balancing, service chaining, workload optimization and traffic engineering."</p>
<p>This new API driven approach to networking is available in the Broadcom Tomahawk and Trident II switches, looking to build up a developer community who can help deliver networking solutions, with Broadcom interested in giving, "users the freedom to control their technology, share their designs and boost application innovation.&rdquo; Everything Broadcom is up to is in alignment with other valid Internet of Things (IoT) efforts I&rsquo;m seeing across not just the networking arena, but almost any other physical object being connected to the Internet in 2015.</p>
<p>I think what Broadcom is doing, is very forward leaning effort, and providing native API support at the device level is definitely how you support &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; around your networking infrastructure. To keep in sync with the leading edge of the current API evolution as I'm seeing it, I would also recommend adding virtualized container support at the device level. As a developer I am thankful for the APIs that you are exposing, allowing me to develop custom solutions using your hardware, but I need you to take it one level further--I need to be able to deploy my own APIs using Docker, as well as working with your APIs, all running on your infrastructure.</p>
<p>I need your devices to support not just the web and mobile apps I will build around your around your hardware, and the API surface area you are providing with the new Tomahawk and Trident II switches, I need to also plugin my own microservice stack, and the microservices that vendors will be delivering to me. I need the next generation of switches to be API driven, but I also need to guarantee it is exactly the stack I need to achieve my networking objectives.</p>
<p>That concludes my intrusion into your road-map. I appreciate you even entertaining my ideas. I cannot share much more details on what I intend to do with your new SDN &amp; API driven goodness, but if you work with me to let me innovate on your virtual and physical API stack&mdash;I feel that you will be surprised with what what the overall community around your hardware will deliver.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-changelog-eye-icon.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm a big fan of private APIs, and all for keeping API access tailored to meaningful groups of users vs. just opening up data to the public, without first thinking critically about the possible pros and cons. With that said, I always encourage API providers to seriously consider the outside-in effect, when APIs are designed to be as accessible as possible, allowing unintended things to occur around your API resources.</p>
<p>It isn't just about the developers who are directly working with your API, it is also the entire API industry, and service providers that serve it. A number of companies exist across the API space, providing valuable products, services, and tooling that is derived from one or many API platforms. The API space is big enough now, it isn't just about the handful of strongest players, it is about the entire community.</p>
<p>An example of this is with <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API ChangeLog</a>, a monitoring service for API documentation. The API ChangeLog keeps an eye on 68 of the leading APIs, and tracks on whether or not they have updated their API documentation, and keeps developers informed of the changes. These types of services benefit both API providers, and consumers, making for a healthier space overall. While some API provider are good at keeping developers in tune with documentation changes, not all of us are able keep up, and sometimes developers just aren't tuned in, and the API ChangeLog helps fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Without outside access to API resources (like your docs), services like API ChangeLog do not exist, leaving developers to fend for themselves, and not providing valuable industry data that can be used by anyone. Services like API ChangeLog will be the lifeblood of the API economy, and provide valuable exhaust that informs API driven markets as they grow, and help give these markets som e of the positive forces they are so well known for.</p>
<p>Keep your APIs, and much of their supporting building blocks as accessible as possible, and while you are at it, <a href="http://apisjson.org">make sure and index them using APIs.json</a>, helping services like <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API ChangeLog</a> provide vital data to developers, and the wider API economy.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/09/what-exactly-does-your-api-do/">What Exactly Does Your API Do?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dailymotion/Dailymotion-Developer-Area.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A short, concise, portable description of what your API does, is one of the most critical building blocks of API management, and is essential to reducing friction when new users are on-boarding with any API. It can be easy to design, and populate your API developer portal from a perspective that is very much in the know. I do it all the time, structuring your portal to reach the widest possible audience can be hard&mdash;it is why I&rsquo;m here! ;-)</p>
<p>Here is a great example of providing all the right elements, but leaving out the essential detail that new API consumers will need. View the <a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com/">Dailymotion developer area</a>, land on home page, and without clicking, tell me what Dailymotion does.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/dailymotion-dev-portal-screenshot.png" alt="" width="98%" align="right" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The portal has all the right moves, except it neglects to say anything about videos, or show a video picture. I guess you could argue that anyone landing here will probably be getting there via the main Dailymotion site, with the proper knowledge of what is going on. This is probably true, but there will always be people landing on the API developer portal page, without any clue of what Dailymotion does&mdash;do not make them click to find out.</p>
<p>This really isn&rsquo;t that big of a mistake, and something that only someone like me, who looks at numerous developer portals would think about. For Dailymotion, all they have to do is update the FMA area, put video in the title, short description, and maybe include as an image in the background. Boom, within seconds everyone understands the value offered by Dailymotion in 2 seconds or less.</p>
<p>The description you provide on your API portal landing page is your first impression, make it count. It is also likely, that the press, bloggers, and  other 3rd parties will copy / paste the description to describe what you do, on remote websites&mdash;so make it good!</p>

<p>This is the third week in a row I've managed to do this weekly report, something that took me about 9 hours of work, so I can see that the amount of work will vary pretty dramatically each week. Doesn't matter, I'm in for the long haul now, butI'm guessing Monday morning is going to be the common release date, as I start wrapping up on Saturday, but often can't do all the heavy lifting until Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>You don't often see me lead into a story with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">accounting</span></strong>, but Xero is pushing forward with their world domination plan, worthy of highlighting:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.xero.com/blog/2015/03/new-zealand-payroll/">Introducing New Zealand Payroll in Xero</a> - Xero is definitely the one to watch, with their expansion.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.xero.com/blog/2015/03/uk-payroll/">Introducing UK Payroll in Xero</a> - I think I will have to do an account API roundup, profile the strongest players, and get a better handle on this.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>There were a number of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>acquisitions</strong></span>, that were worth enough of showcasing this week:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://api.report/2015/03/06/ibm-acquires-alchemyapi-enhancing-watsons-deep-learning-capabilities/">IBM Acquires AlchemyAPI, Enhancing Watson's Deep Learning Capabilities</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/03/04/ibm-acquires-alchemyapi/">IBM Acquires AlchemyAPI</a> - IBM has been beating their API drum lately, and the Watson team has been a significant portion of this drumbeat--interesting to see them making API related acquisitions. I use AlchemyAPI, so this impacts me.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-powers-up-watson-with-alchemyapi-acquisition/">IBM powers up Watson with AlchemyAPI acquisition</a> - Mentioned already, but I always like to include one outside view in the conversation.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.docker.com/2015/03/socketplane-excited-to-be-joining-docker-to-collaborate-with-networking-ecosystem/">SocketPlane Excited to Be Joining Docker to Collaborate with Networking Ecosystem</a> - This is an interesting move by Docker. Networking related API and container related stories seem to be popping up more. Usually they are just SDN API stories, but this acquisition is an interesting sign of whats to come.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/03/03/box-buys-subspace-to-court-more-risk-averse-clients/">Box buys small security startup to court more risk-averse clients</a> - Using security acquisitions to boost your street cred is a worthy investment in the current landscape. You can just do it, but buying a company to add to stack, sends a good message to your consumers.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OrgsyncBlog/~3/iLYd6GFA1Mg/orgsync_is_acquired_by_imodules">OrgSync Acquired by iModules Software</a> - An interesting education related acquisition. I will have to learn more about iModules, and keep an eye on what they are doing in the higher education constituent management API space.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2015/press-030215.html">Akamai Acquires Xerocole</a> - Like security, DNS related investments are wise. Especially if your doing things at Internet scale like Akamai.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/03/02/paypal-acquires-paydiant-puts-nfc-into-its-here-readers/">PayPal acquires Paydiant, puts NFC into its Here readers</a> - At some point I will have to connect the dots on all the payment space moves, lots of action. Almost too much to keep track of.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Advertising</strong></span> is not something usually here, but at the intersection of gaming, I'm a little more interested:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.amazon.com/post/TxRVIU79H0XNDZ/Get-Started-with-the-Amazon-Mobile-Ads-API-in-Your-iOS-App-or-Game">Get Started with the Amazon Mobile Ads API in Your iOS App or Game</a> - I will have to do more research on how big the mobile advertising space is, and see what portion of that is gaming. I'm not usually big on paying attention to advertising, but monetization for a vertical like gaming is interesting enough to track on.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I am working to pull together <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>analytics</strong></span> specific research project over the next week. It is one of those areas I'm carving off of data:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2015/03/lightning-components-analytics-api.html">Build Reporting Apps Using Lightning Components and the Salesforce Analytics API</a> - I'd like to see more stories about building dynamic reporting solutions from API providers. There is a lot of opportunity to build simple tools for end-users here.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/03/04/what-is-the-digital-analytics-program-dap/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=what-is-the-digital-analytics-program-dap">What is the Digital Analytics Program (DAP)?</a> - I got a sneak peek of this in action while i was working in Washington DC. I think this type of analytics in aggregate across government, institutions and other aspects of our public world makes sense. I'd like to see APIs that provide access to anyone looking to better understand how government operates (or doesn't).&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2015/03/02/google-launches-player-analytics-and-custom-native-ads-tools-for-gaming-developers/">Google launches Player Analytics and custom native ads tools for game developers</a> - More gaming news. At some point I'm going to start a gaming research site, as I see more API, and API adjacent stories in this space.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I am moving <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API definitions</span></strong> out of the API design realm, where I can showcase the benefits of machine readable formats:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.apigee.com/detail/apigee_product_highlight_video_smartdocs">Apigee Product Highlight Video: SmartDocs</a> - I thought was an introducing highlight of SmartDocs on the Apigee platform, or as I call them interactive docs. I like seeing how each of the API providers view the benefits of machine readable API definitions like Swagger--Apigee is definitely invested in Swagger.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are my thoughts on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API deployment</strong></span> for the week:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/07/we-need-an-open-library-of-the-most-common-utility-api-implementations">We Need An Open Library Of The Most Common Utility API Implementations &middot;</a> - This seems like a no brainer to me. Someone should step up and build a platform to house these, and figure out some way of generating revenue around this, in a way that you can offer the open source designs for free. Maybe premium services, or custom deployments could be enough to pay for it? It is another area that if someone doesn't step up I may start creating and publishing to a Github repo.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Some interesting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API design</strong></span> discussions this week, from the pragmatic, to the restafarian:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/making-sure-my-api-roundup-stories-are-machine-readable-by-designing-them-as-apisjson-collections/">Making Sure My API Roundup Stories Are Machine Readable By Designing Them As APIs.json Collections &middot;</a> - A look into how I'm using APIs.json to build collections of APIs. As I research specific areas of the industry, I am trying to create these machine readable definitions, that eventually can turn into something so much more.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/post-effyouthisistherighturl-restful-api-design/">POST /eff/you/this/is/the/right/url &ndash; RESTful API Design</a> - I love creative, pragmatic stories on API design. This one made me laugh, and definitely made me reflect on some of the whacky shit I do when it comes to API design, and you know, that is ok!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/dropbox-sparks-controversy-api-design-decision/analysis/2015/03/03">Dropbox Sparks Controversy With API Design Decision</a> - I really do not get all worked up about design decisions like this. Whatever. It is their choice, as long as they communicate it out effectively, it doesn't really change the game to much. I prefer to just showcase the decisions API designers make, and why, and let you decide the best path forward for you.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/my-api-design-research">My API Design Research</a> - Rewriting the home page for my API research, while I spend some time pondering what is the current state, and what might be next for my work in this area.&nbsp;</li>

Some really interesting concepts to weave into API design practice here.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps-01">Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS)</a> - Shit is getting real for ALPS. I keep meaning to add it to my wheelhouse of API design knowledge, but haven't had the time. Looks I better prioritize, as they are getting real with it.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://nordicapis.com/common-cases-when-using-soap-makes-sense/">Common Cases When Using SOAP Makes Sense</a> - It is ok to use SOAP, especially if you work with the enterprise, or take showers every day like I do! ;-)&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://evertpot.com/dropbox-post-api/">Dropbox starts using POST, and why this is poor API design.</a> - While I may not have an opinion directly about this, I do love hearing what everyone else has to say.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As usual, I'm leading the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API discovery</strong></span> conversation:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/07/a-breakdown-of-my-dream-apisjson-file/">A Breakdown Of My Dream APIs.json File &middot;</a> - It could happen! If I believe hard enough, or maybe work hard enough and create enough APIs.json for other people to reach the tipping point.&nbsp;</li>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-journey.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Tony Hirst (<a href="https://twitter.com/psychemedia">@psychemedia</a>) wrote an interesting story about what I would consider <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the API journey</span>, which he called, &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2015/03/09/whats-the-point-of-an-api/">What&rsquo;s The Point Of An API?</a>&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m the first to call bullshit on the term API, which is more storytelling magic than it ever was technical, for me. In my opinion, the point of an API is rarely ever the actual technical implementation&mdash;sorry devs. ;-( The point of the API is the journey, for the API provider, and the API consumer (both dev and end-user).</p>
<p>The point of the API is about the API provider reducing friction, when it comes to understanding, and put to work, valuable digital assets from data, content, to more programmatic, algorithmic elements like image filtering or video encoding, to more physical elements like a Nest thermostat, webcam access, or drone controls. An API does not automatically equal success, it take so much more than just launching an API to establish something that delivers value, and is sustainable--something that can be easier said than done, in todays volatile, digital environment.</p>
<p>The point of an API is about the API consumers having the freedom to discover, access, explore, and put to use valuable digital resources that they couldn&rsquo;t deliver on their own, in new and interesting ways. Developers need to be part of a feedback loop with API providers that helps iterate APIs, and evolve APIs towards being more experience based beyond their resource oriented roots, and integrate them in meaningful ways into the systems, apps, and devices end-users depend on the most.</p>
<p>The point of an API is about empowering the end-user with applications that deliver value, all while opening up as much of the backend, and the pipes that are delivering valuable API driven resources, giving end-users a voice throughout the supply chain, using open formats like oAuth&mdash;bringing much needed transparency to the process. This isn&rsquo;t just about tech, it is also about developing sustainable businesses built around applications that are truly deliver value, which along a way also protect the interests, security, and privacy of the end-user.</p>
<p>The API is not purely the technical elements, it is made up of the technical, business, and political building blocks, which includes the documentation, SDK, terms of service, pricing, and the many other essential aspects of API operations. APIs are definitely made up of the API projections into the users environment, and back-again, facilitating a real-time journey, that if done right, can benefit the API platform, developers who build upon it, and the end-users who ultimately define what the point of any API is.</p>

<p>I'm adding a new layer to my monitoring of the API space, what I consider to be the people layer of the API Evangelist network--the actual people who are executing on much of what I talk about, across my research, and storytelling. This is all born out of the network of people I already talk to regularly, to get the stories, and details for the research that I publish regularly.</p>
<p>I have been tracking on many of the doers of the space for a while, behind the scenes, and this is just about exposing a select handful of individuals who can help you with some of the areas I discuss in my research and storytelling.</p>
<p>Up until now, my research has been about showcasing:</p>
<ul>
<li>News </li>
<li>Companies </li>
<li>Tools </li>
</ul>
<p>All I&rsquo;m doing now is exposing some of the people who are doing interesting things as well, and are open to being contacted about their work, and discuss how you can potentially tap their expertise to help you achieve your API objectives. Over the next couple weeks, you will see me start listing individuals who are open to helping out in the core areas I research:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Design</li>
<li>API Deployment</li>
<li>API Management</li>
<li>API Discovery</li>
<li>API Integration</li>
<li>API Evangelism</li>
<li>API Monetization</li>
<li>API Security</li>
</ul>
<p>I already showcase companies in many of these areas, and track on the features, or building blocks employed to deliver products and services they offer, all I&rsquo;m going to do now is provide more information on individuals who can help execute in these areas as well. Along the way you will also find me showcasing specific companies and tooling as well--API Evangelist partners like 3Scale, WSO2, and Restlet, but also other products I&rsquo;m personally invested in like APIs.json, and the companies, and tools I use daily like Swagger, API Blueprint, APITools, API Science, and Runscope.</p>
<p>After five years of doing this, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/scaling-what-i-do-at-api-evangelist/">I&rsquo;m trying to understand what scale looks like for API Evangelist</a>. My objective is to keep funding my research, producing the short form (blog), and long form (guides, white papers, and blueprints), while keeping it all rooted in what the leading API providers, and ultimately the people behind them are doing on the ground. With this in mind, you will find more areas of my research, providing links to people actually doing these things in the field, and you will also hear more about the conversations I am having with these people as they execute their craft.</p>
<p>As always, if you, or your company is doing something interesting in these areas, let me know&mdash;if you are an individual looking to freelance in these ares, or build a consultancy delivering services in these areas, let me know. I can&rsquo;t guarantee I&rsquo;ll include you in my research, but if you are doing interesting things, you&rsquo;ll stand out, and I&rsquo;m sure I can find some way to showcase your work in a way that helps you, me, and the wider API space. Also, if you need help with a project in one of these areas, feel free to reach out, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to point you in the right direction.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1Gm0CmP"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you are an API developer, it is likely you have used <a href="http://bit.ly/1Gm0CmP">Postman</a>, the simple tool for building, testing, and documenting your APIs. I have <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop">Postman open as a Google Chrome App</a>, which allows me to make API calls as I&rsquo;m designing, developing, and integrating with the APIs across my world. Something which opens up the response and requests of API calls that I&rsquo;m making, giving me more insight into how things are actually working (or not).</p>
<p>One of the <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">key aspects of Postman, are the collections</a>, which:</p>
<blockquote><em>A collection lets you group individual requests together. These requests can be further organized into sub-collections/folders to completely mirror your API. Requests can also store variations and responses when saved in a collection. You can add metadata like name and description too so that all the information that a developer needs to use your API is available right where he(she) needs it. Collections are listed in the sidebar alphabetically. You can search through collection requests using the search form for quick access.</em></blockquote>
<p>To me, Postman Collections are <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> at the API transaction level. Allowing you to define a single unit of currency in the API economy, save, and organize them, and execute them at any point in your API lifecycle. Postman Collections measure not just an API transaction that happens, it is a measure of future transactions that can happen, complete with any relevant meta data that will be needed along the way.</p>
<p>Along with <a href="http://bitly.com/1tnYxV8">Swagger</a>, and <a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/1arUHCU">API Blueprint</a>, I&rsquo;m working to better understand how Postman Collections impact, and fuel the API lifecycle, including conversations with Abhinav Asthana (<a href="https://twitter.com/a85">@a85</a>), Founder and CEO of Postman, about their roadmap. Postman Collections are not just about defining, organizing, and executing your API calls in the Postman client as a solo API developer, they are also about collaborating with other key players involved throughout the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m setting up my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> as Postman Collections, to help me understand how I can use the format to improve my API own API workflows. My goal is to ensure Postman works seamless with all stops along my own API and micro service lifecycle, from design to evangelism, and is plug and play as a machine readable element of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.</p>

<p>I was profiling the <a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com">video sharing API Dailymotion</a> the other day, going through their developer area and profiling their API operations. One of the things I<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/my-ideal-profile-of-companies-who-are-doing-interesting-things-with-apis/"> do as part of the profiling of any company</a>, is checkout how they execute their support.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com/support">Dailymotion employs two very common building blocks for their platform support</a>, including an API specific Twitter handle, and good ol fashion email&mdash;both pretty proven approaches. However Dailymotion also employs a third aspect to thier API support, by recommending you head over to Stack Overflow for some community support.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> in this way is not that original, I see numerous API providers doing this, the part I found interesting was their reference to getting Dailymotion API support via Stack Overflow as, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"ask the stack!"</span> I like that, I think it reflects what Stack Overflow is to the API developer community, and was an elegant way to send API developers off your site, to get the support they need.</p>

<p>I was spending time profiling APIs late last night while putting back a couple of IPAs. Yes this is what I do on a Friday night, you have a problem with that? Anyways, I was crafting Swagger definitions for the <a href="http://developer.7digital.com/">7digital music APIs</a>, and the I came across <a href="http://developer.7digital.com/resources/api-docs/territories-api">their territories API</a>. "The Territories API serves data about countries that 7digital operates in, data about those counties, and a one or more languages with shop urls in each country&rdquo;, something that I could see being pretty useful to developers when building music apps on top of the platform.</p>
<p>There has been numerous APIs I&rsquo;ve developed in the past, where the need for some supporting, utility APIs, such as a list of states, zip codes, counties, or other resources was called for. Two layers to doing this: 1) Acknowledging the little things developers need goes a long way in building trust with them, letting them know you actually care, and get what they are facing 2) You want devs to achieve integration as quickly as possible, provide them with the little things that they will have to go hunt for, and possibly prevent them from achieving their objectives. &mdash; Reduce any friction possible!</p>
<p>I'd like to see an open source library of utility API design, complete with a variety of server side code, and data stores emerge, that help API providers deliver a more complete stacks of API resources. If you need a state / province API, or a language API, you could just grab one off the shelf and install it seamlessly into your API stack. This is just one of those little areas, that I think could be slowing the overall advancement of APis (just a wee bit), and with a little community effort, could really grease the wheels in API adoption, and fuel more meaningful integrations.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/07/a-breakdown-of-my-dream-apisjson-file/">A Breakdown Of My Dream APIs.json File</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm continuing my work, to help people understand what APIs.json is, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/three-ways-i-am-putting-apisjson-to-work/">varying ways that it can be put to use</a>.  My post the other week, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">breaking down Fitbits APIs.json file is a good example of where to get started</a>, and as a follow-up I wanted to help further set the bar for what a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">minimum viable APIs.json</a>&nbsp;looks like, and today, I am going in the other direction--toward my dream APis.json file.</p>
<p>APIs.json starts with a basic set of descriptions for who you are, the API provider. Each header of an APIs.json file gives you a handful of parameters for describing who you are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - your individual or company name, who is managing the APIs.json file.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of your company and / or the API collection you are building.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes yourself or your company</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe your API collection.</li>
<li><strong>created</strong> - the first date in which an APIs.json file was created.</li>
<li><strong>modified</strong> - the last date in which an APIs.json file created.</li>
<li><strong>url</strong> - The url of where the APIs.json lives, allowing your file to be portable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those seven parameters provide details on who you are, and what the API collection is all about. Remember an API collection doesn&rsquo;t always have to live under a specific company domain like Twilio.com, it could be a temporary or more permanent collection, that is part of specific project or application.</p>
<p>The next essential element of an APIs.json file, is the APIs collection, providing you the ability to describe one or many APIs as part of this collection. Similar to the parameters provided for the header, each API entry is allowed a handful of parameters that describe the API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - the name of the API.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of the value an API delivers.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes an API.</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe the API itself.</li>
<li><strong>humanURL</strong> - The url any human should visit to learn more about an API.</li>
<li><strong>baseURL</strong> - The base url any machine should follow to start using an API.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears-soft-round.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Each API should have at least this information, at a minimum. I could stay here, with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">minimum viable APIs.json definition</a>, but I encourage you to take one more step, and put the properties collection to use for each API. You can provide any other URL you want for an APIs properties, but I recommend starting with the basic properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TermsOfService</strong> - where do I find your terms of service page.</li>
<li><strong>StatusPage</strong> - where is the url of the status page, where I can get platform update.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - point me directly to where your pricing page is, so I can make a decision on price.</li>
<li><strong>Forums</strong> - where is the community forum located for a platform, even if this is Stack Overflow.</li>
<li><strong>AlertsTwitterHandle</strong> - what is the primary Twitter handle for the API itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are meant to satisfy the common needs of anyone learning about API operations, however they are just URLs meant for the human API consumer. In my dream APIs.json file, there will be a robust amount of machine readable properties available for each API, beginning with the two most important:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> &nbsp;- a machine readable JSON or YAML file describing your API surface area</li>
<li><strong>Blueprint</strong> - a machine readable markdown file describing your API surface area</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with providing machine readable definitions of the API surface area, establishing a central truth or fingerprint for any API interface, it is just as important to provide a machine readable license for the API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>InterfaceLicense</strong> - a machine readable pointer to the licensing for the API interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with making sure the interface of an API matches your application objectives, consumers need to understand the licensing restrictions, or the freedom that comes with deeply integrating an API resource into any system or app.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m talking about my dream APIs.json file, I&rsquo;m going to talk about two added property formats I&rsquo;m currently working on behind the scenes, adding to the stack of machine readable API definition formats..  These new areas, represent two areas I&rsquo;m working hard to define and understand, right after I hand-craft Swagger definitions for my APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com/">API Pricing</a></strong> - taking pricing to the next level and making it machine readable.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">API Questions</a> </strong>- answering the important questions I need to know about each API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you imagine if API pricing was machine readable by default? Think of the options for building in a broker or market layer within the index of API platforms, and API collections, or even via an IDE. These two definitions are in an <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">alpha stage</a>, but are based upon data I've been gathering behind the scenes, so a lot of thought has gone into settling on these buckets.</p>
<p>After that, I&rsquo;d say there are a handful custom properties I&rsquo;d like to see applied to each API indexed within an APIs.json:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>x-blog -</strong> where do I find your blog. (machine-readable below)</li>
<li><strong>x-blogrss - </strong>where can I just get an RSS of your blog stream.</li>
<li><strong>b-github -</strong> what is the primary Github account for the API.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-circuit-paths.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>That concludes my list of elements I&rsquo;d like to see available in my dream APIs.json file. You can see examples of this in action, with the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">700+ companies I've generated APIs.json files for, over at my API Stack Github repo</a>. There is a lot of work left to do, but this dream APIs.json file resembles a vision I have for the future of API discovery&mdash;which I see as the engine for the API economy.</p>
<p>My goal is to get there I need the most important aspects of API operations machine readable. We aren't there yet, but I can see it. Taste it. Imagine what we can do when you can program against:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surface Area (Swagger, Blueprint)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blog (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Status (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forum (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Twitter (Twitter API)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Github (Github API)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pricing (api-pricing)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Licensing (API Commons)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Questions (api-questions)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I have been staying in tune with the API space using RSS feeds, and the Twitter and Github APIs for a couple years. I&rsquo;m just now developing a deeper understanding of the overall API space through the generation of machine readable API definitions for popular APIs. I can&rsquo;t do much on the API licensing front beyond launching <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, but I am working to define pricing with my <a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com">api-pricing</a> definition work, and also trying to capture the vital meta-data I need about API operations using <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com">api-questions</a>.</p>
<p>This post ended up being longer than I anticipated, but it is helping me beter understand what some of the next steps are for not just APIs.json, but also my own monitoring of the space. My goal is to not just push forward the APIs.json definition, but push forward my understanding along the way. Who knows maybe I'll drag you along too! ;-)</p>
<p>Ok, back to work. I just needed to wrap up these two posts about APis.json that were lingering in my outgoing story and idea queue.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had a conversation with some folks who are building a wikipedia of API definitions the other day, looking to employ formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to make an open, authoritative directory of machine readable API designs&mdash;something I can get behind 100%. I can even contribute the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">700+ APIs.json files, and the 250+ Swagger files I have generated</a>&nbsp;as part of my research.</p>
<p>When I have discussions about APIs.json folks, I always find it helpful to summarize the vision we have for the API discovery format, and described it in a short, concise way. This time around I was able to clarify the vision, in a way I hadn&rsquo;t fully been able to articulate before. To help me remember what I said, I wanted to capture it here on the blog.Many people who have heard about APIs.json as a sitemap for your APIs, but in reality there are three distinct ways I'm putting APIs.json to work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Providing A Sitemap -</strong> This is the simplest approach to using API.json, is to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">create a simple index of the APIs that exist within a domain</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Defining API Collection -</strong> Defining a portable, machine readable collection of common, or disparate APIs, like I&rsquo;ve done with my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/making-sure-my-api-roundup-stories-are-machine-readable-by-designing-them-as-apisjson-collections/">SMS messaging API stack</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Establishing New Definitions - </strong>A place to define the next generation of API definitions that support Swagger, Blueprint, adding licensing layer with <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, or maybe pricing, and the ability to answer service related questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be easy to call APIs.json a sitemap for APIs, but it is much more. It has a lot of potential for defining API collections while also making them portable, and machine readable by default. Where I really get excited for the potential is when it comes to defining new definitions that can work in conjunction with existing definitions, like Swagger and API Blueprint.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to leave you thinking about when it comes to APIs.json, is that it is designed to map out the world of public APIs we have, and the even larger layers of private APIs that exist behind the firewall, and make sense of this mess we&rsquo;ve created. Then with a rough blueprint, we can all work to define some new definition formats that help us bridge where we are currently at, to the next step of where we should be.</p>
<p>In the near fture, I'm focused on educating API providers on how to use APIs.json as a sitemap, and help API evangelists, brokers, and tech bloggers understand the potential that arises when you define API collections using APIs.json. When it comes to establishing new definitions, I think this will take longer to play out. I&rsquo;m working to help folks understand the importance of licensing their API using API Commons, and I&rsquo;m also playing around with some alpha formats for identifying some of the common questions that arise around API operations, and how companies are monetizing their APIs, but there is a lot of work to be done before this bears fruit.</p>

<p>When I come across a new company, during the course of my monitoring and information gathering across the API space, I enter them into my company API. Once a company is in there, and I&rsquo;ve deemed it worthy enough for a closer look, I profile their operations.</p>
<p>For my own organization, and in the spirit of transparency and collaboration, I wanted to breakdown what I mean by profiling. First I start with the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - The official name for any company or project. APis aren&rsquo;t always clearly defined corporate entities.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A short, concise description of what a company does. You&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is.</li>
<li><strong>Logo</strong> - A clean, simple, medium resolution logo for company. Again, you&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I dive into the common URLs that I care about, that provide me with the best signals possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - The heartbeat of any company, and API operations. In my opinion, the blog is one of the most important aspects of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Blog RSS</strong> - A simple, machine readable blog stream &mdash; blown away by how many companies don&rsquo;t have.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active, engaged Twitter account, providing me easy access via the Twitter API.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - A complete, active Github user or organization, where I can access code, and other aspects of API operations via Github API.</li>
<li><strong>Crunchbase</strong> - A business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Crunchable API.</li>
<li><strong>Angelist</strong> - Similar to Crunchbase a business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Angelist API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I tackle the API, or APIs, and profile each API they have by gathering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - A clean, portable name that describes the API, but keeps context of company or organization running it.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A short, concise description of what an API does &mdash; this is another pain in the ass to find most of the time.</li>
<li><strong>BaseURL</strong> - The base url for API calls. The process of finding this, will often determine for me, whether or not an API is worth monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - Doing the deep dive on an API, and generating a machine readable definition of at least the API surface area, and include underlying data model, and authentication when I can.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I sweep through the rest of the API program looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management Building Blocks - </strong>Run through my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common API management building blocks</a>, and record if any are present.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication Building Blocks - </strong>Track what type of authentication is available for the API, including supporting building blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Definition -</strong> Profile how money is made around an API, even if their are indirect benefits when possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once done, I have everything I need to establish a robust profile of an API provider, and add them to my monitoring. To assist me in my profiling, I then generate an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a> for the company, providing a machine readable version of all the information I&rsquo;ve gathered in my profiling. This doesn&rsquo;t always happen all at once, the companies usually queue up, then I go through and do full profiles in controlled sprints.</p>
<p>As with all of my research, y<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">ou can find the resulting APIs.son files on Github</a>, and as my monitoring continues, I will aggregate more companies doing interesting things with APIs, and as I have the time I will generate full profiles for each one.</p>
<p>If there is a specific company you&rsquo;d like profiled, please let me know.</p>

<p><em>I am giving each of my primary API research sites a refresh, and first up is the home page of my&nbsp;<a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery research</a>. As I update each home page, I'm going to publish here on API Evangelist to help bring more awareness to each of the main areas I'm studying.</em></p>
<p>This is one of my API research sites, focused specifically on API discovery. My name is <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, and I am the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a>, working as hard as I can to understand the world of the Application Programming Interfaces, widely called an API. This network of API research projects all run on Github, and is my real-time workbench, which means there is a lot of finished work present, but occasionally you will also come across areas projects that are unfinished--you have stumbled in my API discovery research, you will find the main <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist site over here</a>, with other links to my work.</p>
<p>This site is where I publish news that I have read, stories I&rsquo;ve published, company I&rsquo;ve profiled, and valuable tools I&rsquo;m stumbled on across while researching API discovery. Finding APIs, and having your APIs found is a pretty significant pain point, and in the last ten years, little has been done to provide adequate solutions. API discovery is an area I've been monitoring, ultimately have been unsatisfied with what I've seen, I've take matters into my own hands, and created <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, a machine readable API discovery format, any API provider can use to describe their APIs.</p>
<p>There are several API management companies, including Apigee, Mashery, and Mashape who have put forth API discovery solutions, and while these offerings are valuable, I feel they lack the openness necessary to truly move the API space, and the API discovery conversation forward. APIs.json was created to help make sense of the API space, in partnership with 3Scale API management infrastructure, CEO Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>). Together we are working to define as much of the public APIs space as possible using APIs.json, and encourage the development of open tooling around the format, with the first major addition being an open source API search engine called, <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a></p>
<p>Next I am working with other providers like Socrata, WSO2, and others to develop additional tooling, to serve all levels of the API sector. I do not feel API discovery is something that simply happens via an <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">API directory like ProgrammableWeb</a>, or even via <a href="http://apis.io">API search engines like APIs.io</a>--in the future API discovery will also occur in the browser, via our IDEs, and seamlessly within modern clients. In 2015, you'll see many more APIs.json driven efforts to help alleviate API discovery pain, and we hope the format, and supporting open tooling will stimulate other complimentary, or even competing efforts. API discovery is long overdue for some investment by the community, helping us get past some of our PTSD of the SOA era--we can do it!</p>

I try to be as fair as I can when covering companies, individuals, and the tools they provide, but ultimately you will notice I have my favorites, and there are some areas I only touch on lightly, for a variety of personal reasons. I try to stay as neutral as I can when it comes to technological dogma, and company allegiance, but after almost five years, I have some pretty strong opinions, and can&rsquo;t help but try and steer, and influence things in my own unique way. ;-)</p>

<p>I was reviewing one of the many entries in my review queue of companies who are doing interesting things with APIs, and stumbled across the data visualization API&mdash;<a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">Lightning</a>. Their implementation grabs my attention on several fronts, but their focus on delivering their API within your own infrastructure via a Heroku button, is one of the most relevant aspects.</p>
<p>This approach reflects a seismic shift occurring in how we deploy APIs, and how we deploy architecture overall.  You need a <a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">data visualization API</a>, let me deploy my API into your cloud, or on-premise infrastructure using popular approaches to virtualization&mdash;developers do not need to go to the API, the API will now come to you, and live within your existing infrastructure stack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/a-wholesale-onpremise-version-of-my-api-for-sale/">wholesale APIs a lot lately,</a> showcasing the<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/a-peek-at-the-future-with-white-label-apis/"> white label approach by some API providers</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/blog/">exploring within the evolution of my own infrastructure</a>, and as more savvy API providers jump in on this opportunity, you&rsquo;ll see more stories emerge trying to understand the shift going on. <a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">Lightning</a> is accomplishing this with Heroku, and their embeddable button, but companies who embrace a containerized micro-service centered approach to API deployment, will have a wide open playing field for buying and selling of the wholesale API driven technology being deployed across the emerging API economy.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/05/api-evangelist-call-thursday-summary-for-march-5th-2015/">API Evangelist Call Thursday Summary For March 5th, 2015</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-headset.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I work to isolate all of my calls on Thursdays, leaving other days of the week to more asynchronous forms of communication, and deep dives into coding, research, and storytelling efforts. Last Thursday was interesting, but this weeks conversations has spurred me to summarize some of the conversations that occurred on this busy day. This isn't something I'll do every thursday, and not all conversations will make it in, but I figured it would help me process, as well as share some insight into the types of conversations I'm having being the scene.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the conversations I&rsquo;ve had today, anonymized to protect the lives of those involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Evangelist at Major Media Company </strong>- I usually dodge recruiter calls early on in the process, but this one got through because it came in as a referral from someone I knew. This was regarding a lead role at a major media company you all know, a position I&rsquo;m not interested in, but willing to help talk through what is next for companies who can&rsquo;t find the right person for the role of lead API Evangelist! </li>
<li><strong>Available API Deployment Resources -</strong> I&rsquo;ve had a lot of trouble finding competent resources for any stage of the API lifecycle, but when it comes to API deployment, it has been impossible to establish relationships development shops I can refer work to. I had a very promising conversation about scaling an existing team I&rsquo;ve work with to successfully deploy APIs at scale in the past, opening up the opportunities for a scalable resource I can tap for designing, developing, deploying, and even the ongoing management of API resources. #fingerscrossed</li>
<li><strong>Developing a Wikipedia for API Definitions -</strong> I&rsquo;m working hard to develop a public catalog of open API designs via <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> and the <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> using the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a> format, and I had an interesting conversation with a group that is working on the "Wikipedia for APIs", using machine readable formats like Swagger, and APIs.son. We'll see where this goes, but I&rsquo;m excited about the number of conversations I&rsquo;m having in the area of API discovery, and design. </li>
<li><strong>Containerized Micro-Service Orchestration - </strong>I've been immersed in my own version of micro-service orchestration, using Docker, but today I got a look into other approaches, helping me better understand the bigger picture, and how I can apply existing practices, and tooling to better orchestrate this new world I&rsquo;m creating. </li>
<li><strong>An APIs and IPAs Podcast -</strong> Three of my favorite letters, rearranged into a single podcast conversation. <a href="http://readme.io">Readme.io</a> has asked me to participate in a beer fueled conversation about the API space. Talk about being privileged, I couldn't think of a better career where I get to talk about publicly, what I do for a living, while drinking the best quality beer possible. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done the APIs and IPAs podcast yet, that is up next&mdash;so I need to get ready. I'll have to consider more about how my Thursday conversations compare with the other, asynchronous conversations I&rsquo;m having through the week. At first glance, they seem very similar, but as I continue to get into the groove having my phone conversations only on Thursdays, and do these summaries&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;ll begin to see other patterns emerge.</p>
<p>Anyway you look at it, being in the center of the API economy is pretty exciting in 2015. I thought the buzz in 2010 was significant, but I had no idea of what it would be like in 2015. Lots going on, lots of important technological shifts, and lots of important industries, and companies turning their focus to the world of APIs. Sometimes it can make my head swim, but at the end of the day I&rsquo;m stoked to be where I am, as all of this moves forward--no matter how fast.</p>

<p>This site is where I publish news that I have read, stories I&rsquo;ve published, company I&rsquo;ve profiled, and valuable tools I&rsquo;m stumbled on across while researching API design space. I&rsquo;m in the middle of carving off a couple individual projects from this API design research including <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/">hypermedia</a>, and a soon API definition specific projects. As with my other research projects, there can be a great deal of overlap with other projects, when it comes to defining exactly what is API design. This research isn&rsquo;t about being complete, or finished, it is about maintaining a liquid understanding of what API design is, and be as comprehensive as a one man operation can be.</p>
<p>I execute on my API research by focusing in on specific areas like API design, getting to work understanding who the key actors are, which may include individual personalities, or corporate, government, or institutional entities. I profile each actor, and establish monitoring streams using Github, Twitter, RSS, Stack Exchange, and any other relevant channels. Throughout my monitoring I keep an eye out for interesting articles, white papers, announcements, and tooling that contribute to, and expands upon my definition of what is API design.</p>
<p>The more I research an area like API design, the more I&rsquo;m able to identify common building blocks, that make up the space. For API design, this can be as fundamental as API definitions, or as specific as publishing and sharing interactive documentation. My interpretation of these building blocks change over time, and sometimes I will link up these building blocks with other research projects, or spin off as independent projects, allowing me to dive even deeper&mdash;for example, Swagger began as a building block on API management, and is now its own research area entirely.</p>

<p>Making a list of valuable APIs has been a staple of my tech blogging for 10 years now, and as I work to find even more meaningful ways of defining the API space, I&rsquo;m pushing the envelope on how I do API roundup stories. Instead of just finding a handful of valuable APIs, and providing an HTML list of them, I'm going to use <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, to make sure all of my collections are machine readable by default.</p>
<p>For each API I profile, it is valuable to have a nice logo, name, short description, and a link to the developer portal. However I want to also make sure other valuable, machine readable resources are also present like Twitter, Github, and Blog RSS. This is just the start, I want each API to also have a machine readable API definition using Swagger and API Blueprint as well--all indexed using an APIs.json file.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using APIs.json in two ways, as an index for each API, as well as an index for the overall collection I&rsquo;m building--you will find the overall collection using the big {A} below, and each API has its own little {A}. To show you this in action, here is an <a href="http://sms.apievangelist.com/">SMS API collection</a> I've built:</p>

You can also programmatically evaluate, compare, and generate client-side code, documentation, testing, monitoring, and other essential elements using the machine readable Swagger definitions I&rsquo;ve included.</p>
<p>In the future, each time I post a roundup of APIs blog post, I will publish the list of APIs, using this APIs.json approach. There is a lot of work still to be done in, identifying, and indexing APIs in this format, as well as clarifying more detail about each API, like underlying data models, authentication, and pricing, but having a standard approach is a damn a good start.  This is the standard format I will be using for all my API Stack profiling--<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">you can find a complete list of APIs.json files, and Swagger definitions over on the Github repository for the work</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as I finish my API Blueprint tooling, I will also be providing each API in the API Blueprint format, as well as in Swagger, offering some variety, when it comes to understanding the surface area for each API. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/looking-beyond-the-number-of-apis-or-just-new-apis-and-working-harder-to-find-only-the-most-important-apis/">Instead of tracking on the number of APIs across the industry</a>, I&rsquo;m going to be tracking on the number of APIs that are fully defined, using APIs.json, providing full access to each API operations, as well as providing machine readable API definitions in Swagger and API Blueprint.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-building-blocks-design.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am adding four new building blocks, to my list of suggested <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that API providers should consider when crafting their API management strategy</a>. These four building blocks, are based upon several things I&rsquo;ve seen in the space, and how some current deficiencies I&rsquo;ve identified that could slow things, and hold us back.</p>
<p>These new building blocks are all about API providers practicing what they preach, and making the account for API consumers, and developers, programmatic through an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">API management API</span>. As I was profiling the <a href="http://dev.mailjet.com/email-api/v3/metadata/">Maijet API</a> as part of my <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">email API research</a>, I noticed <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">they had an API for their developer accounts</a>, and with the growth in the number of APIs being consumed, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">the need for account automation is only going to incease</a>, something that is only getting even more critical when you think about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/api-management-infrastructure-and-service-composition-is-key-to-orchestration-with-microservices-in-a-containerized-world/">API service composition overhead needed to support the containerization and micro-services movement.</a> To help stimulate this area, and encourage API providers to automate their API accounts, I&rsquo;m adding these four separate APIs building blocks, providing an overall blueprint for how API providers can launch a developer account API for their own API.</p>
<p>I used Mailjet&rsquo;s approach as a base model, but quickly began looking at <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">3Scale own API design</a>. 1) I use 3Scale, so I&rsquo;m familiar with their approach to user management 2) Their API was simple, robust, and clearly a proven approach that was working.  I broke 3Scale&rsquo;s own endpoints down into four logical groups for v1 of this API management API blueprint. There were a number of features they had, that I wanted in there, but figured it was better to start out simple, and meet most of the common needs I'm seeing from my own experiences.</p>
<p>Here is what I came up with, after taking a look at 3Scale&rsquo;s active docs.</p>
<p><strong>API Management API - User Management<br /></strong>Allow API API consumers to manage their own accounts via an API management API, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete information associated with their account--fields may vary, depending on what information each API requires for user accounts.</p>
<ul>
<li>User Create</li>
<li>User Read</li>
<li>User Update</li>
<li>User Delete</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Management API - Account Management</strong><br />Beyond the user profile, allow API consumers to manage the billing related account information, enable the programmatic adjustment of credit cards, and being able to check in on invoices, and payments through the API management API.</p>
<ul>
<li>Account Set Credit Card</li>
<li>Account Delete Credit Card</li>
<li>Invoice By Account</li>
<li>Invoice Line Item List</li>
<li>Invoice Payment Transaction List</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Management API - Service Management</strong><br />Enable API consumers to retrieve information about plans available for a specific API, or stack of APIs. Allow for listing of plans, and the features available for each plan. Also recommend considering the ability to set default plan for an account, enabling smooth application management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Service Plan List</li>
<li>Service Plan Feature List</li>
<li>Service Plan Set To Default</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Management API - Application Management</strong><br />Ideally each user can have multiple applications, consuming API resources at various rates. This allows for the most flexibility in API consumption, but may vary depending on what API management infrastructure employed. This API should allow for management of all applications, with secure control over application keys. Additionally, there should be analytics available, with a short, simple, but robust list of metrics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Application Plan List (per isolated service)</li>
<li>Application List</li>
<li>Application Create</li>
<li>Application Read</li>
<li>Application Update</li>
<li>Application Change Plan</li>
<li>Application Key List</li>
<li>Application Key Create</li>
<li>Application Key Delete</li>
<li>Application Usage by Metric</li>
</ul>
<p>This represents the v1 stack I&rsquo;d like to see every API provider offer, as well for my own portable stack of API management APIs. I don't just want my core APIs to have these features, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/making-my-3scale-api-management-portable-with-a-containerized-microservices/">I want every wholesale API I deploy in other companies infrastructure to be equipped with the same basic stack</a>. I can add in more features later, but I think this represents the minimum viable stack for automating API consumption at this point.</p>
<p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll build a docker image for deploying this API management infrastructure, alongside other APIs as a single virtual stack of loosely coupled micro-services, when bundled with the service composition 3Scale affords me, it will give me an unprecedented ability to orchestrate my API infrastructure.  Hopefully it can also provide a blueprint for others to use, and evolve beyond what I can do on my own.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/keranm"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/myob/keran-mckenzie-myob.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of finally meeting someone in person, that I feel like I&rsquo;ve known for years, while I was over in Australia, for <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days Sydney</a>&mdash;Keran McKenzie (<a href="https://twitter.com/keranm">@keranm</a>), API Evangelist for <a href="http://developer.myob.com/">MYOBapi</a>. I got to drink, and talk with Keran (finally), but more importantly I got to listen to him talk about his approach to evangelism at the accounting API.</p>
<p>I have given, and listened to more talks on evangelism and advocacy than I care to remember. I always work hard to make sure I sit and list to as many evangelism talks as I can&mdash;there is always something to learn. Keran's talk was informative, thorough, and most importantly it was genuine. Keran discussed many of the proven areas of evangelism we all share, but not in a robotic or corporate way, he shared his, and MYOB&rsquo;s philosophy, and told the honest story about the challenges and triumphs.</p>
<p>Keran gives an energetic talk, but it wasn&rsquo;t just the high energy that sold it for me, it was demonstrating that he actually gives a shit about how to do it right, admitting he doesn&rsquo;t know everything, or nails it in all categories, and he gives an honest, friendly, approachable, and genuine story of what is API evangelism at MYOB.</p>
<p>This approach to API evangelism is critical to success. You won&rsquo;t last long as an evangelist if you are full of shit, or the company behind you is, sorry&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been in this position too many times. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, every API evangelist role is difficult, and full of compromises, challenges, and things that are out of your control&mdash;even in my world. In the end, the only thing you can do is be honest, genuine, and as transparent as you can, and never be afraid to tell you story like Keran does.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/press-release.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time wading through press releases at the number of the dominate aggregate news outlets, looking for API news. I also have a number of scripts running, keeping an automated eye on the press sections for some of the companies I track on. The number of press releases available in corporate press areas vs. the number of press releases submitted by PR outlets, is much larger--which is a missed opportunity in my book.</p>
<p>Each day I look through PRWeb, PR Newswire, Business Wire and others trying to find the latest API stories. This is a process that will always be partially a manual process, as you just can&rsquo;t look for API news without getting petroleum, education, pharmaceutical, and other API news&mdash;which has nothing to with my beloved application programming interface. In short, these sites suck. Their UI is crap, and their search mechanisms are shit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest problem with these news outlets do not usually even have RSS, let alone an API, requiring me to go to each site, each day, and sift through the search results.  The world of press releases is like many other industries I engage with&mdash;needs a dead simple API driven solution. I want a press release API that allows any company to submit for free, but the problem is nobody will in the beginning, so it also needs to go out and find the direct corporate press sources as well, and scrape this long tail of the PR world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d pay a monthly fee to be able to search this vast PR database via an API, and be able to integrate directly into my API monitoring system. It is something I could build, but I just do not have time, and as I do with my other ideas, I am putting out there for someone else to do. The API would be a very simple design, but the legwork to make it truly a rich, and valuable source of press, would take a significant amount of time.</p>
<p>This is one of the ideas I hope someone does not do, thinking it is a VC level start-up idea. It really is something that a handful of folks could bootstrap, and do very well in monetizing premium services, but if you go get VC money you will probably fuck it all up, and have to chase some unnecessary approaches to making money. If someone doesn&rsquo;t do soon, I&rsquo;m going to have to build an API focused version, because I am spending about 1-2 hours a day on this each day.</p>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>As I did last week, I'm walking away with a better awareness of what is happening across the space. It isn't enough for me to read all of this API news in isolation, it helps to see it side by side with other news, allowing me to see and understand patterns that I may have missed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm just getting started exploring the ways to use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;when it comes organize my new Docker fueled, micro services stack. I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/use-apisjson-to-organize-my-swagger-defined-apis-running-in-docker-containers/">using APIs.son to describe each micro service</a>, as well as define the overall collection of almost 20 micro services. I&rsquo;m using the include collection, as a <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery/">navigation for the loosely coupled stack of micro-services</a>, and my friend <span>Chris Spiliotopoulos (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/chefarchitect">@chefarchitect</a><span>)</span>, has done some more work with <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed">his Swagger.ed</a>, delivering some <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> goodness that is in alignment with where I want to take all of this.</p>
<p>Adding to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">discovery and visualization work he did for Swagger</a>, Chris enabled Swagger.ed to look for valid APIs.son files as well, so when you browse to any APIs.son, like the one I have for my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master">micro services stack</a>, you see the little APIs.son search icon in the address bar.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/apis.json"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-json-in-browser.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>When you click on the APIs.son search icon in the address bar, you get a very cool visualization. Its pretty basic at the moment, just a visual catalog of the APIs available in the include collection of my stack, but when you connect up with the Swagger visualization work he's already done, we could have a pretty cool API catalog for managing and exploring microservices.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-catalog.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>I have almost 20 micro-services listed, and Swagger.ed gives me the ability to navigate it in a very interactive way.  Whats next? We don&rsquo;t know&hellip;it is about exploration, and finding out the most meaningful way of exploring the APIs I deploy and aggregate into APIs.son collections.</p>
<p>I can see having a visual catalog of all of my API design that I collect, then deploy, and evolve them as needed for various parts of my infrastructure or for my clients, into other sub-collections? Disconnected collections? Loosely coupled collections? Not sure how tight I want things, part of <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/how-much-api-surface-area-before-it-stops-being-micro/">the micro service definition for me</a> is the size of the network connecting the services, as well as the services theselves.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-question-mark.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/03/significance-of-the-we-the-people-api-being-first-modern-read--write-web-api-in-government/">A topic I've written about before</a>, and one that I answer regularly on forums, via email, and on Twitter is, &ldquo;Are there any write APIs in the federal government?&rdquo; It is a valid question, and as I said in my <a href="http://govfresh.com/2014/01/next-us-government-api-strategy/">strategy suggestions for the federal government,</a> write APIs are a critical aspect of all of this moving forward in a healthy way.</p>
<p>Rebecca Williams (<a href="https://twitter.com/internetrebecca">@internetrebecca</a>) pointed me to a <a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/4466/are-there-good-examples-of-open-read-write-apis-in-federal-government">recent discussion on this topic</a> earlier today, to which I added a couple of suggestions, but ultimately it is something I would like to see a more progressive solution emerge, something that can answer it real-time, and change as the API inventory in the federal government changes and evolves. Keeping a list, <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/write_apis-notes">like 18F is doing</a>, is a start, but we need more.</p>
<p>One of the side projects that I work on a couple of hours each week, is the profiling of federal government APIs using APIs.json, and Swagger, for use in my <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/stack.html">federal API stack</a>. I only have a handful of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">120+ APIs that I&rsquo;m profiling</a> completed, but once done, you will be able to search for APIs based upon whether or not an API uses the verbs GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE&mdash;giving you a much more detailed picture of how government APIs function.</p>
<p>Generating machine readable API definitions in Swagger and API Blueprint are time consuming, but once you tie it together using a discovery format like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, it opens up a lot more opportunity to answer questions about government APIs. I&rsquo;m doing a lot of the heavy lifting currently, to establish a critical mass of API definitions in federal government, then I am hoping that each agency will take ownership over maintaining their own definitions--if not, I think it can just as easily be done from the outside-in, by the community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for the potential, when all of the meta-layer of APIs and open data in government is rich, well defined, and machine readable by default. The continuing data.json work out of the government, and our own APIs.json format is looking to help with this over time. There is a lot of work ahead, as well as education to occur, before the meta data layer for government APIs is machine readable by default, but once it is, we&rsquo;ll be able to answer questions like this in a much more efficient way.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/heavybit-industries-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of attending a gathering at <a href="http://www.heavybit.com/">Heavybit Industries</a>&nbsp;last week, a community for developer-focused entrepreneurs, where one of the headlining speakers was Nike CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrissatchell">Chris Satchel</a>l. I wish I had taken better notes, but the one thing that stuck with me from his talk was his story about moving beyond their love affair with almost any software vendor that came along, and diligentlywork towards a micro-service oriented environment.</p>
<p>As the CTO, Satchell was working to clean up the message of legacy applications used across the enterprise, which was the result of years of, as he put it, saying yes to almost any software vendor that came along. Music to the ears of the San Francisco audience, he was now working to move the company out of a single data center, into the cloud, redefining operations as micro-services, and instituting a devops mindset along the way. They are a long way away from achieving their goal, but I found the change in their mindset about how they acquire software, was extremely relevant to all the API talk in 2015.</p>
<p>While i&rsquo;m sure there will still be plenty of opportunities for old school software vendors to hock their wares, I think this was a pretty clear sign of the API-centric approach that is changing not just how we develop and deploy software, but also how we buy software. If you are looking to sell software solutions to the enterprise in the future, you are going to need more than just yesterdays software, and a sales team&mdash;you are going to need the most agile, flexible, stack of micro-services possible, and let companies choose exactly the resources that they need.</p>

<p>This post has been open for almost two weeks now in Evernote. It began as a simple story about the possibility for generating code samples and libraries using Swagger. The longer it stays open, the wider the definition becomes, so I have to post something, just to draw a line in the sand. I&rsquo;m not talking about generating code that runs on the server, this post is all about everything on the API consumption side of things.</p>
<p>Shortly after Wordnik launched the machine readable API definition format&nbsp;<a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, they launched a <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">library for generating client side code samples in a variety of languages</a>. This was something that was evolved upon by <a href="http://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, with the launch of their API design platform, and introduction of <a href="http://bit.ly/1arUHCU">API Blueprint</a>. Even with these advances forward, there were still many shortcomings, and debate around what you could actually auto-generate on the client-side using a machine readable API definition continued. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many random Tweets I get from people saying, &ldquo;Oh is auto-generation of code cool again?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I thought you couldn&rsquo;t auto-generate client code or SDKs ;-)"</p>
<p>Amidst the debate about what is really possible, and the jokes about our SOA past, new players have emerged like <a href="http://bit.ly/1qnXcI0">Apimatic</a> that are looking to raise the bar when it comes to generation of not just simple code samples, libraries or stubs, but sophisticated API SDKs. I am sure the jokes about automating client code will still occurs, but there is no denying that the overall conversation is moving forward.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m exploring my own limitations of what is possible when generating client-side code with Swagger, I also come across new players like <a href="http://bit.ly/1DwAaXo">Lucybot</a>, who are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/24/driving-your-single-page-applications-and-api-cookbooks-using-api-definition-formats-like-swagger-and-api-blueprint/">moving the conversation forward with API cookbooks, and Single Page App (SPA) generated from Swagger definitions</a>. I&rsquo;m not in denial that there is a lot of work ahead, but in the two weeks that I&rsquo;ve been crafting this post, I&rsquo;d say I have gotten a glimpse of what is next. When you bundle the latest movements in virtualization and containerization, and using API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint to auto-generate client side code, I feel like the current potential is unlimited, and things are just heating up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">talking about the possibilities around wholesale APIs for a while now</a>, something that is only going to become more prevalent with the popularity of micro services and containers. I thought <a href="http://www.rechargkit.com/white-label-api">this company's approach to white label APIs</a> was pretty basic, but worth showcasing, providing a glimpse of what is possible when you are talking about B2B APIs.</p>
<p>Recharge kit provides 15 separate APIs for wholesale usage. I thought it was a telco stack of APIs when I first landed, but it is an interesting mix of telco, utility, travel, and more. I predict companies will emerge with a much more nuanced stacks of micro-services than Recharge Kit, but their approach shows some of the thinking occuring in the space.</p>
<p>As part of the Recharge Kit white label package you also get a handful of API management tools, ranging from user management, and advertising, to billing, and support. The overall presentation is not that professional, but a lot of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">essential API management building blocks</a> are present.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist network</a> is my open workbench, and I understand for many, it can be confusing to see some of my half-baked ideas alongside some of my more hardened API 101, business of APIs, and politics of APIs work. I try to keep the API Evangelist blog containing information for the API newbie, as well as my more advanced API leader crew--something that is tough to do.</p>
<p>I have a lot of ideas coming off the assembly line around my own infrastructure, Docker, microservices, and other more forward leaning areas. Normally I dump a lot of this mundane exhaust from my world over on <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, but that site gets picked up by DZone, due to historical connections, and that audience is pretty trollish, second only to Hacker News. I'm not looking to get into petty fights over choice I made around my own infrastructure.</p>
<p>To support my newer ideas, I launched&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">Alpha API Evangelist</a>, which will act as a kind of staging ground for many of the ideas you may eventually see here on API Evangelist. I do not want to alienate my just getting going audience, with rants about Docker and microservice orchestration, and I definitely do not want some of my unproven thoughts to getting taken out of context alongside some of my rants around important API topics in the business and politics of APIs.</p>
<p>I know some of you are like WTF, another blog, you are diluting your brand, blah blah. If you saw the API Evangelist Network like I do, as this open workshop for API research, and storytelling, you&rsquo;d understand. Anyhoo&hellip;.long story short&hellip;90% of the Docker, microservices, orchestration, Github API blah blah blah, is now over at <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">alpha.apievangelist.com</a>.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/lucybot/lucybot-full-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>During my monitoring of the API space this last week I had one of those rare discoveries, amongst thousands of misses, and around a hundred slightly interesting nuggets, a simple move forward called <a href="https://lucybot.com/">Lucybot</a> emerges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to walk you through what I experienced as I had the tab open in my Chrome browser for the last week, in Lucybot's own words:</p>
<blockquote><em>LucyBot is a tool for on-boarding new API developers, and is meant to be used alongside traditional API documentation such as Swagger and I/O Docs.</em></blockquote>
<p>I really like this sentence when they start talking about generating API cookbooks:</p>
<blockquote><em>LucyBot generates cross-language cookbooks for any REST API. Design step-by-step walk-throughs for any use case, and LucyBot will provide cross-language code snippets, which expand into a working, visually-rich demo.</em></blockquote>
<p>Now you are talking my language. Swagger on Github is a powerful combo:</p>
<blockquote><em>LucyBot can also push the code to GitHub, where users are free to build it out further, e.g. by pulling in data from their own servers or other APIs.</em></blockquote>
<p>Add some <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> to the mix, and now you have some serious API coverage. It can be difficult to understand the vision behind a new API driven start-up&mdash;I look at quite a few new companies. To help move the process forward, let&rsquo;s start with the basics of what is significant about Lucynbot&rsquo;s perspective n API. There are two things that stand out for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning About APIs - </strong>Lucybot takes an API definition like Swagger, and turns it into an interactive walk-through for on-boarding with an API. Think Swagger UI, but more interactive walk-through than interactive documentation--now add in a little Swagger driven <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> to help you authenticate, and navigate the request and response of each API. #Boom</li>
<li><strong>API Driven Clients -</strong> Lucybot isn't just generating interactive documentation or walk-throughs, they are generating a single page application (SPA). Another move forward in how we learn about valuable API driven resources, how we on-board them, and how we engage with them, all in a single, fluid, API definition driven motion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to admit, after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">exploring my thoughts around API visualization using Swagger from Chris,</a> and seeing what is possible in generating &ldquo;API Cookbooks&rdquo;, and Single Page Apps (SPA), with Lucybot, I&rsquo;m about to go into cardiac failure from the movement in the space over the last week. I&rsquo;m excited about what Lucybot brings to the table. I haven&rsquo;t even used their offering, but I can see the potential, and when you line up with the other movement in the API definition world around visualization, and the <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2015/02/17/Utilising-API-Blueprint-in-API-Clients/">addition of hypermedia using API Blueprint</a>, I can begin to see some of one possible future I&rsquo;ve been imagining for the API Economy.</p>
<p>I am excited to see what Lucybot can deliver when it comes to cookbooks and SPAs. If they can deliver on the vision they are bringing to the table, it could further move the overall client and integration side of the API conversation forward pretty significantly. I&rsquo;m seeing many of the important elements of delivering API and microservices coming together in 2015, and <a href="https://lucybot.com/">Lucybot</a> reflects this. Adding yet another bonus incentive for creating machine readable API definitions using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> to the API game.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/scaling-what-i-do-at-api-evangelist/">Scaling What I Do At API Evangelist</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-scale.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my day to day operations, I get regular calls from VC's (Venture Capitalists) looking to better understand APIs, the role they are playing within specific industries, working towards a better awareness of how they will impact their portfolio. These conversations almost always end with the question, <em>"what can I do for you?"</em>, something that always leads to the next question,<em> "what does scale look like for API Evangelist?"</em>. A verty interesting set of questions...</p>
<p>Interestingly, the answers to these questions are directly related to another common question I get from people in the space, <em>"how do you make money?"</em>. I'm fortunate. I get to scale API Evangelist exactly as I see fit, because I get to choose who I take money from. All money has strings attached, and I want to make sure these strings lead me in positive directions, and never hold me back, or force me to make decisions that would be negative for the API space. This is something that is much easier to do in 2015, than it was in 2010, when I first started API Evangelist.</p>
<p>This leads me to yet another question I get from people, <em>&ldquo;how do I do what you do?&rdquo;</em>. A question which I do not have a good answer for. Honestly I do not fully understand how I got here, and not sure folks can deal with being as broke as I&rsquo;ve been over the last five years, something that only recently has changed with the support of my partners, <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://ws02.com">WSO2</a>, and <a href="http://restlet.org">Restlet</a>. I did not set out to build API Evangelist using a single plan, I&rsquo;m making this shit up as I go along, and honestly I do not remember all the decisions I&rsquo;ve made over the last five years, resulting in my current position.</p>
<p>So why am I rambling on about this? Because it brings home what scale actually means to me at API Evangelist. There is no scaling API Evangelist in a Silicon Valley VC sense. It isn&rsquo;t something you can throw money at, come up with an algorithm, and grow. I&rsquo;m obsessed with the API space, and the potential (good &amp; bad) of APIs, which motivates me to read, hack, and tell stories that share my experiences&mdash;that is it. The only way to scale that is to incite others to embark on similar journeys, share the stories I&rsquo;m telling, fork my code and projects, and hopefully begin developing their own stories, and tools, so that I can depend on them, in the same way.</p>
<p>I get a lot of people who engage me daily, and most of them want something from me. Some of these folks are on their own true API journey, sometimes running parallel to mine, but often times they are not, or maybe they are for just a short period of time. I just wrote about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">being Swagger.ed Last Week, and Now I&rsquo;m Seeing Visualizations</a>, showcasing Swagger driven API visualization work by Chris Spiliotopoulos (<a href="https://twitter.com/chefArchitect">@chefArchitect</a>), who fits into this story, because he is what I envision when it comes to scaling API Evangelist.</p>
<p>Chris has been in the shadows, reading my work, listening to my ideas, and internalizing them in his own world, then he works to find something he can contribute that doesn&rsquo;t just augment my own ideas and work, but advances them forward, potentially delivering value for the entire API space. Chris doesn&rsquo;t need anything from me. He is looking to find his own way, and add value in a way that matches his own skills, wherever he can, in a way that amplifies the overall value generated. I wish I could explain this type of scaling to everyone, but hopefully the handful of folks who actually get what I am rambling about, will step in an help me scale the API Evangelist network over the next five years--thanks Chris!</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apiblueprint-swagger.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about this topic before, in an effort to understand the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">possible incentives for API providers to generate their own machine readable API definitions</a> in formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>. These machine readable definitions for APIs and microservices are important to have, but not everyone produces them by default for their APIs, and honestly nobody is going to create them until there are enough incentives to sweeten the pot.</p>
<p>It helps me to walk through this story again, understand the incentives for generating API definitions to date, in hopes of better understanding where we are going. Early on Wordnik developed <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, to generate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation -</strong> Making learning about an API, a hands-on experience, accelerating time to first API call.</li>
<li><strong>Generate Server-Side Code -</strong> Automatic generation of server side skeletons that take out much of the repetitive work of API deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Generate Client-Side Code -</strong> Automatic generation of client side code samples, and libraries, making API integration a much quicker process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a> came along and moved the needle back, making API definitions more about API design than just API management and integration, with the introduction of <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Design Editor -</strong> Apiary introduced the concept of API definitions and API design, with their introduction of their cloud-based API design tooling.</li>
<li><strong>Mock API Generation -</strong> API definitions aren&rsquo;t just for managing API deployment anymore, you can mock APIs, saving costly development cycles, early on in the life cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we are seeing other providers like <a href="https://apimatic.io/">Apimatic</a>, <a href="http://ardoq.com/">Ardoq</a>, and others step up to continue expanding what you can do with machine readable API definitions. I wanted to take a moment to brainstorm everything I am seeing, and would like to see emerge along the API life cycle, that could be driven by Swagger and API Blueprint API definitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SDK Generation -</strong> Going beyond auto-generation of simple samples and libraries, and generating full SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong> - Allowing the visualization of not just API metadata, but also the resources available within.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong> - Understanding more about what an API does, evaluating the interface, and resources available within.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Allowing the automatic deployment and scheduling of API tests, based upon the defined surface area.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Enable automatic generation and scheduling of API monitoring, based upon the defined surface area.</li>
<li><strong>Difference</strong> - Comparing two or more API definitions, and providing more insight into the differences present.</li>
<li><strong>Annotation</strong> - Opening up an annotation and communication layer around an APIs surface area, on any site or network.</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary</strong> - Helping organize, and bring coherence to the language involved with crafting an API surface, as well as existing APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Client Generation -</strong> Allowing the auto-generation of more sophisticated client, single page app, and other interfaces for API consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Search Discovery - </strong>Taking API discovery to the next level, allowing for searching across an APIs surface area, as well as other supporting building blocks, using formats like APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>Collection Discovery -</strong> Allowing for controlled API discovery in curated API collections, using formats like APIs.json to build collections. </li>
<li><strong>IDE Discovery -</strong> Introducing API discovery directly in the IDE, using cloud platforms like Codenvy to bring APIs to developers, instead of requiring developers to find the APIs they need.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time - </strong>Marry the real-time work occurring from providers like Firebase, PubNub, and Fanout with the API definition layer.</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocity -</strong> Expose the integration, interoperability, and automation layers like IFTTT and Zapier that we are depending on as machine readable API definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregation -</strong> Allow for the bridging, and daisy chaining of machine readable API definitions, aggregating many APIs into single, common, machine readable definitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a brain dump, of of possible ideas that could be developed and generated using machine readable API definitions. Some of it represents patterns I&rsquo;m already seeing, while some of it represents existing API driven areas, that haven&rsquo;t been touched by API definitions, but should be (aka opportunity). Swagger and API Blueprint provide a common language for communicating around the central truth that is the API definition, and the more tooling that is developed around these common language, the more incentives there are for API providers and consumers to use them.</p>
<p>I believe we are reaching a tipping point with the tooling that already exists. Interactive documentation, and client and server side code generation is already proving to be enough of an incentive for many, but if you bring in the API design benefits from platforms like Apiary and <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, the  search discovery benefit introduced by <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and <a href="http://apis.io">Apis.io</a>, the IDE discovery brought to the table by <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>, and visualization tools I&rsquo;m seeing from Ardok, and now Swagger.ed&mdash;things really look like they are tipping. Now I am looking to organize the current tools that are available, and better educate API providers and consumers that they exist, while also looking to stimulate the next wave of API lifecycle tooling that is driven by&nbsp;API definitions.</p>
<p>API Blueprint <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2015/02/17/Utilising-API-Blueprint-in-API-Clients/">recently took a big step forward by embracing hypermedia</a>, bringing actions into the API definition layer. In my opinion, all of this tooling is beginning to go beyond just the API meta layer, and permeating potentially every aspect of the API life cycle, and beginning to add more value to the data, content, and other digital resources being made available via APIs. The big picture benefits of API definitions are really coming into focus for me, but there is still so much work to be done, when it comes to properly defining the current API landscape, let alone keeping eye on what is just over the horizon.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ruler-2.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I constantly struggle to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/21/weekly-apireport-for-february-20th-2015/">stay in tune with the scope of the API space, and keep pace with its rapid expansion</a>. As part of this struggle,&nbsp;I am always on the hunt for new ways to shift the way I look at the space&mdash;as long as it helps me understand things better, while also contributing as much valuable, and open information back to the API space. The With this in mind, the API Evangelist monitoring algorithm is always in flux, with the latest change being the elimination of the <em>&ldquo;number of APIs&rdquo; </em>or <em>&ldquo;number of new APIs&rdquo;</em>, from the monitoring equation.</p>
<p>I have showcased the growth in public APIs for a long time now, and for a while, it was what I needed to motivate my research and storytelling, but after almost five years, these two data points are becoming a liability for me. As I go through the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies that are doing interesting things in the space</a>, and generate <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">APIs.json profiles, and machine readable API definitions using Swagger and API Blueprint</a>, I realize quantity or number of APIs has no bearing on my research, and it is just a distraction. Any number of APIs is meaningless if I cannot understand what these APIs do, their pricing, quality of service, terms of these services, and easily match with my own business objectives&mdash;elements I&rsquo;m working hard to define, and quantify in a machine readable way using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.</p>
<p>In the everyday reality of the API space, there is no reason for me care about how many APIs there are, a goal that comes bundled with the desire to chase new APIs, in support of this metric. Sure I want to be informed about new, and interesting APIs that come into the space, but chasing them in the support of some data point, that actually has no bearing on my research, is a waste of my time.  When you couple this with my struggles to keep up with &ldquo;dark APIs&rdquo;, the APIs that are driving mobile applications, and the dizzying number of private APIs that startups, up to the enterprise, are deploying&mdash;it is game over, I just don&rsquo;t think you can quantify it (or at least I&rsquo;m not the guy to do it).</p>
<p>To better help me understand these data points, I asked Jakub Nesetril (<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>) the CEO of <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>, where their numbers are&mdash;how many APIs are lit up on the <a href="http://apiary.io/">API design and collaboration platform</a>? He said, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>"It has crossed 130,000 APIs a couple weeks ago&rdquo;</em></span>. I&rsquo;m sure I can get similar counts from other API providers, but ultimately it doesn&rsquo;t do anything for me. what then? More APIs doesn&rsquo;t do API Evangelist any good. Being able to find the most valuable, and interesting APIs, is what I&rsquo;m looking for. I&rsquo;m driven to find stories of successful and interesting APIs, to evolve my API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">monetization</a>, and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a> strategy and storytelling&mdash;there are only so many APIs I can look at. I'm looking for the interesting conversations going on around the most important APIs, that platforms like Apiary are powering.</p>
<p>Until an API provider does something interesting, or someone does something interesting with an API, that API doesn&rsquo;t exist to me-there is no reason for me to chase any API, until it stands out in one of these ways. However, this is just my perspective, in relationship to my own goals. However, where it begins to apply more universally, and provides something that I think API consumers could walk away with, is that an API really doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, until it is actually being used.</p>
<p>I was talking with John Sheehan, the CEO of Runscope over the weekend, and the common question came up, &ldquo;<em>What are some of the interesting APIs you are seeing out there</em>&rdquo;? To which John replies, &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>None of them, until they are used in your app</em></span>&rdquo;! I think John&rsquo;s answer reflects this seismic shift for me in 2015, which is the year I stop counting and referencing the number APIs in the space, and chasing new APIs in support of this delusion and work harder to find, design, and share the most important API definitions that I possibly can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swaggerLogo360.png" alt="" width="120" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the side effects of being so open and transparent about my ideas, like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/someone-please-build-my-open-interactive-portable-and-visual-api-documentation-toolkit/">the one I had around API visualizations</a>, is that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/06/my-wish-has-been-granted-swagger-driven-api-visualizations-from-ardoq/">people who are doing similar things, like Ardoq</a>, eventually find you. Even better, is when someone closely follows your thoughts, and takes your ideas, and sets into motion, your original idea, in a way that will allow it to become bigger than the original idea.</p>
<p>Last week Chris Spiliotopoulos (<a href="https://twitter.com/chefarchitect">@chefarchitect</a>) sent me an email, with a <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed">simple Chrome extension</a> attached, asking what I thought. After installing the add-on (just drag onto your Chrome extension page), I visited <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">my notebook of Swagger defined APIs over at API Stack</a>, and when Twilio&rsquo;s Swagger definition loaded in the browser, I saw a little Swagger icon show up in my browsers address bar&mdash;you know kind of like when there is an RSS feed available.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger-ed/swagger-ed-address-bar.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>I click on the icon, and a new layer to my browser opens up, with a simple, crude, yet potentially powerful visualization of Twilio&rsquo;s API surface area.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger-ed/swagger-ed-visualization-1.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>Honestly, the visualization does little for sorting out the complexities of the API, but it demonstrates a possible future, where we can browse the Internet, stumble across APIs, and their machine readable definitions, and open up an entirely new, visual layer that helps us quantify, and make sense of what an API does. APIs are a very abstract concept, and helping developers understand the scope and value of an API can be difficult, the introduction of API definition driven visualizations go a long way in helping speed up the conversation.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to immediately understand the scope of a microservice. How big is micro? Can I see a tag cloud of parameters? Is there a visualization layer to explore the underling data model? Can you provide me with a visualization diff between two similar APIs, defined using Swagger or API Blueprint. I&rsquo;m just getting going on brainstorming ideas for visualizations, and so is Chris&mdash;a conversation that I think will be never-ending as we continue to work to understand the digital resources being deployed across the API landscape.</p>
<p>I have an alpha version of an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and Swagger editor, that I&rsquo;m using for the <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">redesign of my platform using microservices</a>, and don&rsquo;t just see the conversation Chris is started exclusively being about visualizing on the meta layer of APIs, but also directly connecting and exploring the valuable data, content, and other digital resources being made available via APIs. I also envision being able to explore collections of APIs defined using APIs.json, allowing not just software to navigate between many APIs, but also humans&mdash;something that is core to the APIs.json vision.</p>
<p>Swagger.ed is open source, and <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed">available in a Github repo</a>. It is just an initial prototype, but imagine what is possible when you can take a machine readable Swagger or API Blueprint file, and instantly explore the meta layer to any API, then also visually explore data returned, like the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/">FDA is doing with clinical drug trials</a>. If you have any visualizations you&rsquo;d like to see, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed/issues">submit as an issue</a> on Chris&rsquo;s work, or in the comments here. I would love to better understand how visualizations can better help you understand your own APIs, and the APIs that are littered across the online landscape, thta you depend on.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-modular.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have API tooling on the brain, a result of conversations on multiple fronts, and the evolution of my own thoughts on creating what I&rsquo;d see as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">the perfect API design tool</a>. My thoughts on API tooling, reflect my general API philosophy, and focus on developing small, meaningful tools that truly make an impact.</p>
<p>First, nobody likes being dependent on bloated software products. The age where software  looks like Microsoft Office in my opinion, is over, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to a brighter future.  I feel pretty strongly that we need small, simple tools, that work in concert, not via a single client I have to pay for 100% of features, to get just 2% of the features I actually need to get done, what I need.</p>
<p>One of my popular Github repositories is my <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/csv-converter/tree/gh-pages">CSV Converter</a>, which is just a reworking of <a href="https://github.com/shancarter/Mr-Data-Converter">Mr. Data Converter</a>, to which I added the ability to save XML, JSON, and CSV files directly to Github, making a completely client-side data management tool that runs 100% on Github pages. I like this idea developing small, stand-alone tooling for the API space, and is something you will see a lot more from me in coming months.</p>
<p>As I work to refine, and evolve my thoughts on the perfect API designer, I&rsquo;m engaged in several conversations, about what the tooling could look like to support this vision, and the consensus seems to be that the next generation of tooling has to reflect an API philosophy&mdash;simple, small, stand-alone tools that do one thing and do it well. Something you can see this in popular API tooling like <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a>, and <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>.</p>
<p>In recent times, I have been very adverse to developing any web or mobile client that someone else will depend on, stemming form PTSD developed by owning so much legacy code over my 25 year career. I'm happy to see that it isn&rsquo;t just me, and that there are so many other souls out there who are tired of legacy software bloat, and ultimately becoming slave to this, from both a provider, and end-user perspective.</p>
<p>The moral of this story (for me), is that any client I build from here forward will be simple, small, and add real value to my operations, or it will be tossed. This approach reflects the way I see APIs, and if a service, or its resulting clients are not delivering value, they shouldn&rsquo;t exist&mdash;something that isn&rsquo;t possible, if you don&rsquo;t have a modular, bite-size approach to developing your technology solutions. I'm fortunate...</p>

Throughout the program I couldn&rsquo;t help be reminded of a similar imbalance in the world of APIs. Throughout my API experience I&rsquo;m constantly faced with a separation between what I hear is possible, what I would like to see, and what actually occurs on the ground in startups, small businesses, and within enterprise organizations, and government agencies.</p>
<p>You might have to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/16/386758778/science-standards-draw-climate-change-debate-back-into-wyo-classrooms">listen to the segment</a>&nbsp;to fully grasp what I mean, but essentially it comes down to this: we&rsquo;d like a perfect world where we do not negatively impact the environment, and everyone understands the urgency, but in reality there are a lot of real world constraints that prevent us from truly realizing this vision. In the world of APIs, these same constraints exist. We&rsquo;d like to achieve API harmony in everything we do, but in reality there are a lot of real world constraints we have to navigate, from knowledge and education, to the time and resources needed to implement.</p>
<p>This chasm reflects the challenge in my API Evangelist mission. How do steer clear of selling people a single product, platform, or holistic vision of an API strategy, and break things into small, bite-size chunks of information that anyone can use (or not use) as they see fit, in the environments they operate within.  I don&rsquo;t believe there is a silver bullet, or single religion to follow here, it is all about staying in tune with what is working, and what is not&mdash;then making your own decisions about what is appropriate on the ground.</p>
<p>API Evangelist was born out of my success and failures working at SAP&mdash;which was all about striking a balance between what I knew was possible, what I wanted, and what was really possible in the environment I operated in. Alright, enough pontificating, and back to understanding all of this. I guess my point is, that this isn&rsquo;t just about understanding where are going, where we&rsquo;ve been or where we are currently&mdash;it is also about actually making meaningful connections that guide us, incrementally, in the right direction.</p>

<p>I have been inspired by my partner in crime Audrey Watter's (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) approach to her weekly news on <a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Hack Education</a>, and will be trying to revive the weekly ritual for API Evangelist, something that I'm going to call the <strong>Weekly API.Report</strong>. I work to try and post API related news on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>&nbsp;each day, but my new Weekly API.Report is looking to to capture my news curation for the week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've seen <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">agriculture</span></strong> related API efforts, but with two in one week, I may have to dive deeper:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.agri-data.net/getting-started-mobile-farm-management-software-agri-data-solution">I'm a Farmer. How Do I Get Started with Farm Management Software?</a> - API driven mobile continuing to target the farmer, and agricultural industry. If I see more IoT, and API related agricultural stories I may have to start a separate research project.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Analysis</strong></span> is an area, I'm going to shave off my larger data API pie, and try to make better sense of how APIs are used for analysis:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/parsing-complex-data-to-solve-simple-problems/">Parsing Complex Data to Solve &lsquo;Simple&rsquo; Problems</a> - Tracking on valuable data conversations coming out of the realtime space. This is a video.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The area of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API design</span></strong>, is one of the most important conversations going on right now:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lucybot.com/">LucyBot - Get your API's consumers moving faster</a> - LucyBot generates cross-language cookbooks for any REST API--that is cool. It looks like LucyBot is poised to do some significant evolution in the Swagger and Blueprint driven API client conversation.&nbsp;</li>

They are adding in a hypermedia layer, the first of the formats to do so. I am still working to understand, and will be covering more.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/blog/guide-rest-api-design">A Guide to REST &amp; API Design</a> - More API designknowledge from API leader Mike Amundsen.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I am always looking for innovative new ways to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>evangelise APIs</strong></span>:</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lucybot.com/">LucyBot - Get your API's consumers moving faster</a> - LucyBot generates cross-language cookbooks for any REST API--that is cool. It looks like LucyBot is poised to do some significant evolution in the Swagger and Blueprint driven API client conversation.</li>

<p>This first Weekly API.Report was about 8 hours worth of work for me, in addition to the regular API news curation I do each week. Next week should be easier, as I built some tools to help me. The hard work now is to prioritize the Weekly API.Report each week, providing a regular account of what I've curated.</p>
<p>This post has helped me better absorb what happened this week, something I hope I can achieve each week. I have this same data going back to 2013, as I've been doing the work each week, i just stopped publishing a weekly post when I went to work in Washington D.C. as a Presidential Innovation Fellow--I just got too busy.</p>
<p>Next up for me, is to generate a short summary, and do a companion email newsletter for the Weekly API.Report--stay tuned!</p>

<p>There is an interesting story about <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/twitter-trolling-victims-mercy-daunting-100000942.html">Twitter trolling over at Yahoo News from CBCNews.ca</a>, which includes recommendations from Adria Richards (<a href="https://twitter.com/adriarichards">@adriarichards</a>) for using the Twitter API to crack down on trolling, based upon her own experiences. Here is the specific API mention from the story:</p>
<blockquote><em>Richards has shared her own recommendations for Twitter to clamp down on trolling, which include making trending harassment patterns available via the application programming interface (API) and allowing users to subscribe to blacklists to exclude words from their timelines.</em></blockquote>
<p>I think APIs can playing a larger roll when it comes to online trolling, but we&rsquo;ll need someone to step-up and own the topic, working with Twitter, and other social networks to expose the right APIs, and give more control to end-users. Then also help encourage the development of open tooling on top APIs, that help users manage their online profiles, manage filter settings, manage black and white lists, and other key features.</p>
<p>I'll continue to consider the potential of anti-trolling APIs, alongside other account, security, and privacy considerations, and see if we can start identifying some potential API patterns and approaches that can be re-used across the space.</p>

I&rsquo;m a big fan of these types of efforts, that help humanize API operations, and bring API providers closer to API consumers. From the outside, it is difficult see behind the API curtain, and showcasing the team, is one of the best ways to break down barriers.</p>
<p>Simple things like showcasing the team, let each one tell their story, and providing Twitter accounts for each team member goes a long way in helping me connect with what an API does. Something that will continue beyond just this one post, because I followed each team member that is active on Twitter, and will be able to stay in tune asynchronously.</p>
<p>In the technical shuffle of API oeprations, it can be easy to forget about little touches like this, which is why I&rsquo;m going to <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">add team showcase as a building block to my API management list</a>.

<p>If you were at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag in Colorado last November</a>, or in <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">Sydney, Australia for API Days last week</a>, you&rsquo;ve heard me talk about what containers are doing to APIs. There is a subtle, but important shift in how APIs are being deployed occurring right now, and as John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>&nbsp;says, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">containers are doing for APIs, what APIs have been doing for businesses</a>.</p>
<p>As I was processing news for <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a> this morning, I found more evidence of this, with the <a href="http://api.report/2015/02/14/logentries-releases-logging-container-for-docker-15-stats-api/">release of logging API container from Logentries</a>. APIs have made resources like &ldquo;logging&rdquo;, much more modular and portable, for use in multiple channels like mobile or via websites. A containerized logging API makes the concept of a logging API much more portable, by adding an entirely new dimension for deployment. You don&rsquo;t just have a logging API, you now have a logging API that can be deployed anywhere in the cloud, on-premise, or on any physical object.</p>
<p>This opens up a whole new world of APIs, one that goes beyond just a programmable web, quickly evolving us towards a programmable world, for the better, and the worse. Last month <a href="http://kinlane.com/2015/01/21/when-will-my-router-have-docker-containers-by-default/">I asked, when will my router have docker containers by default</a>? I received an email from a major network equipment manufacturer this week, letting me know that they are working on it. This means little containers on the Internet enabled objects across our worlds, ushering in the ability to deploy localized, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale APIs</a>, giving us the ability to manifest exactly the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a> that we need, for any objective.</p>
<p>I try not to hype up where things are going in the API space, so I will stick with calling containers a significant evolution in how APIs are done. This new way of deploying APIs will push the evolution around the business of APIs, changing how we make generate revenue from valuable resources, while also putting even more stress on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">politics of APIs</a>, with introduction of more privacy and security concerns&mdash;not to mention adding a whole new dimension of complexity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure where all of this is going. As with the rest of the API space, I struggle with making sense of all of this in real-time, and the allocation the mental bandwidth to see the big picture. All I can say at this moment, is to make sure you work to better understand various approaches to containerization, and adopt a microservice approach to your API design. Beyond this, all we can do is keep an eye on what companies like <a href="https://logentries.com/">Logentries</a>&nbsp;are doing, when it comes to containerized API deployment, and try to learn as fast as we possibly can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://momath.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-museum-of-mathematic/momath-museum-of-mathematics.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just found one of the coolest API stories I&rsquo;ve seen in a while over at <a href="http://chance.amstat.org/">CHANCE</a>, the quarterly magazine designed for "anyone who has an interest in the analysis of data, informally highlighting sound statistical practice." CHANCE talked with the executive director of <a href="http://momath.org/">The National Museum of Mathematics</a> (MoMath), Glen Whitney, about their new hands-on, API driven exhibit that the "museum has created a physical and virtual recreational math community to nurture this generation and the next in their mathematical pursuits."</p>
<p>As part of their plans to reach people outside New York City, and encourage them to join the conversation at the museum, they have installed as a JumboTron on the floor, which:</p>
<blockquote><em>You can walk right onto it and it&rsquo;s equipped with sensing technology, so it&rsquo;ll know the location of everyone who&rsquo;s standing on the floor. We have a variety of exploratory mathematical activities on that floor. We&rsquo;ll have mazes that have special rules or maybe a lot of turnstiles that trigger changes as you walk through them. It shows the notion that math is about exploring the consequences of simple rules."</em></blockquote>
<p>At the heart of the interactive mathematics exhibit:</p>
<p><a href="http://momath.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-museum-of-mathematic/momath-floor.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>"There will be an API (application programming interface)&mdash;a system by which groups can submit their own activity to be displayed on the Math Square floor. We will invite submissions from across the country. And we&rsquo;ll have a curation process, of course. If one group&rsquo;s exhibit is selected, we&rsquo;ll give them the opportunity through live streaming video where the class can see another group in the museum interacting with their creation and get feedback about what these other students experienced as they explored whatever puzzle, problem, or illustration the originators created. We&rsquo;re looking forward to that as a way of connecting people from around the country."</em></blockquote>
<p>At the moment where I&rsquo;m most concerned about the Internet of Things (IoT) API efforts I&rsquo;m seeing emerge across the landscape, an API project like the MoMath API shows up to make me happy. :-) ;-) Can you image the possibilities here? Not just for interactive, API driven displays on the floor at the National Museum of Mathematics, but interactive mathematics anywhere you can install a visual display, or a network of API driven human interfaces.</p>
<p>I am very curious to see what mathematicians around the world do with the <a href="http://3-byte.com/momath/">MoMath API</a> project, and better understand how we can use API to make math a much more fun, accessible, and interactive experience, that can be woven into our daily experiences.</p>
<p>P.S. I really, really hope this is good enough to make it into the <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a> roundup! ;-)</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/02/12/changes-to-linkedin-developer-program-are-no-surprise/">Changes To LinkedIn Developer Program Are No Surprise</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/linkedin/linkedin-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/blog/posts/2015/developer-program-changes">LinkedIn recently announced some changes to their developer program</a>, which involves further tightening down the screws on who has access to the API, limiting public access to only a handful of very superficial APIs. If you want greater access to the business social network API, you will need to be an officially approved partner.</p>
<p>As a result of LinkedIn&rsquo;s announcement, you will hear more discussion about the demise of public APIs, as this is narrative many API providers would like to employ, to support their own command and control positions around their client, or very own API driven resources. There is nothing wrong with having private APIs with supporting partner programs, but this has no bearing on the viability of publicly available APIs.</p>
<p>In reality, LinkedIn&rsquo;s API never really was open. Sure it is a public API, but the API has never been developer friendly, often times taking a very adversarial stance with its community, as opposed to embracing, nurturing, and investing in its developer ecosystem. Honestly, this is ok. Not every company has the DNA, or business model to make public APIs work&mdash;this latest move by LinkedIn reflects their ability, and not the potential of public APIs.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t expect all companies to be able to make public APIs work, it isn't easy. When it comes to making money around valuable content and data online, a closed ecosystem is seen as being better. Tighter control over your users data exhaust, allows you to decide who can do what, limiting to just the partners who have business relationships with you. You just can't monetize user generated to the extent LInkedIn would like, without taking away users control and access to this data.</p>
<p>Even with LinkedIn stance, there are a number of lessons to be learned by studying their approach. Like Twitter and Facebook, there are plenty of positive moves to analyze, as well as numerous other negative elements, that you can learn from when crafting the tone for your API. As an API provider do not dismiss what you can take away from LinkedIn&rsquo;s platform, and as a consumer LinkedIn is a valuable lesson in what you should look for in an API platform.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the move by LInkedIn is no surprise to me, and the platform is purely a distribution channel for me, and has been for some time.. Meaning I only syndicate content there, and you will never find me actually engaging very deep on the platform, building relationships there, because along with other platforms like Quora I do not have any ownership over any of the exhaust I generate. As a professional this is unacceptable to me, as I have a valuable brand that I carefully maintain. As other professionals realize this, they too will mostly abandon the business social network, leaving it to be a spammy corner of the Internet where HR professional prey upon the semi-professional, aspiring employee types.</p>

<p>After seeing the conversation around my In The Future There Will Be No Public vs. Private APIs, I'm reminded of my own mission. I write on API Evangelist first and foremost for my own education, and secondarily I do it to help educate the normals about the importance of APIs. Not page-views. Not to educate the API echo chamber. Not to drive conversation over at <a href="http://www.dzone.com/links/two_api_pundants.html">DZone</a> or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9010304">Hacker News</a>. Definitely not to insult anyone.</p>
<p>That story was me working through my own service composition, and looking at one possible future. That exchange you hear in the story, and all my stories, is the conversation between the voices in my head, and is never mean to insult anyone (think Michael Keaton in Birdman). All of this has reminded me that API Evangelist is not about cutting edge stories, like the unproven stuff I'm doing with my own API architecture, docker and microservices. However it is critical that I still flush out my ideas, in my own way, so I'll move these stories to my personal blog <a href="http://kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a>.</p>
<p>As I re-read that post, I&rsquo;m faced with the link-baity title, which was not crafted with that intent, and the error and brevity in one statement that was singled out and ultimately fueled the conversation. I&rsquo;m always happy to see conversation stirred, but not in the way it was around David&rsquo;s post. It is ridiculous that I would allude to privacy being gone from the conversation around APIs (really?), but ultimately I was pleased to see most people make the same argument that I was having in my own head.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super thankful for having APIEvangelist.com, and my readers. It makes it possible that to bring in the little bit of money I do from 3Scale, Restlet, and WSO2, to pay my rent, and fund my research and learning. I&rsquo;m also thankful for moments like this that help me remember why it is that I do this, and stay true to my API Evangelist mission.</p>

<p>The API savvy folks over at <a href="https://apimatic.io/">Apimatic</a> are at it again, pushing forward the conversation around generating of software development kits, using machine readable API formats, and this time the doorway to your SDK is via the <a href="http://apicommons.org/format.html">API Commons manifest</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going to go ahead and use their own description, as it sums it well, no augmentation needed. Using the code generation API, you can generate SDKs for your API directly from your Github repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Describe you API using some format. You may choose from Swagger, RAML, APIBlueprint, IODocs, and Google Discovery formats. Automatic code generation makes use of information in your API description to generate method and classes names. Please be as expressive as possible by not leaving out any optional fields as applicable e.g., not leaving out types and schemas for your parameters and fields.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Define meta information about your API using API Commons manifest format. You can generate your API Commons manifest using the <a href="http://apicommons.org/manifest-generator.html">API Commons Manifest generator.</a> Be sure to enter all relevant information. Upload the generated manifest as a new file in the root directory of your Github repo by the name "api-commons- manifest.json". Be sure to have the correct name and location of this file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open/Create a markdown file (README.md is a good candidate). Add the following markdown syntax to render an image link.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[![apimatic][apimatic-{platform-name}-image]][apimatic-{platform- name}-url]</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[apimatic-{platform-name}-url]: https://apimatic.io/api/github/{account-name}/{repo-name}/{branch- name}?platform={platform-name}</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[apimatic-{platform-name}-image]: https://apimatic.io/img/github/{platform-name}.svg</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Replace the {platform-name} token with one of the following values: windows, android, ios<br />Replace the {account-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github account name <br />Replace the {repo-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github repository name <br />Replace the {branch-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github branch name where the API Commons manifest file is present. ï¿¼</p>
<p>To validate, open the following url after replacing tokens. This url should open the raw manifest file. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{account-name}/{repo-name}/{branch- name}/api-commons-manifest.json</p>
<p>You can see an example <a href="https://github.com/apimatic/videos">here</a>. Commit changes and navigate to your Markdown file in your browser. You will see apimatic widgets (image links), which you can click to generate SDKs for your API. To see an example, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apimatic/videos/gh- pages/README.md">open this link to view the README.md </a>file in raw text form.</p>
<p>The Apimatic team is owning the conversation when it comes to generation of full fledge SDKs for your APIs. I always hear folks talk about the limitations of auto-generation of client side code, but the Apimatic team is pushing the conversation forward with their persistent approach.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm continuing my work to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/04/what-exactly-is-api-commons/">help people understand what APIs.json is</a>, and the varying ways that it can be put to use.  My post the other day, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">breaking down Fitbits APIs.json file</a> is a good example of where to get started, but I wanted to help further set the bar for a minimum viable APIs.json.</p>
<p>APIs.json starts with a basic set of descriptions of who you are, the API provider. Each header of an APIs.json file gives you a handful of parameters for describing who you are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - your individual or company name, who is managing the APIs.json file.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of your company and / or the API collection you are building.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes yourself or your company.</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe your API collection.</li>
<li><strong>created</strong> - the first date in which an APIs.json file was created.</li>
<li><strong>modified</strong> - the last date in which an APIs.json file created.</li>
<li><strong>url</strong> - The url of where the APIs.json lives, allowing your file to be portable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those seven parameters provide details on who you are, and what the API collection is all about. Remember an API collection doesn&rsquo;t always have to live under a specific company domain, it could be a temporary or more permanent collection, which is part of specific project or application.</p>
<p>The next essential element of an APIs.json file, is the APIs collection, providing you the ability to describe one or many APIs as part of this collection. Similar to the parameters provided for the header, each API entry is allowed a handful of parameters that describe the API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - the name of the API.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of the value an API delivers.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes an API.</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe the API itself.</li>
<li><strong>humanURL</strong> - The url any human should visit to learn more about an API.</li>
<li><strong>baseURL</strong> - The base url any machine should follow to start using an API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each API should have at least this information, at a minimum. I could stop here, with my minimum viable APIs.json definition, but I encourage you to take one more step, and put the properties collection to use for each of your API. Using the properties collection, you can provide any other URL you want for an API--I recommend starting with four basic properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-documentation</strong> - Where the documentation resides for the API.</li>
<li><strong>X-signup</strong> - Where a user can signup to use an API.</li>
<li><strong>X-pricing </strong>- What is the pricing for using an API.</li>
<li><strong>X-tos </strong>- Where do I find the legalize behind AP operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately you can define any property you wish for an API, but recommend with these essential building blocks that all API consumers will need. After that each API has a contact collection, allowing you to provide some basic support for API operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FN</strong> - The name of person to contact.</li>
<li><strong>email</strong> - The email address to contact.</li>
<li><strong>X-twitter </strong>- A twitter user for the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>These contact properties, follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">vCard format</a>, and provide what API consumers will need to get support for an API. The same properties are available again for the overall APIs.json file, as a maintainers collection, which provide contact information for the overall APIs.json maintainer. This will often be a duplicate of information for each API, but allows for ultimately flexibility in aggregating many disparate APIs, into a single collection.</p>
<p>That is it. That is a minimum viable APIs.json definition. We now know who maintains the collection, and essential details about API operations. This goes well beyond just the technical definition of an API, and provides essential business and political elements of API operations, that all API consumers will need to be informed of, and are something that developers will often overlook.</p>
<p>With an <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json file</a>, <a href="http://apis.io/">open source API search engines like APIs.io</a> will be able to index your APIs, and any API directory like <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> can do the same. The definition of your API(s) is now machine readable, and is portable, allowing this definition to live on any website, or within any desktop, web or mobile application.</p>

<p>David Berlin has a rebuttal post on ProgrammableWeb to my recent post&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/03/in-the-future-there-will-be-no-public-vs-private-apis/">In The Future There Will Be No Public vs. Private APIs</a>, called <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/long-live-private-api/analysis/2015/02/06">Long Live The Private API</a>. I&rsquo;m a big fan of doing story responses using our blogs versus the sometimes difficult Twitter conversations that occur--so I am happy to craft a response as well. I&rsquo;m less of a fan of playing into page view games of fabricated kerfuffles, and link-bait titles, which after re-reading, my own blog title was a little link-baity. However in reality, my story came from my workbench as I was reworking some of the service composition stack, and reflect that process, not the conversation it seems to have created, but hey, I am all about embracing unintended consequences.</p>
<p>First, let me address my mistake. I said <em>"If it has an http:// in front of the address, it is a public API&mdash;sorry.&rdquo;</em>, which is total bullshit. As John Sheehan reminded me after I posted, at the point of DNS is what I should have meant, you can definitely use http:// on a totally private network, and what I meant to articulate was once you start making call via http://, using a DNS address.</p>
<p>Second, David really makes my case for me, so in reality we are in agreement, it is all about semantics&mdash;which really is the core of my argument. Private, like the term open is thrown around a lot, usually by marketers, who want to elicit some sort of emotion response from their intended audience, much like David is with his story. All I&rsquo;m pointing out, in my own journey, is I used to have two buckets, public, and private. Then I had three buckets internal, public, and partner. Now I have mulitiple buckets that reflect products, projects, dev groups, and the organic organizational structure that has emerged around the resources I manage, and put to use.</p>
<p>Private just doesn&rsquo;t describe my organizational structure anymore. My organization spans the globe, and has overlap with numerous other organizations, and individuals, and my service composition needs to reflect this change. If my statement: "the concept of public and private doesn't exist. This is a reality that plays out in conversations between people who don&rsquo;t fully understand the world of API management&mdash;aka the tech blogosphere.&rdquo;..is an insult to you. Maybe you can channel that anger into a blog post, and get some page views. ;-)</p>
<p>David is 100% right. It is your right to continue describing things as public vs. private, and I&rsquo;m completely confident that many of you will continue doing this in the future. Describing very public infrastructure as private, describing very closed things as open, what I&rsquo;m trying to do is move the conversation forward. When you are ready for a nunanced discussion about who has access to your API, API management, and service composition, I am here.</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> Look ma! I did it without a second page, to drive page views!</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://ardoq.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ardoq/ardoq_logo_small.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm a big fan of putting my ideas for new tools, services, and other stuff out on the Internet, for public consumption. My mother taught me how to manifest things in my life, and this is my digital version of her teachings. By putting my ideas out there, a) I don't actually feel compelled to do them b) someone else might think it is good idea and build it, and c) when someone does build it and they start looking to publicize, they will find you. c) happened today.</p>
<p>One idea that I put out there recently, that I really wanted to manifest, was a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/30/swagger-visualization-layer-using-d3js/">visualization layer for APIs using Swagger</a>. My wish has been granted, and a startup called <a href="http://ardoq.com/">Ardoq</a>, has done just that, developed a <a href="http://ardoq.com/visualizing-swagger-api-documentation/">visualization layer using Swagger</a>. As they were taking their new product public they came across my story, and pinged me this morning. I&rsquo;m going to follow-up, with a link to the story, and get a full tour of the product, talk with the team, and better understand what they are up to.</p>
<p><a href="http://ardoq.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ardoq/IBM_API_Swagger_To_Ardoq.gif" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Ardoc is an important next step for machine readable API definition conversation, adding another <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">incentive for API providers to generate definitions for their APIs in API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML</a>. I really see three main phases of the evolution so far in this conversation, 1) when Wordnik introduce Swagger and Swagger UI, 2) with introduction of Apiary.io moving the conversation further upstream to API design, and now 3) more meaningful visualizations built on top of APIs and microservices.</p>
<p>Machine readable API definitions have done many significant things for the API conversation, allowing us to deploy interactive documentation, mock interfaces, ultimately giving us a common language that we can use to communicate around some very abstract concepts. I&rsquo;m excited to see visualizations enter the discussion, which will allow us to build powerful visual tooling around APIs, like being able to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/30/how-to-generate-an-api-surface-area-map-for-a-microservice/">map the scope of a microservice</a>, or provide a map for a whole stack of microservices.</p>
<p>I think visualizations generated for machine readable API definition is just the beginning of a whole <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">new world of UI elements developed on top of APIs,</a> and we will also see more analysis, interoperability, integration, and discovery tools emerge as well. API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger will continue to evolve as a central truth throughout the API lifecycle, providing as set of instructions for everything from design and deployment, to management and integration.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/article.xsp?id=05.02.2015092629NHEBWM.htm"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ibm-bluemix-third-party-services.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been talking about developing <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks for a while now</a>, and as I continue understand current shifts in cloud computing, I am doing my own&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/api-management-infrastructure-and-service-composition-is-key-to-orchestration-with-microservices-in-a-containerized-world/">reshuffling towards a more microservices, and docker-centric way of life</a>. When I say the phrase &ldquo;virtual API stack&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m talking about the ability to deploy a stack of APIs you need for a specific organization, project, app, or other configuration. In 2015, you should be able to quickly define exactly the stack of private, and public API services you need to accomplish exactly what you need--nothing more.</p>
<p>As part of my research in this area, I&rsquo;m tracking on similar patterns, that I see occurring at platform providers--today I found an example of <a href="http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/article.xsp?id=05.02.2015092629NHEBWM.htm">defining virtual API stacks</a> using the <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html">service broker API </a>over at <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/bluemix/">IBM Bluemix</a>. Using Bluemix, you can build virtual API stacks from existing services they have setup, including Twilio, and Sendgrid, or register your own APIs using service broker, via their <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/partner-landing.html">cloud marketplace</a>&nbsp;(you have to be partner). The services deploy in this way, need to implement a common API surface area dictated by the platform (I&rsquo;d love to see a Swagger spec for this IBM).</p>
<p>IBM is blending several areas I&rsquo;ve been tracking on, starting with&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">defining of virtual stacks</a>, but also the aggregation of 3rd party services which opens up a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale layer of valuable API resources</a>, and sets up world where <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API brokers can emerge</a>, and prosper. I see that <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZFB2_3.0.1/com.ibm.apimgmt.apionprem.doc/create_api_swagger.html">IBM has embraced machine readable API definitions like Swagger</a> as part of their operations, and I&rsquo;d love to see them <a href="http://apisjson.org/">adopt APIs.json for defining of their virtual API stacks or collections</a>. APIs.json would make the API collections that users define, much more portable, shareable, indexable, and ultimately discoverable. If you need example of APIs.json + Swagger working, look through <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">my API Stack inventory</a>, as I map out the top APIs.</p>
<p>My vision of a future with API stacks and collections, is a world where we can buy and sell these modular resources, in IBM&rsquo;s, Amazon&rsquo;s, Google&rsquo;s, and anyone other marketplace, but we can also run them in any infrastructure we choose. We would all possess our own stacks of resources, be able to choose from a wide array of public and private 3rd party resources, and deploy, remix, and re-use these resources in any way we choose, to drive websites, desktop solutions, system integrations, mobile apps, and devices.</p>
<p>It is good to see these patterns emerging over at IBM, via their Bluemix platform. This type of modular service definition, design, deployment, management and reuse is something I&rsquo;m talking with several other companies about as well--making for a very &ldquo;containerized microservice&rdquo; 2015, from what I can see.</p>

<p>As I travel around talking to folks about APIs, I spend as much time as I can educating folks about <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, and I&rsquo;m constantly reminded how little people, who have even heard, and read about API Commons, really understand what it is. With this in mind, I will be regularly publishing examples of what API Commons is, to help onboard everyone to mine and Steve's (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) vision of API Commons.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API Commons is a machine readable pointer to the license of your API</span>. As I talk with folks, and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ3-yFWYtrk">videos like this one at APICon in UK</a>, I realize how many misconceptions there are about it. Many folks emphasize the Creative Commons license we&rsquo;ve chosen, or the listing of APIs we&rsquo;ve had added to our version of the commons, by publishing an API Commons manifest, which references a CC-BY or CC0 license.</p>
<p>If you feel your API should be covered under an open source license, or covered by your patent, or not covered by any sort of license, create an API Commons manifest that points to your API, references your license, and you&rsquo;ve created your own commons. Now you can spider, and aggregate any API providers who have used the same license, into your own definition of what is the API Commons.</p>
<p>API Commons is not an API directory. API Commons is not a push for copyright in APIs. API Commons is a machine readable format for taking a stance on the licensing (or not) of your API definitions, and data models. Please join us today, by <a href="http://apicommons.org/">letting us know your stance on licensing of your API</a>, we&rsquo;ve love to hear your voice, and better understand your stance.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/global-change-information-system/global-change-information-system.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I remember the vision clearly from 2004, when I first changed the URL for my Delicious social bookmarking account to make it return a list of bookmarks as XML instead of HTML. It was a vision of the programmable web--where everything I explored on the Internet, wasn&rsquo;t just consumable, and right below the surface of any website or application I was using, there was also a machine readable version, allowing me to build whatever I desired.</p>
<p>People are often surprised when they realize I do not have anything to sell them, and that I evangelize that APIs are not some new product, but just the next step in the evolution of the web. This is easy to say, however it can be much harder to demostrate to the &ldquo;normals&rdquo;, leaving me always hundting for easy to understand API implementations I can use to help bring me people closer to understanding.</p>
<p>Steve Ziegler (<a href="https://twitter.com/Stevezieglerva">@stevezieglerva</a>) introduced to me to a great new example of this in the wild. An API I haven&rsquo;t come across before, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it was a partnership between Department of Commerce, Energy, Interior, State Department, Transportation, EPA, Health &amp; Human Services, NASA, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian, USAID, and USDA.</p>
<p>According to their own description the <a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/">Global Change Information System</a> is:</p>
<blockquote><em>The US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) has established the Global Change Information System (GCIS) to better coordinate and integrate the use of federal information products on changes in the global environment and the implications of those changes for society.</em></blockquote>
<p>For me the Global Change Information System is an example of how websites, linked data, and APIs should work in concert, but is something I understand very little about how to actually do. The <em>GCIS&nbsp;</em>platform organizes an amazing amount of information, all the people, organizations, and relationships involved, in a very elegant way-you can start seeing in action by browsing the database, by clicking on the menu in top left corner.</p>
<p><a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/global-change-information-system/gcis-api-report-view.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>Immediately I notice how structured everything, then as I scroll to bottom I see that everything is available in a machine readable format. What is even cooler, is that it isn&rsquo;t just available as JSON, you get it in YAML, Turtle, RDF, and some formats I&rsquo;m not familiar with. Then  of course, you get a robust, yet simple web API as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/api_reference"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/global-change-information-system/gcis-api-reference.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed with the amount of detail available in the Global Change Information System, and the amount thought put into the relationships between all the information, and actors involved. It makes me optimistic for what can come out of government, and that something so forward thinking is being applied to an area as import as the environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting going reviewing the <a href="https://data.globalchange.gov/api_reference">Global Change Information System API</a>, and will make more time to evaluate how it works under the hood, maybe generating a Swagger spec for the interface, to help me better understand how it works. I&rsquo;m also going to reach out to them and see if I can get more information on the story behind, and possibly what the roadmap looks like&mdash;making it likely you will see more stories about it in the near future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/ed/fafsa-form.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>My work on <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/">APIs for the Department of Education</a>, and the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">FAFSA API</a> began while I was working in Washington DC as a Presidential Innovation Fellow. Shortly after leaving DC, I was informed that conversations around an API for the FAFSA had been put on back-burner, and in response I developed a prototype FAFSA API to help jumpstart the conversation.</p>
<p>In December 2013, I went to one of the two data jams put on my the White House and Dept of Education, up in Palo Alto, CA at Stanford. Then, in January 2014 I heard there was talk at the secretary level, about officially pursuing a FAFSA API. Yay! By February I got an email that there was an opportunity for funding such an initiative, if there was a technical specification available. Three days layer <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/2014/02/20/fafsa-api-technical-specification-draft-raw/">I finished a couple of options</a>, which ultimately resulted in a <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/2014/02/21/fafsa-api-technical-specification-draft/">draft technical proposal for a possible FAFSA API</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard nothing about the outcome of these efforts. I provided some thoughts on <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/2014/06/02/my-response-to-how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">APIs in general, in June of 2014, in repose to their RFI</a>, but beyond that it has been radio silence at Department of Education when it comes to a FAFSA API. Granted, I&rsquo;m not pursuing this, but when it comes to FAFSA API discussion, I own the SEO conversation, so if it came up, I&rsquo;m sure someone would ping me.</p>
<p>I have no confidence that the Department of Education will pursue a FAFSA API. My motivations around contributing to the conversations stem from a desire to jumpstart investment from both the public, and the private sector. While jumpstarting conversations in the federal government, I was hoping I could also jumpstart the development, and deployment of a federated FAFSA API, which in turn would apply pressure on the federal government to participate. Doing this is not trivial, and a cause that needs a champion or full time evangelist&mdash;I&rsquo;m not your man.</p>
<p>The FAFSA API is an excellent example of the technology, business, and politics of APIs, something that is more art, than science. If it is going to become a thing, I think it has to happen inversely to the way the IRS ecosystem has occurred, from the outside in. I just don&rsquo;t have confidence that the Department of Education can own this one, I think multiple leaders from the private sector have to make it happen, get private sector buy-in, then convince the Department of Ed to play nicely in a federated FAFSA API ecosystem.</p>
<p>Which is no small task.</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>This post is meant to help several groups understand where I am at with the FAFSA API. I just posted a round of updates directly to my <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">FAFSA API research</a>, as well as my overall <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/">Dept of Education research</a>.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://api.report/2015/02/04/infolytica-corporation-releases-motorsolve-v5/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/infolytica-motorsolve.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been pretty focused on web APIs in my API Evangelist world, steering clear of hardware, networking, desktop software, and the American Petroleum Institute. While you will never catch me paying attention to oil, I am slowly changing my tune on other types of legacy APIs.</p>
<p>As I read through <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html">the first 700, of the 16K API related patents I&rsquo;ve harvested from USPTO XML files</a>, I initially started dismissing hardware related patents, and then some of the more network related ones as well. Then I started evaluating the impact these patents could have on the Internet of Things (IoT), and I am beginning to shift my stance.</p>
<p>I may not fully profile the approaches of some of these API providers, but I think I will at least bookmark, and consider the approach, and how its being applied, while also putting on my web API architect hat. As I read through a press release today on <a href="http://api.report/2015/02/04/infolytica-corporation-releases-motorsolve-v5/">Infolytica corporation releasing the next generation of their MotorSolve software</a>, complete with mention of an API, I can&rsquo;t help but think of the implications if Infolytica embraced a web-API strategy.</p>
<p>Imagine the potential, if MotorSolve was broken up, migrated into the cloud, and containerized? Then add in the necessary business building blocks like docs, code, pricing, and the requisite political building blocks like rate limits, terms of services, etc. This is the lens I am looking at older patents I am reading through, that may not 100% reflect modern web APIs, but because our virtual and physical worlds are increasingly merging with the growth of Internet of Things (IoT), and Software Defined Networking (SDN), might have significant impact if just looked at a little differently.</p>
<p>Overall I see an pretty interesting opportunity in trying and consider all types of APIs, no matter their origins, reconsidering them in light of shifts in compute like the cloud, mobile, IoT, and SDN, and see what we can learn. You&rsquo;ll see more news reports of more &ldquo;low level&rdquo; APIs on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, and some of what I learn evolving my analysis here on API Evangelist.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-traffic-fast-lane.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get a lot of folks who come to my blog, see the title, read one or two posts, and assume that I&rsquo;m a blind lover of API technology, and that I see APis as a solution to everything. While some of this is true, I do love APIs, and think they are a great solution (in some cases), at the same time I&rsquo;m also an outspoken critic of APIs, and work hard to be a voice of reason when I see people doing stupid shit with them.</p>
<p>With this theme in mind, I want to once again remind everyone that APIs are neither good, nor bad, nor neutral by themselves, they are merely one of the tools companies can wield, and completely reflect the motivations of their masters. One such example of this in action, where I believe an API is being used for some pretty bad reasons is with the <a href="https://developer.att.com/apis/sponsored-data">AT&amp;T sponsored data API</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to support AT&amp;T as much as I can, because I really want to help the enterprise make sense of web APIs, and teach them to wield them in positive ways, but I have to say the sponsored data API is not something I can get behind. Upon closer examination this API is working to close down, control and meter the Internet, rather than opening up the Internet making it more accessible, and usable by AT&amp;T customers.</p>
<p>Allowing for mobile users to get their music, video and other content delivered in a way that doesn&rsquo;t impact their phone bill seems like a good idea, and allowing companies to step in an sponsor the delivery of data and content for users, may smell like a good opportunity when you own the pipes, but this is leading us down a dark road. I&rsquo;m sorry, there are much more interesting ways to optimize the delivery of content, and make money off the Internet pipes you have--AT&amp;T you lack imagination, and creativity.</p>
<p>I'm sure you are well aware, but what you are doing with sponsored data delivery to mobile phones is another push for allowing the prioritization of Internet traffic, and being able to pay for a better Internet experience for those who can afford it, rather than making the web accessible to everyone. Additionally if you consider that many providers will actively work to slow the Internet delivery of content behind the scenes just so they can generate revenue using approaches like sponsored data, things really start to get really ugly. I'm not ok with you doing this via APIs, and helping your customers see API as something attached to their bill, and speeding up the Internet</p>
<p>This use of an API to close the Internet down, and such bad examples of API monetization really bum me out. There is so much opportunity for monetization if everyone has open, free access to the Internet. We can get more creative than this, when it comes to monetizing the pipes, and approaches like this from AT&amp;T is just going to continue fucking up the Internet, similar to what we are seeing come from Verizon, and the other leading telcos who don't get Internet, let alone APIs.</p>
<p><em><strong>PS:</strong> I wrote this 8 months ago, and just now found in my Evernote. Figured I'd publish in the shadow of FCC announcment on net neutrality.</em></p>
