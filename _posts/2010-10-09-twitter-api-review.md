The Twitter API has come a long ways since the early days of the microblogging service. Even though Twitter now has a sexy dashboard with an organized set of building blocks, I would file the API under accidental ecosystem.

I think the Twitter ecosystem was largely built by the community itself, and not necessarily by Twitter. Twitter is one API I wish I had reviewed several years ago so I could compare their earlier approach to how it is being served up today.

Twitterï¿½s API uses the following building blocks:

  * Dashboard
  * Getting Started
  * Documentation
  * Client Libraries / Code Samples
  * Widgets
