<p>With over 100 APIs, and an army of developer advocates, Google is one of the top API ecosystems in the world, alongside Twitter and Facebook.
<p>Google is stepping back and rethinking how they interact and support their developer community and are <a title="looking for feedback" href="https://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/09/what-does-it-mean-to-be-google.html">looking for feedback</a> from the developer community.
