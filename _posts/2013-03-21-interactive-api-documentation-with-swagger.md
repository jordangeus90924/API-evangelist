{% include JB/setup %}<p>It is becoming more common for API providers to deliver documentation using whats known as interactive API documentation, instead of the usual static API documentation.Understanding how to use an API can be tough sometimes, and rather than just reading about it how it works, interactive API documentation allows you make real calls against an API, while learning about the interface.While there are several approaches to delivering interactive API documentation, my personal favorite is using Swagger.Swagger comes built in with 3Scale, which is the API management platform I use for the API Evangelist API, but Swagger is available for anyone to use as an open source project.Interactive API documentation using Swagger starts with a Swagger definition, which is a JSON representation of an API endpoint.</p>
