[Binpress][1] is a [marketplace][2] for code, where software developers can buy and sell source code from each other. And it's [holding a developer contest][3].

Binpress is looking for high quality code from professional developers that can be packaged, re-used and published in the Binpress marketplace. [<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/contests/binpress-programming-contest.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][3] Prizes include:

  * Grand Prizes of $17,000
  * Two Runner Up Prizes of $13,000
  * Six Best Submission per Language Prizes of $10,000.00
Contest submissions will be graded on the following attributes :
  * Development style and methodology - intelligent use of software design techniques and patterns.
  * Originality - how original is the submission.
  * Usefulness - how useful is the submission.
Some idea suggestions are:
  * Integrate popular [APIs][4] (such as Amazon or Paypal) into popular frameworks and platforms.
  * Create an administration panel to manage common entities in web applications (such as users)
  * Develop a standalone solution to handle media from multiple sources and formats
  * Be creative - but also develop something useful.
The contest is a great opportunity for developers to get exposure and make some money.

It is also is a great way for Binpress to create awareness of their source-code marketplace, the process around publishing code and grow their developer community.

Sponsors include Google, [Amazon Web Services][5], and Paypal.
