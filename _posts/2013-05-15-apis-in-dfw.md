{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just got back from the Dallas-Fort Worth area.I visited Dallas last night to help kick off the first gathering of the DFW API Professionals Meetup.We got together at Microsoft around 6PM and I talked from 6:30 until 8:00, evolving on my From Web, to ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld talk.The meetup was about 45 people ranging from developers to investors.I showed up with a lot of content, but I wanted to make sure and cover the full API spectrum, while also introducing some new content about specifically about API consumption.</p>
