<p>I was able to update my API monitoring system to include the location of some of the APIs, allowing me to look at APIs by country and region. In preparation for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, I'm taking a closer look at what API innovation is coming out of Europe--first up the United Kindom.
<p>I knew about some of the APIs like Datasift and The Guardian, but I enjoyed learning about the other 35 API companies that I discovered. I was only able to find the location of about 700 of the over 2000 API companies that I track on, but will continue to update the rest of the APIs as I can.
