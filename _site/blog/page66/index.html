<a title="Phaxio" href="http://www.phaxio.com/">Phaxio</a>, an API that allows developers to <a title="integrating faxing capabilities into application" href="http://www.phaxio.com/">integrate faxing capabilities into their applications</a>, has  email invitation as a main menu option in its API area.<p></p>
The Phaxio API is in private beta, but existing users can send off a Phaxio invitation code that allows other developers to discover and sign up for the faxing service.<p></p>
Application email invites are clearly not something new.  And with the growth of social media, it may be that sharing via Twitter or Facebook has become more associated with the steps necessary to make things "go viral."  Nevertheless, having the ability to send out invitations via email can still provide essential word-of-mouth marketing for your API and shouldn't be overlooked.

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-popularity.png" alt="" width="375" align="right" />How do you measure the popularity of your API, or someone else's API?<p></p>
If its your API, hopefully you have metrics established for every part of your API and supporting API area.<p></p>
But how can we measure the API space as a whole?  I get asked a lot about, what are the top APIs out there.<p></p>
<a title="ProgrammableWeb Measures Popularity" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?sort=mashups">ProgrammableWeb measures popularity</a> by the number of mashups that are built on an API.  Using this metric, Google Maps, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube rise to the top.<p></p>
Not all APIs are suited for mashups, and we definitely need more ideas of how to measure popularity and usage of Open APIs.<p></p>
I would start by using <a title="Alexa" href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a>, <a title="Compete" href="http://www.compete.com/">Compete</a>, and <a title="Quantcast" href="http://www.quantcast.com/">Quantcast</a> who provide SEO related analytics and ranking for web sites.<p></p>
Next I would look at the number of partners an API has showcased in their developers area or web site.<p></p>
After partners I would look for the number of developers showcased as part of an API ecosystem.  Not all APIs provide tools for developers to have a public profile, but if they do, this can be an important measurement.<p></p>
After the number of partner and public users, I would take a close look at how many applications are developed on a platform.  Both internally and community developed applications.  These represent completed projects where developers have successfully integrated with an API.<p></p>
Then I think overall API community activity and resources would be a good thing to measure.  How many code samples, language kits, FAQ, forum posts, and other resources are provided. This reflects the amount of resources a company and community has put into an API.<p></p>
There is no perfect way to measure the success and popularity of an API on the open Internet, but these are a few ideas for variables the industry might consider when developing an algorithm for tracking the popularity of APIs in this fast growing space.

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2011</span>
        As an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I'm always grouping and targeting my API consumers, to better meet their needs and identify their role within my <a title="API Ecosystem" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php">API ecosystem</a>.
<p></p>The three main groups that I break my API users into, are:<img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=300x225&amp;cht=p3&amp;chd=s:SSMG&amp;chdl=Partner|Public|Inernal|Platform&amp;chdlp=b&amp;chma=1,1,1,1&amp;chtt=API+Ecosystem&amp;chts=000000,14" alt="API Ecosystem" width="300" height="225" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Partners Developers
     </li>
     <li>Public Developers
     </li>
     <li>Internal Developers
     </li>
</ul>When I first started working with APIs, I generally focused on API access for partners.
<p></p>With the introduction of Open APIs, I began paying attention to a wider audience of developers from different countries, industries, programming languages and platforms.
<p></p>Recently APIs are also being recognized for their use internally. API owners often target other departments or business locations when deploying or consuming APIs.
<p></p>As the API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a>, I'm seeing a new target emerge, platform partners.
<p></p>Platform partners are tend to be other complimentary APIs and / or <a title="self-service application platforms" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application platforms</a> like <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> and <a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a>.
<p></p>Just like with my partners, public, and internal developers I'm developing specific strategies, code samples, documentation and other tools targeting my designated partner platforms.
<p></p>Partner platforms are quickly becoming an important part of my API ecosystem, we'll see where this trend goes.

        <span class="post-date">20 Apr 2011</span>
        Presentation assets are the user interface or visual front-end to an application.  Logic assets are the algorithms, analytics or services which take data inputs, do some processing and provide a response.  Data is the raw content but can also include simple transformations of the content.  Different services can be linked together to provide a complete application system.<p></p>
It is important to break out of the mind-set that your company has to deliver all three assets.  It is true that traditionally the only way to deliver applications was for a company to own responsibility of all three.  However the World Wide Web and APIs liberate companies from the need to deliver all three.  Now more and more companies benefit if they focus on their unique value-add.  Once you identify your core assets, it becomes clear which complementary assets will be provided by your partners.  Thus to reach a strategy you are satisfied with, follow the simple steps:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>Identify your own core asset(s)</li>
	<li>Choose the complementary asset which will deliver most value</li>
	<li>Define the strategy to capture the value most effectively</li>
</ol>
For example for <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> the core asset that they distribute via their API is data, in the form of the immense stream of 140 character tweets.  They made a decision early in the company history to focus all their resources on this core asset - notwithstanding recent strategy changes where they are trying to re-assert control of more of the Presentation and Logic assets.  This means that with the original strategy the complementary assets were Presentation and Logic assets.  In these two areas the company would build partnerships to deliver enhanced solutions to meet the diverse needs of Twitter users - a far greater variety that Twitter alone could ever deliver.<p></p>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-38112" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/?attachment_id=38112"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38112" src="http://www.3scale.net/wp-content/uploads/Biz-Model-Complementary-and-Core-Assets.png" alt="API Business Model: Core and Complementary Assets" width="542" height="275" /></a><p></p>
Let us say that of the two complementary assets, Twitter decided to focus on Presentation, because they realised that it is critical to get mobile client coverage.  Then the strategy definition was to power mobile apps.  The company defined the specific APIs and a business model that would attract developers to create new mobile front-ends for Twitter.  An example of a Twitter partner that leverages the API to deliver a mobile client and fulfil this strategy is <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a>:<p></p>

<em>Note that the highlighted boxes are not the only assets that the company provides, but rather they indicate the most important, or core asset.  The remaining two are candidates for complementary partners, even if there may be some level of co-opetition.</em>
<h3>Business Model options with an API</h3>
Once the strategy is agreed, you will find that the use of an API opens up new options in the choice of business model.  For each potential business strategy you need to evaluate which is an appropriate business model to execute. The options related to APIs include:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Product / Service</strong>: if the main way for the company to deliver value is through its API e.g. Twilio from the table above.</li>
	<li><strong>Distribution</strong>: to extend the company's reach, the API allows the company's content or services to be accessed from other applications or devices (such as smartphones).  This could be in the form of a channel business model, but it may simply be to broaden access via partnerships.  There are several options for monetizing the channel option including product resale, whitelabel licensing, or affiliate commissions.   An example of this is Wolfram Alpha's partnership agreement with Microsoft's Bing search engine.</li>
	<li><strong>Promotion</strong>: if an important role is to raise awareness for the company's products or brand, and generate additional traffic.  This is the business model used by Netflix and The Guardian for movies and news content respectively.</li>
	<li><strong>Content Acquisition</strong>: to make it easy to gather content which will then form a strong base for the value of a company.  An example of this when job posting websites cross-post job openings to Indeed via their APIs.</li>
</ul>
These business model options are not exclusive.  In fact the presence of an API will usually mean that several of these are achieved.  A good way to think about it is to choose one focus area for the business model, and additionally one or two supporting areas.  We will elaborate on some detailed examples later.  A related choice to the business model is to identify how directly the value of the API will be monetized.  This is typically not a black-and-white decision, but rather there is a spectrum of possibilities.  The following table gives examples at several points along the spectrum from very direct pricing based on API calls, to completely indirect value capture.

We have now seen a framework to evaluate the best business model options for your API.  It began with an assessment of your core asset to determine what strategy will guide your API.  Then you explore four different directions for business models to find which is the best fit for your strategy.  In parallel with the business model evaluation, you can optionally define some high-level pricing approaches.  In the next post in the series we will look at each of the four business model options in more detail, before applying this framework to a number of existing companies to show how these business models look in the real world.

        <span class="post-date">18 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/journalism/nieman-journalism-labs-icon.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="right" />There is an excellent analysis of Open API usage in news organizations at the Nieman Journalism Lab, called <a title="Wisdom of the crowd: Key lessons from news organizations using open APIs to ramp up R&amp;D" href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/04/wisdom-of-the-developer-crowd-key-lessons-from-news-organizations-using-open-apis-to-ramp-up-rd/">Wisdom of the (developer) crowd: Key lessons from news organizations using open APIs to ramp up R&amp;D</a>.<p></p>
This analysis is a summary of a paper by<a title="Seth Lewis" href="http://sethlewis.org/">Seth Lewis</a>, professor at University of Minnesota, and <a title="Tanja Altamurto" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tanja-aitamurto">Tanja Aitamurto</a>, a Finish PH.D student at Stanford, that was presented at the International Symposium on Online Journalism earlier this month.<p></p>
After studying the approaches of the four biggest players with open APIs are <a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">NPR</a>, <a title="The New York Times" href="http://developer.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>, <a title="The Guardian" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform">The Guardian</a>, and <a title="USA Today" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a>, Lewis and Aitamurto came away with five key lessons:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Open APIs can serve as external R&amp;D labs</li>
	<li>Open APIs present a revenue opportunity</li>
	<li>Open APIs help weave news organizations into the fabric of the web</li>
	<li>Open APIs create an ecosystem effect</li>
	<li>Open APIs can be a challenge, especially within the news organization</li>
</ul>
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/journalism/the_guardian.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /> Lewis and Aitamurto conclude that Open APIs are not the solution to all of the news industries problems, but they are significant step toward a form of online publishing that is in sync with the web, and also allow publishers to take advantage of thewisdomof the (developer) crowd for research &amp; development.<p></p>
These new approaches offer a first glimpse of what <a title="Open Innovation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation">open innovation</a> using APIs could bring to the news business when it comes to revenue and partnerships.<p></p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hackeducation.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I've been watching my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>, evolve her online presence as a freelance writer working for <a title="ReadWriteWeb" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/author/audrey-watters.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>, <a title="O'Reilly" href="http://radar.oreilly.com/audreyw/">O'Reilly</a>, <a title="NPR Mindshift" href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/">NPR Mindshift</a>, and other high profile blogs.
<p></p><a title="@AudreyWatters" href="http://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters">@AudreyWatters</a> has large Twitter following, however she keeps her Facebook very private.
<p></p>A growing portion of her user base are sending her Facebook friend requests, because she keeps her profile private, she doesn't accept. So naturally she created a <a title="Facebook page" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Audrey-Watters/100999103321790">Facebook page</a>.
<p></p>I watched her install the Facebook <a title="like social-plugin" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/">like social plug-in</a> to the single.php file, which will display it on each blog post, and added an <a title="activity feed social plug-in" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/activity/">activity feed social plug-in</a> to the sidebar of her blog. She runs her blog on Wordpress, and was able to do this easily.
<p></p>Facebook social plug-ins make your site social, but by using the <a title="Open Graph Protocol" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/">Open Graph Protocol</a> she was able to offer a deeper integration with Facebook. By having her blog integrated with the Open Graph API she is able to push content to her "fans" Facebook wall, increasing the reach of her blog to their social streams.
<p></p>Audrey got her inspiration to do this from the <a title="Journalist on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/journalist">Journalist on Facebook</a> fan page, a page created by Facebook to educate journalists about best practices using Facebook to disseminate information.
<p></p>I see Facebook doing two things to encourage this kind of API usage:<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook_logo-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>API User Targetin</strong>g - Going beyond the current definition of partner and (internal and external)l developer focus, and identifying other target groups of users beyond the developer community, and providing a Facebook page and other information for a target group.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>API Embed Strategy</strong> - Facebook has a great API embed strategy, providing a suite of embeddable tools that any user can use to make their sites social -- extending their sites reach to Facebook, while also expanding Facebook's presence on to other sites.
     </li>
</ul>I'm seeing shifts in many APIs lately to a more embeddable approach, such as <a title="Twitter Web Intents" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/simpler-twitter-api-integration-with-web-intents/">Twitter's Web Intents</a>, and <a title="LinkedIn Evolution of its Developer Platform" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/13/linkedin-api-platform-and-the-evolution-of-the-api/">LinkedIn's evolution of its developer platform</a>.
<p></p>In addition to an embed strategy, Facebook is creating pages and other resources targeting specific user groups. This is a potentially powerful combination for attracting new users and extending the reach of Facebook across the web.

        <span class="post-date">15 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Freshbooks_610x564.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a title="Sample Code Libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">Sample code libraries</a> are an essential part of an API ecosystem. They give developers a head start when integrating their applications with an API.<p></p>
I've explored the concept of <a title="letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/01/use-your-community-to-build-api-code-libraries/">letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries</a>. Doing this may create a more engaged community and give developers a sense of ownership and attachment to the API.<p></p>
As I <a title="reviewed the Freshbooks API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/13/freshbooks-api-review/">reviewed the Freshbooks API</a>, I noticed they have a very community-driven API code samples area.<p></p>
The Freshbooks API provides client libraries in Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl, JavaScript, ActionScript, Java, .NET, and C++, as well as plug-ins for popular frameworks like Zend, Drupal and Symphony.<p></p>
Many of the <a title="client libraries and plug-ins" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/sample-code/">client libraries and plug-ins</a> are built by the Freshbooks API community, such as:
<blockquote><img style="padding-bottom: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developers/ryan-szrama.jpg" alt="" width="50" align="right" /><em>Drupal plugin by <a title="Ryan Szrama" href="http://drupal.org/user/49344">Ryan Szrama</a>.  Szrama is an active member of the Drupal community.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><img style="padding-bottom: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developers/matt-culbreth.jpg" alt="" width="50" align="right" /><em>Python client libraries by <a title="Matt Culbreth" href="http://mattculbreth.com/index.html">Matt Culbreth</a>, a software developer in Marietta, Georgia USA.</em></blockquote>
By encouraging your API developers to build code samples, plug-ins, and code libraries, you can get necessary tools built for an API.  But just as importantly, you're building community and providing a much needed spotlight for your developers.  This in turn helps them be successful in their careers.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/washington-crossing-the-delaware-cropped.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />We are witnessing some <a title="tremendous growth in the number of new web APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">tremendous growth in the number of new Web APIs</a>.  <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, for example, added 1000 new APIs to its directory over the last year.<p></p>
Many of these APIs are brand new and have very few code samples or libraries to go with them.<p></p>
These new APIs represent a huge opportunity for developers to stake a claim within these communities -- to build their portfolios and their resumes.<p></p>
Recently Google released their <a title="Google Cloud Print Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a>.   The only thing available was some documentation describing the handful of API endpoints for managing printers and print jobs.<p></p>
I went to work trying to understand Google's vision of cloud printing, and I wrote a simple PHP class for working with Google Cloud Print.   I published on <a title="Github - Google Cloud Print" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Google-Cloud-Print-Proxy">Github</a> and <a title="Google Code - Google Cloud Print" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-print-proxy/">Google Code</a> and blogged about my work.<p></p>
By creating a PHP class for Google Cloud Print I established myself as an early mover in the space, and I attracted attention to my work. Even Google noticed and someone from Google contacted me.<p></p>
Since Google Cloud Print was so new, and they are actively encouraging community participation, there was an opportunity for me establish a presence.<p></p>
Many API providers are taking a similiar <a title="community-driven approach to building their API code samples and libraries" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/15/community-driven-api-code-samples-and-libraries/">community-driven approach to building their API code samples and libraries</a>.  Within these communities, there are windows of opportunities for developers to claim their territory, get a little of the spotlight, while building their portfolios and resumes along the way.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/linkedin/LinkedIn-Developer-Network.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a title="LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> refreshed its <a title="LinkedIn Developer Platform" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/">developer platform</a> recently, updating its <a title="RESTful API" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/community/apis">RESTful API</a> and <a title="JavaScript API" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/community/jsapi">JavaScript API</a>.<p></p>
A noticeable change, was its continued evolution towards a more plug and play API environment.<p></p>
When you visit the <a title="LinkedIn Developer Area" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/index.jspa">LinkedIn developers area</a>, the first option on the menu is plug-ins, and the main page is totally dominated by embeddable profile tools.<p></p>
The RESTful API and Javascript API are only accessible off a single menu option, the community has a clear focus on courting non-developer LinkedIn users.<p></p>
With the rise in popularity of RESTful APIs and JavaScript, we are seeing a explosion in <a title="Widget, Embeds, Plug-In" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/06/allow-api-users-to-embed-content-with-oembed/">widgets, embeds, plug-ins</a> and other copy / paste code that any tech savvy user can deploy.<p></p>
Attracting the developer community to new APIs can be tough.  Programmers tend to be drawn to exciting, new, and shiny APIs that provide challenges and new opportunities.   The business and professional focus of LinkedIn doesn't quite put the "shiny" in API.<p></p>
LinkedIn shows an understanding of its user base, and the best way to provide API tools that these tech savvy users can copy and paste on their web site, social networks, and other applications.

Being the forward thinkers they are, they say:
<blockquote><em>If there's an app there's an API, so we've made ours available to everyone...</em></blockquote>
The <a title="GitHub Jobs API" href="http://jobs.github.com/api">GitHub Jobs API</a> allows you to search, view, and create jobs with JSON over HTTP.<p></p>
The APIalso provides support for JSONP, by appending ?callback=myFunction to any API request, it will wrap the response in a function call to myFunction. This is useful when making requests to the GitHub Jobs API using JavaScript.<p></p>
Nothing to revolutionary, or noteworthy about the API, except Github is just way cool, and I love their perspective that, if there is an app there is an API.

        <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2011</span>
        <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Freshbooks_610x564.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I am slowly working my way through <a title="hundreds of APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">hundreds of APIs</a> and doing business reviews of their approach to delivering their APIs.<p></p>
At API Evangelist I'm focused on the business of APIs, with a minor focus on the technology behind those APIs.  So when I publish a business review of an API, I will add it to my API database, then move on.<p></p>
That is, unless I identify a story -- an innovative approach, monetization strategy, or anything that I feel needs to be talked about in more detail.<p></p>
While reviewing the <a title="Freshbooks API" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks API</a> I found three notable building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong><a title="Application Billing" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/billing/">Application Billing</a></strong> - A built in billing and payment framework for Freshbook applications and beyond</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Webhooks" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/webhooks/">Webhooks</a></strong> - Framework for enabling application callbacks, URLs where the Freshbook system can send notifications to third party applications</li>
	<li><a title="Freshbooks Add-On Store" href="http://community.freshbooks.com/addons/"><strong>FreshBooks Add-on Stor</strong>e</a> - Application store and development platform for developers to build custom apps, showcase,  and sell to Freshbook customers.</li>
</ul>
<a title="Self-Service Application Frameworks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">Self-Service Application Frameworks</a> like the Freshbooks Add-On Store are growing more common.  I've talked about similar systems from <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> and <a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a>.  The Freshbooks Add-On store is not 100% self-service, but it is close.
<a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/freshbooks-leaf.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
Webhooks are nothing new, but Freshbook offers a standardized approach to deploying web-hooks that makes them easy for developer to use.<p></p>
A built in payment system is definitely a notable <a title="API Building Block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">API building block</a>.  Providing developers with a baked-in payment system for handling application monetization is very innovative.<p></p>
Where do these three building blocks fit into the big picture?   I try to build profiles for common API building blocks, I don't have profiles for self-service application frameworks, webhooks, and payment systems, but as I evaluate more I will define these as more innovative building blocks for API owners to use.<p></p>
I will definitely be keeping an eye on the <a title="Freshbook" href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">Freshbook</a> approach to their API.

        <img src="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/buddies.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />There are many  approaches to building an API ecosystem.  Some approach it more like building an API community, and others as growing an API ecosystem.<p></p>
<a title="Howard Liptzin" href="http://twitter.com/howardliptzin#">Howard Liptzin</a>, at Avatar Industries prefers a more <a title="organic approach to growing an API community" href="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/2011/02/28/developer-communities/">organic approach growing an API community</a>.  In his own words:
<blockquote><em>What you'll want to do is to create the conditions for a community to form, thrive, produce and grow.</em></blockquote>
Liptzin emphasises gardening over engineering, not managing your community, more facilitate. Before you even start, Liptzin offers a little advice:
<blockquote><em>Make sure your API actually solves a problem that merits solving!</em></blockquote>
Then Liptzin identifies five areas to address when growing your API ecosystem:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Creation</li>
	<li>Activation</li>
	<li>Retention</li>
	<li>Productivity</li>
	<li>Growth</li>
</ul>
It is great to see other API owners and evangelists share their philosophies and approach to growing their community.<p></p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I keep stumbling across innovative approaches to using Web APIs, for non-developers.
<p></p>The other day I wrote about <a title="Quantifying your social media impact, using Google Docs and social media" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/apis-are-not-just-for-developers/">quantifying your social media impact,</a> using Google Docs and social media APIs, by<a title="Tom Critchlow" href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/30546">Tom Critchlow</a>.

<p></p><a title="Richard Orelup" href="http://twitter.com/#!/ripsup">Richard Orelup</a> came up with this little hack in response to this tweet:
<blockquote>
     <em>So in all of Twitter-dom, there is seriously no tool that archives a day's tweets in a sortable fashion?</em>
</blockquote>Using the <a title="importXML() function" href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=75507">importXML() function</a> he pulls Twitter updates from the <a title="Twitter API" href="http://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter API</a> and stores in this <a title="Google Spreadsheet" href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AncshzELR0ZHdDdoSWJKc0JtWjBYT0NpX0V6dlhzUUE&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CJr2ztYJ#gid=0">Google Spreadsheet</a>.

An API owner should have an established monetization strategy for their API, and it should outline how revenue will be generated.<p></p>
Having a way to track and attribute sales to your API developers makes a lot of sense, and sharing revenue with developers will ensure they will keep building new ways to attract users to a service via the API.

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/blueprints.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />In my quest to fully understand the underlying principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), i'm re-reading Roy Thomas Fielding original dissertation, <a title="Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architecture" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>, where he first introduced the REST architectural style.
<p></p>His dissertation explored the junction of two disciplines in computer science: <em>software and networking</em>.
<p></p>He identifies that software research:
<blockquote>
     <em>...has long been concerned with the categorization of software designs and the development of design methodologies, but has rarely been able to objectively evaluate the impact of various design choices on system behavior.</em>
</blockquote>While networking research:
<blockquote>
     <em>...is focused on the details of generic communication behavior between systems and improving the performance of particular communication techniques, often ignoring the fact that changing the interaction style of an application can have more impact on performance than the communication protocols used for that interaction.</em>
</blockquote><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/parthenon.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Fieldings work was motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software. He wanted to rethink software design in the context of the World Wide Web.
<p></p>The World Wide Web is intended to be an Internet-scale, distributed system, interconnecting information networks across organizational boundaries, and cope with the demands of scalability and independent deployment of software.
<p></p>As Fielding states:
<blockquote>
     <em>REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.</em>
</blockquote>As I'm reading his abstract and introduction I can't help but think about where I stand as an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/api-evangelism-vs-developer-evangelism/">API Evangelist</a>, at the convergence of business and RESTful APIs.
<p></p>When RESTful APIs are applied to business, what does this look like? Is business currently restricted in the same ways as software? When business is operating on the World Wide Web do we need to consider the network more?
<p></p>Lots to consider at the intersection of business and RESTful APIs.

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/social-impact-graph.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />One of the reasons I believe <a title="APIs Are Growing so Popular" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">APIs are growing so popular</a> is they are getting easier, and easier to use.<p></p>
The main reason they are getting easier to use is due to the adoption of RESTful approaches when delivering APIs.<p></p>
Many APIs that use REST can be easily hacked by just changing values in the URL query string, instantly making APIs accessible by a wider audience<p></p>
Once users get past the confusing acronyms and jargon us programmers use, and realize whats going on, they can start accessing the data and functionality that's behind the curtain.<p></p>
RESTful APIs open up data and functionality to anyone, and we are starting to see a new breed of hackers from many disciplines including journalism, social media marketing, and government, to name a few.<p></p>
As technology becomes increasingly important in our every day lives, people can't wait for IT or programmers to deliver, savvy users start hacking on their own.<p></p>
A very innovative example of this I saw lately was by Social Media Strategist, <a title="Tom Critchlow" href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/30546">Tom Critchlow</a>.  Tom wrote a great post called, <a title="Using Tools &amp; APIs to Track Your Social Media Strategy" href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-to-track-your-social-media-strategy">Using Tools &amp; APIs To Track Your Social Media Strategy.</a>
<img src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/users/30546.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
Through a need to understand the impact of his social media efforts, he learned that he can query top social sites using their API to quantify the impact of his site(s).<p></p>
Then using Google Docs, along with with the power of <a title="Google App Scripts" href="http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/">Google App Scripts</a> he pulls counts for shares, likes, etc for his site using Social Media APIs.<p></p>
Using RESTful Social Media APIs, and Google Docs, he is able to hack these APIs, get the data he is looking for, store it in a spreadsheet, and then visualize it.<p></p>
His efforts truly represent the power of APIs, and how important it is that we deliver simple, RESTful interfaces that developers and non-developers can use in our every day business.

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-business.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I have found a voice through my blog, API Evangelism.<p></p>
I get asked why "API Evangelism" instead of "Developer Evangelism"?<p></p>
I see a significant difference:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Developer Evangelists</strong> spread awareness, and understanding of an API, or APIs, amongst the developer community.</li>
	<li><strong>API Evangelists</strong> spreads awareness, and understanding of an API, or APIs, amongst the developer and business community.</li>
</ul>
Developer evangelists are generally focused outwards, staying within the developer community and often times are, or have been developers themselves.  They understand the problems their developers face and provide resources, so they are successful using an API.<p></p>
As an API Evangelist I focus on everything a developer evangelist focuses on, but I also find myself selling the API and its benefits both externally and internally.<p></p>
If I see a potential use for an API, one that enhances the core business, I will build a prototype and get to work selling the appropriate department(s) on the benefits.<p></p>
In addition to selling internal business leaders on benefits of a specific API, I spend a lot of time educating external business leaders on the benefits of APIs in general.  Using a specific API (hopefully my own) for building the business case.<p></p>
We need more developer evangelists, but we also need armies of API evangelists who will teach the business masses of the benefits of APIs, and prepare them for the coming <a title="API Economy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-Apps-Marketplace.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />APIs have been influential in ushering in a new era of business development, dubbed <a title="BizDev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">BizDev 2.0</a>.   APIs empower new types of relationship to be built between a business and its partners or openly by public developers.<p></p>
Self-Service application platforms move this business development forward and introduces a third player into the game, platform partners.<p></p>
Platforms like <a title="Google Apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps</a>, and <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> not only deliver APIs, they provide a <a title="Self-Service Application Development Environment" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application development environment</a>, a place where third party businesses can access their users, and add value to their platform.<p></p>
Forward thinking businesses can bring their own APIs, and communities development power to these environments and create applications tailored specifically for Box.net or Google Apps Business, Government, Education and Non-Profit users.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/box-net-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
In some cases businesses can even create white label applications that other service providers quickly deploy their own branded applications on Box.net OpenBox, or Google Apps Marketplace.   Adding a potentially new wholesale layer to these API communities.<p></p>
APIs with a<a title="Self-Service Application Platforms" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">Self-Service Application Platform</a> introduces new forms of business development where businesses can leverage their own APIs, the APIs of others, even bundle them together to build applications that can reach entirely new audiences via platform partners.

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Tag-Cloud-API-PDF.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I'm spending time evaluating different types of APIs in various categories.
<p></p>I want to see how each provider delivers their API in similar categories, and potentially look for opportunities within those categories for new API services.
<p></p>I'm starting with PDF APIs.
<p></p>There are quite a few web APIs providing services to generate and work with PDFs.
<p></p>The first main group of APIs I notice are HTML to PDF conversion APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocRaptor" href="http://docraptor.com/documentation" target="_blank">DocRaptor</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Doculicious" href="http://docs.doculicious.com/api" target="_blank">Doculicious</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="html2PDF" href="http://webservice.htm2pdf.co.uk/htm2pdf.asm" target="_blank">htm2pdf</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Joliprint" href="http://joliprint.com/api/" target="_blank">Joliprint</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="HTM2PDF" href="http://www.html2pdf.biz/api.php" target="_blank">HTML2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Web2PDF" href="http://www.web2pdfconvert.com/pdf-api.aspx" target="_blank">Web2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF My URL" href="http://pdfmyurl.com/support/support.jsp" target="_blank">PDF My URL</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Crowd" href="http://pdfcrowd.com/html-to-pdf-api/" target="_blank">PDF Crowd</a>
     </li>
</ul>Next there are a couple of other PDF conversion tools:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/PDF_red.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Anything to PDF" href="http://api.danielprocter.com/" target="_blank">Anything to PDF</a> - Convert base 64 encoded data to PDF
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Alchemy" href="http://www.pdfalchemy.com/" target="_blank">PDF Alchemy</a> - Word to PDF
     </li>
</ul>Beyond document conversion I found two APIs for commenting and annotating PDFs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Crocodoc" href="http://crocodoc.com/api/" target="_blank">Crocodoc</a> - PDF commenting and collaboration
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Annotate" href="http://a.nnotate.com/api-reference.html" target="_blank">A.nnotate</a> - PDF annotation
     </li>
</ul>Then there was a single provider of PDF document signatures:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocuSign" href="http://www.docusign.com/developers-center/developers-center-overview" target="_blank">DocuSign</a>
     </li>
</ul>There are two clear leaders that provide more advanced PDF document management services:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Doxument" href="http://doxument.com/en/developer" target="_blank">Doxument</a> - HTML to PDF, OCR, Split PDF pages in separate images
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Docs " href="http://code.google.com/apis/documents/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> - File Conversion to PDF, OCR, translation
     </li>
</ul>With the ubiquitous nature of PDFs, and a wide range of desktop and web based PDF tools, I think there is a huge opportunity for new types of APIs in this area. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf-ocr.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> There are dozens of code libraries in various languages for manipulating PDFs. I would suggest some savvy developer:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Identify the most viable business uses for PDF APis
     </li>
     <li>Select the strong set of PDF language libraries
     </li>
     <li>Wrap in a RESTful wrapper
     </li>
     <li>Deploy on Amazon EC2 with PDF storage on Amazon S3
     </li>
</ul>PDF APis is one category of APIs that has huge opportunity for growth in the next couple of years.

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2011</span>
        When deploying an API, the interface is just the beginning. You need tools and resources to support the API. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/building_blocks.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> There are <a title="Common Building Blocks Used by APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks that are used by many existing APIs</a>, such as documentation, forums, code samples and other tools developers have come to expect from APIs.
<p></p>When selecting which <a title="Building Blocks to Use for an API Area" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks to use for an API area</a>, there are many things to consider. There are many opinions on which are essential, and this can vary from industry to industry.
<p></p>One thing everyone agrees is that <a title="Metrics and Analytics for an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">metrics and analytics for an API</a> are a must have.
<p></p>Beyond the common building blocks, many API owners are providing new innovative tools such as:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Application Showcase" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=180">Application Showcases</a>

     </li>
</ul>If you are planning an API and do not have much experience with API technology, or what building blocks you will need, you should talk to experienced API service providers such as <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, or <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>. These providers have a lot of experience, tools and services you can access to plan, develop, deploy, and manage your API.
<p></p>Even with the growth in the number of available APIs, and the number of service providers I do not see much in the way of open-source API building blocks available on the market yet. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/open.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> We need more innovation around development of open API building blocks. Think what <a title="Wordpress" href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> has done for blogging, and <a title="Heroku" href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> has done for cloud computing.
<p></p>The availablility of open API building blocks delivering the common, innovative and essential tools needed for APIs, would give a much needed boost to the entire industry.
<p></p>There is a lot of learning, exploration and trial and error to occur within the API space. Leaving this to occur within the hands of a few API service provider, or following the lead of major API players like Twitter and Google limits the opportunities for everybody involved.
<p></p>I would like to see more discussion and collaboration around building a community of open source API build blocks this year.

        All of us programmers have a preferred programming language. It is the language that we identify with and prefer to build projects in.
<p></p>When it comes to delivering an API area, one of the most important <a title="building blocks" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks</a> for getting programmers up and running are <a title="code language libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">language libraries</a>.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-social-coding-words.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /><a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that uses the Git revision control system.
<p></p>The site also provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and a network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.
<p></p>Github provides two main tools that can be used in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Github Repositories" href="http://help.github.com/create-a-repo/">Github Repositories</a></strong> - Git code repositories for various supporting areas of an API

     <li>
          <strong><a title="Gists" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a></strong> - Gist are a simple way to share snippets of code
     </li>
</ul>There are several ways to use Github repositories and Gists in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Documentation</strong> - Display example calls, requests, and responses using Gists
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Samples</strong> - Display code samples using Gists, and package up entire sets of code samples using Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Libraries</strong> - Package up official and community generated API code libraries as Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Prototypes</strong> - Publish API prototypes as Github repositories
     </li>
</ul><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-round.png" alt="" width="160" align="right" /> Github provides a way for API owners to manage a large number of code samples, libraries and prototypes, in a way that allows developers to fork and contribute code as part of the community.
<p></p>The social spects of Github extends a API community to the existing, vibrant developer community that exists at Github.
<p></p>Its easier for an API to participate within the existing Github developer community, rather then expect developers to come and participate in a community built around the API.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/php.gif" alt="" width="125" align="right" />An important tone of my blog is not to ever say any API owner should, or developers have to do anything. My role as API evangelist is to observe, discuss and explore the business of APIs.
<p></p>I was discussing best practices around API ecosystems with a prominent developer the other night an a O'Reilly Web 2.0 event. He had an interesting perspective on how to build community around an API. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/ruby-logo.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> Building your API community can start with your code libraries.
<p></p>His recommendation was that API owners should focus on building a simple and standardized API that provides true value, and do not build your own API code libraries.
<p></p>Let your community build, and contribute code libraries in their preferred programming language.
<p></p>His argument was that if an API owner releases an official set of libraries, the innovation stops there. Nobody will build any further code libraries and possibly improve on them. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/python.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> By allowing the community to build API libraries it gives you a chance to put the spotlight on developers, increases the chance for competition, spurs innovation and developers will rise to the occasion.
<p></p>In some cases an API owner may even contract with a developer to build the API code libraries, but do not endorse them as official. This way developers see opportunity to build upon them and improve them, if they feel so inclined.
<p></p>I found this a very innovative approach to empowering your developer community, encouraging innovation, and building community within your API ecosystem.

        NPR announced their new <a title="NPR News Application for Android 2.0" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/04/01/134951191/android-2-0-rebuilt-redesigned?ft=1&amp;f=91000411">NPR News application for Android 2.0</a> today.

Normally I wouldn't cover just any new app or feature release, but there is more of a story here than just a new mobile app.  I am interested in the way they went about designing it.<p></p>
Last summer they submitted designs for the new Android application to the <a title="NPR open source community" href="http://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">open source community</a> to discuss how to best move forward with designing the mobile app.<p></p>
They gathered feedback from users and built in what the community said was most important, such as new player, universal navigation, as well as adding programs with live streams and the ability to favorite stations.<p></p>
They are working to <a title="publishing the source code back to the community repository" href="http://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">publishing the source code back to the community repository</a>, keeping the project open source.<p></p>
Of course this is NPR, a public entity, but their approach to mobile application design using their API is  a model that can be used by other API providers.

<a href="http://www.granatapet.de/">GranataPet</a>, a German dog food manufacturer, created a <a href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/03/31/api-highlight-a-special-for-our-four-legged-friends/">billboard that dispenses a treat for your dog when you check in to it using Foursquare</a>.<p></p>
Think about the possibilities when you have signs, billboards, and other types of display that either respond or dispense something when you interact via your mobile phone and an API.<p></p>
Opens up a whole lot of possibilities when you have devices that monitor APIs for specific triggers, respond accordingly, and then developers build software on top of those APIs.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/intents-summary.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Since the <a title="Twitter OAuth Apocalypse" href="http://twitter.com/#!/SNFLabs/status/16426051477">Twitter OAuth Apocalypse</a> integrating tweets into a web page requires writing an OAuth application for even the simplest of Twitter integrations, like replying, retweeting and favoriting.
<p></p>Twitter just released a new <a title="Simpler API Called Web Intents" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/intents">simpler API called Web Intents</a> that makes Tweets more interactive when you display on the web.
<p></p>The Twitter Web Intents API provides a JavaScript interface for adding Reply, Retweet, and Favorite links to a specific Tweet:
<p></p><script src="https://gist.github.com/896788.js?file=Twitter%20Web%20Intent%20API" type="text/javascript">

<p></p>Twitter Web Intents API is an example of a growing trend of simpler tools that make APIs accessible beyond the developer community.
<p></p>REST has simplified APIs making them hackable by journalists, data scientists, and any other tech savvy users that may not be able to program but can understand manipulating a URL query string to get the data they are looking for.
<p></p>More API providers are considering development of simpler APIs, snippets, widgets, and embeddable code that expand their API ecosystem to a wider audience.

        <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-analytics.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I document a lot of the <a title="Common Building Blocks Used By API Providers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks used by API providers</a>. These are common tools used across many industries and types of APIs to build their ecosystem.
<p></p>I hesitate to ever say any of these common building blocks are essential, because every API potentially has different requirements.
<p></p>However, one building block that is essential for <span class="c1">every</span> API, is metrics and analytics.
<p></p>API owners should me measuring every aspect of their API and its community, and be constantly reassessing their strategy based upon what is going on in real-time.
<p></p>API analytics is what service providers like <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a> and <a href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a> bring to the table. Mashery and Apigee proxy your API to deliver analytics, while 3Scale provides a plug to gather data for reporting on.
<p></p>All three of these providers charge you per transaction for this service. <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Google-Analytics-Charts-Stack.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> To my knowledge there is no provider of an API analytics tool that is free, and plug and play.
<p></p>With the current explosion of APIs being deployed, there is a huge opportunity for someone to provide a free API analytics service that gathers and measures API usage.
<p></p>Think Google Analytics for APIs. A single line of server side code, with a variety of language kits, that will measure all requests on an API, its community, and provide a rich set of reports for API owners.
<p></p>This could probably be done with the <a title="Google Analytics API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/home.html">Google Analytics API</a>, I will have to play with more.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/03/27/a-sensible-approach-to-the-twitter-api-ecosystem/">A Sensible Approach to the Twitter API Ecosystem</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I just finished reading two more posts on the recent changes to the <a title="Twitter API Terms of Service" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">Twitter API terms of service</a>.  There are a lot of opinions on whether Twitter was right or wrong in their approach to reign in their developer community.<p></p>
I understand Twitter wanting to take back some control over its ecosystem and monetize its world.<p></p>
I do not understand why people are demonizing Open APIs or the developer community.  Both made Twitter what it is today.<p></p>
I wanted to put some thoughts down on how I'd engineer a more sensible approach to the Twitter API ecosystem.<p></p>
<strong>Brand Control:</strong> Twitter needs to keep expanding its <a title="branding resource area" href="http://twitter.com/about/resources/logos">branding resource area</a> where users can come to get CSS, HTML, images, widgets, borders and many other higher quality assets that can be used by the community and maintain a quality level of brand control for Twitter.<p></p>
API access and usage.  Let's create some free and paid access levels:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Developer</strong> - A free low volume access level that allows developers to play with the API, but only allows a minimum number of API calls per day.</li>
	<li><strong>Professional</strong> - A slightly higher level of access meant for API consumer that may be building an application, but probably used just for professional purposes.</li>
	<li><strong>Business</strong> - API access for businesses that use Twitter for their own brand, and require a higher level of API requests, but are willing to pay for it.</li>
	<li><strong>Commercial</strong> - A pay-for-what-you-use model, in true cloud computing fashion, with the possibility of volume discounts.</li>
	<li><strong>Academic</strong> - A free research-based access account for scholars to use in their academic projects.</li>
</ul>
With clearly defined Twitter API access levels, Twitter can start making money and controlling usage of their API.<p></p>
<strong>Ad Network</strong>:  The next approach to monetization and control over the Twitter ecoystem could be a Twitter advertising network modeled after Google Adsense and Adwords.<p></p>
Let's call it the Dickbar Advertising Network.  Require all client and web interfaces to have some sort of advertising network deployment.  You could have Dickbars, Dickboxes, and Dickheaders in all shapes and sizes for developers to deploy.<p></p>
Twitter can still advertise, make money, and control their network.  Developers could make money too.  There would be added incentive for developers to build quality applications, and be able to be sustain their work through advertising revenue.<p></p>
With a sensible terms of service, branding guidelines, tiered API access levels, and an advertising network, Twitter could retain control over its network, protect its brand, monetize and ensure a higher quality user experience.<p></p>
This could all be done while still respecting and harnessing the passionate developer community of the Twitter ecosystem that made Twitter what it is today.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/apigee-api-console.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I am seeing more API owners and service providers launching REST API explorers lately:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee Console</a></li>
	<li><a title="Salesforce" href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003IjwLEAS">Salesforce</a></li>

	<li><a title="Infochimps Data Explorer" href="http://www.infochimps.com/">Infochimps</a></li>
</ul>
These REST API explorers allow users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a web interface.<p></p>
<a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee Console</a> even allows you to Authenticate with APIs using Basic Auth or OAuth.<p></p>
The simplicity of REST has contributed to the extreme growth in the number of Web APIs in the last year, and API explorers are going to fuel this growth in 2011 and beyond.<p></p>
API explorers put the power of Web APIs in the hands of non-developers, allowing journalists, students, politicians, and any tech savvy Internet user to access the data and functionality available via APIs.<p></p>
Once a couple of these providers adds an export JSON to Google Docs or download to Excel, its a whole new ballgame.<p></p>
With an API explorer any user will be able to pull data from one or many APIs, export to a Google Spreadsheet and build visualizations to extract their own meaning from the data they've gathered via any REST API.

<p></p>Infochimps is taking large data sets in areas like<a title="Census Data" href="http://www.infochimps.com/tags/Census">census</a>, <a title="Housing" href="http://www.infochimps.com/tags/Housing">housing</a>, and <a title="Education" href="http://www.infochimps.com/search?query=education">education</a> and making them available via an API.
<p></p>Also Infochimps is bundling these data sets and RESTful APIs with their API Explorer. This allows even non-developers to play with large data sets.
<p></p>Some new API calls they've built are:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Qwerly" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/qwerly-profile-search">Qwerly</a> -</strong> You know when you Google someone's name and through some SEO magic, you can find all of that person's social media profiles? Imagine being able to easily integrate these presences into your applications. Query a person's Twitter handle and the Qwerly API call will return any of his or her social media presences (Facebook, Friendfeed, Flickr, etc) that it can find.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Twitter People Search" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/twpeoplesearch">Twitter People Search</a> -</strong> Let's face it. Finding new cool people on Twitter can be a bit taxing. Query any word using Twitter People Search and find any user who uses that word in their bio. Looking for other data lovers? Check. Looking for people who like the Green Bay Packers? Check. Looking for Bieber lovers on Twitter? You'll have no problem there. ;-)
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="British National Corpus" rel="wikipedia" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-frequencies-from-the-british-national-corpus">British National Corpus</a> -</strong> Word lists are very popular on our site and we couldn't pass this one up. This API call allows you to access the British National Corpus, a 100-million-word text corpus of samples of written and spoken English from a wide range of sources. The corpus covers British English the late twentieth century from a wide variety of genres with the intention that it be a representative sample of spoken and written British English of that time.
     </li>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/03/22/twitter-lendle-and-the-state-of-the-open-api-ecosystem/">Twitter, Lendle and the State of the Open API Ecosystem</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />As such, there has been much discussion recently about Open APIs and whether or not third party developers are wise or foolish to build their businesses on someone else's platform. The concern stems from a number of reasons, least of which being Twitter's pronouncements about the <a title="&quot;Rules of the Road&quot; for Its Ecosystem" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">"rules of the road" for its ecosystem</a>, and now <a title="Lendles announcement that Amazon has revoked its access to the Amazon API" href="http://lendle.me/">Lendle's announcement that Amazon has revoked its access to the Amazon API</a>.
<p></p>The reactions to both Twitter and Amazon have been pretty strong. And while I do think Twitter is making some serious mistakes with its approach to its API and developer ecosystem, we might be making some mistakes of our own if we lump the Lendle/Amazon issue in to concerns about Twitter. Is Amazon shutting down apps that are poaching on its ecosystem? That's not clear.
<p></p>As it stands, everyone seems to be stirring the pot and feeding the hysteria around the perils of using Open APIs, or rather, the dangers of relying on them for your businesses..
<p></p>But it seems to me that there is much more going on here. While APIs may be the focus -- the way in which apps and websites are connecting to a larger platform -- we're also looking at larger conflicts with new business models, whether those are publishing and DRM in the case of Amazon and Lendle or whether those conflicts are around a startup still struggling to monetize its core business. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> This isn't to say that there aren't precautions that people should take when building on an Open API. But when I hear some of the FUD lately, much of this echoes what we were hearing (and still hear, I suppose) about cloud computing.
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>Your server or storage could disappear at any moment, because its virtualized!</strong> Sure, as would any server or storage, that's why I have plan A and B, and in the clouds I have C &amp; D as well. I plan for failure no matter where my infrastructure is located.</em>
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <strong><em><strong>Your data is not secure in the clouds!</strong></em></strong> <em>Security is a concern everywhere, make sure and have thorough security plan that is revisited regularly.</em>
</p>
<p></p>The naysayers are now making their arguments about APIs
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>Your API access could be shut off at any time!</strong> I don't think this is any secret about APIs. This is why there are terms of service that you must read and follow. Your application needs to take this into consideration with ALL the APIs it uses -- whether they're from developer-friendly companies or not, and then operate accordingly.</em>
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>An API owner could decide to poach business from its community at any time!</strong> Again I don't think its a secret. APIs are a form of R&amp;D for companies, this is open territory for everyone to innovate. In perfect world an API owner communicates openly with developers and partners about opportunities in the ecosystem, plans to monetize, and where partner opportunities exist.</em> I'm not saying these dangers aren't real. They are. What I'm saying is that none of this should come as a shock. You build and plan around these potential issues just as you would with any other technologies you invest in. What if Google Apps goes down? What if your supplier goes out of business? What if FedEx doesn't arrive on time?
</p>
<p></p>Open APIs aren't really the problem here. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/lendle-logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /> If a company is built entirely around a single API ecosystem, maybe the owners should consider diversification into other areas, expanding their business. The fault is with the business strategy; it's not the fault of the API.
<p></p>If an API ecosystem grows large enough where business opportunities develop that are ripe for picking by companies or poaching by the APIs owners, then the responsibility is on the API owner to establish a partner strategy that considers and includes ecosystem developers. It's not the fault of the API.
<p></p>Technology is transforming a lot of industries right now. Open APIs are at the heart of this. <em>This is a good thing</em>.
<p></p>Open APIs drive developer and business innovation, and as this occurs there are going to challenges with monetization, business strategies, licensing, ownership, security, and privacy.
<p></p>Let's not blame the API or scare people off from using APIs by freaking out about the dangers. Let's identify the pitfalls, understand their value and establish healthy ways to integrate with APIs, to build healthy business and vibrant ecosystems around them.
