[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Rdio-Logo-Gradient.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />][1]I'm starting to see more API providers working together to attract developers to their platforms.

As an API Evangelist I look for other APIs that enhance the [Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API][2], and try to figure out how I can leverage this, or at least tell the story.

[Google Cloud Print Services Interface][3] and the [Box.net][4] API have been two of my favorites so far. I also just finished a blog post about [creating classroom training materials with Crocodoc and Mimeo Connect][5].

Today I saw that[Rdio][1], the social music service [announce their partnership][6] with [The Echo Nest][7], a music intelligence platform.

They are partnering behind the scenes, but I'm sure the API is the driving force behind this relationship.[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/the-echo-nest.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" />][7]

APIs enable new types of partnerships, and even allow API providers to work together and offer a more collective value.

What other APIs do you think compliment each other, and should consider partnering?
