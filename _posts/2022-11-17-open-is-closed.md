The other day I was looking for a domain name to host APIs and related services for various R&D projects I'm involved in. When that's the case, I usually stick to the classic .com and .org top level domains, but though it would be good for a change to explore some of the most exotic ones that are now available.

So I went to the wikipedia page listing all the [Internet top-level domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains) for inspiration, and though it would be brilliant to go with a ".open" option. My next step was naturally to visit the GoDaddy website, where my domains are registered, and do a quick search for the one I wanted. Unfortunately it was not available, and surprisingly neither any of the variations I could think of. I basically quickly realized that none of the .open domains were… Odd I told myself. Maybe GoDaddy was not the registration authority? 

This naturally intrigued me and, after a bit of digging, landed on the IANA page with the [delegation record](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/open.html) for .open, which, to my surprise, is owned by "American Express Travel Related Services, Inc". Seriously? Amex? Even odder. Not wanting to give this up, I reached out to both the administrative and technical contacts, and, after a couple of attempts, I was told that "The TLD .open is a brand TLD and isn't open for public registration". 

A quick Google search for "brand TLD" lead me to the [ICANN Wiki](https://icannwiki.org/Brand_TLD) page explaining that "A Brand TLD is an innovative type of top level domain name (TLD) that is made possible through the implementation of ICANN's new gTLD Program. A Brand TLD provides the opportunity for branded corporations to use their corporate name as their website's top-level identifier instead of using a more traditional .com or biz."

Why did Amex apply for this and how was it accepted as a brand TLD for a credit card company profoundly puzzles me. I would love to hear from anyone who has an explanation. But guess this closes the door on my idea of getting a cool .open domain name.
