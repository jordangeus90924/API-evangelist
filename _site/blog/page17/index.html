        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-microphone.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/7/2538031/zypr-launches-voice-control-for-every-device">Shortly after the Zypr voice API came on to the scene in 2011</a>, I launched <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">my research into voice APIs</a>. Like many other areas of the API universe, voice has come in and out of focus for me, something I think will take much longer to unfold, than any of us could have ever imagined. Zypr quickly ran out of steam, and other similar solutions have come and gone over the last couple years as well, leaving my research pretty scattered across many different concepts of how voice and APIs are colliding--lacking any real coherency.</p>
<p>I took a moment last week to take a fresh look at my <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice API research</a>, because of a comment by Steven Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>), the CEO of <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>. Its not an exact quote, but Steve spoke about how voice is the future of API consumption, after he had attended the AWS:Reinvent in Las Vegas. I agree with him. Voice APIs is a topic that has been significantly stimulated with the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/echo">introduction of the Amazon Echo platform</a>, but I also feel also coincides with a critical mass of available API driven resources that will deliver some of the value these platforms are promising users.</p>
<p>Voice recognition has always been something that leaves a lot to be desired--think Siri. Even with these challenges there are many dimensions to the voice API discussion, and with the amount of resources now available via simple APIs in 2015, I feel we are reaching a more fertile, and friendly time for voice solutions to return the value end-users desire. We now have a rich playing field of weather, news, stocks, image, video, podcast, and other data, content, rich media, and programmatic resources, which can be linked to specific voice commands--something we didn't have before.</p>
<p>While there is still so much work to be done, but I agree with Steve's vision, that voice will play an increasingly significant role as an API client. I would add that like mobile, or the recent wave of wearables, voice will have special constraints when it comes to API design, further requiring API providers keep their APIs simple, and reflect how users will experience them, not just being a SELECT * FROM table WHERE q = 'search', with a URL bound to it.</p>
<p>I think the API providers who are further along in their journey, will get a boost as voice evolves as an API client, and voice enabled app developers are able to easily integrate valuable API driven resources into their solutions. Even with my new found optimism about voice APIs, I still think we are years away from voice solutions actually living up to, even a small portion of the hype they seem to get over the years. Regardless, I'll be working to keep a closer eye on things, and will be sharing via <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">my voice API research</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-puzzle-round.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been tagging companies that I come across in my research, and stories that I find with the term "orchestration" for some time now. Some of this overlaps with what we know as cloud-centric orchestration using Puppet or Chef, but I am specifically looking for how we orchestrate across the API lifecycle which I feel overlaps with cloud orchestration, but pushes into some new realms.</p>
<p>As I'm carving off my orchestration research, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/06/some-thoughts-for-the-coming-wave-of-api-hubs-garages-and-workbenches/">I am also spending time reviewing a newer breed of what I'm calling API hubs, workspaces, or garages</a>. Over the last year, I've broken out <a href="http://ide.apievangelist.com/">IDE research</a> from my overall <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API Discovery</a> research, and <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDK</a> from my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API Management</a> research, and <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">client</a> from my API Integration research. In parallel with an API-centric way of life, I want all my research to be as modular as possible, allowing me to link it together into meaningful ways that help me better understand how the space works, or could work.</p>
<p>Now that I'm thinking terms of orchestration, something that seems to be a core characteristic of these new&nbsp;API hubs, work spaces, or garages--I'm seeing a possibly new vision of the API life-cycle. I'm going to organize these new hubs, work spaces, and garages under my <a href="http://ide.apievangelist.com/">IDE research</a>. I am starting to believe that these new work spaces are just the next generation IDE meant to span the entire API life-cycle--we will see how this thought evolves.</p>
<p>This new approach to API IDEs gives us design, and development capabilities, but also allows us to mock and deploy APIs. You can generate API documentation, and SDKs, and I'm seeing hints of orchestration using Github and Docker. I'm seeing popular clients like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> evolve to be more like a API life-cycle IDE, and I'm also seeing API design tooling like <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet Studio</a> invest in HTTP clients to expand beyond just design, adding live client interaction, testing, and other vital life-cycle elements.</p>
<p>None of my research is absolute. It is meant to help me make sense of the space, and give me a way to put news I curate, companies I discover, and open source tooling into meaningful buckets that might also help you define a meaningful version of your own API life-cycle. I apologize if this post is a little incoherent, but it is how I work through my thoughts around the API space, how things are expanding and evolving in real-time--something I hope will come into better focus in coming weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">I am keynoting APIStrat in Austin next month</a>, and it is a big deal for me. Ok, its my event, and I probably shouldn't be that excited, but it is the first time I've ever keynoted it. ;-) It is the sixth edition of APIStrat, and Steve asked if I wanted to keynote, which I dismissed because it seemed too ego, but when he pushed back, I realized that I would be stoked to keynote.</p>
<p>I'm excited about the preparation for the talk, and trying to think about how I can incorporate my research, and working API operations into it. <a href="http://defragcon.com/">I'm also keynoting Defrag the week before</a>, so both my keynotes will march in lockstep. They won't be the same keynote, but they will reflect what I'm seeing across the API space right now, allowing me to use both venues as vehhicle to move my research forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apistrat-austin-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>My Defrag talk is titled, "<em>The 17 Stops Along The Modern API Lifecycle"</em>, which I'm guessing will grow as I prepare both these talks, but it will also be the same core theme of my APIStrat keynote. Over the last five years, the API space has been slowly coming into focus for me, and in 2015 I feel like I'm really starting to see some coherency in how things are working together, making for a clearer API life-cycle for me to reference.</p>
<p>Storytelling on my blog helps me work through my ideas, and doing it on stage at Defrag and APIStrat will help me organize them in a way that can benefit the entire API community. I haven't been this excited about two talks in a while, and I'm looking forward to sharing where my research has gone in 2015, on stage at two conferences I really enjoy supporting.</p>
<p>See you in Broomfield and Austin folks!</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/use-apisjson-to-organize-my-swagger-defined-apis-running-in-docker-containers/">I started playing with the possibilities when it comes to API deployment using virtual containers like Docker early this year</a>, exploring the constraints this approach to API deployment introduced, on my own infrastructure. The process got my gears turning, when it comes to deploying very simple data, content, and algorithmic APIs into any environment that runs Docker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As 2015 has progressed, I'm seeing containers emerge as part of more stops along the API life-cycle, specifically in <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a> and <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>. A new one that just came across my radar is <a href="https://apiplug.com/">API PLUG</a>. I haven't played with the containerized API deployment solution yet, but after watching video, and looking through site it seems in line with what I'd expect to see from a next generation, containerized, API deployment solution.</p>
<p><a href="https://apiplug.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-plug-screenshot.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/23/reconciling-my-api-orchestration-research-with-the-evolution-of-ide-sdk-and-http-clients/">Overlapping with my previous post on reconciling API orchestration</a>, I'm seeing several stops along API lifecycle present in API PLUG, beyond just API deployment, it allows you to design, deploy, and document your API which moves well into the world of API management. As I'm seeing with other emerging solutions like <a href="http://apistudio.io/">API Studio from Apigee</a>, I predict we will see <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">monitoring</a>, and other critical layers of the API life-cycle emerge as orchestration layers of API PLUG.</p>
<p>I've added API PLUG to my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">API deployment research</a>, and I am still considering the best way to include them in other areas of my API research. I'm increasingly finding that modern API management solutions are spanning multiple areas of the API life-cycle, which further encourages me to modularize my research, but also tells me I'm going to need to create some sort of Venn Diagram visualization to help me better understand the reach of emerging API products and services.</p>
<p>Anyways, more to come on API PLUG as I play with, and listen to the stories they tell via their blog, <a href="https://twitter.com/apiplug">Twitter</a>, and Github accounts (I can only find a Twitter account, but I'm sure they are working on that! ;-).</p>

<p>Marketing your products and services in the API sector can often look very different than marketing of products and services in other sectors. Developers are a very different target audience, and to make things even more complicated, not all developers are created equal! Open developer are not like the enterprise developer, and healthcare developers won't have much in common with device-based, Internet of Things developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to market your API has been a session at every APIStrat since we did the first conference in New York City back in February of 2013, and <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">we just announced the latest edition of marketing for APIs at @APIStrat in Austin in November</a>.

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">It has been a year or two since I've given any deep thought to the Twitter ecosystem</a>. There has been such little meaningful action to come out of the social platform over the last couple years, I had all but given up on it being a platform with any sort of future for developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/656885664525357056">When Jack Dorsey apologized and solicited feedback from the community this week</a>, I honestly felt I didn't have much to offer when it comes to advice--I just wasn't prepared. Twitter does almost everything right when it comes to their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">developer ecosystem</a>...well on the surface, where they do fail, is within the most critical areas of API operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>&nbsp;- Twitter communicates about the usual mundane API platform stuff, but really lacks a tone and substance that really cuts through the BS for developers. In my opinion it will take years to recover from the tone set by Dick Costolo &amp; Ryan Sarver--they just did not respect developers at all, and it showed. This isn't something you recover from quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Access &amp; Rate Limits -</strong>&nbsp;While communications around access level and rate limits have gotten much more clearer, with a dedicated area in dev portal, and available inline within documentation, it will take going the extra mile before developers feel like there is truly a level playing field. It will require more API access to account level usage, notifications, dashboards, etc. to heal these wounds--real-time communication.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model -&nbsp;</strong>There is just no clear business model evident from the developer ecosystem--something that showcases how Twitter is making money, where the API fits into this, and the opportunity for developers to play in this game. I've broken down the pricing confusion involved with using the <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/06/twitter-api-integration-math-rest-api/">REST API</a>, and <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/21/twitter-api-integration-math-streaming-api/">Streaming API</a>, and <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/22/twitter-api-integration-math-reconciling-data-with-rest-and-streaming-apis/">tried to understand across the different levels of access</a>--even though my research is dated, the confusion still exists. There is no clarity when it comes to how I can grow my usage of Twitter (as a startup), therefore many resort to very bad behavior to make ends meet.</li>
<li><strong>Personality</strong> - There is no personality or face to the Twitter platform, thus it always defaults up the chain to current CEO. Maybe a new director of platform came on after Ryan Sarver left, but I couldn't tell you who it was. The platform needs a leader who will set the same tone Jack Dorsey is trying to set by returning to the CEO Position--Twitter needs a Jack who is specifically in charge of the platform vision, message, and will be the friendly face of the platform turnaround.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of communication, overall tone, and lack of transparency and clarity around access, rate limits, and the business model has just left a bad taste in the mouths of Twitter developers. I use the Twitter API actively as part of my business, but I would never consider building a new product that depends on the Twitter API--never, and I know many other developers feel the same.</p>
<p>I've long moved on from my utopian views of what the Twitter API could have been, there are too many powerful actors who are investors, and partners&nbsp; now for this ever to be a reality. I do not think Twitter should entertain and do business with ALL 3rd party developers, and eliminate rate limits--I am more experienced in API operations than this. However Twitter has to provide a clear ladder that developers can climb when it comes to accessing the API, ascending all the way up to partner levels, with transparency all along the way.</p>
<p>Twitter has to be communicating with the community at every step, and honestly the community needs to get better at communicating with Twitter as well. I respect the challenge that Twitter has when it comes to managing a million developers, and know these things are not easy, and it makes me happy to see Jack taking a clear stance, and reach out to the community for feedback.</p>
<p>As Jack Dorsey said, transparency is the key. Transparency around API access, rate limits, the road-map, business model, partner and developer revenue opportunities, will be critical going forward. It makes me happy to see language like "Developer Rules of the Road" finally gone from the legal side of platform operations--it was language like this that set a really bad tone for developers. I really hope Twitter can turn this corner, and&nbsp; reboot its ecosystem, as the platform plays a critical role in almost every industry, and in my opinion <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is the most important API out there today</span>. i would really like to be able to showcase Twitter as a platform that all API providers should emulate once again.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just had a call with one of my newer API partners, working with them on crafting version 1.0 of their <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API evangelism strategy</a>, and the subject of what content to generate, and which channels to use, when building up their brand arose. In my work, about 90% of the approaches I see implemented by API providers is a traditional PR strategy, where you create content, and push to popular channels to do the work of syndicating the message. While this approach works, and is something I recommend you do, I have a different way of building up my brand, and the partner or community brands that I invest in.</p>
<p>All of this begins with something that truly brings value to the table for everyone involved, without this, my approach will not work. Once you have something of value, you start working directly with this value, building things, experimenting and playing, while telling the story all along the way. If it isn't something you'd use yourself, and be able to innovate with, why would you expect anyone else to. If value truly exists around products, services, and tooling associated with a brand, you will build momentum with each story you tell, eventually encouraging others to do the same.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild is with the fast growing API definition Swagger. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">I started paying attention to Swagger closely in 2011</a>, and by <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/09/19/forget-being-neutral-and-objective-anymore-with-apis/">mid 2014 I had gone all in with Swagger</a>, and integrated into my own platform, and tooling, resulting in 265 stories that reference swagger over the last four years. Let me show the value driven by this type of storytelling--here are the plotting of my stories over the last four years:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-evangelist-story-swagger.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Here is a plotting of growth of the <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=swagger%20api">Swagger according to Google Trends</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/google-trends-swagger.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>This is how you build brand awareness organically. I'm not saying I'm solely responsible for Swagger's success--it all started with the value brought to the table by Tony Tam. Secondarily it was the community who ultimately <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/platform-integrations.html">integrated Swagger into their platforms</a>, <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/swagger-ui.html">used Swagger UI for displaying their API documentation</a>, and innovated in the <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">numerous other areas of API operations where the API definition format has been applied</a>. Most importantly, it has taken the storytelling of the community, about what they have done, that got us to where we are at in 2015 with the Swagger brand.</p>
<p>Along with the value brought to the table by Tony, and the community, I do feel I played a significant role in where the Swagger brand is today. I did this through building tooling with Swagger, searching out what others were doing, and telling the story all along the way. I wrote 160 stories in 2015 alone, and I did this all via my own blog. I beat this drum so loud, and so consistently, others wrote about what I was doing in top tier blogs like <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/05/kin-lane-api-commons">InfoQ</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/15/3scale-discounts-cost-of-managing-apis-through-nginx-open-source-server-gives-developers-access-services-quality/">TechCrunch</a>, as well as on other company and developer blogs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the power of storytelling. This isn't marketing, and isn't about products or services--it is about generating valuable exhaust around something API related, and telling the story along the way. This is something I enjoy helping API providers, and service providers understand as they try to differentiate themselves in 2015, and for a select few partners, I will be doing this around the value they bring to the table, across the API Evangelist network.</p>

<p>One layer I am working to add to my API research, are machine readable API definitions that I find, or generate from the APIs of the API service providers I keep an eye on. Within this new layer I'm aggregating these API the specs of the companies who are offering services within the emerging areas of the API sector.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/specs.html">The first area I've started aggregating is within API management</a>. 3Scale was very forward leaning with their willingness to open up their API definitions for <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">their own API management infrastructure APIs</a>. These are API specs that describe all of the features of the 3Scale API management platform, and represent one possible blueprint that API management service providers could emulate.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/specs.html">I have four separate API definitions included from 3Scale on my new page</a>, something that could be broken down further if it makes sense. I also just added a suggested API definition for API portals--crafted by the <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> team. They thought my idea for defining a common set of definitions across the 17+ areas I monitor was an interesting cenough oncept, and was something they wanted to explore further with me.</p>
<p>Zeeshan Ejaz Bhatti of <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> pulled together this spec:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!--  .gist {width:100%; height: 200px; overflow:auto}  .gist .file-data {max-height: 200px; max-width: 500px;}  -->
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/c1b0bf18ed7f67362a78.js"></script>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is just one potential starting point for providing a common interface for managing your API portal. Zeeshan feels that , if "API-Portals-as-a-Service", and other API management providers agreed on a common publish API format, it would benefit other API service providers like APIMATIC who are providing services to their customers via these API portals.</p>
<p>I agree with Zeeshan, and might&nbsp;<a href="/admin/blog/api-portal.apievangelist.com">play around adding an API facade for managing your API portal using Github + Jekyll, like I do with my standard API Portal template</a>. This is all work in progress. Right now I am just aggregating the API definitions for API service providers that have APIs. In my opinion this layer of the API space will differentiate API service providers from each other, demonstrating which ones will actually scale in the fast growing the API economy.</p>
<p>Next I'm taking <a href="http://monitor.apievangelist.com">API monitoring services like Runscope and API Science</a>, and aggregate their API definitions as part of my research.</p>

<p>I have used the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/usagov/Federal-Agency-Directory-API-Documentation">Federal Agency Directory API</a>&nbsp;for quite some time to lookup federal government agencies. <a href="https://www.usa.gov/developer">USA.gov has some highly valuable, and simple APIs</a> including the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/usagov/Social-Media-Registry-API-Documentation">Social Media Registry API</a>, which I find extremely useful. They recently added a new one for<a href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/developer/govt-urls.html"> searching government websites that do not end in .gov</a>.</p>
<p>The Non-.gov URLs APIs allows you to search for all websites that end in .com, .org, .edu, or other top-level domains, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal, state, local,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usa.gov/tribes">tribal</a>, commonwealth, and territorial government agency websites</li>
<li><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/otherfrb.htm">Federal reserve banks and branches</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fhlbanks.com/">Federal home loan banks</a></li>
<li>Libraries, archives, and museums, including&nbsp;<a href="http://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/">Presidential libraries</a></li>
<li>Department of Defense websites for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.defense.gov/Sites/DOD-Websites?category=Recruiting">recruiting</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.defense.gov/Sites/DOD-Websites?category=Academy">service academies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.usa.gov/recreation-and-travel">Travel and tourism</a>&nbsp;websites for states and U.S. territories</li>

<li><a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21663.pdf">Government sponsored enterprises</a>&nbsp;(such as Fannie Mae) [PDF]</li>
<li>Federal and state retirement systems</li>
<li>Task forces (such as the Preventative Services Task Force) and commissions (such as the 9/11 Commission)</li>
<li>A few select, non government organizations (such as the Red Cross) and public-private partnerships</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>I find the APIs coming out of USA.gov to be excellent examples of what ALL government agencies should be doing. The APIs don't have to be complicated, just provide simple read, and sometimes write access to valuable government data that should be public.</p>
<p>I am going to prioritize the creation of an API definition for USA.gov, and wrap their APIs in an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json file</a>, and add to my <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/stack.html">federal API stack</a>. The more of these APIs I have at my disposal, the more efficient I am at when it comes to opening up government data, and making existing API resources available across my research.</p>

<p>I've been working on expand upon <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">my API security research</a>, but it can be difficult to find API focused security solutions. Exactly what is security when it comes to APIs can vary. Are you looking to secure your APIs? Are you looking to secure your data or content using an API? This is why I started a research projects so that I can turn on my keyword monitoring, and begin scouring the landscape in real-time--the more I conduct research in an area, the better I get at it.</p>
<p>The best part of my research is that sometimes when I write about things, companies just come to me. This happened the other week, with an encrypted database API provider called <a href="https://securedb.co">SecureDB</a>. What this brand new API driven platform provides is default security for your&nbsp;accounts, data, files, and settings--exactly what we need in this cyber-insecure world we have created for ourselves.</p>
<p>I do not store any sensitive data, but if I did, I would not want to be in the business of storing it. Period! <a href="https://securedb.co/apidocs/">SecureDB gives you everything you need to manage your users account and identity, create the data stores you need, and store your appilcations files and settings in a secure environment</a>. All identity data is encrypted by default, and you get to set the encryption levels for all your data stores, allowing you to make sure everything sensitive is not readable on the server, even if it is compromised.</p>
<p>SecureDB is just getting started, but they have a lot of things in the works, including on-premise, containerized implementations, version that run on Heroku, white label solutions, and much more. I will be working with them to help them craft a marketing and storyteling strategy around their encrypted database solution, and establishing a deeper partnership between them and API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I'm pretty stoked on my ability to attract these types of API service providers just by publishing my research regularly, and talking about the areas these companies are providing solutions in. I'm just telling the first story about SecureDB to let you know they are out there, and get them established in my monitoring system, and overall research--stay tuned for much more on SecureDB, and the security solutions they provide--I couldn't think of a better time for an API like this, we are so going to need it.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-lifecycle.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is up to API providers to establish a coherent approach regarding how they rollout and manage their APIs, something that historically has just involved deploying and managing, but in the last couple of years we have seen more formal approaches emerge, something we are all calling the API lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2012, after we started standardizing our API development and management thinking using API definitions, the expansion of the API lifecycle was set into motion with the introduction of an API design-first way of thinking from the Apiary team. API definitions allowed us to get our development and management house in order, but also begin collaborating, mocking, and having a conversation around our API designs, way before we began the costly process of writing code.</p>
<p>In 2015, I am tracking on API definitions driving over 17 separate stops along this fast evolving API lifecycle. While some API providers who are further along in their API journey are incorporating all of these stops, many API providers who are just getting going, are still learning about all the stops along this modern API lifecycle. Part of this evolution is establishing just exactly what is your companies API lifecycle, something that can be a very personal thing, and we'll need more of our tooling to help us quantify this.</p>
<p>This is why I was happy to see evidence of API lifecycle management built into the tooling with the new AWS API Gateway. In my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/11/some-potentially-very-powerful-api-orchestration-with-the-amazon-api-gateway/">earlier post on the&nbsp;potentially very powerful API orchestration with the Amazon API Gateway</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Going beyond the types of integration you can employ when crafting, and deploying APIs using the Amazon API Gateway, the platform also provides a way to define stages that APIs will exist in from design, development, QA, production, or any other stage you wish. I like the concept of having a stage defined for each API, designating where it exists on the API life-cycle. I tend to just have dev and prod, but this might make me consider this a little more deeply, as it seems to be a big part of defining the API journey.</em></p>
<p>In my opinion, this is a sign of things to come. Right now it is just basically a way to tag your APIs, and define which stage of the API lifecycle they are in, but I can see see these stages being used to organize various stops along the API lifecycle, in a meaningful way for your API team. You could put testing and performance as part of your QA stage, and you can setup monitoring and security for your APIs that are in production, and much more.</p>
<p>While it is still coming into focus for me, I see the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">17+ stops along the API lifecycle</a> as something that could be organized into these various API lifecycle stages. I do not think there will be one API lifecycle blueprint to rule them all, but this new approach would allow API teams to craft their own vision, and allow them to share these blueprints for other teams to follow, either internally, or even publicly.</p>
<p>I hope we'll see more API service providers consider where they fit into the overall API lifecycle of their consumers, and provide features that helps users define what this means to their team. Maybe eventually we'll end up with a common language and tooling for helping API providers discuss and operate within a more coherent, flowing, and meaningful API lifecycle.</p>

These are the features provided from API service providers that are made accessible via APIs. Mind blowing right? API service providers having APIs? Which then allows API providers to programmatically manage the operations of their own APIs? Who would have ever thought!! Actually it is a pretty clear example of API service providers who are kind of full of it, when they do not offer their own APIs--meaning they are telling you about the importance of APIs, but not actually practicing what they preach. It is kind of like API providers who do not use their own APIs in their applications (dogfooding).</p>
<p class="p1">Anyhoo. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">I have done a lot of work to define the common building blocks across API service providers, spanning over 17 stops along the API lifecycle</a>, and part of the next phase of my research is to connect these building blocks to actual API definitions that can help automate these vital API features.

All API providers should have an API for base API account management--meaning your API consumers should be able to manage their accounts, services, apps, and billing via an API. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">This will be a differentiation between API providers in the near future, and if you aren't up to speed, developers will be looking elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/24/how-open-source-api-proxies-and-other-api-services-and-tooling-can-strategically-partner/">This portion of my work is in response to a group of open source API management providers looking to encourage interoperability between their platforms, and what better way to do this than a common API management definition</a>. While not all API management solutions will have exactly the same features, if they can speak a common, API defined language, the better off the entire API space will be.</p>
<p>This is something I want to encourage across all 17+ of the API service areas I track on. I'm going to take a look at <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com">API monitoring</a>, and also try to generate a common outline from definition across some of the service providers I track on. I'm using API definitions to generate these outlines, and potentially merging across multiple API service providers. If you are one of the API service providers I track on, and have an API definition, make sure I have link so I can include in thi sportion of my research.</p>

<p>Maybe I've looked at too many APIs, but I feel that APIs are very telling of the overall culture of a company. APIs that are trusting, tend to open up a full stack of APIs, including POST, PUT (or PATCH), and DELETE functionality, giving developers access to all, or nearly all functionality available via a platform.</p>
<p>I do not feel that platforms are required to open up everything, but the amount of what they open up, does tells a lot about how a company is thinking. While I find many companies are not fully up to speed on the benefits a modern API management strategy, and the control it gives you over resources and API consumers, I think many just do not trust anyone outside the firewall, and think they know best when it comes to everything.</p>
<p>APIs are not for every company, and I do not think everybody should have any API, but I do want API providers to be aware of how telling their approach will be about their motives behind having an API. You should not see this as a negative lesson, it will help you think about your company from the outside-in, this is one of the most important aspects of the API journey in my opinion.</p>
<p>A journey you should begin as soon as possible, if you think you can make it work in a positive way.</p>

<p>NASA just launched two new APIs, <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/">as part of their open data efforts</a>. I find the APIs they offer to be simple, and very inspirational examples of what an API can be. Maybe I just love space, but seeing these well designed, very fun APIs out of our countries space agency is just cool.</p>
<p>They added a <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS">Near Earth Asteroids API</a>, and a <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos">Mars Rover Photos API</a>, <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/blog/mars-photos-and-asteroids-are-just-get-request-away/">and they also understand the value of telling the story of the release on their blog</a>. Remember API providers, if you launch an API in the woods and don't blog about, nobody will know about it--storytelling is one of the most important tools in your toolbox.</p>
<p>Also, your APIs don't have to be complicated, and overthought. Just providing GET access to interesting images and other content like NASA is doing can really go a long ways in generating attention (it got me to write a blog post). You can see this in action with both their APIs, and their approach to their API portal--I look forward to seeing what APIs they release next!</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/22/converting-between-the-popular-api-definition-formats-using-api-transformer/">I wrote about the ability to convert between multiple API definition formats using API Transformer</a>&nbsp;the other day, a solution being developed by the <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> team, and shortly after posting, the <a href="https://lucybot.com/">LucyBot</a> team pointed out they are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/22/converting-between-the-popular-api-definition-formats-using-api-transformer/">working on a similar tool</a>. This is one of the reason I try to write these posts, it always brings folks out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>It is good to see multiple efforts out there. Converting of API definition formats is a fast growing need for both API providers and consumers, something that is only going to grow with the adoption of popular API definition formats. I feel it is a healthy sign that standard tooling for converting common API has emerged, and an even better sign that there will be a diverse selection in this tooling.</p>
<p>It looks like the <a href="https://github.com/lucybot/api-spec-converter">Lucybot converter</a> is a little behind <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>, but I'm sure they will get caught up soon. I'm eager to see how these API definition conversion service providers keep up with each version of API definitions as they evolve, as well as new players who enter the game. If they can do successfully they will possess some very valuable data around which API definitions are being put to use by API providers and consumers.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-building-blocks.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If you have followed my work since 2010, you know <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I pull out what I call the common building blocks of originally just API management</a>, but over the last five years <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">this has grown to 17 areas of the API life-cycle</a>. My goal is to better understand the common features offered by API service providers, but only the ones that will also matter to API consumers at the same time.</p>
<p>In the last couple months I started tracking on how these API building blocks match to actual APIs offered by the API service providers I monitor. What do I mean? Well, when you consider <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">the common building blocks offered offered by API management providers</a>, these building blocks come to life when you look at<a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs"> the API offered by 3Scale</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api">Moving down the lifecylce, you can see this in action with the Runscope API in the area of API monitoring</a>. The RunScope API allows API providers and consumers to realize <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring</a> and testing in a programmatic way, going beyond the web interface they provide to their users. While the features available via RunScope, and via the APIs are not a one to one match, they represent a very important start.</p>
<p>This is where API providers become API consumers, accessing common building blocks they will need to operate their platform. This is also where API providers practice what they preach, and also become API providers, in addition to just selling services to API providers--an important distinction that separate the API service providers who are further along in their journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/03/api-service-providers-need-to-decouple-the-services-they-offer-to-api-providers/">If you are an API service provider, and do not offer an API to your customers, matching as many of the features available in your interface</a>, my prediction is you won't last long in the current fast moving landscape.</p>

<p>One of the things that really bothers me in the API space is when API service providers are too competitive, establish silos, don't use APIs themselves, and refuse to provide interoperability with other service providers. It is the API space y'all, this shit needs to work together, if we expect anyone to buy into what we are selling--if you aren't confident of the product you are selling, you probably shouldn't be in business.</p>
<p>This is why it makes me happy to see the work 3Scale has done in integrating their own API infrastructure with AWS API infrastructure. <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2015/10/new-aws-api-gateway-integration-with-3scale-api-management/">You can find the details of the integration opportunity over at 3Scale</a>, but I want to focus on the subject of API service providers working together, even if it is externally augmented like 3Scale did, as opposed to formal partnership.</p>
<p>Within weeks of AWS launching their API Gateway, the 3Scale team was not only unfazed by the potential competition from the cloud giant, they immediately got to work understanding how their own infrastructure could compliment the offering. There is an overlap between the AWS API Gateway, and 3Scale infrastructure, but both platforms bring an immense amount of value to the table, and it is very forward thinking of their team to see this, rather than just sit around worrying about what AWS would do to their business.</p>
<p>3Scale has an eight year head start when it comes to API management, and AWS brings some serious API deployment power to the table with their new Lambda platform. What 3Scale has done, represents how API service providers should behave in the industry. I have lots of experience in trying to get API service providers to work together, and participate in a conversation on stage at events, something that can like getting a group of toddlers to play together.</p>
<p>To me, what 3Scale is doing demonstrate their confidence in the infrastructure they are selling. I saw a number of folks on Twitter highlight what a bad omen it was for API deployment and management service providers, when AWS released their API gateway solution. While it does have significant implications when it comes to the industry, I think the negative impact will be felt by the API service providers who really don't have something of value to offer, and companies like 3Scale who do, will be just fine.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-defensive-tactics.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I add each <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">API to my stack</a>, I consider security along the way. I require an API key to access all of my APIs using my <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale API management infrastructure</a>, and I also have different tiers of access, and while defining this management layer my first impulse is always put POST, PUT, and DELETE methods into the most trusted tiers.</p>
<p>The service composition layer in API management is where I feel the heart of API is--the thing that makes it different than SOA, and other approaches. This is where you can loosen things up, trust your 3rd party developers, and allow serendipity to occur. If you always default to locking things down, and only allowing the updating of resources by internal, or just trusted external sources, you are limiting the possibilities.</p>
<p>With this in mind I'm carefully evaluating a couple of defensive API management tactics I can employ:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notifications -</strong> Make sure and send out an email or push notification to myself when POST, PUT, and DELETE are executed on certain APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Key Locking -</strong> Allow for a certain amount of POST, PUT, and DELETE, but when you go over a certain volume, it locks your API key.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these tactics won't prevent all bad situations, it can help me quickly identify them, and take action. My goal is to encourage people to develop on top of my APIs, and I'd rather focus on letting things flow, over locking everything down. There are certain security realities surrounding publicly available APIs, but honestly most people will never take the time to register for key, and learn a system just so they can do malicious things, and for the ones that will, I have some defensive things in place to trip them up.</p>
<p>There are plenty of tools built into my 3Scale API infrastructure that do this for me, what I am considering are some additional measures I can build into my own API, that employ <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">the 3Scale API</a> to better automate some of these defensive tactics. What are you doing to keep things safe, but also open? I'd love to hear other ideas for operating an API on the open Internet, in the safest, most sensible way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-vice.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been getting demos of some pretty interesting new work spaces meant for API architects, and designers. Examples of this are <a href="http://apigarage.com/">API Garage</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reprezen.com/">RepreZen API Studio</a>, and the recent <a href="https://swaggerhub.com">SwaggerHub</a>. These are just some of the API life-cycle solutions I'm seeing emerge recently, where companies are trying to provide API design, development, and deployment solutions in a single, tidy, work space.</p>
<p>Now that the API life-cycle has expanded beyond just API management, deployment, and design, into testing, monitoring, security, and beyond, I predict these types of API work-spaces that span multiple stops along the API life-cycle will become common place. To help prime the pump, and ensure there will be more viable products launched, I wanted to share a few thoughts on what these solution providers should consider as part of their offerings.</p>
<p>Here are some of my scribbles while drinking an IPA at my local bar:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definitions -</strong> Speak Swagger, API Blueprint, Postman Collections, and other common API definition formats, and allow for the importing and exporting of them at every step.</li>
<li><strong>Provide APIs -</strong> Make sure you provide APIs to all the functionality available within the workspace -- paying the whole API thing forward.</li>
<li><strong>Consume APIs -</strong> Make sure you allow the consumption of APIs, from within the interface, either as part of http client, or add-ons.</li>
<li><strong>Plug-in Framework -</strong> Allow some sort of extensibility of the work space, allowing 3rd parties to augment the platform via plugins.</li>
<li><strong>Play Well With Others -</strong> Please play nice with other service providers, all of this works because of interoperability, and I should be able to use the services I need via my work space.</li>
<li><strong>Search -</strong> Provide a comprehensive search, allowing me to discovery across everything I do within a work space, via a comprehensive history</li>
<li><strong>Notebook -</strong> Give me a notebook for storing my work, draft APIs, and other items I gather through my work, allowing me to come back and re-use work from the past.</li>
<li><strong>Use Github -</strong> Make sure Github is a first class citizen within the workspace, allowing me to import, and publish all my work to Github -- think orchestration, not just import and publish.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Developer Friendly </strong>- Make sure tht the work space isn't just for developers, and anyone can come in and participate throughout the API life-cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a HTTP Client -</strong> Make sure there is a built-in, or embeddable HTTP client, so get building one, partner with existing, or acquire one you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of my thoughts as I received a demo of one API work space, and was reading about a couple of other new products. After scribbling these thoughts, I sat back, drank a another pint of IPA, and contemplated the role of these types of work spaces in the future of the API industry. I predict there will be a wave of these API work spaces emerge in coming months, providing their own take on exactly what the API life-cycle looks like, and want to help developers standardize and be successful.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to playing with all the new work space, and hoping there will be at least one to emerge that suits my unique needs as the API Evangelist. I will need all of the elements listed above, or I probably won't be working in there full-time. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tony-kin-swaggerhub.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I received a personal demo of the new <a href="https://swaggerhub.com">SwaggerHub</a> from Mr. Swagger himself -- Tony Tam, this last week. SwaggerHub is a new API life-cycle hub, centered around the API definition format, developed by the SmartBear Swagger team. The new hub brings together all of the Swagger tooling into a single, collaborative web application, that allows you to manage API definitions through varioius stages of the API life-cycle.</p>
<p>SwaggerHub lets you import and export your JSON or YAML Swagger definitions, giving you an environment for storing, searching, versioning, and collaborating around the definitions. Using the platform, you can edit Swagger definitions using Swagger Editor, generate server and client side code with Swagger CodeGen, and play with the API using Swagger UI--all wrapped in this new versioned and collaborative API design environment.</p>
<p>After importing a handful of my APIs into SwaggerHub, it feels like a solution to help me manage the central truth that are my API definitions, allowing me to bring other people into the process, and generate the code and docs that will be needed at other stops along the API life-cycle. I'm assuming that other stops like testing, monitoring, and virtualization will emerge in future iterations of SwaggerHub.</p>
<p>SwaggerHub works well for API definition centralization, collaboration, and management, but some of the publishing of docs, server and client code didn't work as I'd expect them. There is Github integration for logging into SwaggerHub, and a "Github Push" feature, which I couldn't get to work, so I'm assuming the publishing and orchestration around APIs will only improve -- something I'm really interested in, because I use Github to manage all aspects of APIs life-cycle.</p>
<p>I like what I see so far in the <a href="https://swaggerhub.com">SwaggerHub</a>, and see hints of the future with Docker image references, an API behind the platform, and I know there is APIs.json goodness right behind the surface. For now, I will just keep importing my designs into SwaggerHub, keep playing with, and seeing where Tony and the team takes the new API collaboration destination.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/09/29/a-review-of-the-callfire-communication-platform/">A Review of The CallFire Communication Platform</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-logo.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This is a review of the <a href="https://www.callfire.com/">communication API platform CallFire</a>, crafting a snapshot of platform operations, from an external viewpoint, providing the CallFire platform team with a fresh take on their API from the outside-in. The criteria applied in this review is gathered from looking at the API operations across thousands of API providers, and aggregating best practices, into a single, distilled review process.</p>
<p>This review has been commissioned by CallFire, but as anyone who's paid me for a review knows, money doesn't equal a favorable review&mdash;I tell it like I see it. My objective is to help CallFire see their platform through a different sense, as developers might see their platform. It can be hard to see the forest for the trees, and I find the API review is a great way to help API providers see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>I prefer to share my API reviews in a narrative format, walking through each of the important aspect of API management, telling the story of what I see, and what I don't see. Here is the story of what I found while reviewing the communication API platform for CallFire.</p>
<p><strong>Overview<br /></strong>CallFire makes for an easier review than some API operations, because the API is the product. As soon as you land on the homepage of the website, you begin your API journey as a potential API consumer. The first thing you read is "Over 2 Billion Messages Delivered&rdquo;, so you immediately understand what CallFire does, and the next thing that grabs your eye is &ldquo;Signup For Free&rdquo;&mdash;way to not miss a beat, CallFire.</p>
<p>Next you see five simple icons, with simple text, breaking what CallFire does down: Text Messaging, Call Tracking, Video Broadcast, Cloud Call Center, IVR. Within the first five seconds you fully understand what is being offered, and given the opportunity to sign up. If that is not enough, you are also told the reasons why: Engage Your Customers, Save Valuable Time, Increase Revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-home-page.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>After you look at thousands of APIs, nothing is more frustrating than to have to figure out what an API does. CallFire gives me what I need, in five seconds or less, without clicking or scrolling. This is the way all APIs should be, if not the homepage of website, then the landing page of the API developer portal. The main page of the CallFire website is well designed, and organized in a simple, and robust way, giving you one-click access to everything you need to get going with the platform--no other feedback required.</p>
<p><strong>Endpoints</strong><br />This is the part of the review I dive into the actual design of the API, and provide some feedback on the technical endpoints of the APIs themselves. CallFire is unique because it has a REST and a SOAP version of the API available, which I think is important in today's business climate, where APIs are targeting open developers, as well as those within the enterprise.</p>
<p>The CallFire API is very robust, with wide range of endpoints / methods for the most basic text and call features, all the way up to campaign, subscription, and contact management. You can tell the system is well thought out, providing a full suite of communication resources for all types of developers.</p>
<p>On you dig into the REST API you begin to see quite a bit of SOAP residue, and while the API has a well thought out list of endpoints, many elements of the parameters, requests, and responses feel SOAPy, including the XML responses. There is also a lack of consistent response codes, and defined data model, giving the REST API an unfinished, empty bottom feeling.</p>
<p>Overall I give the API a solid B in that it is a very robust stack, but I'd say it needs some hard use, and integrations before some of the rough edges are hammered off, parameters become more intuitive, and request and response structures normalize. Much of this just comes with usage, and requires getting closer to real world use cases, end users, before it becomes more of an experience based design vs. the resource based design it currently is.</p>
<p>I could easily go through the entire Swagger definition for CallFire and make recommendations on naming conventions, and help craft the resource definitions for the underlying data models, but this is best worked out with the community, iterating, and communicating with developers, and learning more about truly what they need. Think of it as kiln firing of the API, through developer execution, and robust platform feedback loops.</p>
<p><strong>On-Boarding</strong><br />On-boarding with the CallFire API was frictionless. I went one click from home page, authenticated with my Google Account, and immediately I was dropped into my account dashboard, with a helpful intro screen showing me where things are. I easily found the area in my account to add an application, and get my API keys, then stumbled into the overview of how to activate your account as well&mdash;account management was intuitive.</p>
<p>The intuitive and informative CallFire home page made the API easy to find, and with frictionless account signup, and a standard API app management, I was ready to make my first call on the API within 10 minutes. The only thing I would consider adding as part of the process, is an option for signup and login using my Github credentials, in addition to Facebook, and Google.</p>
<p>On-boarding with an API is often the most frustrating part of API integration, and it wasn't something I worried about at all with CallFire. The process was intuitive, smooth, and didn't leave me trying to understand what the API does, and how I am supposed to make it work. Solid A on the on-boarding process for the CallFire API.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/api-documentation/rest/version/1.1"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-api-documentation.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br />Documentation is one of the most critical aspects of API integration, making or breaking many integration efforts by developers. CallFire has double duty, in that it needs to provide documentation for the REST and SOAP version. Somethig CallFire manages to deliver with no problem, providing clean, easy to follow documentation for both APIs they offer.</p>
<p>The SOAP API document provides a simple breakdown of operations and methods, with easy to follow descriptions for everything. Ultimately the SDKs do most of the heavy lifting here, but the SOAP docs provide a nice overview of the CallFire platform.</p>
<p>The REST API for CallFire is defined using the machine readable API definition format Swagger, and uses Swagger UI to generate documentation, making learning about the API more interactive. Swagger provides a machine readable overview of the CallFire API, and is an approach to delivering API documentation that keeps pace with modern approaches.</p>
<p>I do not have much feedback for the documentation side of CallFire, I'd like to see more information about the underlying data model described in the Swagger definition, as well more detail about the response codes, but I give the platform documentation a solid B for being simple, clean, and complete--the API just needs some hardening, and the documentation will improve.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br />On-boarding with the CallFire API is frictionless, and adding an app, and finding your API keys are intuitive enough. The platform also provides a nice overview on how to enable the API on your CallFire account, but ultimately the topic of authentication is neglected.</p>
<p>Authentication for SOAP interactions, and REST for that matter, are abstracted away by each of the SDKs. However one of the elements of RESTful APIs is that authentication should be clearly defined as part of the documentation. I suggest adding a page, or section on an existing page that is dedicated authentication, explaining the BasicAuth used to secure the CallFire API. For any experienced API consumer it isn't difficult navigate, but the app manager with login and password, has appearance that it may be app key via a header or parameter, not BasicAuth--a dedicated authentication overview page would help clear up.</p>
<p>As part of authentication review I do not usually advocate for a specific authentication approach, when the choices are BasicAuth, or using the app id and keys in the header or parameters. The best option is to pick one, be consistent, and explain it clearly, on a page that stands out. Overall the authentication for CallFire is intuitive, it just needs a little bit of information to makes things 100% clear when you first find yourself making that first API call.</p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Since I wrote this review, and the time of publishing, <a href="https://answers.callfire.com/hc/en-us/articles/205407787-Authentication">CallFire has updated their portal to include a well formed authentication overview for the platform</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Code</strong><br />After documentation, code samples, libraries, and SDKs are key to a painless API integration. For the CallFire API, there are only two SDKs available currently, for the PHP, and .NET platforms. It is common that platforms who are just getting going, only have a handful of SDKs in specific language, and is forgivable, but is also a sign of platform immaturity (aka lots of work still to be done).</p>
<p>Another aspect of SDK design for CallFire, that I'd like to bring up, is the cohabitation of REST and SOAP in a single SDK. I'm not sure this type of cross pollination is ideal for all integrations. Maybe it is just my architectural style, but I like seeing each SDK be as smallest possible footprint as possible, and meet the needs of developers without any extraneous bloat.</p>
<p>CallFire needs to have Python, Ruby, Java, Node.Js, Go, and JavaScript language SDKs to be able to serve as wide as possible audience as we possibly can. To help achieve this I recommend soliciting the help of platform users, or even paying a 3rd party developer to build SDKs, if needed.</p>
<p>Moving beyond SDKs, into what I call Platform Development Kits (PDK), CallFire does well in providing two distinct platform plugins for WordPress and Drupal. I recommend bringing these PDKs to the surface, and showcase them in a full SDK and PDK showcase page&mdash;showing what is possible. &nbsp;Maybe even considering the next step, of what is the 3rd PDK that could be developed? SalesForce? Heroku?</p>
<p>The usage of Github by CallFire is another important signal, showing the platform is progressive, and something that developers can depend on. I recommend further bringing Github into the site, linking to accounts, providing direct links to SDK and PDK repositories from an official page, and add Github authentication for developers to be able to create and manage their accounts. Github isn't just about code, it is a potentially important social layer to the CallFire API ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile</strong><br />There really is no evidence of any mobile SDKs, or information for mobile developers available on the CallFire platform. It is common to find entire sections dedicated to mobile developers, or at least links to mobile platform specific code libraries. I recommend establishing a mobile focused section of the platform, and invest the resources necessary to help developers build iOS, Android, and Windows mobile applications using CallFire.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong><br />CallFire is doing well on the support front, providing building blocks for both direct, and self-service support. I like to see a mix of support services that developers can find on their own, getting the help they need 24/7, but they also need to be able to get direct support when they get stuck.</p>
<p>When it comes to direct support, CallFire is rocking it, with a support email, live chat, phone number, contact form, and ticketing system tied to your account messaging area. The only additional things I could recommend CallFire offering is paid support plans, allowing developers to pay for one-on-one support via chat, online hangout, or other means.</p>
<p>With self-service support, there is the CallFire FAQ, which I'd call more a knowledgeable than a simple FAQ, providing a wealth of knowledge about the platform. The only common element I see missing is more of a community element with a forum, or usage of Stack Overflow to engage with the wider developer community. &nbsp;The current FAQ is very robust, and with the integrated ticketing system, the potential is great, but it is all missing that community piece.</p>
<p>Overall, CallFire support is as robust as you'd expect from any API platform. When you combine with the social media presence the platform has, that I'll cover as part of the communication strategy, the platform has all of its bases covered. A+ on support effort.</p>
<p><strong>Communications</strong><br />When it comes to my review criteria for communications, other than a newsletter, CallFire nailed everyone of them. The platform has all of the expected social media platforms, has an active blog with RSS feed, and is very accessible with email, phone, and chat. All of this sends the right signals to the community, and potential API consumers, that someone is home. I have nothing to contribute when it comes to communications, as long as all channels are kept active, CallFire is doing everything it can in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>Change Practices</strong><br />As platform providers, we are asking developers to depend on us, and integrate our resources into their applications, and businesses. That is asking a lot, and we need to provide as much information as possible about what the future hold, to hlep build trust with developers. There a handful of proven ways for doing this, established by leading API platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - API roadmaps are usually a simple, bulleted list, derived from the APIs own internal roadmap, showing what the future holds for the platform. Transparency around an APIs roadmap is a tough balance, since you don't want to give away too much, alerting your competitors, but your developer ecosystem needs to know what is next.</li>
<li><strong>Status Dashboard -</strong> Status dashboards are a common way for API platforms to communicate the availability of an API, but also show the track record of a platform, helping developers understand the track record for an API they are to integrate with. There are several simple services, that help API providers do this, without investment in new tools and systems.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log - </strong>Knowing the past is a big part of understanding where things are in store for the future. A change log should work in sync with the API roadmap building block, but provide much more detailed information about changes that have occurred with an API. Developers will not always pay attention to announced updates, but can use a change log as a guide for deciding what changes they need to make in their applications and how they will use an API.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Sharing the change history of a platform, a roadmap to the future, and a status of API operations at the moment go a long way in help build trust with developers. Transparency in the development of any platform, is essential in helping developers feel comfortable that a platform will be around to support their needs, and is worthy of their time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/pricing"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-pricing-page.png" alt="CallFire Messaging Pricing" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Business Model</strong><br />When reviewing APIs, the overall business model is usually one of the most incomplete aspects of operations, in my experience. This is ok, as many platforms are still figuring this out, however this is not the case with CallFire. The business model for the platform isn't just well defined, it provides me with an example to use when helping other API providers visualize what is possible.</p>
<p>The pricing page for CallFire is clean, well thought out, and provides sensibles tiers of operation, with clear units of measurement, letting me know what I get for each level. I can easily upgrade the access tier directly from my account settings, and I can get volume pricing if needed. This is how APIs should work, allowing me to easily calculate what I'll need, and figure out which tier I will be operating within, complete with a self-service option for scaling as I need, paying for what I use, as I go.</p>
<p>The billing management and credit system for CallFire is superior to most of even the most thought out API billing and pricing models. It is clean, well thought out, and makes sense from a user perspective&mdash;which is the most important aspect. I'll be using CallFire credit system as a reference when I talk about how the platforms should build tooling that supports the underlying API business model.</p>
<p>I can't articulate enough, how well done the business model, pricing, supporting billing and the other business elements of the CallFire API.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong><br />When it comes to available support resources, it is another area CallFire does very well. The platform has heavily invested in case studies, videos, webinars, and a tour of the platform. They even have a communications and marketing glossary developers can use to get up to speed. CallFire does a good job of providing valuable resources to get developers quickly understand all aspects of platform operations..</p>
<p>A couple of areas I could provide suggestions for improvement, in is when it comes to more industry level white papers, and when the evangelism side of things kicks in maybe consider posting slide decks from events CallFire presents at, as well as a calendar of interesting events. These things will happen I'm sure once an API evangelism strategy is kicked into full gear, but for now just keep doing more of the same--providing lots of rich resources for devs.</p>
<p><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong><br />I'd file R&amp;D in the same category as mobile, non-existent. API ecosystem are essentially external R&amp;D labels for companies, and general operations are about exploring ideas of what can be build with an API, but it helps to have some element available to stimulate overall R&amp;D via the platform.</p>
<p>Some of these elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea Showcase - A place the community can share ideas of what could be built with the CallFire platform.</li>
<li>Labs Environment - A workbench showing what CallFire is working on when it comes to their own integration.</li>
<li>Opportunities - Available opportunities to build things like SDKs, PDKs, or specific projects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>These are just three things that help stimulate the innovation around an API. Sometimes developers just need something to spark the imagination, or possibly see an existing labs project to help them see something in their own work. These rich R&amp;D environments can provide a great opportunity to help meet the needs of CallFire, and its partners.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Department</strong><br />CallFire has the requisite Terms of Service (TOS), and privacy policy. I'm not a lawyer, so i'm not going to parse all of the details of each. There was nothing that raised my TOS alarms too significantly, the TOS were pretty standard, and the privacy policy didn't raise any huge privacy concerns as well I wouldn't have any problems integrating my own platform and business into CallFire.</p>
<p>A couple of items I'd recommend also considering, based upon what I seen on other platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code License - </strong>The PHP SDK has an MIT license, but the .NET didn't have anything. A centralized code licensing page could help as well.</li>
<li><strong>API License -</strong> A license for the API itself, applied to the REST API interface that is defined by Swagger, using API Commons format.</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreement (SLA) - </strong>Provide a service level agreement for API consumers to take advantage of, and understand service level commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Branding -</strong> There are no branding or style guidelines with support resources like logos, etc&mdash;missed opportunity for spreading word, and steering developers in the right direction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Just a couple of things to think about. All of these would go a long way in building trust with developers, and the branding thing is a huge missed opportunity in my opinion. When you bundle these with the TOS, privacy, and compliance information already provided by the platform, it would round off the legal department of the CallFire API nicely.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable</strong><br />Embeddable tooling is another area that is non-existent for the CallFire API. There are no embeddable tools like widgets, buttons, etc that allow the average end-user, and developer to put the API to use in web pages, and applications. I'm not sure what an embeddable suite of tools would look like for CallFire, that would need to be a separate brainstorming process.</p>
<p>When it comes to communication platforms, especially ones involving media, and deep social interactions, embeddable tools are a proven way to grow platform, expand the network effect, and potentially bring in new developers. I recommend including an embeddable section to the site, with a handful of embeddable tooling to compliment the SDK and PDK resources already available.</p>
<p><strong>Environment</strong><br />One area I consider when looking through API operations, is the environment itself. By default many APIs are live, ready for production use, but increasingly platforms are employing alternate environments for development, QA, and potentially variant product environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sandbox</strong> - With the sensitive information available via many APIs, providing developers a sandbox environment to develop and test their code might be wise idea. Sandboxes environments will increase the overall cost of an API deployment, but can reduce headaches for developers and can significantly reduce support overhead. Consider the value of a sandbox when planning an API.</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong> - When planning an API, consider if all deployments need to have access to live data in real-time or there is the need to require developers to request for separate production access for their API applications. In line with the sandbox building block, a separate API production environment can make for a much healthier API ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Simulator</strong> - Providing an environment where developers can find existing profiles, templates or other collections of data, as well as sequence for simulating a particular experience via an API platform. While this is emerging as critical building block for Internet of Thing APIs, it is something other API providers have been doing to help onboard new users.</li>
<li><strong>Templates</strong> - Predefined templates of operation, when a new environment is setup, either sandbox, production, or simulator, it can be pre-populated with data, and other configuration, making it more useful to developers. These templates can be used throughout the API lifecycle from development, QA, all the way to simulation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>This approach to delivering an environment for the CallFire API is not essential, but I could see it providing some interesting scenarios for communication campaigns, and the deployment of messaging infrastructure in a containerized, Internet of Things rich environment. Deployment CallFire communication infrastructure should be as flexible as possible to support the next generation of Internet enabled communication, both in the cloud and on-premise.</p>
<p><strong>Developers</strong><br />An often overlooked aspect of API operations is the tools provided to API consumers. CallFire is in a fortunate position as the API is core to their product, and the API integration is an extension of a primary CallFire user account. The account area for CallFire is well done, clean, and gives users, and those who choose to be API consumers, quite a bit of control over their communication infrastructure.</p>
<p>CallFire nailed almost every API account area I like to see in any API platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Dashboard - </strong>The dashboard for CallFire account is well done, and information.</li>
<li><strong>Account Settings - </strong>CallFire provides a high level of control over account settings.</li>
<li><strong>Reset Password -</strong> Resetting password is important, and I like to highlight separately.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - The app management for CallFire is on par with rest of industry.</li>
<li><strong>Service Tiers -</strong> The ability to change service tier, and scale is pretty significant.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong> - An import part of the communication and support strategy of platform.</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong> &nbsp;- Essential to the economy portion of platform operations, well executed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of areas I'd like to see, to round off developer account operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Github Authentication -</strong> It would fit nicely with Facebook, and Google Auth--I prefer authenticating for APIs with my Github.</li>
<li><strong>Delete Account - </strong>Maybe it is in there, but I couldn't find it. The ability to delete an account is important in my book.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Logs &amp; Analytics -</strong> I'd like to see application specific analytics like on the dashboard, showing usage per app.</li>
<li><strong>Account API -</strong> Allow API access to all account operations, allowing access to account settings, usage limits, billing, messaging and other areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The CallFire account management for users and developers is much more robust than I see in many of the APIs I review. Like I said before the monetization portion is something to be showcased, and all the most important aspects of account management for API operations are present. It wouldn't take much to round off with a couple more features, some more analytics, and an account management API would really take things to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong><br />I always enjoy when I come find consistent design, and function across API operations. This is what I found with CallFire. The API isn't an afterthought like other platforms, it is their product, and the site design, messaging, and content are consistent across the platform.</p>
<p>The API design is consistent, and the supporting documentation is as well. The only thing I'd add is design patterns across the SOAP and REST API should be less consistent, and stay true to their own design constraints. The details of the REST could be tightened, to be more consistent in how parameters are formed, and response formats, and error code are commonly presented.</p>
<p>Usually when reviewing APIs, I look for fractures between API operations, like clunky UI between website sections, or incomplete documentation, often created by disparate teams. This doesn't exist with CallFire, and while there are many details that could be cleaned up, the consistency is all there.</p>
<p><strong>Openness</strong><br />This is a term thrown around a lot in the space, and very seldom do sites live up to it. There are many things that contribute to whether or not an API is truly open. CallFire delivers on all of the important areas, making open a word I'd apply to CallFire.</p>
<p>First on-boarding for the platform frictionless, and everything is self-service, even scaling your account when you need more credits. You have control over your account, and the terms of service and privacy policy are liberal. These are all hallmarks of an open API. Add the ability to delete my account, I'm 100% on board.</p>
<p>One of the things I think heavily contribute to the openness of the CallFire platform is the business model. The monetization strategy is well formed, with pricing and service tiers well defined. You know what things cost, and how to get what you need. This type of approach eliminates the need for other extraneous rate list, or restrictions&mdash;this type of balance is important to truly achieving openness.</p>
<p>After this review I'd call CallFire an open API, but only time will tell, if the platform is also stable, support channels are truly supportive, and other aspects of open that only CallFire can deliver on. For right now I consider them open for business, and open for developers, but ultimately whether or not CallFire is willing to share this review, will put the exclamation on the platform openness definition, won't it! ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Evangelism</strong><br />The usual footprint you'd see when an API platform has an active evangelism program doesn't exist for CallFire, but that is part of the motivation of this review. We are looking to take a snapshot of where &nbsp;the platform is at, in hopes of providing much needed input for the roadmap, as well as establish a version 1.0 evangelism strategy--we will revisit the evangelism portion of this review in a couple months.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />In short, the CallFire passes my review. There are several key areas like mobile, and roadmap communication, that are missing from the platform entirely, but then there are other areas CallFire nails almost every one of my review criteria. The API is robust, the documentation is complete, and they provide all the essential support building blocks.</p>
<p>One of the things that really stand out for me is the CallFire business model, something that I think really cuts through the BS of many APIs I look at. CallFire has a clear business model, and the tools to manage your API usage. There is no grey area with the business of model for CallFire, which is something I just don't see a lot of.</p>
<p>I'd say my biggest concern with the platform is the lack of diverse code resources. I can't tell if they are just getting going, or maybe the lack of developer skills is slowing the diversity of available coding resources--I am just not sure. My guess is their is a lack of diverse developer skills on staff, which explains the lack of mobile SDKs, and the SOAP residue on the REST API. My advice is to invest in the developer resources necessary to load the platform up with a wide variety of coding resources that developers can put to work in their projects.</p>
<p>Beyond the code resources, it is really just a bunch smaller items that would bring the platform into better form. CallFire definitely reflects everything I'm looking for in an API platform, and is something I've included in the top APIs I track on as part of my API Stack. Additionally, I've gathered a couple of other stories while doing this review, including the overall monetization strategy, the notification system under account settings, and their usage of Swagger&mdash;which is always another good sign of a healthy platform, and a positive review.</p>
<p>Lots going on with the <a href="https://www.callfire.com/">CallFire platform</a>, I recommend taking a look at what they are up to.</p>
<p><em>This was a paid review of the CallFire platform, if you'd like to schedule a review of your platform, <a href="mailto: info@apievangelist.com">please contact me</a>, and we'll see if I can make time. &nbsp;A paid review does not equal a good review. it is my goal to give as critical, and constructive feedback as I can to help API providers enhance their roadmap and better serve their consumers.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/four-new-apis.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have a whole bunch of APIs I want to deploy. There is a queue of APIs that I will never get to, but I can't help myself, and when I am tired of watching what everyone else is doing, and want to get busy actually building things, I crack open my queue of ideas. This weekend I launched four new APIs, that will be in the service of some very different objectives that I have.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.low.hanging.fruit.apievangelist.com/">Low Hanging Fruit</a></strong> - Identifying the potential CSV, XLS, XML, and table resources that exist in any domain, and publish them to Github as a list for deploying as APIs - aka the low hanging fruit.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.tsa.report/">TSA.Report</a></strong> - A simple form for submitting your thoughts as you are going through the airport line.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.apis.how/">APIs.How</a></strong> - The URL shoretner for the API Evangelist and Kin Lane network--getting off Bitly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.magnetic.jargon.kinlane.com/">Magnetic Jargon</a></strong> - A dictionary creation API, allowing the building of word lists to use for a magnetic fridge web and mobile app I am building.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these APIs have a specific purpose. Low Hanging Fruit, and APIs.how are both very back-end system tools, where TSA.Report and Magnetic Jargon are meant to drive simple web and mobile applications. The purpose of these applications are not the point of this story, the minimum viable existence of these four new APis is what I want to talk about.</p>
<p>These four APIs are far from complete. I anticipate that TSA.Report and Magnetic.Jargon will evolve based upon the apps that are developed on them, but Low Hanging Fruit and APIs.How are core to how I do business, and will continue to evolve as far as I can afford to scale them (ie how many sites and links I can index).&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal this weekend, is to just get the APIs up and running. Their overall relevance and productivity in my world will be decided by their roadmap. I just needed to establish them as a real project, and get a mimum viable definition up and running. Here is what defines a minimum viable API in my world right now:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API</strong> - One or many endpoints that serve data, content, or other resources via one of my domains.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - A JSON definition of the surface area, and underlying data model for any API I provide.</li>
<li><strong>API Blueprint -</strong> A markdown&nbsp;definition of the surface area, and underlying data model for any API I provide.</li>
<li><strong>Postman </strong>- A Postman Collection allowing anyone to quickly deploy an API in a Postman Client.</li>
<li><strong>API Science Monitor </strong>- At least one monitor of one of the endpoints, acknowledging it is up and running.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json -</strong> Providing an index of each project, giving me machine readable access to each API, as well as its operations.</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo -</strong> A repository to house the server code (privately), but also publish a developer portal with API definitions available via a known location.</li>
</ul>
<p>This the current minimum viable definition of an API in my world currently. I will be adding more endpoints to each of these APIs, as well as other building blocks to support their operations, but this represents the start for each of these projects for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly I do not know if each of these APIs will survive. They will each have their own road-maps, one that is driven based upon how much I evangelize, and ultimately attract interest from consumers. Each API will have its own monetization strategy, something I will work on sharing via the API definitions that I've published in their API portals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two of these APIs are core to my operations as API Evangelist, while two of them are just really for fun, and are in support of simple micro apps I wish to deploy. Low Hanging Fruit will depend on how much funding I can get for each domain indexes, and APIs.How will thrive based upon the growth of my own writing and storytelling. The other two will be driven by advertising revenue, and I do not expect anyone to actually build anything else on the APIs, they only exist because I am API-first in everything I do.</p>
<p>Now that I have a minimum viable existence for all four of these APIs I can move into the next next steps for each project, while also addressing other items on my task list, but at least I know these projects are up and running, and discoverable when I get time to get back to them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-puzzle-strategic.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/issues/159">I was gathering my thoughts today around API management solutions can better work together, in response to an industry discussion going on between several creators of open source tooling</a>. The Github thread is focused on proxies, and how they can work more closely together to facilitate interoperability in this potentially federated layer of the API economy, but as I do, I wanted to step back and look at bigger picture before I responded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was gathering my thoughts, <a href="http://apigarage.com/">I also had an interesting conversation with the creator of API Garage</a>, in which one of the topics was around how we encourage API service providers to want to work closer, but this time from the perspective of a <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">API client workspace</a>. This made me think, that the thoughts I was gathering about how open source proxies can better work together, should be universally applied to every step along the API lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Open APIs</strong><br />It should be a no-brainer for API service providers--have an API! <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">One of the best examples of this, is with 3Scale API management--they have a very robust API, that represents every aspect of the API management layer</a>. Other service providers like <a href="https://developer.apiscience.com/">API Science</a>, and <a href="http://docs.apimatic.apiary.io/">APIMATIC</a>, who server other stops along the API life-cycle, also have their own APIs. If you want your API tooling to work with other API tooling, have an API--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/20/swagger-20-for-the-docker-api/">think about Docker, and their API interface, and make your tools behave this way</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong><br />Provide openly licensed tooling around any service you provide. Make your tooling as modular as you can, and apply open source licenses wherever it makes sense. Open licenses, facilitate people working together, and breaks down silos. This is obvious to the folks on the API proxy thread I'm referencing, but will not be as obvious to other service providers looking to break into the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open Definitions</strong><br />Speak common API definition formats like Swagger, API Blueprint, and in Postman Collections, and provide indexes using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. If consumers can import and export in their preferred definition format they will be able to get up and running much quicker, share patterns between the various proprietary services, and the open tooling they are putting to work. There are a lot of opportunities to partner around common API definitions for API deployment, and management, which would open up a potentially new world of API services that aggregate, integrate, and sync between common API platforms throughout the life-cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Open Plugins</strong><br />Developers never want their tooling to be a silo. Allow the extensibility of any tooling or services, from design, to management, or client, using common approaches to connectors, plugins, etc. Make plugins be API first, so that other API service providers can easily take their own APIs, craft a plugin, and quickly bring their value to another platform's ecosystem. Plugins are the doorway to the interoperability that open APIs, source code, and definitions bring to the table for platform providers.</p>
<p><strong>Open Partnerships</strong><br />Open APIs, source code, definitions, and plugins all set the stage for ever deeper levels of partnership. APIs are the pipes, with open source code and definitions providing the grease, and if all API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com">monitoring</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com">testing</a>, <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com">performance</a>, <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">security</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, and <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a> providers allow for plugins, strategic partners can occur organically.</p>
<p>All of this really sounds familiar? It really sounds like what the API space is telling the rest of the business world, so I can't help but see the irony in giving API service and tooling providers this same advice. If you want more partnerships to happen, expose all your resources as APIs, providing open tooling and definitions, allow other companies to plug their features into your solutions, and a whole new world of business development will emerge.</p>
<p>With the mainstream growth we are seeing in the API space in 2015, there are some pretty significant opportunities for partnership between API service providers right now--that is, if we follow the same API-first approach, currently being recommended to API providers.</p>

<p>My own API management system allows me to import Postman collections, HAR files, Charles Proxy XML files, and Swagger version 1.2, but when it comes to output, it only speaks Swagger 2.0. I've been wanting to create a tool for outputting my definitions as API Blueprint for some time now, but just haven't had the time to do the work.</p>
<p>I have been secretly hoping someone would build a good quality, so I wouldn't have to do this work myself. Now I have <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>, an API definition translation platform, developed by the <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> team. Using API Transformer you can upload or pull API definitions in the following formats:</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/"><img style="margin-top: 60px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-json-with-blueprint.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>API Blueprint</li>
<li>Swagger 1.0 - 1.2</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 JSON</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 YAML</li>
<li>WADL - W3C 2009</li>
<li>Google Discovery</li>
<li>RAML 0.8</li>
<li>I/O Docs - Mashery</li>
<li>APIMATIC Format</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you can output API definitions in the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Blueprint</li>
<li>Swagger 1.2</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 JSON</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 YAML</li>
<li>WADL - W3C 2009</li>
<li>APIMATIC Format</li>
</ul>
<p>With API Transformer, they are offering a pretty valuable service, that any API service provider, and API consumer can put to work right away. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I quickly generated four API Blueprints, for my API, audio, blog, and building block APIs, which I also indexed as part of each APIs.json file</a>.</p>
<p>As any good API service provider should, The API Transformer has an API. You can build in API transformations between definition into any service or tooling. In my opinion, every API service provider in 2015 should speak as many API definitions as possible, always allowing customers to import, and export in all of the formats offered above.</p>
<p>API Transformer reflects how API service providers should work, it is doing one thing, and doing it well, and it provides a simple web interface, as well as a dead simple API. There is no way I will be building out my own service now that <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">APIMATC has launched API Transformer</a>.</p>

<p>I just sat in on an <a href="http://apiware.io">APIWare</a> call with a fast growing startup, developing a better understanding of how we can assist their team. They have a pretty solid development team behind their API, so providing core API development resources is not in the cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where&nbsp; this startup is needing the most help, is where the APIWare team shines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Operations Review -</strong> Taking a look at how an API platform works from the inside out, preferably starting with an outside perspective, so we can bring that fresh perspective to the table, and immediately begin adding value to the road-map.</li>
<li><strong>Crafting API Strategy -</strong> With a better understanding of how an API works, inside and out, we can take a walk through our massive list of best practices, and see what we can apply when it comes to bringing together a strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing companies with a comprehensive review of their API operations from an outside perspective, but also walking through their architecture, team, and other internal resources, is a valuable process on its own. Having a team of experience API professionals listening, and walking through the current makeup of your API operations helps you better articulate your vision while also helping us define how things work, so a coherent API strategy can be crafted by our team.</p>
<p>This is the stage we are in with this particular startup conversation--kicking off a formal review, so we can help them craft a coherent API strategy. Once this is done, we can re-assess how we can help them, and probably begin telling more public stories about the project. This conversation reflects other conversations the APIWare team is having with other startups, SMB and enterprise groups. However one thing that did present itself on this call, is how APIWare is also becoming a burst-able development team that can act as a backup when small startups are faced with potentially large enterprise relationships that come with API success.</p>
<p>This particular startup&nbsp; just had a new enterprise customer come in through their API, the dream of any small API, until you actually have to scramble to meet the demands. I have seen the interest of the enterprise be both a blessing and a curse in the past for small teams, something that has the potential to derail a startup, taking them away from the daily work that matters. The enterprise has the resources to throw at these projects, but small startup teams do not always have what it takes to keep day to day operations running smoothly, while also meeting the needs of a large project or partnership.</p>
<p>This is APIWare. In addition to helping this startup review their current API operations, and craft a coherent API strategy, the APIWare team is here to help their core API developer team expand and contract as necessary. We are getting to know know the company's existing infrastructure and operations, primarily to be able to help craft the overall API strategy, but this awareness also puts us in a good position to step in and help either to help with a larger project, or augment the core team, while they address the needs of larger, temporary projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability for APIWare to be there for a company in this capacity always starts with an API operations review. We can't be waiting in the wings, ready to work, if we aren't up to speed on how things are currently operating, and in tune with the road-map. It is nice to be starting these conversations early, so we are up to speed when we are needed most. I am happy to see that staying specialized in the areas of API design, deployment, and management is proving to be a valuable approach to the startups we are talking with so far.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-engine-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Sometimes I have ideas, that are sticky, meaning they won't leave my brain, but are not always concepts I personally enjoy exploring. This is just a little insight into the madness that is my brain, focus Kin...FOCUS! So, I found myself thinking last week about API monetization, while I was also updating my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> and <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a> research--then, during this Reese's peanut butter cup moment, I came up with an idea for a suggested or sponsored link relation engine for hypermedia APIs.</p>
<p>First, I'd prefer to start with what I'd consider to be a hypermedia suggestion engine, that could provide external suggestions for related links to any structured data that is being returned via an API. It is a suggestion engine that an API provider, who has followed hypermedia principles as part of their API design, could use to augment the resources they are serving up. Such a suggestion engine would have to be pretty smart, and work from an existing index that API providers could train via an external API.</p>
<p>One possible example of this from my existing work, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/15/can-we-keep-important-scientific-research-projects-alive-through-revenue-generated-from-api-access/">is present in a scientific research API</a>, that might be serving up research papers, and with each API call you could potentially get some native related links for annotating, tagging, and other opportunities that are dictated by the API providers. But, what if the institution, where the research occurred could provide related links to other research going on at the institution, or maybe a governing scientific organization could suggest other related research or resources, and it was up to the API provider to whitelist or blacklist link relations that were included.</p>
<p>Taking this to the next level, which is inevitable, and I might as well be the asshole who suggest it, but what if API providers could approve a paid index of links to suggest as a link relation, for any product in the catalog. Sure you can add this product to your wishlist, or shopping cart, but you could also donate it to a non-profit organization, or buy it through a partner who will modify it for me, and deliver it to me in a way that improves on the original product experience. Such a link relation engine could inject valuable links into the API stream, and the API provider, and potentially developers could tap into this as a potential revenue stream. Of course, all links included would be fully vetted, and <a href="https://metacert.com/">certified secure using a service like Metacert</a>.</p>
<p>If you are still reading this, this link relation engine does not exist. This is just a random idea derived from the collision of several of my active projects, with a little forward thought of what could be one possible dystopian post-advertising world, API monetization world might look like. I'm sure, like current advertising, 90% of the links in a link relation engine would be total shit, but who knows, they might also add value to the increasing number of structured objects being served up via APIs, and maybe active as a next generation financial engine that is tailored specifically for the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-business-dev-code.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If  you are in an industry being impacted by technology, you have probably  become very aware of the term Application Programming Interfaces, more  widely known as APIs, and how they are driving web applications, mobile  applications, and increasingly everyday  objects in our homes, cars, businesses, and across the public  landscape. If you are finding yourself part of this growing  conversations, you have most likely have also heard talk of a new breed  of API definition formats that are becoming ubiquitous like Swagger  and API Blueprint.</p>
<p>API definitions are a way to describe what an API does, providing a  machine readable blueprint of how to put the digital resource to work.  API definitions are not new, but this latest round of available formats  are taking the API conversation out of just  IT and developer groups, and enabling business units, and other key  stakeholders to participate throughout the API life-cycle. Much like the  latest wave of web APIs has made data, content, and other digital  resources like video and images more accessible,  API definitions are making APIs more accessible across the rapidly  expanding digital business landscape.</p>
<p>The first widely available API definition format was the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl"> Web Services Description Language (WSDL)</a>, which is an XML format  established in 2001 that described web services. Much like web services  (an API predecessor), WSDL was a very technical vision of APIs,  something dictated by IT, and developer groups, with  heavy top down governance from business and industry leadership. While  web services, and WSDL are still ubiquitous across the enterprise, they  are rapidly being replaced with much lighter weight, simpler web APIs  that use the Internet as a way of delivering  the digital data, content, and resources web, mobile, and devices are  demanding in 2015.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round-certified.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Along the way, newer, more web friendly API definition formats emerged, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language"> Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, but ultimately WADL was  something that never took root, suffering from many of the same illness  of its predecessor WSDL. It wasn't until a new format called <a href="http://swagger.io"> Swagger</a> was born, that we started to see the conversation around how  we define, communicate and develop standardized tooling around APIs  evolve, providing an open specification for defining all the details  that go into an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swagger provided developers a way to describe an API that was more in  sync with everything else modern API developers were used to, including  using JSON, rather than the XML of previous web services, WSDL and  WADL. Swagger gave us something more than just  way to define APIs, it gave us swagger UI, which is a interactive  version of API documentation that made learning about what an API does,  and how to integrate with it, a hands on, interactive experience. This  new approach to documentation gave us a solution  to the number one problem plaguing API providers, which was out of date  documentation that confused consumers.</p>
<p>Shortly after Swagger began seeing wide adoption because of the  interactive documentation it provided for APIs, a new API definition  format also emerged called API Blueprint, which provided interactive  documentation, but rather than using JSON, it used Markdown,  making the process of defining APIs a little less intimidating for  non-developers. Apiary, the makers of API Blueprint did another thing  that would move the conversation forward again, making the reasons for  defining APIs in these formats, more about API design,  than just about delivering up-to-date documentation.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-blueprint-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Using API Blueprint, API designers could define an API, before any  code was actually written. Developers could craft an API using Apiary's  tooling, then a mock version of an API could be generated, which could  be shared with other project stakeholders, from  business users, to potential web or mobile developers. This process  saves considerable time, money, and other resources in ensuring than API  would be something web, mobile, and device developers could actually  put to use. With two new API definition formats  Swagger, and now API Blueprint, the processing of defining, designing  APIs in a machine readable way, was accessible to everyone, across a  rapidly expanding API life-cycle.</p>
<p>This evolution has all occurred over the last 4 years, a period which  has also produced other API definition formats like RSDL, RADL, RAML,  I/O Docs, and MSON--just to name a few. All of these API definition  formats are quickly becoming the preferred format  for not just defining, and designing APIs, as well as delivering  documentation. Another positive by-product has been that a new breed of  API service providers are also using it as the central definition for  quickly putting their services to work on any API,  for documentation, mocking and virtualizing APIs, generating server  code, producing software development kits (SDK), and setting up  essential testing and monitoring to keep APIs stable and reliable for  consumers--the API definition driven life-cycle continues  to expand.</p>
<p>In 15 years, like APIs, the API definition formats have moved out of  the real of the technical, and are providing vital business interactions  that ensure APIs meet critical internal, partner, and public needs.  They are also being applied to bring much needed  balance to the political side of API operations, from making sure APIs  are stable, and available, to defining pricing, rate limits, terms of  service, and even helping secure APIs that operate on the open Internet.</p>
<p>API definitions have become a machine readable contract that defines  the boundaries of a relationship between API provider, and its  consumers. Acting as a central truth, that is crafted by developers and  API architects to govern how an API operates, from  mocking to client integration, but in a way that is also setting the  technical, business, and legal expectations of consumers. This API  definition-driven contact is transcending the often proprietary, black  box algorithms that make an API function behind the  scenes, providing a portable, shareable, machine readable contract that  can be shared internally, and externally with partners or the general  public.</p>
<p>The importance of this new layer, and its role in the future of software development can be seen playing out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_America,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc."> Oracle v Google API copyright case</a>, where Oracle (using the courts)  has set the precedent that the naming, and ordering of your interface is  separate from the code, and falls under copyright protection. Beyond  the core legal case, the questions, and understanding  of exactly what is code has been even more interesting. Many API  architects do not see APIs as anything but code, having not seen impacts  of the modern API definition movement within their architecture yet.</p>
<p>API definitions aren't just about defining the URLs, parameters,  headers, and other aspects of API operations that developers need to  know, it is also bringing much needed clarity and awareness of value  generated by APIs among business users, and the end-users  of the applications that APIs are powering. API definitions provide a  common format in markdown, YAML, or JSON, that describe the technical  surface of an API, but then also take this technical specification, and  allow it to be applied across every stop along  the API life-cycle, from idea to deployment, to resulting integration  with web, mobile, and device applications.</p>
<p>As APIs make their way into almost every aspect of our business and  personal lives, driving our social relationships with family and  friends, meter our connections to our utility companies, connect us to  educational and healthcare opportunities, this touch-point  between platform, and the web, mobile, and device applications it  powers, is becoming increasingly critical. To businesses this layer  represents critical supply chains, but to each individual this touch  point is where all of our life bits flow--further emphasizing  the importance of, but also the sensitivity required in defining APIs  in a meaningful way, that makes sense to EVERYONE involved.</p>
<p>In 2001, a WSDL definition was very much about communicating what a  service did between platform and an the system that was integrated,  something that only involved IT, and developers. In 2015, a modern API  definition format provides the same benefits that  WSDL has historically delivered, but it is also addressing the  business, and political elements of how Internet enabled software works.  &nbsp;A modern API definition provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>a medium for API designs, architects, and business stakeholders to  craft exactly the API that is needed, before any production code is  written. </li>
<li>a necessary set of instructions needed for a quality assurance (QA) team to make sure an API meets business requirements </li>
<li>a definition of sandbox, mocking, simulation, and virtualization environments that developers may need to be successful </li>
<li>what a developer needs to integrate with another system, or  build an application through interactive documentation, and even  complete Software Development Kits (SDK) </li>
<li>what the API testing, monitoring, and performance groups will need to ensure service level agreements are met or exceeded </li>
<li>the known surface area that security auditor will need to  properly secure the infrastructure web, mobile, devices, and ultimately  users will depend on </li>
<li>a map that government regulators can use to understand the  industry landscape, and help keep all players in alignment with the  nations priorities </li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a sampling of how API definitions are being used as a  driver for what is widely being called the API economy, which is the  heart of cloud, mobile, big data, Internet of Things (IoT), and almost  every other technical trend of the last ten years.  While API definitions provide the much needed machine readable  instructions for computers to understand what occurs at these vital API  touch-points, they also provide the much needed human readable  instructions, that people can use to interpret business agreements,  individual relationships, that are playing out across our increasingly  digital lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dimensions-pricing.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When it comes to the API space, it always takes numerous conversations with API providers and practitioners, before something comes into focus for me. I've spent five years having <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> conversations, an area that is very much in focus for me when it comes to my own infrastructure, as well as using as a metric for reviewing the other public and private APIs that I review regularly.</p>
<p>While I have been paying attention to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">API monetization</a> for a couple years now (thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), in 2015 I find myself involved in 20+ conversations, forcing the topic to slowly come into focus for me, whether I like it or not. When talking to companies and organizations about how they can generate revenue from their APIs, I generally find the conversation going in one of two directions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource</strong> - We will be directly monetizing whatever resource we are making available via the API. Charging for access to the resource, and composing of multiple access tiers depending on volume, and partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - We believe the technology behind the API platform is where the money is, and will be charging for others to use this technology. Resulting in a growing wholesale / private label layer to the API economy.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>90% of the conversation I engage in are focused in the first area, and how to make money off API access to a resource. The discussion is almost always about what someone will pay for a resource, something that is more art than science--even in 2015. The answer is, we don't know until there is a precedent, resulting in an imbalance where developers expect things for free, and providers freak the fuck out--then call me. ;-)</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/08/catching-my-breath-on-my-api-monetization-ramblings-before-i-enter-into-some-new-conversations/">As more of my thoughts around API monetization solidfy</a>, a third dimension is slowly coming into focus, one that won't exist for all API providers (especially those without consumers), but is something I think should be considered as part of a long term roadmap.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exhaust</strong> - Capture, and make accessible the logs, usage, tooling, and other resources that are developed and captured through the course of API operations, and make available in a self-service, pay as you go approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways you can capture the exhaust around API operations, and sell access to it. This is where the ethics of APIs come into play--you either do this right, or you do it in a way that exploits everything along the way. This could be as simple as providing an API endpoint for accessing search terms executed against an API, all the way to providing a franchise model around the underlying technology behind an API, with all the resources someone needs to get up and running with their own version of an API. If you are very short-sighted this could be just about selling all your exhaust, behind the scenes to your partners and investors.</p>
<p>To me this is all about stepping back, and looking at the big picture. If you can't figure out a theoretical, 3rd dimension strategy for making money off the exhaust generated by the resource you are making available via an API, and the underlying technology used to do so---there probably isn't a thing there to begin with. Well, if you can't do this in an ethical way, that you will want to talk about publicly, and with your grandmother, you probably shouldn't be doing it in the first place. I'm not saying there isn't money to be made, I'm say there isn't real value, and money to be made that also lets you also sleep at night.</p>
<p>This opens up a number of ethical benchmarks for me. If you are looking at selling the exhaust from everything to your VC partners, and never open it up via your public APIs, you probably are going to do very well in the current venture capital (VC) driven climate. What I'm talking about, is how do you generate a new layer of revenue based upon the legitimate exhaust, that is generate from the valuable resource you are making available, and the solid technological approach that is behind it. If there is really something there, and you are willing to talk about it, and share publicly, the chances I'm going to care and talk about on my blog increases dramatically.</p>
<p>If you do not have a clue what I'm talking about, you probably aren't that far along in your API journey. That is fine. This isn't a negative. Just get going as soon as you can. If you are further along, and have people and companies actually using your API, there is ap robably a lot of value already being generated. If you partner with your ecosystem, and educate, as well as communicate with end-users properly--I am just highlight that there is a lot of opportunity to be captured in this 3rd dimension.</p>

<p>Amazon did a good job, providing a GUI interface for crafting the methods, resources, and underlying data models for APIs you are deploying using the gateway. However when you <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">compare to some of the GUI API design editors I mentioned in my last post on this subject, from Restlet, APIMATIC, and Gelato</a>, the Amazon interface clearly needs evolve a little more.</p>
<p>AWS is just getting started with their solution, so I'm not knocking what they have done. I just wanted to keep comparing of all of the solutions as they emerge, and highlight the opportunity for some standardization in this layer of API tooling. I see a pretty big opportunity for some player to step up and provide an open source API design editor that provides a seamless experience across API service providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This post is nothing new. I am just trumpeting the call for open API design tooling each time I see another new interface introduced for crafting APIs, their paths, resources, parameters, headers, authentication, and underlying data models. At some point, a new player will emerge with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">the open source API design editor I am looking for</a>, or one of the existing players open sources their current offering, and evolve it in context of the wider API design space, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/we-need-an-open-abstraction-layer-to-help-us-better-define-and-design-our-apis/">providing an abstracted layer that supports all API definition formats</a>.</p>
<p>With the growth in the number of service providers I see stepping up to server the API space, the need for common, open tooling when it comes to API design is only going to grow. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">It took almost four years of waiting for the API management space to figure this out</a>, I'm hoping I don't have to wait as long in the API design side of things.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-monetization-strategy.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of my readers recently reached out to me, in response <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/08/catching-my-breath-on-my-api-monetization-ramblings-before-i-enter-into-some-new-conversations/">to some of my recent stories of monetization opportunities around government and scientific open data and APIs</a>. I'm not going to publish his full email, but he brought&nbsp;up a couple of key, and very important realities of open data and APIs that I don't think get discussed enough, so I wanted to craft a story around them, to bring front and center in my work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most open data published from government is crap, and requires extra work before you can do anything with it</li>
<li>There currently are very few healthy models for developers to follow when it comes to building a business around open data</li>
<li>Business people and developers have zero imagination when it comes to monetization -- aka ads, ads, ads, and more ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>My reader sums it all up well with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I don't dispute that with some pieces of government data, they can be  integrated into existing businesses, like real estate, allowing a  company to value add. But the startup space levering RAW open, or paid  government data is a lot harder. Part of my business does use paid  government data, accessible via an API, but these opportunities the  world over are few and far between in my mind.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think his statement reflects the often unrealized challenges around working with open data, but in my opinion it also the opportunity when it comes to the API journey, when applied to this world of open data.</p>
<p>APIs do not equal good, and if you build a simple API on top of open government data, it does not equal instant monetization  opportunity as an API provider. It will take domain experts (or aspiring ones) to really get to know  the data, make it accessible via simple web APIs, and begin iterating  on new approaches to using the open data to enrich web and mobile applications in ways that someone is willing to pay for.</p>
<p>The reality of taking an open data set, cleaning it up, and then  being able to monetize access to it directly via an API is simply not a reality,  and is something that will only work in probably less than 5% of the  scenarios where it is applied. However this doesn't mean that there aren't opportunities out there when it comes to monetizing adjacent to, and in relationship to the open data.</p>
<p>Before you can develop any APIs that any business or organization would want to pay for you have to add value. You do this by adding more meaningful endpoints that do not just reflect the original data or database resources, and provide actual value to end users of the web and mobile devices that being built--this is the API journey you hear me speak of so soften.</p>
<p>You can also do this by connecting the dots between disparate data-sets, in the form of crosswalks, and the establishing common data formats that can be applied across local, and regional governments, or possibly an industry. Once common data formats and interface models are established, and a critical mass of high value open data, common tooling can begin to evolve, creating opportunities for further software, service, and partnership revenue models.</p>
<p>The illness that exists when it comes to the current state of open data is something partly shared between early open data advocates when it came to over-promising the potential of open data, and their own under-delivery, as well as the governments under-delivery when it came to the actual roll-out and execution around their open data efforts. Most of the data published cannot be readily put to work, requiring several additional steps before the API journey even begins--making more work for anyone looking to develop around it, putting up obstacles, instead of removing them.</p>
<p>There is opportunity to generate revenue from open data published by government, but it isn't easy, and it definitely isn't VC scale opportunity, <a href="http://hdscores.com/">but for companies like HDSCore, when it comes selling aggregate restaurant inspection data to companies like Yelp, there is a viable business model</a>. Companies that are looking to build business models around open data need to tamper down their expectations of being the next Twitter, and open data advocates need to stop trumpeting that open data and APIs will fix all that is wrong with government. We need to lower the bar, and just get to work doing the dirty work of exposing, cleaning up, and evolving how open data is put to work.</p>
<p>It will take a lot of work to find more of the profitable scenarios, and it will take years and years of hard work to get government open data to where it is default, and the cleanliness and uselessness levels are high enough, before we see the real potential of open data and APIs. All this hard work, and shortage of successful models, doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. For example, just because we can't make money providing direct access to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/">Recreational Information Database (RIDB),</a> doesn't mean there isn't potentially valuable APIs when it comes to understanding how people plan their summer vacations at our national parks--it will just take time to get there.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a> project is purely about the next steps in this evolution, and making valuable government "open data" that has been published as CSVs and Excel, more accessible and usable, by cleaning them up and publishing them as JSON and / or APIs. I am just &nbsp;acknowledging how much work there is ahead of us when it comes to making the currently available open data accessible and usable, so we can just begin the conversation about how we make them better, as well as how we generate revenue to fund this journey.</p>

        <p><a href="http://cloud-elements.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/cloud-elements-logo.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-loader/">Element Loader from API service provider Cloud Elements</a> came across my monitoring this week, providing a configurable JavaScript application that help simplify data migration, allowing you to move content and data between cloud platforms, by putting their APIs to work.</p>
<p>The Element Loader is interesting to me as an evolution to the concept of what I&rsquo;ve long called <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">API reciprocity</a>, where companies like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> allows you to migrate your bits and bytes between the platforms we are all increasingly finding ourselves dependent on.</p>
<p>I think Cloud Elements is moving the needle forward just a bit, by formalizing a tool that is dedicated to real-time sync, between the platforms you depend on. You can accomplish similar things with Zapier, but I think looking at it purely about sync of specific life bits (objects) can be a very valuable exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been calling this reclaim your domain for a couple years now, where I think the process of identifying the services we depend on is extremely valuable, and one where establishing a plan for how your bits and bytes work in concert, really pushes things into the realm of actually healthy IT operations--for both individuals and businesses.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-loader/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ElementLoaderWorkflow.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I do not have my world synced. My contacts on Google, LinkedIn, and other platforms are totally out of sync, and my documents are spread between Google, Amazon, and Dropbox, without any coherency at all. Don&rsquo;t get me started on my images. This is a real problem, that is only growing, and a segment where I'd like to see more solutions like Element Loader emerge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start tracking on reciprocity providers like Cloud Elements who are doing specific things like sync, which will become one of the common building blocks I&rsquo;ll add to my research when I get the time to update. Hopefully I will find some more time soon to take a deeper look at my my <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API automation and interoperability research</a>--it has been a while.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://learn-more.idxbroker.com/developer-summit/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/idx-summit-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://learn-more.idxbroker.com/developer-summit/">I preparing a talk this week in Portland, OR, at the IDX Developer Summit</a>. IDX serves the real estate industry, providing real estate professionals access to hundreds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_listing_service">multiple listing services (MLS)</a> groups, from around the United States. If you are a real estate broker or agent, and you need real estate listings on your site, IDX is how you do this--they are leading player in the space.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with the world of real estate data, it has been long controlled by a network of MLS groups, totaling almost 2000 (I think), spread around the nation. These MLS organizations tightly control their data, deciding exactly who has access to it, and exactly how it can be used, and how it MUST be displayed in print and across the web. This is a process that has long existed, prior to the existence of the web, but since 1995, it is mechanism that has gotten even more strict, and litigious, seeking to maintain their control over a very valuable, and increasingly digital layer of our physical worlds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to APIs, the real estate industry is the OG API provider, making data available via FTP locations as soon as the web was a thing. However, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">when it comes to the core principles of what makes APIs work</a>, the real estate industry is the anti-API. MLS hoard facts, something that cannot have copyright applied, but if you are litigious enough, it is something you can defend. The address, and details of residential and commercial property is data that should be accessible to everyone, but MLS groups, and National Association of Realtor (NAR) have created a cartel, that prevents this from ever being a reality. Think what the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and record labels have done to music--the MLS and NAR do this to real estate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/idx-real-estate.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>IDX has struck a balance between hundreds of these MLS organizations, allowing them to process their prized data, and enable real estate agents and brokers to publish this data on their websites using seamless and often embeddable tooling, that adheres to the distribution, and branding guidelines set by the MLS. IDX provides a bridge between the online digital world, and this legacy world of data control, potentially providing the real estate industry with the online tooling they will need to be successful.</p>
<p>Ok, if the MLS, NAR, and real estate industry is the anti-API, what the hell am I doing speaking at a real estate industry developer conference? Well, I was the original tech founder of IDX. ;-) I build the original system for pulling real estate data, targeting the first handful of MLS organizations. I exited the company sometime around 2005, and my technology is long gone (thank god), and my two co-founders have gone on to do some very interesting things, building a thriving company in a very difficult space.</p>
<p>I won't be going to the&nbsp;IDX Developer Summit to talk shit on the MLS and NAR, I will be helping to inspire the developers, about how much opportunity is available out there right now, even in the real estate industry. There are a lot of open data, and Internet of Things related opportunities emerging when it comes to residential, and commercial buildings, as well as neighborhood, and city level development possibilities. My objective is to help them understand the realities of the space they exist in, and still build value within, and around an industry that is so entrenched when it comes to data sharing--it can be done!</p>
<p>I also hope to get them to use my nationwide MLS API, and bypass the MLS and NAR system. Just kidding!! If you have ever worked in the industry, this is the question every newbie asks, "can't I just get access to the nationwide MLS?". ;-)</p>
<p>I am actually really honored to be speaking at the&nbsp;IDX Developer Summit this week. My buddies Chad and Jeff have done some good work, in a very difficult industry--I am proud of them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aws-api-gateway-icon.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I sat down for a second, more in-depth look at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a>. When it first released <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/09/the-new-aws-api-gateway-anyone-who-does-not-do-this-will-be-fired-thank-you-have-a-nice-day--jeff-bezos/">I took a stroll through the interface, and documentation</a>, but this time, I got my hands dirty playing with the moving parts, and considering how the solution fits into the overall API deployment picture.</p>
<p><strong>API Design Tools</strong><br /><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home">As soon as you land on the Amazon API Gateway dashboard page</a>, you can get to work adding APIs by defining endpoints, crafting specific methods (paths), the crafting the details of your HTTP resources (verbs), and round off your resources with parameters, headers, and underlying data models. You can even map the custom sub-domain of your choosing to your Amazon API Gateway generated API, giving it exactly the base URL you need.</p>
<p><strong>API Mapping Templates</strong><br />One feature provided by the&nbsp;Amazon API Gateway that I find intriguing is the mapping templates. Using the data&nbsp;models and the mapping template tool, you can transform data from one schema to another. This is very interested when you are thinking about evolving your own legacy APIs, but I'm also thinking it could come in real handy for mapping to public APIs, and demonstrating to clients what is possible with a next version--designed from the outside-in-<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/04/swagger-api-definition-mapper/">mapping is something I've wanted to see for some time now</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API Integration Types</strong><br />Up until now, in this review, we are just talking about designing APIs, and possibly mapping our data models together. There are many other ways you can gateway existing systems, databases, and other resources using Amazon API Gateway, but the one that seems to be getting the lions share of the discussion, is deploying APIs with Lambda functions as the back-end.</p>
<p><strong>API Integration Using Lambda Functions</strong><br />Lambda functions give you the ability to create, store, and manage Node.js and Java code snippets, and wire up these resources using the Amazon API Gateway. When you create your first Lambda function, you are given a small selection of blueprints, like a microservice, or db connection, which also allows you to edit your code inline, upload a .zip file, and pull a .zip file from Amazon S3 (where is the Github love).</p>
<p><strong>Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM)</strong><br />The Amazon API Gateway gives you some pretty simple ways to secure your APIs using API keys, but then also gives you the whole <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS IAM platform,</a> and resources to put to leverage as well. I think most of the IAM will be more than many API providers will need, but for those that need this, I can see this part of their gateway solution sealing the deal.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling Lambda Functions Behind</strong><br />Being scalable is one of the promises of a Lambda backed API deployed using Amazon API Gateway, which I can see being pretty alluring for devops focused teams. You can allocate each Lambda function to posses the memory it needs, and individually monitor and scale as needed. While I see the recent containerization movement taking care of 50% of the API back-end needs, I can also see that being able to quickly scale individual functions as you need using the cloud, taking care of the other 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Events For Lambda Functions</strong><br />Another powerful aspects of a Lambda function, is you can engineer them to response to events. Using the interface, command line, or API, you can define one or many event sources for each Lambda function. Amazon provides some pretty interesting sources for triggering each Lambda function.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Amazon Kinesis</a></strong> - Real-time data processing</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit">Alexa Skills Kit</a></strong> -&nbsp;Voice interaction with devices</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a></strong> - Storing mobile user data</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a></strong> - A NoSQL database&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a></strong> - Secure object storage</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns">Amazon SNS</a></strong> - Push notification service</li>
</ul>
<p>Those six event sources provide some pretty potent event sources for triggering specific functions in your vast Lambda code library. &nbsp;You can rely on running code stored as Lambda functions using the API you deploy using Amazon API Gateway and / or you can have your code run in response to a variety of these events you define.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Lambda</strong><br />When it comes to defining a back-end for the APIs you deploy using Amazon API Gateway, Lambda is just the beginning. Amazon provides three other really interesting ways to power APIs. I see a lot of potential in managing code using Lambda, and using it to scale the back-end of many APIs pretty quickly, but these areas provide some pretty interesting potential as well.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Proxy</strong><br />A quick way to put Amazon API Gateway to use is as a proxy for an existing API. When you think about the potential in this area, when put mapping templates to work, transforming the methods, resources, and models. I haven't mapped it to any existing APIs yet, but will make sure and do so soon, to better understand the HTTP proxy potential.</p>
<p><strong>Mock Integration</strong><br />Another way to quickly deploy an API is mock your integration, providing a quick API that can be used to hack on, making sure an API will meet developer's needs. You may even want to mock an existing public API, rather than use a live resoure as you are developing an application. There are many uses for mock integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AWS Service Proxy</strong><br />The final way Amazon gives provides for you to power your API(s), is by proxying an existing AWS service. This opens up the entire AWS cloud stack for exposing as API resources, using the Amazon API Gateway. This reminds me of other existing API gateway solutions, except instead of your on-premise, legacy infrastructure, this is your in the cloud, more recent infrastructure. I'm guessing this will incentivize many companies to migrate their legacy infrastructure into the cloud, or at least make it cloud friendly, so you can put the AWS service proxy to use--lots of possibilities here.</p>
<p><strong>Defining The Stages Of Your Lifecycle</strong><br />Going beyond the types of integration you can employ when crafting, and deploying APIs using the Amazon API Gateway, the platform also provides a way to define stages that APIs will exist in from design, development, QA, production, or any other stage you wish. I like the concept of having a stage defined for each API, designating where it exists on the API life-cycle. I tend to just have dev and prod, but this might make me consider this a little more deeply, as it seems to be a big part of defining the API journey.</p>
<p><strong>API Monitoring By Default</strong><br />Amazon has built in monitoring by default into the API Gateway, and Lambda functions. You can connect APIs, and their designated integration back-end to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/">CloudTrail</a>, and monitor everything about your operations. CloudTrail is very much a cloud infrastructure logging solution over API analytics solutions, but I could see it evolve into something more than just monitoring and logging, providing an overall awareness of API consumption. Maybe an opportunity for the ecosystem to step in via the API(s).</p>
<p><strong>CLI An API For The API Gateway</strong><br />You have to admit, Amazon gets interfaces, making sure every service on the platform has a command line interface as well as an API. This is where a lot of the API orchestration magic will come into play in my opinion. The ability to automate every aspect of API design, deployment, management, and monitoring, across your whole stack, using an API is the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There Are Some Limitations</strong><br />There are some <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/limits.html">current limitations of the Amazon API Gateway</a>. They limit things to 60 APIs maximum per AWS account, 300 resources maximum per API, 10 stages maximum per API, and 10-second timeout for both AWS Lambda and HTTP back-end integration. They are just getting going, so I'm sure they are just learning how people will be using the API deployment and management infrastructure in the cloud, and we'll see this evolve considerably.</p>
<p><strong>What Will This Cost?</strong><br />Lambda is providing the first 1 million requests per month for &nbsp;free, and $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter, or $0.0000002 per request. The Amazon&nbsp;API Gateway costs&nbsp;$3.50 per million API calls received, plus the cost of data transfer out, in gigabytes. It will be interesting to see what this costs at scale, but I'm sure overall, it will be very inexpensive to operate like other AWS services, and with time the cost will come down even further as they dial it all in.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/amazon-api-gateway-screen.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>AWS API Gateway Has Me Thinking</strong><br />I won't be adopting AWS right away, I'd prefer to watch it evolve some more, but overall I like where they are taking things. The ability to quickly deploy code with Lambda, and use blueprints to clone, and deploy the code-behind APIs, has a lot of potential. Most of my APIs are just simple code that either returns data from a database, and conducts some sort of programmatic function, making Lambda pretty attractive, especially when it comes to helping you scale and monitor everything by default.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/10/aws-is-selling-the-api-solution-the-enterprise-will-buy-not-necessarily-the-api-solution-they-need/">My original criticism of the platform still stands</a>. Amazon is courting the enterprise with this, providing the next generation of API gateway for the legacy resources we have all accumulated in the cloud. Something that really doesn't help large companies sort through their technical debt, allowing them to just grow it, and manage it in the cloud. Win for AWS, so honestly it makes sense, even though it doesn't deliver critical API life-cycle lessons the enterprise will need along way to actually make change.</p>
<p>This is a reason I won't be getting hooked on Lambda + Amazon API Gateway anytime soon, because I really don't want to be locked into their services. I'm a big fan of my platform employing common, open server tooling (Linux, Apache, NGINX, MySQL, PHP), and not relying on specialty solutions to make things efficient--I rely on my skills, and experience and knowledge of the resources I'm deploying, to deliver efficiency at scale. My farm to table approach to deploying APIs, keeps me in tune with my supply chain, something that may not work for everyone.</p>
<p>While the tooling I use may not be the most exciting, it is something I can move from AWS, and run anywhere. All of my APIs can easily be recreated on any hosting environment, and I can find skills to help me with this work almost anywhere in the world. After 25 years of managing infrastructure, I'm hyper-aware of lock-in, even the subtle moves that happen over time. However, my infrastructure is much smaller than many of the companies who will be attracted to AWS Lambda + API Gateway, which actually for me, is another big part of the API lesson and journey, but if you don't know this already, I'll keep it to myself.</p>
<p>I'd say AWS gives a healthy nod to the type of platform portability I'm looking for, with the ability to import and export your back-end code using Lambda, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2015/07/introducing-swagger-importer-easily-import-swagger-api-definitions-into-amazon-api-gateway/">and the ability to use API definitions like Swagger as part of Amazon API Gateway emerge</a>. These two things will play a positive role in the overall portability, and interoperability of the platform, but doing this for the deeper connections made with other AWS services, will be a lot harder to evolve from if you ever have to migrate from AWS.</p>
<p>For now, I'll keep playing with Amazon API Gateway, because it definitely holds a lot of potential for some very powerful API orchestration, add while the platform may not work for me 100%, AWS is putting some really interesting concepts into play.</p>

<p>I can easily write scripts to help me do this, but I'm trying to keep the process as close to what the average person, who will be adopting a government agency data set, will experience.

<p>I had a reinder on my task list to check-in on where some of the common database platforms were when it came to APIs. I think it was a Postgres announcement from a while back that put the thought in my notebook, but as an old database guys I tend to check-in regularly on the platforms I have worked most with.</p>
<p>The point of this check-in, is to see how far along each of the database platforms are when it comes to easy API deployment, directly from tables. The three relational database platforms I'm most familiar with are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SQL Server - </strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa174556(v=SQL.80).aspx">The platform has APIs to manage</a>, and you <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg192995.aspx">deploy an OData service</a>, as well as <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-dotnet-rest-service-aspnet-api-sql-database/">put .NET to work</a>, but nothing really straightward, that would allow any developer to quickly expose simple RESTful API.</li>
<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> - I'd say PostgreSQL is furthest along with thier "early draft proposal of an extension to PostgreSQL allowing clients to access the database using HTTP", as they have the most complete information about how to deploy an API.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong> - There was a <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/09/MySQL-RESTLabs">writeup in InfoQ about&nbsp;MySQL offering a REST API</a>, but from what I can tell it is still in <a href="http://labs.mysql.com/">MySQL Labs</a>, without much movement or other stories I could find to show any next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The database that drives my API platform is MySQL running via Amazon RDS. I haven't worked on Postgres for years, and jumped ship on SQL Server a while back (my therapist says I cannot talk about it). I automate the generation of my APIs using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim framework</a>, then do the finish work like polishing the endpoints to look less like their underlying database, and more like how they will actually be used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe database platforms shouldn't get into the API game? Leaving API deployment to the API gateway providers like <a href="http://www.slashdb.com/">SlashDB</a> and <a href="http://blog.dreamfactory.com/add-a-rest-api-to-any-sql-db-in-minutes">DreamFactory</a>. It just seems like really low hanging fruit for these already used database solutions, to make it dead simple for developers to expose, and craft APIs from existing datasources.</p>
<p>if you are using any database to API solutions for SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or MySQL, please let me know.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://pages.3scale.net/api-design-provider-guide-wb.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-design-providers-guide.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There was a pretty interesting conversation around API design going on in one of my API slack channels over the last couple days, about what is API design, and what is needed to get developers, and even non-developers more aware of the best practices that exist. It is a private group, so I won't broadcast it as part of this post, but I did want to extract a narrative from it, and help me set a bar for other API design discussions I am having.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Restafarian, hypermedia, and linked data folk have long been frustrated by the adoption of sensible API design practices across the sector, and the lack of basic HTTP literacy among developers, and non-developers is at dangerously high levels. The good news, is some of this is beginning to change, but we still have so much work to do, something that won't be easy, and unfortunately it won't always have the clean outcomes leaders in the space are looking for.</p>
<p>APIs returning JSON is just the next step in the evolution of the web, and when you consider how much work it took to get everyone on-board with HTML, and building web pages, then web apps, and recently mobile apps, you can begin to understand the work that still lies ahead. We have to help the next generation of developers be more HTTP literate (something the previous generations of developers aren't), and possess a baseline knowledge of common API design best practices. This needs to be done in a world where many of these developers really aren't going to care about the specifics of good API design, like us API architects and early pioneers have.</p>
<p>The average API designer in the future will not always be willing to argue about the nuance of how to craft URLs, whether to use a header or parameter, caching, and how to version. They just want to get the outcome they seek, accomplish their project, and get paid for their work. Consider the solar industry as a quick comparison. The first wave of installers were domain experts, while the following waves of installers who will be focused on scaling and maintaining the industry, will only need to be trained on only what is required to get the job done in a stable, profitable way.</p>
<p>Ok. So how do we do this right? I feel like we are already on the good path. We just need you to publish your own API design guide somewhere that we can all learn from, like other leading API providers already present in<a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html"> my API design research</a>. As we build a critical mass of these, we need to also work to aggregate the best practices across them, so that instructors and textbook publishers can incorporate into their curriculum. If you have an API platform, and have ever wished that there were more highly skilled API designers out there, make sure you have your API design practices documented, and shared with the world.</p>
<p>This will get healthy API design practices out of the trenches of startups, SMBs, enterprise, and government agencies, and get it into the educational institutions around the world. Then we can start equipping the next generation of programmers with the knowledge they will need to be successful in delivering the resources need for the next generation of Internet powered apps, networks, and devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to add on emore thing. API service companies who are looking to provide tooling that API providers can use to do deploy APIs, will have share in the load here. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/10/aws-is-selling-the-api-solution-the-enterprise-will-buy-not-necessarily-the-api-solution-they-need/">This is core to my criticism of the AWS API Gateway, in that I applaud their use HAL, but please make sure you also provide a healthy dose of hypermedia literacy along the way, don't just hide it behind the curtain</a>. I really do not want to see the another FrontPage for APIs, so if you are building an API editor, let me know so I can provide you with some ideas. (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">1</a>) (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">2</a>).</p>
<p>We all have a lot of work to do, in preparing the next generation of developers, and business users when it comes to a baseline of HTTP literacy, as well as a healthy dose of API awareness. We are going to need an army of API designers to help us deliver on the API economy we are all seeing in our heads--so let's get to work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/crafting-and-publishing-api-design-guide-shows-that-you-are-further-along-in-your-api-journey/">If you do not have a formal API design strategy get to work on one (let me know if you need help)</a>.

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears-questions.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have two more conversations kicking off on the topic of API monetization, so I just needed to take a moment to gather up the last wave of posts on the subject, catch my breath, and refresh my overall thoughts in the area. What I really like about this latest wave, is that they are about providing much needed funding for some potentially very important API driven resources. Another thing is that they are pretty complicated, unproven approaches to monetizing APIs--breaking ground!!</p>
<p>Over the last couple weeks, I have be engaged in four specific conversations that have shifted my gaze to the area of API monetization:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/30/is-your-monetization-rooted-in-the-resource-or-experience-side-of-your-api-operations/">Audiosear.ch</a>&nbsp;- Talking with the PopupArchive team about making money around podcast search APIs.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;As I think through the approaches above, I'm pushed to exercise what I can from these discussions, on my own infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/05/expanding-on-my-api-monetization-strategy-and-research/">My API Monetization</a>&nbsp;- As I look to add more APIs to my stack, I'm being forced to clearly define all the moving parts of my API monetization strategy.</li>

</ul>
<p>The API Evangelist network is my research notebook. I search, re-read, and refine all the thoughts curated, and published here. It helps me to aggregate areas of my research, especially in the fast moving areas, where I am receiving the most requests for assistance. Not only does it refresh my memory of what the hell I've written in the last couple weeks, I also hope it gives you a nice executive summary in case you missed anything.</p>
<p>If you are looking for assistance in developing your API monetization strategy, or have your own stories you'd like to share, let me know. If you have any feedback on my stories, including feedback for the folks I'm talking to, as well as items missing from my own API monetization approach, or blockchain delusions--let me know!</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithmic-pricing.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I believe in the ability of APIs to pull back the curtain of the great OZ, that we call IT. The average business and individual technology consumer has long been asked to just believe in the magic behind the tech we use, putting the control into the hands of those who are in the know. This is something that has begun to thaw, with the introduction of the Internet, and the usage of web APIs to drive applications of all shapes and sizes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn't just that we are poking little holes into the corporate and government firewall, to drive the next generation of applications, it is also that a handful of API pioneers like Amazon, Flickr, Twitter, Twilio, and others saw the potential of making these exposed resources available to any developers. The pulling back of the curtain was done via these two acts, exposing resources using the Internet, but also inviting in 3rd parties to learn about, and tap into these resources.</p>
<p>Something that is present in this evolution of software development, is trust. API providers have to have a certain amount of trust that developers will respect their terms of service, and API consumers have to have a certain amount of trust that they can depend on API providers. To achieve this, there needs to be a healthy dose of transparency present, so API providers can see into what consumers are doing with their resources, and API consumers have to be able to see into the operations, and roadmap for the platform.</p>
<p>When transparency and trust does not exist, this is when the impact of APIs begin to break down and they become simply another tech tool. If a platform is up to no good, has ill intentions, selling vapor ware, or there is corruption behind the scenes, the API concept is just going to create problems, for both provider and consumer. How much is exposed via an API interface is up to the API designer, architect, and ultimatley the governing organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-shipping-container.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are many varying motivations behind why companies open up APIs, and the reasons they make them public or not. APIs allow companies to keep control over their data, content, and algorithmic resources, while also opening them up so "innovation" can occur, or simply be accessible by 3rd party resources to bypass the historical friction or bottleneck that is IT and developer groups. Some companies I work with are aware of this balance being struck, while many others are not aware at all, they simple are trying to make innovation happen, or provide access to resources.</p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.com/blog/">As I spend some brain cycles pondering algorithmic transparency, and the recent concept of "surge pricing" used by technology providers like Uber and Gogo</a>, I am looking to understand how APIs can help pull back the curtain that is in front of many algorithms impacting our lives. in the same way APIs have pulled back the curtains on traditional IT operations, and software development. As part of this thought exercise I'm thinking about the role Docker and other virtualized contaniners can play in providing us with more transparency in how algorithms are making decisions around us.</p>
<p>When I deploy one of my APIs using my microservices model, it has two distinct API layers, one for the container, and one for what runs inside of it. Docker comes ready to go with an API for all aspects of it operations--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">here is an Swagger definition of it</a>. What if all algorithms came with an API by default, just like each Docker container does? We would put algorithms into containers, it would have an interface for every aspect of its operation. The API wouldn't expose the actual inner workings of the algorithm, and its calculations, but provide a complete interface for all its functionality.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithm-flow.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>How much of this API a company wished to expose, would vary just like with APIs, but companies who cared about the trust balance between them, their developers, and end-users, could offer a certain amount of transparency to build trust. The API wouldn't give away the proprietary algorithm, but would give 3rd party groups a way to test assumptions, and verify the promises made around what an alogorithm delivers, thus pulling back the curtain. With no API, we have to trust Uber, GoGo and other providers about what goes into their surge pricing. With an API, 3rd party regulators, and potentially any individual could run tests, validating what is being presented as algorithmic truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know many companies, entrepreneurs, and IT folks will dismiss this as bullshit. I'm used to that. Most of them don't follow my beliefs around the balance between the tech, business, and politics of APIs, as well as the balance between platform, developer, end-users, and what I consider to be an invetiable collison with government regulation. For now this is just a thought exercise, but it is something I will be studying, and pondering more, and as I gather more examples of algorthmic, or "surge pricing", I will work to evolve these thoughts, and solidify into something more presentable.</p>

        <p><a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-monetization-strategy.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This is a full walk-through of me trying to distill down my approach to API monetization, in a way that can be applied across not just 30 APIs, but potentially 300, or 3000. There are several things converging for me right now, which includes the maturing of my own infrastructure, as well as conversations I'm having with startups, enterprise groups, federal government agencies, and my own partner(s).</p>
<p>I need to keep hammering on this to help me operate my own infrastructure, but I am also partnering with <a href="http://apiware.io/">APIWare to help me deliver on much of the API design, deployment, and management</a>, so I need to have a good handle on my costs. As with all of my areas of research, within the area of <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a> I am just trying to get a handle on the common building blocks, and provide a checklist of considerations to be employed when I'm planning and operating my API infrastructure.</p>
<p>To help me build a base, let's walk through some of the building blocks of my own API monetization strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition</strong><br />What do I have invested into any single API. Even if I am building something from scratch, what went into it? Every API I possess has some sort of acquisition cost, even if it is just $14.00 for the two pints of beer I bought while I was brainstorming the idea.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover -&nbsp;</strong>What did I spent to find this. I may have had to buy someone dinner or beer to find, as well as time on the Internet searching, and connecting the dots.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate</strong>&nbsp;- What time to I have in actually getting access to something. Most of the time its on the Internet, and other times it requires travel, and meeting with folks.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing</strong>&nbsp;- There is a chance I would license a database from a company or institution, so I want to have this option in here. Even if this is open source, I want the license referenced as part of acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong>&nbsp;- Also the chance I may buy a database from someone outright, or pay them to put the database together, resulting in one-time fee, which I'm going to call "purchase".</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a framework for me to think about the acquisition of each API resource I possess, makes it easier for me to think it through when I am brainstorming new API ideas. Something that makes sure I am tracking all details from the moment of inception, to when I commit to actually making it available via an API on my platform.</p>
<p><strong>Development</strong><br />What does it actually take to stand up an API. There are a lot of moving parts with making an API happen, and not all of them are technical. Am I willing to invest the time necessary to stand up an API or will it require outside investment, as well as resources. What is needed to take an API from acquisition to actual operation?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment -</strong>&nbsp;Who put up the money to support the development of this API resource? Was it internal, or did we have to take external investment.</li>
<li><strong>Grant -&nbsp;</strong>Was the development of this API rolled up in a grant, or specifically a grant for its development. Covering costs involved.</li>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong>&nbsp;- What does it take me to cleanup, and normalize a dataset, or across content. This is usually he busy janitorial work necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong>&nbsp;- What does it take me to generate a Swagger and API Blueprint, something that isn't just auto-generated, but also has the required hand polish it will require.</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong>&nbsp;- How much work am I putting into setting up the database. A lot of this I can automate, but there is always a setup cost involved.</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong>&nbsp;- Defining the amount of work I put into setting up, and configuring the server to run a new API, including where it goes in my overall operations plan.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong>&nbsp;- How much work to I put into actually coding an API. I use the Slim PHP framework, and using automation scripts I can generate 75% of it usually, but there is always finish work.</li>
<li><strong>DNS</strong>&nbsp;- What was the overhead in me defining, and configuring the DNS for any API, setting up endpoint domain, as well as potentially a portal to house operations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Historically when it came to APIs, I just dove into writing code with little consideration for what went into it. I'd say this is one by-product of the microservices way of thinking, is that I decoupled the moving parts of each of my APIs, allowing me to approach development in this way. I'm sure I will keep slicing off other elements within the development process as I progress.</p>
<p><strong>Operation<br /></strong>What goes into keeping an API operational, reliable and available? How much do I spend on all aspects of an existing APIs lifecycle to make sure it meets the standards of API consumers. Ideally operational costs go down the more efficient the platform gets with overall operations, reducing overhead, and streamlining across everything.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>&nbsp;- How much resources am I applying to creating and maintaining APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprint definitions for my APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of my AWS compute is dedicated to an API. Flat percentage of the server its one until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>&nbsp;- How much on disk storage am I using to operate an API? Could fluctuate from month to month, and exponentially increase for some.</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>&nbsp;- How much bandwidth in / out is an API using to get the job done.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of API management resources is dedicated to the API. A flat percentage of API management overhead until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Code -</strong>&nbsp;What does it cost me to maintain my code samples, libraries, and SDKs for each individual API, or possibly across multiple APIs and endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Evangelism</strong>&nbsp;- How much energy do I put into evangelizing any single API? Did I write a blog post, or am I'm buying Twitter or Google Ads? How is the word getting out?</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of the API monitoring, testing, and performance service budget is dedicated to this API. How large is surface area for monitoring?</li>
<li><strong>Security -</strong>&nbsp;What does it cost for me to secure a single API, as part of the larger overall operations? Does internal resource spend time, or is this a 3rd party service.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization -</strong>&nbsp;What am I spending on virtualization for an API, as part of QA process, for retail sandbox and simulation environments, or for specific partner needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally the more APIs you operate, the more detail you will get about each of these areas, and some of these areas you should get better deals, the more volume you run through each area listed above. Example of this would be with compute and storage costs going down, as we do more business. The more we understand the details of operations, the more we can optimize operations.</p>
<p><strong>Access Levels<br /></strong>What sort of access levels are we going to provide across <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL APIs</strong></span>, not that all APIs will use all areas, but we should be ready for as many scenarios as we possibly can. We need to be clear of what access is the free layer, as well as the tiers of access, and any wholesale, partner, or re-sellers aspects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free (unlimited) -</strong>&nbsp;This is just a free API, I won't be rate limiting the usage of it. It will act similar to any website I put out there, but instead of HTML it is JSON.</li>
<li><strong>Free Trial&nbsp;</strong>- I am only going to offer a limited use, or time period for access a resource, giving just a taste test, but won't be in main pool of APIs available.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Not For Profit -&nbsp;</strong>This API is being subsidized somehow. Either there is direct investment from internal or external resources to subsidize or there is a grant involved.</li>
<li><strong>Educational Access -&nbsp;</strong>Is this API available as an educational resource, with special pricing for students and teachers? This will usually be reflected in the tier, and credit availability.</li>
<li><strong>Tier(s) -</strong>&nbsp;Which of these service tiers is an API available in, and which endpoint paths + verbs are accessible in the tier (api-pricing definition).      
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- General access, you usually don't even need a key. Only limited to specific APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Retail</strong>&nbsp;- This is the pay as you go level for public acess to all APIs. This is where the retail side of business operations will occur.</li>
<li><strong>Trusted</strong>&nbsp;- These are just a handful of trusted individuals or companies, who may have write access to some endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Education -&nbsp;</strong>Providing a specific access tier for education partners, including students, teachers, and institutions. Providing higher levels of free access, and lower price points.</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong>&nbsp;- These are partners I have prearranged agreements with, something I will be transparent about, showcasing them on partner page.</li>
<li><strong>Wholesale</strong>&nbsp;- The wholesale, often non-rate limited portion of my platform, where I deploy APIs in other people infrastructure, or our own for flat fees.</li>
<li><strong>Platform</strong>&nbsp;- This is all internal access by applications I build for my own usage. I still rate limit, and manage this access, I just give myself different privileges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Partner Program -</strong>&nbsp;A structured program allowing API consumers to achieve higher levels of access, with reduced pricing levels, flat rate access, and other benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Reseller Program -</strong>&nbsp;A structured programming for allowing API consumers to prove themselves, and share in revenues from API usage, affiliate links, and revenue share.</li>
</ul>
<p>My intent around access levels is to be as transparent as possible. Not all users will access at all levels, and not all APIs, and their endpoints will be available within at all access levels. The goal is to optimize access, remain as open as makes sense, while also sensibly monetizing resources to cover costs, and make a fair profit.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing &amp; Credits<br /></strong>I am employing a universal credit system that will be used by all APIs. The goal is to expand the unit of currencies I employ beyond just API calls, and attach a universal unit of value that can be applied across all APis. API consumers will be given a certain amount of API credits to be used each day, as well be able to buy and sell credits at various rates.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Value</strong>&nbsp;- Each API will have its own credit rate set, where some will be one credit, while others may be 100 credits to make a single call, it can be defined by API or a specific endpoint.</li>
<li><strong>Daily Limit -&nbsp;</strong>The daily allowed credit limit will be determined by the access level tier is registered at, starting with daily free public access to retail, trusted, and potentially custom tiers.</li>
<li><strong>Usage</strong>&nbsp;- How many credits does any one user use during a day, week, or month, across all APIs. When each API is used, it will apply the defined credit value for the single API call.</li>
<li><strong>Incentive</strong>&nbsp;- How can the platform give credits as an incentive for use, or even pay credits for writing to certain APIs, and enriching the system, or driving traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase -</strong>&nbsp;What does it cost to buy a credit, something that could fluctuate from day to day, week to week, or month to month.</li>
<li><strong>Buyout -&nbsp;</strong>Allow API consumers to get paid for the credits on their account, preferably all users are encouraged to spend credits, but buyout is an option.</li>
<li><strong>Discounts</strong>&nbsp;- Can we give discounts when you buy credits through specific channels, promotions, or other type of planned deal.</li>
<li><strong>Volume</strong>&nbsp;- Are there volume discounts for buying of credits, allowing consumers to purchase credits in bulk, when they need to and apply when they desire.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Applying</strong>&nbsp;- Can you wait to apply credits you have accumulated? Given the option with each billing cycle to apply, or you may want to wait and use at future date.</li>
</ul>
<p>I envision credits being the lifeblood of the API monetization strategy for my platform, and would love to see it spread beyond any single API ecosystem, and be something that all providers could put to work. The benefits of this would be seen by both API provider, as well as consumers, in helping us establish a currency for the API economy.</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Value Generation<br /></strong>What value is generated via API operations that isn't directly monetized, but driving value in other ways. These indirect value generators are often overlooked, and under-showcased areas of operation, often resulting in API failure--always showcase the buzz.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Vehicle -</strong>&nbsp;Having an API is cool these days, and some APIs are worth just having for the PR value, and extending the overall brand of the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Web or Mobile Traffic -</strong>&nbsp;The API exists solely for distributing links to web and mobile applications, driving traffic to specific properties - is this tracked as part of other analytics?</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness -</strong>&nbsp;Applying a brand strategy, and using the API to incentivize publishers to extend the reach of the brand and ultimately the platform - can we quantify this?</li>
<li><strong>Data &amp; Content Acquisition -</strong>&nbsp;Using the API, and the applications built on top as part of a larger data and content acquisition strategy--can we quantify this?</li>
</ul>
<p>I could see data and content acquisition grow into an area we can better quantify soon. Putting a base value on each resource in the system, and figure out how much each resource grows in size, and quality over time. Applying value to these indirect areas is something I'd like to expand upon in future iterations.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Revenue Generation<br /></strong>Ideally any platform should be sharing the revenue and value exhaust generated via the ecosystem, providing revenue opportunities for web, and mobile application developers. There are a handful of ways revenue can be shared via API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link Affiliate -&nbsp;</strong>What revenue is generated and paid out via links that are made available via the API, with potentially externally affiliate links embedded.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Share -</strong>&nbsp;What portion API revenue is paid out to potential re-sellers who drive API usage. Revenue is percentage of overall credit purchases / usage.</li>
<li><strong>Credits to Bill -&nbsp;</strong>All revenue is paid in credits on account, and user can decide to get buy out of credits at any time, or possibly use in other aspects of system operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be expanding on these areas in the future, as I play with ways to incentivize content or data creation, or just driving API consumption well into the paid tiers. Right now many API platforms I study are essentially sharecropping plantations, reaping the value generated from developer activity. In the future, developers should be incentivized with cash and credit to help achieve platform monetization goals, which is something I want to explore via my own API resources when I have the bandwidth.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Revenue Generation<br /></strong>Where are we making money? What revenue is generated across the platform, and then what are the breakdowns. I want to understand who my rockstar users and applications are, something that isn't isolated to external users. I am looking to craft all of my applications as individual citizens within the API ecosystem, measuring and limiting what type of access they have, and treat them like any other consumer on the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly</strong>&nbsp;- How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for a specific user, for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for a specific application,&nbsp;for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Tiers -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Which tiers generate most usage and revenue? I should be applying just as easily to aspects of platform / internal usage as well.</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate Revenue -</strong>&nbsp;What was generated from affiliate links made available via APIs, minus what percentage was paid out to API consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising Revenue -&nbsp;</strong>What advertising revenue was derived from web or mobile application traffic resulting from the API, minus whatever was paid out as rev share to API consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of my platform is not simply to make money. Sure I like making money, but I'm looking to flush out a reproducible framework for hanging each API, and making sense of it as part of my larger API platform operations. Not all APIs will be created equally, but I should be able to equally measure what it costs to develop, and operate, and apply consistent ways of generating revenue around its use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this looks intimidating when you scroll back through. However my goal is to produce a standardized pricing page that can exist across all of my API ecosystem(s), which are growing in number, and prompting me to think in this way. I need a better handle on my costs, and ultimately be able to generate more revenue to keep me with a roof over my head, food on the table, and my AWS bill paid.</p>

<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">While I only have a single API portal right now</a>, I'm preparing to deploy a specific collection using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and publish as version 2.0 of my API Evangelist developer portal. I'm also looking to immediately publish a few other API portals, designed to support various collections or stacks of APIs available in my network (images, API definitions, etc.). I need a standard way to deliver on-boarding, and pricing for the APIs, and this backend framework gives me the v1 approach to that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each API that I launch will have a pricing page, with each of the available service tiers as a box, and within each box it will list how many free credits you get each day, and other features available like per credit rate beyond the daily allowed limit, support elements, and other relevant details to that tier. There should also be links to more detail about partner, re-seller, and wholesale options for each API portal I launch. The API consumer never sees all of this. This framework is for me to hang each API upon, and think through it in context of the overall API lifecycle and platform operations.</p>
<p>I'm applying this outline to the 30 APIs I have in my stack, and then also applying it to a handful of new data APIs I'm working on. Along the way I will flush it out a little more, before I get to work on some of the more advanced pieces like a partner and re-seller programs. I'm not a big fan of advertising, but I do have some single page apps that perform pretty well, and it wouldn't be too intrusive to have some advertising on them. All of these SPAs are driven by my APIs, and they often exist as tools across my API driven content network as well.</p>
<p>This post will be published to my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization research</a>, and this list will be published as common building blocks, that can be considered as part of any API monetization strategy. It makes me happy to see this portion of my research finally move forward, and evolve, especially since its based upon my own platform goals, as well as my wider monitoring and review of the space.</p>

<p>I have had this discussion several times now, in the dark corners of bars in San Francisco, Paris, Berlin, and Barcelona. It is something I just want to make sure is published on my site, as part of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/05/expanding-on-my-api-monetization-strategy-and-research/">my latest expansion of my API monetization research</a>. I'm rolling out a standardized credit system as part of my API operations, and using my API service composition layer to apply credit usage as part of each API call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My objective is to make it easy as possible to buy and even sell credits via my platform, and easily apply those credits across any API I publish, in a variety of access tiers. As I think through this, I can't help but start thinking about how this can play out on a larger scale. Meaning, how do we get API providers to adopt a universal API credit system, so you could buy and sell credits anywhere, use them on any API platform, and transfer them between platforms.</p>
<p>Every time I think about this topic, I end up at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)">blockchain</a>. It just makes sense that we would use blockchain technology establish a currency that could be used as fuel for the API economy. The blockchain ledger could be used to manage API credit exchanges, but also could be used to store other relevant details that could impact API driven transactions in real-time. With the most important piece being about interoperability, and the fact that you can use in any API ecosystem.</p>
<p>An API world, where you could generate credits on one platform, and transfer them for buying of API calls on another platform, opens up some pretty interesting API driven scenarios for me. Not many platforms pay developers to use APIs, most are just free, or charging per API call. There isn't much incentive for API providers to shell out cash, to incentivize API consumers, but when you could pay in credits, that were transferable, it might change the dynamics.</p>
<p>Honestly, I am not very knowledgeable on the blockchain. It is something I've only recently started educating myself about it. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/05/expanding-on-my-api-monetization-strategy-and-research/">I'm also still mapping out my own API monetization strategy, and gathering my thoughts on an API credit system that is based upon my needs, but it is something that is also rooted in my monitoring of common API platforms</a>. I have a lot to learn about the blockchain, and have numerous details to work out as part of my larger API monetization strategy, but I wanted to at least put this out there, and make sure it is part of my API monetization conversations and storytelling in the future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-map-pricing.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>It has been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/history-of-apis--google-maps-api/">almost 10 years since Google launched the Maps API</a>. With as many APIs as Google have, you'd think they'd have a better handle on a standard approach to pricing across all of them. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/history-of-apis--google-maps-api/">As we've seen with Google Translate, they have struggled with the right way of pricing APIs, as well as communicating this to their developer ecosystem.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2015/09/introducing-more-flexible-option-to.html">This week Google took further steps on the road to standardizing how you pay for Google Maps API, opening up pay as you go purchasing via the Google Developer Console</a>. Here is how they put it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In this new purchasing structure, the Google Maps Geocoding, Directions, Distance Matrix, Roads, Geolocation, Elevation, and Time Zone APIs remain free of charge for the first 2,500 requests per day, and developers may now simply pay $0.50 USD per 1,000 additional requests up to 100,000 requests per API per day. Developers requiring over 100,000 requests per day should&nbsp;contact us&nbsp;to purchase a premium licence.</em></p>
<p>It is good to see Google run with some pretty standard pricing, and running with something in line with what other API providers are putting to work. Just like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/14/google-api-access-with-oauth-20/">Google worked to standardize OAuth 2.0 across the APIs</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">get their approach to API management organized via the developer console</a>, it looks like they are now working hard to get their API pricing in order.</p>
<p><span>I still see many API providers struggle with API pricing, both large and small. Many of the larger API providers do what Google did, and offer a free access level, and then once they need to generate revenue they shut things down, or tighten things up, rather than just offering a clear path to paying for resources. This approach has fueled the debate around whether you can depend on APIs, and also whether or not a freemium approach to APIs will work at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Another common stumbling block I see API providers trip over when it comes to pricing, is a disconnect between each level of access, meaning there is a freemium layer, and there are paid tiers of access, but there is no even steps between them, making it impossible for many developers to traverse. This generally makes a clear statement that it is ok to play with our API, but you really need to be the enterprise to actually do business with us.<br /></span></p>
<p>This is all something that can be mitigated with a clear, pay as you go, pay for what you use API model with a free tier of access, and sensibly tiered paid levels of access, as well as a robust, transparent partner program for higher levels of needs. There are plenty of models out there to follow when crafting your own <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a> strategy, so make sure you something in place from day one, even if you are tweaking along the way like Google has had to do.</p>

<p>If you have heard any of my talks at <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/api-docker">API Days Sydney</a>, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYR7A0r598c">Barcelona</a>, or at Gluecon in Colorado this year, you've heard me talk about wholesale APIs, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">how I am using Docker to help make some of my APIs available for use as private or white label APIs.</a> The concept of a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/a-peek-at-the-future-with-white-label-apis/">white label, private label, or wholesale API</a> is something I've been talking about for a while, and is something I am starting to see more of in the wild.</p>
<p>The most recent sighting is from payment API provider Dwolla, with <a href="http://blog.dwolla.com/simple-integrated-ach-payouts/">four new API endpoints that deliver a white label&nbsp;ACH payout API solution</a>. According to the announcement from Dwolla, the white label API solution will:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"..leverage Dwolla&rsquo;s existing infrastructure&mdash;our fraud analysis, bank partnerships, real-time fraud analysis, communication protocols and more&mdash;while maintaining your brand&rsquo;s look, feel, and name on end-user interactions. This functionality will provide platforms a powerful, flexible, and custom ACH infrastructure at a fraction of the cost and time."</em></p>
<p>When you use the Dwolla white label ACH payout API,<em> "there are no individual transaction fees or percentages&mdash;regardless of how many times you, your business, or your application transfers money". </em>Providing a pretty interesting alternative to the common, pay for what you use business model used by man API providers today.</p>
<p>I predict this approach to API deployment will become more common place in coming years. Many developers, and API consumers will be quite content just calling your regular retail API, but more specialty, and larger partners are going to want the functionality you offer, but are not going to want to be metered for each API transaction.</p>
<p>When I deploy wholesale, or white label versions of my APIs I will not be charging for each API call, however I will still be managing API access, and usage with my <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale API infrastructure</a>, because I still want to be able to get analytics, and other awareness generated via my API management layer. The cost of each wholesale API installation will depend on the scope of the instance, whether it is in our infrastructure, or yours, and how much ownership <a href="http://apiware.io">me and my APIware team</a> will have in API operations.</p>

<p>I'm always on the hunt for API driven solutions that will help the average business user be more exposed to the power of APIs. It is common for us technologists to kick up dust, and get all excited about what we build, when in reality, it doesn't mean anything to the average person in the real world--after 25 years in business, I still do this regularly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why, having a constant reminder to look for solutions that bridge the technical world of APIs, to the average business users world, helps me break free from my own biased approach. When I lean back in my chair, and think about what solutions are currently available in the space, that have this potential, these are the two companies.</p>
<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="200" align="center"><a href="https://www.blockspring.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/blockspring-logo.png" alt="" width="150" /></a></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both of these platform speak API, but more importantly they speak spreadsheet and forms, two of the most common dialects spoken by the average business user today. I'm closely working with both groups to better understand how they can communicate what they do to the business world, and repeatedly the examples in play are not focused on API, they are focused on solutions that make sense to the end user, but just happen to be API driven.</p>
<p>While much of the API design, deployment, management, and integration services and tooling that has evolved over the last five years will play a significant role in providing the API base we will need for the API economy, services like Blockspring and Form.io will bridge the critical last mile to the average user. These two companies are making APIs accessible via the most ubiquitous client out there, the spreadsheet, and helping average users understand what an API is, and what they do, through another ubiquitous interface, that almost everyone gets--the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wanted to take a moment to highlight the importance of these types of services and tools, among the wealth of other companies I am highlighting.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I setup individual research projects, is to provide me with a structure for better defining each aspect of the API world, something I am working hard to jump-start within my <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">API security research</a>. You will notice the project does not have any building blocks defined, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">which when you compare with one of my oldest research areas</a>, you start to see what I mean.</p>
<p>The blog posts, and other links I curate as part of my API security will help me find companies and tools that are providing value to the space. As I break down each company, and what they offer, I often have to read between the lines, in trying to understand how an API, service, or tool can be used by API providers, as well as potentially API consumers. I am looking for APIs that offer security, but also APIs that offer security to APIs--make sense?</p>
<p>As part of this research, I am playing with <a href="https://metacert.com/">Metacert</a>, which bills itself as &nbsp;a security API for mobile application developers, helping them block malicious ads, phishing links &amp; unwanted pornography inside apps, but I think it is so much more. I could see Metacert being pretty valuable to API providers, as well as API consumers building web and mobile apps. Security isn't always about brute force attacks, and could easily just be in a simple link, added with some content, via your API.</p>
<p>I am adding Metacert to my API security research, with a focus on its potential to API providers. I could see API providers seamlessly integrating <a href="https://metacert.com/api-documentation/getting-started/">the Metacert API</a> into their own stack, processing all links that are submitted through regular operations. I will also be adding link screening like this as a building block to my API security research.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a wise investment in the API security space, you should be talking with Metacert. APIs like Metacert provide us with a model for thinking about how we deliver API driven security services for web, mobile, and IoT applications, but it also provides a potential wholesale API layer that other APIs can use to better secure their own APIs. I consider it a strong blueprint, because its API driven, they have all the essential building blocks, which includes a monetization strategy, and they do one thing, and they do it well.</p>

<p>As I make my way across my research projects, I'm learning more about how <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/01/breaking-down-the-layers-of-api-security-and-considering-link-integrity/">companies like Metacert can deliver valuable security services to API providers</a>. I'm also getting a better idea of the nuance that goes into monitoring APIs, from <a href="http://apifortress.com/landing/">API Fortress</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apifortress.com/even-billion-dollar-brooklyn-companies-arent-perfect/">API Fortress has very interesting API monitoring story, derived from the Etsy API</a>. This isn't the API monitoring story you'd think, it isn't about the overall stability of the Etsy API, and whether its up or down, it is about the details of API payloads, and inconsistencies they found scanning the API.</p>
<p>Through a payload toast of the Etsy API, the API Fortress team found an occurrence of NULL values in 3,600 out of 50,100 items scanned--which negatively affected what results that were actually accessible via the API vs the Etsy interface. Something that can result in loss of exposure for products, translating into reduced sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While full API outages are definitely front and center when you think about monitoring, things like this could potentially drain revenue over a long period of time, in a way that makes it very difficult to discover. I can only imagine, when you are doing things at the scale Etsy is, this kind of monitoring could plug some pretty big holes in your sales bucket.</p>
<p><a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API Fortress is already part of my API monitoring research</a>, but just like with API security, I am going to add content analysis, and pattern matching like this as building blocks for API monitoring. After I make my way through all of the current companies I have listed in my API monitoring, I will publish the master list of common building blocks I've collected.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-nose-disguise.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am always pleased to see API providers publishing Swagger definitions, and using them to drive their interactive documentation. Projects like the&nbsp;<a href="http://data.globalchange.gov/">Global Change Information System API</a>, are getting on the API definition bandwagon, and this is a good thing. I have been pushing API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint since 2012, but in 2015, while I want to keep on-boarding folks to the concept of using API definitions for interactive documentation, but I also want them to also understand that their APIs definition will be used in other areas of API operations as well.</p>
<p>Most people think <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> is the documentation, and have not been able able to separate the specification from the interactive documentation. I think <a href="http://apiary.ioo">Apiary</a> has done a better job of this separation with the separation of <a href="http://apiblueprint.com">API Blueprint</a> from Apiary. As an API provider, you may not have evolved to a full API-first level of operation, which is ok, but I encourage you to make your Swagger or API Blueprint definition as accessible as possible, so your API consumers can put to use in other ways--even if you don't have the time.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw that the&nbsp;<a href="http://data.globalchange.gov/">Global Change Information System API</a>&nbsp;employed Swagger for their documentation, the next thing I wanted to do was also use in my <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman client</a>. While the Swagger UI provides me with a hands-on way of getting to know the GCIS API, I have to come back to the site to play with more, and it doesn't give me as much detail about how the API works, as my Postman client does. All GCIS API team has to do, is publish a text or image link to <a href="/admin/blog/view-source:http:/data.globalchange.gov/api_reference.json">their Swagger definition</a> in a prominent location, so it is obvious to us consumers.</p>
<p>I get easily reverse engineer the Swagger UI, using my Google Developer tools, but it is a couple of extra steps for me, that stands in between me, and making calls to the GCIS API in my local Postman Client. Interactive API documentation via Swagger and Apiary has significantly moved the API definition conversation forward, but <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/thinking-beyond-just-language-specific-clients-and-also-speaking-the-formats-popular-http-clients-are-using/">just like we should be thinking beyond just language specific clients, we also need to be enabling our API consumers to speak the formats popular HTTP clients like Postman speak</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">API security</a>, there are a number of things to consider, something I will be be working to define, and share as part of my ongoing research. However there are three building blocks that are front and center in most security conversations--SSL, API keys, and OAuth. SSL is a must-have, and OAuth is fast becoming a must-have when there is personal data involved, but I still encounter numerous misconceptions around the role API keys actually play in security.</p>
<p>API key, and its accompanying secret are a common way to secure API access. You require developers to register for an account, create a new application, and they are then given an application key, plus a secret that is passed along with each API call. You cannot call the API, without passing in your API key and secret. This act alone, is what people view as the security role API keys are playing, and I get a number of questions if this is truly secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No it is not. Looking for two values being passed with each API call, really doesn't do that much. The actual security of your platform requires a much higher level, IT view of security (which I won't go into here), with API keys being just one tool in your security toolbox. Where keys do play a huge role, is around the awarness that is introduced, of who is accessing what, and managing how much they can access (aka mitigating how much damage is done, when there is a breach).</p>
<p>This short sighted views of API keys is why many companies feel they can just roll their own API management solution, and why many API developers and architects think the keys themselves possess some magical security pixie dust. The actual power comes from your awarness of the resources you are exposing via APIs, organizing into coherent service tiers, applying meaningful rate limits on these resources, and evolving your detailed awareness of who is accessing your resources, how much they are using, and when.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An API key and its companion secret offer very litle security, but the awarness they bring when you have a modern API management layer in place, can bring huge security benefits to the table. Something that will not prevent every security breach, but with the right mechanisms in place you can be alerted of breaches in real-time, and dramatically limit the extent of their damage, when they do occur.</p>

<p>While there are numerous examples of APIs that successfully offer more than one option when it comes to the content types their API returns, the concept is missing from the large portion of the APIs I review. When I see good examples of this in the wild, I try to make time to showcase, and share, to help with the HTTP literacy of my readership.</p>
<p>One API which is rocking several fronts when it comes to API design for me, is the&nbsp;<a href="http://data.globalchange.gov/">Global Change Information System</a>, which interestingly is an alliance between government agencies, not something born out of Silicon Valley. When requesting resources from the GCIS API, the following HTTP accept headers are honored:</p>
<ul>
<li>application/json</li>
<li>application/x-turtle</li>
<li>text/turtle</li>
<li>application/n-triples</li>
<li>text/n3</li>
<li>text/rdf-n3</li>
<li>application/ld-json</li>
<li>application/rdf+xml</li>
<li>application/rdf+json</li>
</ul>
<p>When integrating with the GCIS API, it all begins with some&nbsp;basic JSON, but then look at all the other linked data goodness in there! JSON-LD, RDF, Turtle!! Discovering APIs that support robust content type negotiation like this can be hard to find, most APIs don't talk about it, so even if they do, there is no way to know about it. Thankfully the&nbsp;GCIS API shares it via email, as well as describes in the <a href="/admin/blog/view-source:http:/data.globalchange.gov/api_reference.json">GCIS Swagger definition</a>, which is how I learned about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content-Type negotiation is one of those HTTP literacy areas that need a lot of discussion, helping on-board API newbies to the power and possibilities that are present here, and that you can go beyond just plain ol JSON, and receive much richer API responses.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-business-api-response.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm immersing myself in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-and-open-data-for-banks">Data	Sharing	and	Open	Data	for	Banks</a>, published by&nbsp;the HM	Treasury	and	Cabinet	Office&nbsp;in the United Kingdom,&nbsp;"to explore how competition and consumer outcomes in UK banking could be affected by banks, giving customers the ability to share their transaction data with third parties using external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)."</p>
<p>While I do not think an open API standard will ride into town like a white knight, saving England from all its banking problems, I do think there is a lot of good that will come from this effort. The banks have a lot of technical debt, corruption, and many other issues to deal with before APIs will even work, but I think there is enough pressure on them right now from consumers, and startups, that they will have to change at some point--or die.</p>
<p>As I look for evidence of movement around an open API standard online, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413766/PU1793_Open_data_response.pdf">I came across the response to the government proposal back in March</a>. I thought there was a lot to learn from in these responses, not just for banks, but for any company that is struggling with a coherent API strategy. You can read the document yourself--here are the specific responses.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits and risks of an open API standard&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.1 The first set of questions in the call for evidence invited views on the benefits and risks of an&nbsp;open API standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.2 The vast majority of the respondents supported the development of an open API standard,&nbsp;and respondents agreed that there are many potential benefits of an open API standard in UK&nbsp;banking. The most commonly cited benefits were increased competition and innovation in&nbsp;banking, a greater degree of consumer choice in financial services, and the development of new&nbsp;and better services tailored to customers that can enhance the overall efficiency of banking. The&nbsp;government also repeatedly heard that an open API standard would result in customers feeling&nbsp;more empowered to engage with their banking or financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.3 However, many respondents also recognised that there are risks that could arise from an&nbsp;open API standard. One concern that was raised was the risk that an individual (to whom the&nbsp;data belongs) may not have meaningful control over the exchange of the data between third&nbsp;parties and financial institutions. Respondents from the technology industry and the banking&nbsp;industry cited risks around privacy of customers&rsquo; data and the potential for fraudulent use of&nbsp;data. In line with this, the need for appropriate security and vetting systems for third parties was&nbsp;regularly mentioned in the submissions received. In addition, responses received from the&nbsp;payments and banking industries explained that an open API standard should avoid &lsquo;locking in&rsquo;&nbsp;a set of standards which cannot be enhanced or restrict banks from their own innovations, and&nbsp;that it should be compatible with European legislation.&nbsp;<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Development of an open API standard&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.4 The next set of questions in the call for evidence considered the process for the development&nbsp;of an open API standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.5 The government asked what it could do to facilitate the development and adoption of an&nbsp;open API standard. The majority of respondents said that that the government has a key role to&nbsp;play in coordinating between the banking industry and the fintech community, and driving&nbsp;forward the design of the open API standard, particularly in relation to the development of the&nbsp;standards around data security and confidentiality. Respondents predominantly from the fintech&nbsp;community also explained that government has a role in helping to educate customers to&nbsp;understand the privacy and security issues surrounding an open API standard, and the steps that&nbsp;can be taken to mitigate those risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.6 The government questioned who should play a role in the development of an open API&nbsp;standard, who should be able to make use of it and how it should be used. The government&nbsp;received responses suggesting various different institutions could be involved in the&nbsp;development of an open API standard. These include banks and other financial institutions; the&nbsp;British Standards Institute and International Standards Organisation; the Financial Conduct&nbsp;Authority; the Bank of England; the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office; the British Bankers&rsquo;&nbsp;Association; the Payments Council; the European Banking Authority; data security experts;&nbsp;software developers; fintech businesses and the government. Submissions from the fintech and&nbsp;technology business said that the open API standard should be available to be used by everyone,&nbsp;subject to the appropriate vetting procedures, and not restricted to those who banks have existing relationships with or can afford to pay for access. The banks agreed that appropriate&nbsp;security vetting procedures should be developed.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.7 In response to the question on the cost of developing an open API standard, the&nbsp;government received a variety of estimates ranging from negligible costs to tens of millions of&nbsp;pounds. Several respondents from all industries explained that they were unsure of the cost of&nbsp;delivering an open API standard, or that it was difficult to predict how much it would cost,&nbsp;because much of the detail of the design of the open API standard remains to be agreed. Many&nbsp;respondents also highlighted that the costs were likely to vary greatly between institutions.&nbsp;Software and app developers, however, explained that costs may be lower than anticipated&nbsp;because some banks have already developed their own external APIs and so are not starting&nbsp;from a blank sheet of paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.8 The government asked questions on how long it would take to deliver an open API&nbsp;standard. While there was a degree of variation in the responses, broadly respondents were in&nbsp;agreement that 1 to 2 years was a reasonable timescale to develop and deliver an open API&nbsp;standard in UK banking, although more in depth responses explained that the timescale for&nbsp;delivery would be clearer once the design specification of the open API standard is more&nbsp;defined.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.9 The government also asked what issues would need to be considered in relation to data&nbsp;protection and security. Respondents highlighted that customers must at all times be in control&nbsp;of which third parties they grant access to their bank data and for how long, how that data can&nbsp;be used and the level of granularity of data that can be assessed. The banking industry and&nbsp;many technology firms said that third parties should be appropriately vetted before being able&nbsp;to access customer bank data, and a permissions list of authorisations and authentications&nbsp;should set out all approved third parties. One technology company added that the degree of&nbsp;access to customers&rsquo; bank data could be tiered according to the level of security standards met&nbsp;by the third party.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.10 The government invited views on the technical requirements an open API standard should&nbsp;meet and adhere to. Respondents put forward a number of recommendations, the most&nbsp;popular options involved such requirements as HTTP, JSON, XML, OAuth, REST5 and Cloud&nbsp;based architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also found the government responses to be equally valuable:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.1 It is clear from the vast majority of responses received during the call for evidence that the&nbsp;benefits of an open API standard are numerous and widely recognised. The key benefits that&nbsp;were identified by respondents were an increase in consumer choice, more competition in&nbsp;banking and an enhanced process, experience and outcome for consumers. Respondents&nbsp;strongly emphasised their support for the delivery of an open API standard in UK banking.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.2 While much of the detail of an open API standard is still to be agreed, it is evident that an&nbsp;open API standard can be designed in a way which meets requirements around data protection&nbsp;and security, and at reasonable cost. The majority of respondents also said that developing an&nbsp;open API standard to a timescale of 1 to 2 years would not be unreasonable.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.3 Respondents from the financial industry and the technology industry were aware of the risks&nbsp;that an open API standard could bring to consumers such as data privacy and the possibility of&nbsp;fraudulent use. It was made clear, however, that these risks are largely addressed through&nbsp;existing data protection laws, and can be mitigated through detailed planning and meticulous&nbsp;scoping of the open API standard design.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.4 Submissions to the call for evidence also made clear that the publication of more open data&nbsp;in banking can have benefits to customers and financial institutions, and help to boost&nbsp;competition. The government, however, notes that steps will need to be taken to ensure the&nbsp;appropriate degree of data security and protection to customers is maintained.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.5 The government is therefore committing to deliver an open API standard in UK banking, and&nbsp;will set out a detailed framework for the design of the open API standard by the end of 2015.&nbsp;The government will work closely with banks and financial technology firms to take the design&nbsp;work forward and, as part of those discussions, will also take forward ideas to introduce more&nbsp;open data in banking for the benefit of customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.6 Delivering an open API standard in UK banking will help to drive more competition in&nbsp;banking for the benefit of customers, and enable fintech firms to make use of bank data on&nbsp;behalf of customers in a variety of effective and creative ways. It will ensure that the UK remains&nbsp;a global hub and a world-leader for financial technology and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think 3.5 is the most important:&nbsp;<em><strong>The government is therefore committing to deliver an open API standard in UK banking, and&nbsp;will set out a detailed framework for the design of the open API standard by the end of 2015.</strong></em></p>
<p>Let's get to work. I'm setting up my monitoring to track on things as they roll out, and hopefully provide a blueprint that can be employed here in the U.S. I'd love to see similar work come out of our Department of Comerce, but I guess, as with other aspects of the open data and API movement here in the U.S., we will be following a UK lead.</p>

<p>Late in 2014, the HM	Treasury	and	Cabinet	Office&nbsp;in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-and-open-data-for-banks">published Data	Sharing	and	Open	Data	for	Banks</a>,&nbsp;"to explore how competition and consumer outcomes in UK banking could be affected by banks, giving customers the ability to share their transaction data with third parties using external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)."</p>
<p>Very similar to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Obama open data mandate in May of 2012</a>, &nbsp;I saw a lot of discussion shortly after the release of the document from the HM	Treasury, but not many details on how things are going so far. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413766/PU1793_Open_data_response.pdf">There was a response to the document published back in March</a>, which holds some interesting perspective, but not much else from the government, or banks, that I can find.</p>
<p>It is only August, I'm sure we'll see more activity this fall and into 2016, when it comes to standardizing banking APIs in the UK. I've tracked on efforts like the <a href="https://www.openbankproject.com/">Open Banking Project</a> for a while now, but I think what is potentially happening in the UK is worth me taking things up a notch or two. To help me, I will setup a banking research project, which will push up banking and related APIs in my daily and weekly monitoring, something I can review regularly, and maybe push back on some key players to get more information on where things are. Establishing an official research project really helps me find the key players, both individual and companies, which in turns increases the amount of information I gather as part of my research.</p>
<p>If you work for a bank that does business in the UK, or possibly for the government, I'd love to hear your thoughts, even if it is off the record. I'm hopeful for what can occur in the UK, but I'm also eyeballing the effort as a potential blueprint that the rest of the world could follow. I know the banking industry suffers from some crippling legacy technical debt, and are slowed by government regulations, but I'm pumped about the potential after reading through the Data Sharing and Open Data for Banks again--we will see a significant shift in the next five years, when it comes to how we manage our money.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/382273/141202_API_Report_FINAL.PDF"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/data-sharing-and-open-data-for-banks.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I enjoy what I do, but when I embarked on my API Evangelist journey in 2010, I set myself on a mission to educate people about the business of APIs, and highlight that it isn't just the technology that makes APIs a thing. I have worked hard to distill down what it takes to execute an effective API management strategy into usable advice that anyone can run with when crafting an API strategy.</p>
<p>As I conduct my monitoring of the API space, It makes me feel accomplished, when I find my work cited, influencing important API related projects. This just occurred to me as I was taking a fresh look at&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-and-open-data-for-banks">Data	Sharing	and	Open	Data	for	Banks</a>, published by&nbsp;the HM	Treasury	and	Cabinet	Office&nbsp;in the United Kingdom. As I was reviewing the document I happened to search for apievangelist (I know, I'm vain)--I was pleased to find a single citation to my work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Reference 152 -&nbsp;</strong>Thirdly, making the most	out	of	external	APIs	involves	providing	on-going	support	to	the	developers	and	third	party	organisations	that	make	use	of	them.	Good	API management	can	involve	providing	samples	of	code,	a	curated	support	forum,	a	sandpit	with	dummy	data,	an	up	to	date	blog,	FAQs	and	more.</p>
<p>It isn't much, but it is a nod to my work, that helps validate what I've been studying for the last five years--the business of APIs. For me, this isn't about recognition, its about knowing I'm making an impact, and I'm influencing policy, and helping companies, institutions, and government agencies understand API best practices. Little mission accomplished, I'm contributing a small piece to potentially improving the UK banking system, which is something that will undoubtedly spread beyond just England.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-monetization.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm almost to the point with <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">my API stack</a>, where I can start plugging in new APIs I have planned. Up until now, the APIs i have deployed, are of little use to a wider commercial audience. However some of the APIs I have planned for the next year, I'm looking to monetize their usage, and operate as part of a larger commercially viable API stack. (practice what I preach baby!)</p>
<p>To run this stack, I need a plug and play way to define what an API is costing me, and potentially how much revenue I am generating from each API. With this in mind, here is my draft look at an API monetization framework, that I am employing across my API Stack.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition</strong> (One Time or Recurring)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<strong> </strong> 
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover - </strong>What did I spent to find this. I may have had to buy someone dinner or beer to find, as well as time on the Internet searching.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate</strong> - What time to I have in actually getting access to something. Sometimes its time, and sometimes it costs me.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Licensing</strong> - There is a chance I would license a database from a company or institution, so I want to have this option in there. Even if this is open source, I want the license referenced.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong> - Also the chance I may buy a database from someone outright, or pay them to put the database together, resulting in one-time fee.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Development</strong> (One Time or Recurring)<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong> - What does it take me to cleanup, and normalize a dataset, or across content. This is usually he busy janitorial work necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong> - What does it take me to generate a Swagger and API Blueprint, something that isn't just auto-generated, but also has a hand polish to it.</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong> - How much work am I putting into setting up the database. A lot of this I can automate, but there is always a setup cost.</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - Defining the amount of work I put into setting up, and configuring the server to run a new API, including where it goes in my operations plan.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong> - How much work to I put into actually coding an API. I use the Slim PHP framework, and using automation scripts I can generate 75% of it usually.</li>
<li><strong>DNS</strong> - What was the overhead in me defining, and configuring the DNS for any API, setting up endpoint domain, as well as potentially a portal URL.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong><strong>Operation</strong></strong></strong> (Recurring)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> - What percentage of my AWS compute is dedicated to an API. Flat percentage of the server its one until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> - How much on disk storage am I using to operate an API? Could fluctuate from month to month, and exponentially increase for some.</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> - How much bandwidth in / out is an API using to get the job done.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong> - What percentage of API management resources is dedicated to the API. A flat percentage of API management overhead until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Evangelism</strong> - How much energy do I put into evangelizing any single API? Did I write a blog post, or am I'm buying Twitter or Google Ads? How is word getting out?</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - What percentage of the API monitoring, testing, and performance service budget is dedicated to this API. How large is surface area for monitoring?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Pricing </strong></strong></strong></strong>(Recurring)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tier(s) -</strong> Which of the 7 service tiers is an API available in, and which endpoint paths + verbs are accessible in the tier (api-pricing definition).</li>
<li><strong>Credit(s) -</strong> How many credits does an API use when any single endpoint is engaged, specified as entire endpoint or individual paths + verbs (api-credit definition).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong> 
</ul>
<p><strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Revenue </strong></strong></strong></strong>(Recurring)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly</strong> - How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for a specific user, for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- How much revenue is being brought in on a monthly basis for a specific application,&nbsp;for an API and all of its endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am looking for this framework to help me set pricing, and rate limits for any API I publish. My goal is to rapidly make available some valuable databases, and more functional APIs using common open source software, available for free, but also generate enough revenue from high volume users, to run the whole thing. To do this, I need to understand exactly what an API is costing, allowing me to set a price, with the intent of breaking even, and then generating some revenue where it makes sense.</p>
<p>As part of this work I will be generate an APIs.json type I am calling <a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com">api-pricing</a>, which I am looking to help be balance out consumption across my API stack. Using my <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale API infrastructure</a> I am able to easily add and subtract credits for API usage across users, and apps, then handle the billing based upon what pricing I have set for all my API usage.</p>
<p>My pricing will not just be about retail usage. Some of my APIs I will be deployed in other people's infrastructure, and letting them control the pricing, credits, and service composition. This is the wholesale layer to my strategy, allowing me to go beyond my own internal usage, by B2D usage, and open up new opportunities for API deployment and consumption.</p>
<p>As with most of my work, I'm going to be very transparent about my pricing, making sure it is indexed within each APIs.json file, and available alongside each APIs Swagger, API Blueprint, Postman Collection, and API Science monitor--encouraging wider consumption, and processing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-abstraction.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I walked around San Francisco with Jakub Nesetril (<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>, Wednesday evening, talking about the API space. Eventually we sat down in Union Square, continuing our conversation, which is something I wanted to further process, and blend with some existing thoughts I'm working through. Much of our conversation centered around the need for an open abstraction layer for API design, which would reduce the focus on Swagger vs. API Blueprint vs. WADL vs. RAML vs. any other API definition, and make it just about defining and designing our APIs.</p>
<p>Jakub is right, I'm sure he'd love everyone to use API Blueprint (which thousands are), but it is more important to him that people just use API definitions, and commit to a healthy API design strategy. This line of thinking is in alignment with other thoughts I'm having around there being a&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">common open source API design editor,</a>&nbsp;which I'd like to use as vehicle to get us closer to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">my vision of a perfect API design editor</a>.</p>
<p>I see an abstraction layer consisting of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Import</strong>&nbsp;- We need to be able to import ANY API definition format we desire.</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong>&nbsp;- We need to be able to export ANY API definition format we desire.</li>
<li><strong>Viewer</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;We a code view for ANY API definition format we want to look at while working.</li>
<li><strong>Editor</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;We a visual, GUI editor that is all about visual API design, WYSIWG editor for APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>The import, export, and viewer should work as an API, and the API editor should be a simple, well design JavaScript tool that can be embedded anywhere. The back-end API stack should be available in PHP,Python,Ruby, Node.js, Go, C#, and Java flavors, with a docker image anyone can deploy within their own infrastructure. This should be all about abstracting away the complexities of each individual format, and focus on delivering a simple, yet robust API design editing experience.</p>
<p>API definition format owners should be able to maintain importing, exporting, and viewing layers via some sort of plug-in architecture--meaning the platform is about API definition, the WSDL, WADL, Swagger, API Blueprint, RADL, RAML, Postman Collection, and other formats should be owned by each respective owner. The Open API Abstraction project could provide a single architecture for everyone to plug into, with an emphasis on building the best possible API design editing experience possible.</p>
<p>The Open API Abstraction tooling could be baked into any API service or tooling in the space, allowing the next generation API service providers to focus on what they do best, and not having to build out their own API design editor, while &nbsp;also baking in compatibility for all API definition formats by default. Such a layer would allow API architects and designers to craft APIs in a consistent way, no matter what API definition format designers and developers might be speaking, opening up a wider world for communicating and collaborating through the API design process.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-postman.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was given an introduction to the Microsoft Graph&nbsp;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/develop-office-graph">A concept being applied to Office 365 APIs</a>, other Microsoft APIs, and potentially beyond, to map out segments of users and every day objects. As I learn more about this unifying, graph API effort, I will write more, but this particular story is about how we communicate around the first steps taken by developers when integrating with any API. As an API provider, how you talk about integration, and craft your on-boarding resources, can significantly impact how developers view your resources, something that I think still will always need some work across the space.</p>
<p>After being introduced to the Microsoft Graph APIs, we were given a list of code resources, that we could use to hack against the API. The API integration overview had all the modern elements of API integration, with C#, Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, and other "coming soon" libraries. The resource toolkit, even had a sandbox account we could use, helping us on-board with less friction. While this approach is very progressive for the Microsoft world I've known, evolving us beyond the endless sea of C# focused WSDLs we all have seen historically, I would like to point what I think should be the next step in our evolution.</p>
<p>It makes me happy that we now speak in multiple programming languages, and provide sandbox or simulation environments. +1 What I'd like to see next, is that we also speak more HTTP, than just language specific clients. I'd like to see these types of API on-boarding toolkits start providing a Postman Collection for the API, or even better, a Swagger or API Blueprint definition that can allow me to not just on-board using the HTTP client of my choice, like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, <a href="https://luckymarmot.com/paw">PAW</a>, or <a href="http://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia REST</a>. I agree that we should be speaking the native language of the developers we are courting, but I like to nudge things forward, and encourage speaking a more generic language of HTTP, for those of us who program in many different languages.</p>
<p>Just like being multi-lingual with APIs has moved us out of our web service silos, I'm hopeful that if more developers speak HTTP, it will help move us into the future, where API developers are more HTTP literate, are are really leveraging the strengths of HTTP, or even better--HTTP/2 in their everyday worlds. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">I started including Postman collections, along with my Swagger definitions, for my APIs</a>.&nbsp;I'm also working to include API Blueprint, and other API definition formats, something that will allow potential API consumers to onboard using my language specific libraries, or the HTTP client of their choice.</p>

<p>I'm processing all of my thoughts from some travel to the big city of San Francisco. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/crafting-and-publishing-api-design-guide-shows-that-you-are-further-along-in-your-api-journey/">I was providing feedback on Microsoft's API design guide, as part of the&nbsp;OneAPI Technical Advisory Group</a>. As I was thinking about the journey Microsoft is on, the role of the API design guide, and <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html">how many other companies like Paypal, and Cisco, are on the same journey</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In parallel to this, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I am on my own journey with my own API stack</a>, I've been looking at everything from a slightly different perspective than many other analysts and providers in the space. When I started in 2010, it was all about API management, then after folks kept asking me about options for deploying APIs I expanded my monitoring to API deployment. Then Jakub the CEO of Apiary, moved the dial back ruth on the life-cycle, and got me paying attention to the concept of API design.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2015, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">I am paying attention to almost 20 separate areas, as part of my core API research</a>. I tune into a number of other areas, but these research projects make up the heart of my API storytelling. On the trip back from San Francisco today I had a few thoughts, and needed to organize them in context of my core research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry, I don't mean to be a downer. But...we are just getting started with stabilizing how we do APIs. I feel like we are beginning to formalize how we manage or APIs (thanks Mashery, 3Scale, and APIgee), and we are getting a handle on API deploy (thanks Restlet, Amazon), and we are deep into understanding how we define (thanks Swagger and API Blueprint), and ultimately design (thanks Apiary, Restlet, and Apigee).</p>
<p>We are moving fast into testing, monitoring, performance, and virtualization (thanks Runscope, APITools, API Science, and SmartBear), but our security sucks, embeddability has stagnated, and evangelism and discovery really isn't improving. I'm working on APIs.json, and bringing together the Swagger and API Blueprint communities, but there is so much work left when it comes to discovery, and automating each of the areas listed above.</p>
<p>There really is no point to this post. It is my mental vomit, after a trip to San Francisco, and working on Microsoft's API design guide. Stay tuned for how any of this applies to anything.</p>

<p>I spent all day Wednesday, at Microsoft offices in San Francisco, providing feedback on the Microsoft API design guide, as part of the&nbsp;OneAPI Technical Advisory Group. The OneAPI team had already done most of the hard work in hammering out the API design guide, by working with the API leadership from groups across Microsoft--we were just brought in to provide outside perspectives.</p>
<p>A group of about 20 of us, spent the entire day walk through the high levels of the Microsoft API Design philosophy. The Microsoft OneAPI design guide is a draft, so they aren't ready for us to share it publicly, something we'll see in the near future. However, document being ready or not, the process showed me that Microsoft is really working hard to get their API design strategy house in order. They had worked hard to iterate through all the common areas of API design, with their various teams--even some of the more controversial areas like versioning.</p>
<p>I did not feel like I had a lot to contribute to the process. They have some really good API designers, and there was plenty of high quality API design talent in the room, to provide the feedback they wanted. When Microsoft is ready for more of the management, evangelism, and other areas more in the business and politics of APIs, I will have much more to bring to the table. I did however, provide some insight that I think could help the overall process, and will continue to provide feedback--which is why I'm gathering my thoughts in this series of posts.</p>

<p>Prior to me participating in the&nbsp;OneAPI Technical Advisory Group, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html">I had just published the API design guides for Cisco and Paypal, as part of my API design research</a>. Bringing the number of API design guides to 9, which is a good sign the space is getting more serious about standardizing how we do API design. For me, there are two important things going on here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company Journey </strong>- The companies own API journey, allowing them to collaborate and craft a single API design philosophy, with the intent of making it a company-wide initiative.</li>
<li><strong>Publicly Sharing </strong>- Declaring to the public, this is how we design APIs. Something that allows others to learn from, and merge with their own API design philosophy--benefiting the entire space, while also establishing leaders and followers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crafting a document that defines how a company builds software is nothing new. However, APIs aren't just about building software, they are about defining your companies resources, and when you work to standardize how you define your resources as APIs, you are focusing on the core of your business. Next comes the value when building websites, web and mobile applications, and potentially devices as well. Getting your API design house in order, is all about standardizing how you speak API across your company, something that touches every product and service, and is the foundation for your corporate digital strategy.</p>
<p>My participation in the&nbsp;OneAPI Technical Advisory Group gave me a unique glimpse at the API strategy unfolding at Microsoft. While there is still a lot of work to be done, the fact that they are working on a central API design strategy demonstrates to me they are further along in their API journey than I thought they were. Where are you in your own API journey? Does your organization have an API design guide? How do you share this knowledge across your organization, and with the public?</p>
<p>As I monitor the API space, I am always looking for the signals of a healthy API strategy, and I think, when I see a formal API design guide present for any company that I track on, I am going to tack on a couple extra points. A polished, publicly shared API design guide shows organizations are a further along in their overall API journey, than other companies in the space, who are still trying to figure things out.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/warewolf-esb-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Making sure APIs that are available via the enterprise service bus, affectionately known as an ESB, more discoverable, accessible, and consumable via the open Internet, is one of the many challenges organizations will face along their API journey. Striking a balance between internal APIs, and public APIs, even if they aren&rsquo;t open to the wider public, and only partners, is proving to be a big challenge for many enterprise groups I am engaged in conversations with.</p>
<p>When Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I developed <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, an open API discovery format, we were focused on bringing solutions to the table that were focused on API discovery on the open Internet. We knew that the format could also assist in more controlled environments, like within the enterprise, but wanted to focus on the wider discussion first. Our primary focus is making indexing the current landscape of publicly available APIs, using APIs.json, so that we can make available via <a href="http://apis.io">our open source search engine APis.io.</a></p>
<p>We have been working with other <a href="http://wso2.com">API service providers like WSO2 to integrate into their enterprise offerings</a>, but pretty much leaving the enterprise landscape to craft its own APIs.json driven solutions. <a href="http://warewolf.io/ESB-blog/swagger-apisjson-support/">So it pleases me to see that Werewolf ESB has integrated not just Swagger into their open source ESB solution, but also APIs.json.</a> Any service you expose through the Warewolf ESB security layer, will automatically be published in an APIs.json file--additionally these services will also have a Swagger file generated, providing you a machine readable definition for the surface area of each exposed API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warewofl ESB's usage of APIs.json is exactly what we had envisioned when it comes to providing API discover solutions, for APIs that originate within the enterprise. In this scenarios, APIs.json is acting as a portable, machine readable, JSON definition of what APIs can be found via an company, or organization's ESB. The availablity of Swagger makes these services consumable, as soon as they are discovered via the APIs.json index--showing what is possible when you combine APIs.json with Swagger.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with exactly how Warewolf ESB manages the security layer for APIs on the bus, but I'd like to learn more, so I can help organizations craft not just single APIs.json indexes, but develop meaningful collections, and begin to broker the resources they are making available via any ESB on their network, in more intelligent ways. The Warewolf release has jump started me brainstorming more around the possibilities for API discovery when it comes to the enterprise, using APIs.json--thanks Warewolf, very nice work!</p>

<p><a>I am slowly making my way through defining of&nbsp;</a><a href="http://theapistack.com/">the APIs available in the API Stack</a>, beginning with <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">the APIs that I depend on to operate API Evangelist</a>. The best way to understand any API in my opinion, is to create a <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger definition</a> for it, as well as an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json file</a>, indexing the overall API operations. Since my mission is all about understanding APIs, this is something I try to do on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Creating an APIs.json file allows me to index each APIs operations from registration and documentation, to pricing and terms of service. Then I work to break down every possible unit of value represented by an API's endpoints, reducing it down to the minimum viable element possible--something that Swagger allows me to do nicely.</p>
<p>Here is what I ended up with for AngelList so far:</p>

<p>I depend on AngelList API to provide a vital lens for monitoring the companies I track on, who are doing interesting things with APIs. AngelList also provides me with an important discovery tool, that helps me find new people, and companies that are pushing the API conversation forward, as well as monitoring the existing players.</p>
<p>I have had an APIs.json file for the AngelList API for some time, but I only had a single, pretty useless Swagger definition. Now I have 16 separate resources, with each endpoint, verb, parameter, underlying data and security models defined. The process helped me better understand how I already use the search, and startups endpoints, but also opened up my eyes to the jobs, press, user, and tag APIs--which I am now working into my regular API monitoring workflow.</p>
<p>This process isn't just about creating complete profiles I can include in <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>, and <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. It is about me better understanding the resources I already depend on, pushing me to better take advantage of them, ultimately improving upon my own API stack, as well as my operational efficiency using APIs.</p>

<p>I have been pulled into the conversation around the API for our National Park system information several times now. In October of 2014&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/16/i-need-help-to-make-sure-the-dept-of-agriculture-leads-with-apis-in-their-parks-and-recreation-rfp/">I asked for Help To Make Sure The Dept. of Agriculture Leads With APIs In Their Parks and Recreation RFP</a>, something <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/the-next-steps-for-the-the-recreation-information-database-ridb-api/">I saw some&nbsp;Next Steps For The The Recreation Information Database (RIDB) API</a> this January.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Topic:</strong><span> &nbsp;Addendum to Recreation One Stop Support Services Contract RFP for a Recreation Information Database API download cost recovery mechanism for high frequency, high-volume requests</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Issue:</strong><span> &nbsp;Questions and comments from prospective contractors for the R1S support services contract included significant concern about the costs associated with supporting a completely open API. &nbsp;There is an incremental cost for each instance that a third party &lsquo;calls&rsquo; the API. &nbsp;In private industry, the volume of calls is often managed by provisioning access to the API by requiring registration and agreeing to the volume of calls in advance. &nbsp;For third parties wishing to create an interface that will call the API frequently, private industry typically implements a tiered pricing approach where costs rise as volume increases. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In response to these concerns and to provide a mechanism for cost recovery for high frequency, high-volume requests, the R1S Program Management Team offered this solution by posting this statement to questions on FedBizOpps (FBO.gov). </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>Additionally, automated access to recreation data shall be free of charge for users making nominal data requests. The contractor may propose a fee structure applicable only to high volume data consumers. Such a fee structure shall be enforced through an agreement directly between the Contractor and the data consumer and shall be consistent with industry best practices and established market pricing. Should the contractor opt to propose such a fee structure, their proposal shall clearly state the applicable rates and details of the proposed fee structure.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A member of the open-data community quickly reacted to this provision indicating that it no longer meets the intent of the President&rsquo;s Open Government executive order. &nbsp;It is possible that media coverage will daylight dissatisfaction over this provision.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It is important to note that it shall be the R1S contractor&rsquo;s responsibility to manage and control access to the API so that excessive calls from outside entities do not put unreasonable stress on the system that may be cause performance issues or be malicious in nature. &nbsp;To accomplish this, the R1S contractor will need to provide sufficient server capability and staff to manage and support the API and the consumers using it. &nbsp;The costs for the basic service are contained in the fee-per-transaction model, which will support free access to the API for all users, with a cost-recovery mechanism in place for high-use consumers. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To clarify the intent of the government, the RFP will be amended to state:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>The Government recognizes that high frequency, high-volume data requests may have a detrimental effect on the performance and security of R1S Reservation Services system and that the management and mitigation of such negative consequences drives costs to the contractor.&nbsp; Accordingly, automated access to recreation data shall be free of charge for users making nominal data requests, however, the contractor may propose a fee structure, or establish access limitations, applicable only to higher volume data consumers. &nbsp;Any proposed fee structure shall comply with OMB Circular A-130; Section 8 &ndash; Policy, which states, &ldquo;Agencies will &hellip; Set user charges for information dissemination products at a level sufficient to recover the cost of dissemination but no higher.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Summary/Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The RIDB API is now open and available to anyone to download free of charge.</li>
<li>Federal recreation data is and shall continue to be available in machine-readable formats and shall safeguard privacy, confidentiality, and security in compliance with the Open Data Executive Order.</li>
<li>The follow-on contract for R1S requires that in addition to more static recreation and inventory data, real-time availability data shall also be made available through an API.</li>
<li>The audiences we anticipate using the API is widely varied and includes those who may want to incorporate federal recreation data into tourism portals and travel planning applications. &nbsp;Others however include those who wish to produce new interfaces to the real-time availability data that could generate a very high volume of calls to the API.</li>
<li>We will continue to offer completely free access to the RIDB API for routine and reasonable requests in support of the President&rsquo;s Open Government Executive Order.</li>
<li>R1S is allowing offerors for the follow-on contract to propose a cost-recovery fee structure for high-volume data customers that exceed reasonable access in accordance with OMB Circular A-130; Section 8. &nbsp;These proposals will be considered as a provision within the new contract expected to be awarded in 2017.</li>
<li>The Recreation.gov API(s) will be funded entirely by recreation fee revenue generated through reservation transactions made by the general public. &nbsp;By following private industry standards, R1S will be able to continue to provide free and open access to nominal users of the API without passing on higher costs associated with high volume use to the general reservation making public. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background:&nbsp;</strong>Charging fees for access to government APIs is a relatively new concept, however open-data evangelists and private industry all agree that there is a time and place for creating a reasonable tiered pricing structure which supports free open data and provides a framework for managing increased costs associated with higher end use.</p>

</ul>
<p>That concludes the briefing paper, but after I shared my thoughts with them, I received an update of what the language has evolved to, resulting in the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Government seeks to encourage usage of the Recreation.gov API, especially for third parties that could use the API to initiate additional reservations. At the same time, the Government recognizes that it is difficult to predict the likely query volume on Recreation.gov&rsquo;s APIs, and that very high-frequency API requests from third parties that do not result in reservations on the system could have a detrimental effect on the performance or cost of the system, without providing associated benefits to the contractor or the Government.</em><br /><br /><em>Accordingly, the contractor may propose an API management plan that protects against extremely high-frequency usage of the API from third-parties that are not driving reservations to the system, while also encouraging widespread usage from third parties that are making a reasonable number and frequency of requests, and provides a mechanism for supporting and encouraging heavy API usage from third parties who demonstrate value and success in driving reservations on the R1S reservation system. Such plans may include establishing guidelines for third party interaction with the API (i.e., recommended best practices for caching API responses, implementing conditional requests, and defining &ldquo;abusive&rdquo; API usage that may be restricted), requiring users to register to receive a token or key to access the API and using techniques such as rate-limiting the number of API requests allowed from a given third party over a given period of time (i.e., XXXX requests per hour), or introducing &ldquo;tiers&rdquo; of access that limit high-frequency, high-volume API usage to those third parties who are successfully driving reservations on the system or are willing to pay a nominal fee that covers the incremental costs of serving non-reservation-generating high-frequency requests.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>This is the first precedent I have seen, of a modern API driven monetization strategy in the federal government. There are many examples of private companies charging for access to federal government data, but this is the first example of applying modern API business models on top of government APIs and open data.</p>
<p>To me, this conversation also goes well beyond just charging for high volume access to government APIs, to cover the cost of delivering API driven resources reliably. It also introduces the concept of service composition into government APIs. We've had government APIs keyed up with <a href="http://apiumbrella.io/">API Umbrella</a> for some time now, an open source approach that is modeled after modern, commercial API management offerings. What the RIDB API approach does, is open up the ability to introduce different levels of access tiers, rate limit, and charge for commercial levels of usage around vital government resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When government follows the business model applied across the API sector, it will allow for the free, lower levels of access, while also charging for higher levels of access, that will keep critical APIs operating at scale, in a dependable way. I'm also hoping it opens up other approaches to service composition, like allowing developers to write and contribute to the evolution of government data. I'm just hoping the possibility of covering the cost of API operations, is enough of an incentive for government agencies, and the vendors that serve them, to explore other approaches to API service composition.</p>
<p>The trick in all of this will be teaching the agencies and vendors, about the transparency required to make all of this work. Agencies, and their vendors, will have to make sure and share the algorithm they use to establish service tiers, rate limits, and pricing levels. They will also have to be transparent about which API consumers / partners exist in which tiers, to eliminate speculation around favoritism. This transparency will be critical to all of this working smoothly, otherwise the whole approach will suffer from similar illnesses that existing government procurement practice suffer from. <em>APIs != Good by Default</em></p>
<p>The RIDB API approach, which allows vendors to add API service levels, rate limits, and a pricing layer, sets a precedent for generating much needed revenue that can cover the costs of API operations. While this may seem like a footnote on a single government RFP,&nbsp; as I mentioned in earlier posts on this subject, it represents how we will manage commercial usage of our virtual government resources in the future, in the same way we've done for our physical government resources for many years now.</p>

<p><em>This is a deep dive from one of my loyal readers, who doesn't just listen to what I write, he is pushing my own research in new directions, and reporting back to me. You have read his work before in&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/06/api-police-report-raw-thoughts-from-onboarding-with-your-api/">API Police Report: Raw Thoughts From On-Boarding With Your API</a>, and this time Bob Salita is building on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/21/parsing-charles-proxy-exports-to-generate-swagger-definitions-while-also-linking-them-to-each-path/">my own proxy work with Charles Proxy</a>. Guest posts isn't something I do on API Evangelist, but when you are pushing the conversation forward like Bob does, I can't help but share.</em></p>
<p>I'm a  multi-platform, multi-device developer. I wanted an easy way to inspect  HTTP(S) API traffic (requests, responses) from one of my many  development devices. Inspection can be achieved by using (reverse) proxy  software such as <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a>, <a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a>, <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">squid</a>, or <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a>. The usual  method is to make proxy changes to a device so traffic is forced to a  system running a reverse proxy. This process is inconvenient and error  prone in multi-device environments. For every device, one has to  discover how to make a proxy change, then manually effect the change,  and then manually reverse the change when inspection is done. I found  the process annoying and error-prone. There had to be a better way.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that  the ideal setup would be a router where the WAN's gateway was a system  running a transparent proxy. Thus simply by connecting the device to the  router, the transparent proxy software would capture HTTP and HTTPS  traffic. After weeks of research, testing of many configurations and  software, I am pleased to document a working configuration.</p>
<p>The first step is to install <a id="yui_3_16_0_1_1440232677015_9987" href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a>&nbsp;(Linux, OS/X), or&nbsp;<a id="yui_3_16_0_1_1440232677015_9541" href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmdump</a> (Linux, OS/X, Windows) on a system. I've tested mitm software on OS/X  and Windows only. The same software is known to run on Linux, I  personally haven't tested there yet. OS/X proved to be a better platform  than Windows because it can run the&nbsp;console UI program called  mitmproxy, whereas Windows users have to settle for the simplistic  screen scrolling text program called mitmdump. There actually is another  option, called mitmweb, but it's beta.&nbsp;mitmweb a fascinating variation  of proxy UI, I highly recommend giving it a try. It may become a killer  proxy UI.</p>
<p>The second step is to  configure a dedicated router, call it "PROXY", that gatways traffic to  the transparent proxy created in step 1. PROXY router eliminates the  need for the annoying proxy changes&nbsp;for every device. You simply connect  the device to PROXY and your traffic instantly becomes inspected. I  used a super cheap router (TP-Link WR841N $20), loaded dd-wrt, but I  think any router will probably work. Configure the router's WAN gateway  to point to the transparent proxy system (e.g. 192.168.1.27). You may  need to explicitly configure the WAN's DNS servers too, if so, I used  Google's DNS servers at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Configure the LAN to be  some private IP, I used 192.168.3.1. When you connect a device, the  router will assign a private IP address (e.g. 192.168.3.50).</p>
<p>You're now done. Connect  any of your devices to PROXY router and the HTTP(S) traffic will appear  in mitm software on the transparent proxy (gateway'ed) system. When  finished inspecting, reconnect to your everyday router. No device  fiddling ever needed.</p>
<p>Although the above steps  are simple, it took considerable time to investigate all the  alternative configurations. In the end, I found no other working  software option, only mitm transparent proxy worked. Charles and Fiddler  are lacking a working transparent proxy feature. squid transparent  proxy likely works on Linux but I didn't test it. It's unfortunate that  Charles and Fiddler proxy software didn't work as a transparent proxy. I  âmuch prefer Fiddler over mitmproxy because of Fiddler's superior UI  and my personal preference for C# and .Net.</p>
<p><em>I am sharing Bob's instructions, so that you all can play with as well. I have an API setup to process any Charles Proxy file, and generate Swagger definitions from them, something I'd like to see occur from this implementation as well. Understanding how the web and mobile applications we depend on are using APIs, is becoming increasingly important. Thanks for your work Bob!</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-three.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While we wait for the next steps of the long drawn out Oracle v Google Java API copyright battle, I wanted to take some time and talk about what we can all be doing to actually make a difference. If you aren't familiar with the legal case,&nbsp;is a legal dispute related to Oracle's copyright and patent claims on Google's Android operating system. The court case started in California courts in 2012, with the rmost recent verdict coming in&nbsp;May, 2014, where the&nbsp;<a title="United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit" target="_blank">Federal Circuit</a>&nbsp;partially reversed the district court ruling, ruling in Oracle's favor on the copyright-ability issue, and&nbsp;<a title="Remand (court procedure)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remand_(court_procedure)" target="_blank">remanding</a>&nbsp;the issue of fair use to the district court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we wait for appeals, endure the continued discussion, and read the trickle of FUD that comes out from the tech press, what can the tech community actually do to make a difference? First, we can reduce our anxiety about this being hellfire and brimstone for the current web API movement. The Oracle v Google legal battle is &nbsp;focused on Java APIs, which are a different beast than a web API, and it would take another legal case to actually set a precedent that copyright applies to web APIs--when this happens, I will be showing up with my Internet of Things enabled pitchfork, and torch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to actually making a difference, you can openly license and share your existing API designs. If you think copyright applies to APIs, publish them&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">CC0</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">other Creative Commons license</a>--something you can link to using&nbsp;<a href="http://apicommons.org/" target="_blank">API Commons</a>. If you do not think copyright applies to APIs, apply whichever licensing stance you feel is relevant. The important part is that we share how our APIs licensed, accompanied with machine readable API definitions that can act as a representation of what is covered by a license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your web API definitions are the recipes for your digital resources, and machine readable API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint are how we describe our recipes in a machine readable way. This isn't your secret sauce--how you execute on this recipe is your secret sauce. The name, and ordering of your recipe is how you communicate on the menu that is your developer portal, where you will be cook'n up an assortment of API driven dishes. How you operate your business, and deliver on your recipes is what you should be protecting, not the way you define, and communicate what you do as an API driven business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Openly sharing the definitions of our APIs, that we operate on the Internet, is a meaningful action we can take in response to the Oracle v Java copyright case, but an action that goes so much further in helping also make the API space better. Sharing machine readable definitions of the recipes that are our APIs, using formats like&nbsp;<a href="http://swagger.io/" target="_blank">Swagger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://apiblueprint.org/" target="_blank">API Blueprint</a>, embracing media types like&nbsp;<a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/" target="_blank">Collection+JSON</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren" target="_blank">Siren</a>, using common data formats like&nbsp;<a href="http://jsonapi.org/" target="_blank">JSON API</a>, and wrapping it all up as an&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org/" target="_blank">APIs.json collection</a>, will help us evolve beyond the bespoke API space we currently have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copyright is lower down on the list of obstacles we face in the API economy. There are numerous interoperability, reusability, and scalability issues that are much bigger threats than a far off Java API copyright battle. We can take all of these challenges head on by using existing API definition formats, media types, and data models when designing, deploying, and managing our APIs. If we do this, any future API copyright battle will never even take root, in a world where open formats, source, and API patterns will rule.</p>
<p>Please work with me to contribute to this world, rather than giving fuel to one possible dystopian world suggested by Oracle.</p>

<p><em>This is one of several stories I am evolving as part of series I'm calling API fairy tales. With these tales I want to educate business leaders, technologists, and government about the importance of Application Programming Interfaces (API), and how they are being applied in almost every aspect of business occurring online today--providing simple examples that mainstream users can learn from, as well as retell in their circles.</em></p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">Just two months after launching there new messaging startup in 2006, Twitter introduced the Twitter API to the world. Twitter's API release was in response to the growing usage of Twitter by those scraping the site or creating rogue APIs, so Twitter exposed the Twitter API, returning machine readable JSON and XML that developers could put to use, building things beyond what Twitter could build.</p>
<p>In just four short years Twitter&rsquo;s API had become the center of countless desktop clients, mobile applications, web apps, and businesses -- even by Twitter itself, in its own mobile apps, and for its public website. The majority of what you know as Twitter today, came the API ecosystem. If Twitter is the nervous system of the world, the Twitter API is the nervous system of Twitter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In my opinion, Twitter is one of the most influential APIs operating today, showing what is possible when a dead simple platform does one thing well, then opens up access via an API and lets an open API ecosystem of almost a million 3rd party developers, build out the rest of the platform--establishing an external R&amp;D environment for the fast growing communication platform.</p>
<p>In addition to importance, Twitter is also one of the most complex APIs platforms in operation today showing us the difficulty in running large developer ecosystems, where you have a million developers building whatever they want, around your valuable companies assets. Sometimes this is a blessing, and sometimes this is a curse, and Twitter does pretty well at striking a balance between the two &mdash; acknowledging that APIs are more than just tech, they are also about business, and have a huge social and political aspect as well.</p>
<p>Not everyone loves Twitter, but you can&rsquo;t argue that it has made a huge impact on how we conduct global business, and even how the government and our larger society operates. When you look at the success Twitter has achieved, I can&rsquo;t help but see API driven success, allowing a simple startup to spread around the globe, using APIs to connect people, places, and conversations&mdash;becoming the nervous system for the coming API economy, which will always have that human, social layer that Twitter reflects so well.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/research-funding-using-apis.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am spending an increasing amount of time thinking about how you monetize data, content, and other digital resources via APIs. A couple of very compelling layers to all of this work, is pushing forward <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/07/a-better-understanding-of-government-apis-and-their-consumers-before-considering-charging-for-use/">my thoughts on how and when government should charge for access to public data</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/11/hdscores-one-potential-api-driven-business-model-aggregating-public-data/">the how and when private sector companies should charge for access to public data</a>--lots to think about here.</p>
<p>Another layer to this conversation that was introduced this week, centers around how we can keep data and content generated via publicly funded research, at publicly funded institutions, available, accessible, and moving forward, by applying the technology and business of the modern web API. I was contacted this week by a group at <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>, that is proposing a research to database hyperlinking project, which would provide one-click access from published biomedical research papers to authoritative biological databases such as WormBase (WB;&nbsp;<a href="http://wormbase.org">wormbase.org</a>), Flybase (FB;&nbsp;<a href="http://flybase.org">flybase.org</a>), the Saccharomyces Genome, and Database (SGD;&nbsp;<a href="http://yeastgenome.org">yeastgenome.org</a>).</p>
<p>The primary objective of the project is to make information around scientific research, and the resources you need to accomplish the research, more accessible at the time of research--not after the fact. The secondary objective is to identify monetization opportunities within the industry for the data, and apply modern API methodologies, to take advantage of these opportunities. In short, we are looking to build a viable business model on top of this highly valuable scientific data, to help keep these databases accessible, evolving, and living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/02/01/should-the-government-subsidize-and-profit-from-data-markets/">the API monetization discussions I've had in the past around generating revenue around public data</a>, come into play, but this time it is with publicly funded scientific research. It takes money to keep these databases up and running. It takes money to design, deploy, and manage APIs, and operate the API ecosystem that will arise around these databases. Where is the ethical line between providing access to this important data, and generating enough revenue to keep the important work alive?</p>
<p>I am most definitely biased, but this is where APIs really begin to shine for me. It isn't just that we have the technology to open up access to these databases, in a simple way that can be used in websites, web applications, browser add-ons, and mobile apps. We also have the ability to meter access, giving free access to those who need it, while charging for access from those who can afford it, in order to fund operations. The third aspect of a modern approach to APIs that makes this possible, is the transparency. We can strike this operational balance around monetizing this public data, in a transparent way, so ethical concerns can be minimized.</p>
<p>This represents the technology, business, and politics of APIs that you here me ranting about on a regular basis. I am not saying this formula will work for all scientific research, but I think if we can strike the right balance, we can uncover another revenue stream to keep important scientific research moving forward. I am just beginning these conversations, and in my own style, I'm working through my thoughts here on the blog. I would love to hear your thoughts, if you have any opinions in these areas.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more as this project evolves...</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-speak-api-definitions.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I play with a lot of services that target the API space each week, during my regular monitoring of the space. These are services from all along the API lifecycle that service this space, from design to integration, that target both API provider and API consumer. After I on-board with a service, there is one trend I see emerging that really puts service providers into two distinct buckets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The API focused services that stand out the most, are the ones that employ common API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>. After I've on-boarded with a service, if I can upload a machine readable definition of one or many of my own own, or public APIs I depend on, the quicker I will see a service in action--well on my way to understanding the value generated by a service provider, and becoming a customer.</p>
<p>Examples of this in the wild are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apimatic.io/">SDKs with APIMATIC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.apiscience.com/">Monitors with API Science</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Tests with Runscope</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Client with Postman</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gelato.io/">Documenetation with Gelato</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As a service provider, focusing on the API space, if you do not speak Swagger, Postman Collection, or API Blueprint, the chances API providers (or consumers) will be on-boarding and using your service, goes significantly down. This works just like APIs themselves, in that you have to reduce any friction possible when on-boarding. If I can signup using my Github account, and fire up the service with a Swagger, or even better a collection of Swagger APIs using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, the chances I'll be a customer increase dramatically.</p>
<p>I am adding flags for the common API definition formats, to the system that I use to track on API service providers, and will be highlighting those that speak these formats. After that, I will find a way to showcase which formats these providers support, bringing front and center across my research, and storytelling.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://apimatic.io/pricing"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/APIMATIC-Pricing.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the areas I focus on in the API space, is the business of APIs, and how companies actually make the rubber meet the road when it comes to pricing the API resources they are serving up, as well as the price that API service providers offer up to their customers. After security, monetization is the top question I get from the folks i am talking to about their API strategy.</p>
<p><a href="https://apimatic.io/pricing">I've been watching the SDK service provider APIMATIC move from a company in beta, to announcing pricing for the valuable API service this last week</a>. I love watching any company break up their valuable resources and services, but feel APIMATICs pricing announcement is interesting enough to warrant a story, because it provides other API service providers with one possible blueprint they can use.</p>
<p>APIMATIC is somewhat unique, because they generate SDKs for your APIs, but the way they define their service and broke it up into units of measure valuable, can be universally applied. APIMATIC distilled their service down to a basic unit of value--line of code, or LOC:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>LOC stands for lines of code. KLOC is a short form for 1000 (1K) lines of code. We use KLOC to estimate the size of an API and charge accordingly. An average API would consume about 1 KLOC.</em></p>
<p><span>You get different amounts of KLOC, depending on what tier you are in, with a free, professional, and commercial levels of access, as well as a pay as you go option at each level. Even though APIMATIC are an API service provider, who provides services to API providers, APIMATIC's pricing reflects an API way of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span>The lessons here for other API service providers is not necessarily about a KLOC, but about the process of distilling down your service to its smallest possible unit of value. Then you attach a freemium doorway to the front, break down into reasonable priced, evenly scaled service tiers, with a pay as you go option along the way. The cherry on top, is provide spending calculator--which APIMATIC rocked.</span></p>
<p><span>This provides us with a model that other API service providers should be looking at. You can apply this thinking to multiple service area, and aren't limited to a single unit of value like KLOC, you can have an ala carte buffet of services, with different pricing levels, depending on where you are at in the service tiers. Think of it as a monetization framework for API service providers that also reflects how APIs are priced.</span></p>
<p><span>While the services you are offering to the space may be different than APIMATIC, the model is something you should think about as you craft your monetization strategy. I see many companies fail because they don't offer the freemium portion, don't have evenly spaced service tiers, or haven't actually distilled their service down into a meaningful unit of value. Hopefully the APIMATIC story can help you avoid stumbling blocks in your own monetization journey--which is what API Evangelist is all about.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2015</span>

<p>I love the API design editors that have emerged from <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet as part of their design studio</a>, and from <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC as part of their SDK management service</a>, and if you haven't checked out <a href="https://gelato.io/">Gelato.io</a>, I highly recommend it. All of these solutions provide me with a well designed user interface for working with common API definitions, but even with these offerings, I feel like the overall API universe is very deficient in this area.</p>
<p>It is good that these providers are using common API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, but the UI itself is a one-off, and for API definitions to take their place, front-and-center throughout the API lifecycle, we are going to need some common API design tooling. Any successful solution needs to go well beyond just the JSON, YAML, and Markdown, and give us a powerful user interface to craft exactly the APIs we need.</p>
<p>There are several other API definition editors that let you directly edit JSON, YAML, and Markdown, but to move things forward, we need an easy to use, standardized, open source, API interface interface that will work across common API definition formats. Think of what the WYSIWYG editors did for web design--we need a similar, elegant and modern solution for API design.</p>
<p>I have had this conversation with several API service providers, but I wanted to expand the conversation, and see if I can stimulate the development (or release) of an open source API design editor. I am looking for a solution that any API service provider can deploy within their management solutions, encouraging them to not just speak in common API definition formats, but do it in a way that developers, and non-developers alike, can participate at every stage of the API design life-cycle.</p>

<p>I love the wide swinging perception people have of who I am, often based upon a 15 seconds of sizing me up, reading the title, first and ending paragraph of a blog post, and often seeing this photo. I'm also humbled by the people who tell me the stories of who they thought I was, before they got to know me, and how that dramatically shifted once they met me. People think I'm all sorts of crazy things, without ever actually having a conversation with me.</p>
<p>To help clear the smoke, I figured I'd hlelp answer a few of the common perceptions people throw at me, that in my head I feel people should know, but regularly I am reminded that based upon my site name, branding, etc, people have no clue:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>APIs Are Good -</strong> No, no, sorry they aren't by default. People do a lot of really stupid, fucked up shit with APIs. I'm not blindly cheering on the API masses--sorry. ;-(</li>
<li><strong>Its About REST You Idiot! </strong>- No, no, really don't give a shit if its RESTish, RESTful, REST, or RESTafarian. I do think you should follow sensible, common patterns, something that is rapidly evolving beyond just REST.</li>
<li><strong>I Am Master API Designer -</strong> No, no, sorry. I'm making this shit up as I go along, and learning just like the rest of you. Polishing my skills a little more with each iteration.</li>
<li><strong>I Like All The Attention -</strong> No, no, actually I don't. I like to read, write, and code, and about 1/3 of the time I like interacting with everyone else. During that time I thrive on conversations with people about what they are facing.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Public APIs Are Where It Is At -</strong> I think you should be as transparent, and as publicly available as possible--it just is good for operations, but not everything needs to be publicly available for anyone to consume (that is dumb).</li>
</ol>
<p>I know the people who need these answers the most won't read this blog post -- that is ok. It helps me out to just put the thoughts out there, because once I publish my thoughts, they seem to become more real, or maybe its just me.</p>
<p>In the end, I'm not the API Evangelist because I think APIs are the answer to the worlds problems, but I do think in this insane, online world we are creating for ourselves, we need transparency in how all the Internet tubes work, and APIs + oAuth is the best answer we have currently.</p>
<p>To me, APIs are not the REST dogma many of my critics immediately point to, it about the access, control, and transparency of our vital personal, business, and public resources--whatever our intentions are with those. Ultimately I do not think my vision of APis will win out, but in this early stages of the evolution of the Internet, I'm pushing back to make sure as much of it is as open as possible--this is what API means to me.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gate.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm feeling like the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/09/the-new-aws-api-gateway-anyone-who-does-not-do-this-will-be-fired-thank-you-have-a-nice-day--jeff-bezos/">recent release of the AWS API Gateway</a> isn't just an isolated product release, but more of a signpost in the overall evolution of the API space. It is quite possible that Amazon's moves, set much of this into motion, but I am seeing a number of new API gateway solutions, as well as engaging in more API gateway conversations as part of my regular monitoring and discussions.</p>
<p>Amazons API Gateway release has left me pretty underwhelmed, but I still have a lot of exploration to do, which includes employing the gateway alongside Lambda--so I may be changing my tune. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/10/aws-is-selling-the-api-solution-the-enterprise-will-buy-not-necessarily-the-api-solution-they-need/">When I said AWS launched exactly the API deployment solution the enterprise wanted, not what they need</a>, I'm not necessarily saying it was a stupid move for AWS, my criticism is more about just about making money off the enterprise over providing what they actually need to evolve. (not really a battle I will win--just my ethics bubbling up)</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/23/pushing-my-api-gateway-thoughts-forward-api-gateway-anywhere-with-justapis/">I've also talked with the AnyPresence team about their JustAPIs gateway release</a>, which I thought was more progressive than what AWS is up to, pushing into Internet of Things (IoT) territory, over just mimicking what many existing API gateways offer. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/23/pushing-my-api-gateway-thoughts-forward-api-and-single-page-app-development-with-wavemaker/">Later on in the week, I also noted the "API gateway-light" approach of Wavemaker in their full suite of API-first development solutions</a>, adding to the mix.</p>
<p>After these conversations, <a href="https://apigee.com/about/press-release/apigee-delivers-new-hybrid-cloud-capability-boost-api-management-performance">I also noticed that Apigee launched their new "Edge Microgateway"</a>, and <a href="https://strongloop.com/strongblog/api-gateway-node-js/">StrongLoop launched their new&nbsp;API Gateway which is powered by Node.js</a>. I have not dug into either of their solutions, but on the surface it seems to reflect this overall shift in the concept of an API gateway, something that better addresses the needs of API providers and consumers.</p>
<p>The concept of an API gateway is nothing new, and honestly is something that doesn't normally excite me, but a much lighter-weight, evented, containerized API gateway that will run anywhere I need, and helps me evolve existing infrastructure forward by employing hypermedia patterns--becomes much more interesting. While not all the new API gateway offerings have what I'd like to see, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">when it comes to modern API deployment solutions</a>, I am seeing some progressive signs.</p>
<p>I understand the need to deploy APIs from legacy infrastructure, but without actually understanding the resources, evolving the interfaces, and underlying resources forward, API gateways do not move things forward. If you can actually get more precise about how and where you deploy your APIs, and be able to actually apply future thinking API design patterns, I think there are huge opportunities to actually move API deployment forward in a way that supports web, mobile, and IoT development.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://hdscores.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/hdscores-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I came across <a href="http://hdscores.com/">HDScores</a> a couple of weeks agao, but their API wasn't quite ready, something they officially released this last week. HDScores is interesting to me for a couple of reasons. It is an API that aggregates open government data, but also has what I'd consider a potentially viable API business model as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The monetization of government data using APIs is something I've been discussing for a while, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/02/01/should-the-government-subsidize-and-profit-from-data-markets/">exploring whether our government should subsidize and profit from open data</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/07/a-better-understanding-of-government-apis-and-their-consumers-before-considering-charging-for-use/">helping agencies develop a better understanding of their open data and API consumers before they charge for anything</a>. HDScores takes this to the next level for me, presenting some possible models we can all follow when developing viable business on top of open data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HDScores aggregates restaurant inspection data, something I know other leading tech companies like <a href="http://www.yelp.com/healthscores">Yelp</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/new-york-city-open-data-highlight-restaurant-inspection-results/">CityGrid</a>&nbsp;(ha I wrote that)&nbsp;have wanted to solve for a while, but seems like something that an independent 3rd party could potentially accomplish better. While it is is n Yelp's interest to serve up inspection, it isn't their core competency to make it accessible for others to serve up as well, something I think is critical for the success of open data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like HDScores own description of what they do:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>HDScores is creating ways for everyone to make better decisions on based on actual restaurant inspection data collected by registered/licensed health inspectors in an easy to read, search and understand format.</em></p>
<p>This is an important aspect of open data, and something the government stewards of this data do not always have the time and resources to accomplish. I feel there is a huge opportunity here for the private sector to step up and help out in an open, transparent fashion, when there is a viable business model present.</p>
<p><a href="http://hdscores.com/hdscores/api-rates/">HDScores approach to monetization is pretty straightforward</a>, they allow you to pull up to 1K establishments, and 2.5K inspection reports daily, for free--after that they charge you .05 per piece of data. They also have partnership opportunities available, allowing access to crosswalk data as well, and I'm sure there are volume pricing opportunities if you ask--standard operating procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know many folks who feel that you shouldn't be able to charge for access to public data. However when someone gets to know the data like HDScores has, and improves upon it, I strongly feel you should be able to cover your infrastructure costs, as well as make a fair profit. I suspect as HDScores gets to know consumers better, their pricing will evolve, and get more precise.</p>
<p>In addition to aggregating this data from so many sources, organizing it into a single, coherent collection that is available via an API, HDScores also provides web and mobile apps, as well as embeddable resources built on top of the data. They go well beyond just aggregation, and seem to be actively working to improve upon the open government data.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/hdscores-web-app.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>While I do worry about companies profiting in extreme ways on top of public data, I think what HDScores is up to represents one layer to the future of open government data and APIs. As you will see through my work around the recent grant I received from the Knight Foundation, I strongly feel that the government opening up data is just one piece of the puzzle, and that the private sector needs to step up and complete the puzzle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this vision to become a reality, there has to be a financial incentive for companies to aggregate the data, get to know it intimately, improve upon it, and craft well designed APIs, as well as web, mobile, embeddable tools and visualizations on top of the APIs. I'm not sure that HDScores model is the only way forward in this conversation, but I think it provides us with one possible blueprint of what could work, when it comes to building viable businesses on top of publicly available data.</p>

<p>I am accumulating more references to API goodness from across Universities, <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">as part of my APIs in higher education research</a>. The more I monitor, the more I find, this is how the API monitoring game works. Unfortunately there is no silver bullet for finding APIs, and related resources, it takes going out and finding it--while also having an eye for what to look for.</p>
<p>One thing I found recently was an <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg/apiusability.html">API usability course from Carnegie Mellon</a>. The material is a little bit dated, not reflecting API design used in modern efforts, but it is still good to see something like this as part of university curriculum. There are also some good references there, I will be borrowing from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to seeing more standardized blueprints emerge regarding how campus IT should approach their API efforts, I'd like to see more standardized curriculum emerge that teachers can use in the classroom. I'd also like to see material emerge that isn't just for developers, helping anyone on-board with the concept of APIs, all the way to helping students better design APIs.</p>
<p>Lots to keep an eye on when it comes to <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">APIs on campus</a>. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>I am spending some time, refreshing my look at the open data work, specifically the results of&nbsp;<a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/policy-memo">OMB Memorandum M-13-13</a>,&nbsp;which required federal government agencies to publish a data.json file, providing a machine readable inventory of an agencies public data resources. <a href="http://knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2015/8/4/22-ideas-win-knight-prototype-fund-support/">I recently received a Knight Foundation Grant to build a prototype, explore one possible "whats next", for open data in the federal government</a>--allowing me to push this valuable work forward.</p>
<p>To refresh my memory, I pulled from 87 federal agencies I am tracking on as part of my regular API monitoring--<a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/25/6482-datasets-available-across-22-federal-agencies-in-datajson-files/">raising the bar from 22 federal agencies having published their data.json file</a>, to 27 who have published their data.json file.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It isn't the massive adoption I would like to have seen, but I am happy to see three more agencies get on board with opening up their data inventory, and pleased to see the increase from 6,482 to around&nbsp;<span>33,073. As usual, I am</span>&nbsp;interested in breaking down what is actually happening across these 26 agencies, but I am looking to identify which agencies should be publishing their data.json files, but are not.</p>
<p>While manually checking each federal agencies data.json availability, these are the agencies that I came across that SHOULD have a data.json file present in the root of their domain, there really is not excuse why they shouldn't in 2015.</p>

<p>I will be focusing on the 26 federal agencies who have published their data.json, but will be keeping an eye on how we can incentivize the additional 24 agencies to do it as well. As I dig into the details of each agencies data-sets, I will be looking for where data-sets exist that aren't present on inventory, and help agencies along in their journey.</p>
<p>As I continue my work as part of my Knight Foundation Prototype, I'll have lots more stories to share, this is just the beginning.</p>

<p>I am participating in several API focused <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack channels</a> these days, which opens up entirely new channels for conversations across the API community. I think the private channel(s) gives people a safe place to talk about the challenges they face, but there are also some very educational conversations that occur, that should also be shared publicly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of these conversations from yesterday was focused on how we handle the trailing slash in our endpoints, a conversation started by Nicolas Greni&eacute; (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a>), <a class="tweet-url twitter-atreply pretty-link" dir="ltr" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/3scale"><span>@</span>3scale</a><span>&nbsp;hacker in residence, who asked about</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>myapi.com/authors/ <strong>vs</strong> myapi.com/authors</li>
<li>myapi.com/authors/1/ <strong>vs</strong> myapi.com/authors/1</li>
</ul>
<p>Something which Guillaume Laforge (<a href="https://twitter.com/glaforge">@glaforge</a>) of <a href="https://twitter.com/restlet">@Restlet</a> said, <em>"technically speaking, they are different resources&hellip; but practically speaking I think an API should accept both to do the obvious thing"</em>.</p>
<p>Then John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) of <a href="https://twitter.com/runscope">@Runscope</a> brough some simple wisdom to the conversation, <em>"save a byte, remove the slash, and redirect when it's present to the non-slashed version</em>".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Closing up the conversation&nbsp;Darrel Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>) shared a previous blog post he had published, <a href="http://www.bizcoder.com/2009/02/24/the-mystery-of-the-trailing-slash-and-the-relative-url/">the mystery of the trailing slash and the relative url</a>, which he concludes with ensuring the trailing slash is present in all his urls.</p>
<p>I tend to flip-flop on topics like this, one month adding slashes to everything, and the next month running around removing them. It is my strange ebb and flow API design, and conversations like this help me draw a line in the sand, keeping my behavior consistent. I think I'm going to stick with making sure the slash is present, for no other reason than it looks better.</p>
<p>I'll keep trying to cherry-pick simple wisdom like this from our conversations, capturing and sharing some of the exhaust from these private Slack channels, making sure the wisdom of the crowd gets shared, while still respecting the private conversations that occur.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.osu.edu/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/osu-banner-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">While updating my APIs in higher education research this last week</a> I came across an API portal I think tells an important story about an evolution in how we develop and maintain software. The current wave of web APIs that I cover has been working well because it has exposed a number of valuable resources, that once upon a time were only available in the realm of IT, making these resources accessible to a wider audience of developers, or even business users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This evolution has been slowly pulling back the curtain of IT, exposing more of it's inner workings, potentially simplifying, and decoupling valuable digital resources from legacy power structures. An important piece of this transformation is the translation of IT speak to language that the average human can understand, something that is playing out within API developer portals across companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/25/taking-a-look-at-whats-next-for-the-environmental-protection-agency-epa-envirofacts-data-service-api/">I touched on this subject with my work on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Envirofacts API a couple weeks ago</a>. With a little work I was able to expose a rich set of API resources, just by renaming the APIs, and hydrating some of the acronyms that were being used. While this is an example of the intersection of government IT power structures, it represents the same evolution.</p>
<p>As I was updating my university API work, <a href="https://kmdata.osu.edu/s/">I stumbled across the same evolution occurring at The Ohio State University</a>. When you land on this API developer portal, you are given no signal that this contains course, and other valuable campus related APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://kmdata.osu.edu/s/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/the-ohio-state-university-api-portal-hidden.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This API effort is born out of a classic IT lead project, and while it brings forward some healthy API patterns, it also carries forth the language and culture of IT. I am not saying the team behind the API portal is approaching their portal with intentional bias, these types of efforts are common, and often done by very well meaning groups, who only shortcomings are they don't think about reaching a widest audience possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that anyone should be able to land on an API portal, and be able to understand what is going on, is a foreign concept to many IT and developer groups. They build web service portals, system documentation, and other system doorways, thinking that other like-minded (IT and dev) folks will be coming there. They just aren't used to thinking that business leaders, researchers, data journalists, teachers, students, and any number of other folks might be coming there too.</p>
<p>Most groups that I come across like this, just need to be enlightened, and they will course correct. A smaller, but an often vocal group see no use in anyone outside the IT good ol boy club having access to resources--this is the old IT guard, and how power is protected. They will be gone soon, but for now you will have to just work around them. My goal is to just educate the API portal groups who are willing to listen, and stimulate API efforts from outside of IT lead groups when it is necessary, not to convert the critics.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-services.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I work with each generation of API service providers, I always notice a portion of them that are born out of a previous era of software development from the 1990s, and even sometimes the early 2000s, This reminder frequently brings up the point of how these companies need to follow the same advice they (we) offer to their own customers--decouple your resources, into small API driven services. I regularly stumble upon companies who asks me to review software services that are targeting API providers, that don't reflect an API-first approach.</p>
<p>My advice to these companies is always to step back, take a deep breath, and consider how you can embark on the same journey that the companies you are targeting have already begun traveling. Define all of your digital assets, break them down into the smallest possible API resource you can, then retool how you sell these service through an API platform, as well as web, mobile, and other micro tooling that you, and your partners can build on top of these APIs. To me, this is the Dogfood (Champagne --&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/inadarei">@inadarei</a>) 2.0 conversation that needs happen in order for the API space to mature to the next level.</p>
<p>In 2015, if you are a company that is selling a service to API providers of any shape and size, and this service is not available via an API, and offers a self-service on-boarding flow, I probably won't be talking about it often. I won't be spending too much time convincing API service providers that they need to reduce this friction--it seems like common sense at this point, I will be focusing on the leading service providers, that they need to be "communicating" using common API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>, and with <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collections</a>.</p>
<p>Just like we tell companies that are considering the API journey, "don't get left behind", as an API service provider you need to make sure and decouple your services, making them more agile, nimble, and scalable. Sound familiar ?? ;-)</p>

<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">As I migrate the version 1.0 of my internal systems to an API-first version 2.0</a>, one of the challenges I face is the optimization of some of the features in my own system. I have numerous systems I crafted to solve a specific need, at a specific point in time, with very little consideration about the most efficient design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 50% of my version 1.0 systems employed APIs, many systems relied on directly connecting to my MySQL databases. One example of this is my main news curation screen on my dashboard. This was the replacement for Google Reader about 6 months before they killed it off. My reader system is very chatty, every action I take against a single post (archive, curate, tag, etc.) initiates a round-trip to the database--something when you translate to API calls, becomes a very huge blip on my API analytics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I treat all my internal apps, just like I would one of my API consumers, and make them sign up for key, and exist within my API service tiers. There are numerous reasons for this, but in the end, it helps me see things through an external lens. When I got my report on my usage, I noticed my curated API usage was through the roof. This is good right? No! It means I have super chatty features in my application, something I need to refactor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My curation may involve 1000 to 3000 news articles which needs to be curated or archived, resulting in potentially 3000 API calls, and when you add on applying tags, and managing other details, I can be in the 5,000 to 10,000 range pretty quick. Its obvious I need a better approach, so I'm developing a new queue based system that lets me work with 25 news stories at once, and submit the changes as a single bulk API call--significantly reducing the number of calls I make.</p>
<p>In the end, my API rate limits are forcing me to think through my app design, and how I make API calls. It also is helping me rethink how I design my APIs. I want each API call to be as efficient as it can from app to server. To quote my friend Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>), "rate limits on APIs pushes developers to be more creative". Something I agree with 100%, if it truly is a transparent conversation between API provider and consumer--which in my private, schizophrenic ecosystem is pretty easy to achieve.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/api-management-infrastructure-and-service-composition-is-key-to-orchestration-with-microservices-in-a-containerized-world/">I am revisiting the service composition for my own APIs on a regular basis lately</a>, along with the ever increasing number of conversations I'm having with API providers about their own API monetization strategy. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/30/is-your-monetization-rooted-in-the-resource-or-experience-side-of-your-api-operations/">An example of this can be seen with the conversation I had&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Popup Archive about their monetization strategy for their AudioSear.ch API, and how they are shifting from a resource based perspective to a more experience based monetization approach.</a> One side effect of this conversation, is that it looped me back around to thinking about the next steps for my own system.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I currently have 28 APIs, with almost 400 endpoints, most of which are content and data style APIs</a>. This represents the core of the API Evangelist network, and now that I have it well defined as a single set of decoupled APIs, it is allowing me to move forward with a whole new generation of APIs. With my current set of content and data APIs, the number one consumer is me, any 3rd party usage is something I want to stimulate, and derive any revenue--my blog, curated, and other APIs are just value add to the traffic on my network of web sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the next phase of my API development, I am looking to create more structured API resources that do things like convert CSV to JSON, process patent XML dumps to JSON, the indexing of websites, and much more. These newer APIs tend to go well beyond just pulling information from a database, and require a little more engineering, as well as potentially a lot more compute resources to make a reality. Historically I only meter my APIs to help me manage my costs, but moving forward I am looking to actually generate revenue as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service composition I currently have defined using my <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale API infrastructure</a> addresses the different types of consumers who potentially will be consuming my APIs. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/08/my-api-service-composition-tiers/">I have public, retail, trusted, partner, and platform service tiers that provide me with the buckets I need to manage my consumers</a>. However, this doesn't address my granular level API monetization goals, something I am now adding as a credit based system on top of my existing 3Scale API service composition to address. Each of my APIs will now have a credit value associated with it, with many having 1 as the value, others could run you as much as 50 or 100 credits--I am guessing most will be in the 1-10 range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an API-first system where I manage all my internal APIs, alongside all of the APIs I track on in the public sphere, and I am just adding this credit value to each entry, something that will then reflected in the APIs configuration file. As each API is called, it reports to my 3Scale API infrastructure what value of usage is being consume, and 3Scale does the rest for me. My API management infrastructure handles applying of the API usage to each users application, and which service composition tier that application operates within--and invoicing of each account accordingly.</p>
<p>It will take me a while to roll this out across my stack, and begin applying to some APIs that are in development and not quite ready for prime time. Hopefully my next update will have more examples of this in the wild. I'm eager to see how I can apply a credits cross my stack, better helping me understanding the value of each of the data, content, and algorithmic API resources I'm crafting, and ultimately whether this value translates to 3rd party API consumers.</p>

<p>I am fortunate to be able to take part in numerous conversations around API strategy, with companies, organizations, and government agencies who are trying to understand, and maximize the role they play in the API economy. However, one side effect of this world, is that most of these conversations begin and end with strategy planning, and when it comes to deployment and management, I rarely stay on in discussions. I do have clients who do check in with me, at different stops along their journey, but for the most part my role ends once the strategy discussions end.</p>
<p>I would like to change this with a new relationship I've established with <a href="http://apiware.io/">APIWare, a new API-first agency that is dedicated to defining, developing, deploying, and managing APIs at all stages of the life-cycle</a>. I have worked with the core team that is APIWare, on earlier projects, and after a couple of years, I've learned to trust the work they do.</p>
<p>API Evangelist and APIWare are partnering to make sure that some is always available to help you meet the demand of your API operations, by exclusively focusing on:</p>
<p><a href="http://apiware.io/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apiware-working.png" alt="" width="240" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining Your API - </strong>Where do your resources originate, and what is the best path forward in defining and designing your APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Developing Your API - </strong>The actual hard work of crafting your APIs from scratch, all the way to using common API gateway solutions and frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Managing API Operations -</strong> Take care of the day challenges when operating your API from monitoring and availability to developer on-boarding.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The APIWare team is determined to stay focused in these areas, while you are busy doing other things, and the team is working hard to follow many of the best practices that I showcase across my work in the API space. Now you don't just get a handful of initial conversations with me about best practices, you have a team that will help you actually address the pieces of API operations that are falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>I will not be doing any of the development, the core team is way more skilled at this than I am, however I will be involved with defining overall best practices for the team, and will be touching each project as it comes in the door, and at regular stages throughout its evolution. This approach helps make sure I can continue having many conversations throughout an APIs life-cycle, be there to share thoughts on the road-map, while also keep telling the important stories about API operations from the trenches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The API Evangelist + APIWare partnership reflects a shift in how I will be doing things in the future. I am looking to capture more of the exhaust from my world--filling a critical gap in providing companies and organizations with a reliable source of API development, and management resources, that operates in a structured, yet agile, project management way, while sticking to an API-first vision.</p>
<p>This new evolution in API Evangelist will not change my tone. My goal is to not to build a startup, but to help meet a growing demand in the space. I will still be as opinionated, and honest about my approach, I will just have more stories to tell! ;-)</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Citi-Mobile-Challenge.png" alt="" width="290" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.citimobilechallenge.com/APIs/index.php">I was made aware of the&nbsp;Citi Mobile Challenge</a> during a conversation last week <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/23/pushing-my-api-gateway-thoughts-forward-api-gateway-anywhere-with-justapis/">with the Anypresence team about their new JustAPIs offering</a>. The conversation with them has triggered several potential stories, but one that stood out for me, was the API virtualization opportunities that emerge when <a href="http://justapis.com/">you use solutions like the JustAPIs gateway</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support the&nbsp;Citi Mobile Challenge, the bank launched a set of virtual APIs to support the event. I think their descriptions tells a lot of the story:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The APIs made available through Citi&reg; Mobile Challenge power some of Citi's latest digital offerings around the globe. These APIs will give developers an opportunity to create solutions that could function with existing Citi technology. No customer data will be shared. Citi encourages developers to also use APIs outside of Citi to support and add additional features to their innovations.</em></p>
<p>The bank needed to mimic their production environment, but in a way that developers can still build meaningful mobile apps,without the immediate security and privacy concerns that are present when working with live systems. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/11/i-wish-all-apis-had-sandbox-environment-by-default/">While I wish sandbox environments were default via all API platforms</a>, which unfortunately is not a reality, however I think when it comes to fintech, the stakes are much higher--which smells like an opportunity for API definitions to me.</p>
<p>It can be a lot of work to establish and maintain both sandbox and production environments, but is something that if you do, can open up even more opportunity when it comes to supporting hackathons, providing QA environments, and much more. Additionally, if you embrace modern API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint in this process, as well as approaches to containerization like Docker, a whole new agility and flexibility can be realized as well.</p>
<p>Like API monitoring, performance, security, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">other growing incentives for embracing modern API definition formats</a>, I see the demand for API virtualization growing. When your APIs are well defined, a new world of API definition driven services emerges, making things like virtualization for hackathons, QA, load testing, simulation, as well as just a permanent sandbox possible</p>
<p>I have an API virtualization research area started, I just need to spend the time organizing the companies who are doing interesting things in the space, and consider some of the possible building blocks, before it is ready for prime time--stay tuned!</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/cobalt"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/cobalt">I found a pretty cool Github repository during my latest review of my university API research</a>, with a mission "<span>to provide a collection of RESTful web APIs that can allow developers to create applications or services that utilize public data from the University of Toronto."</span></p>
<p>I am a big fan of jump-starting API efforts on campus in this way, <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/">something I did to help fuel the API discussion at University of Oklahoma</a>. Which is a topic I will be talking more about in the near future as these conversations continue play out. In my opinion, many campuses are just not ready for APIs, and to get things rolling, it will may often take outside influences.</p>
<p>This API project I found, that is dedicated to the University of Toronto is interesting because they identify three target APIs that are being worked on.</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" type="checkbox" />&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/cobalt/tree/master/api/courses">UofT Course API</a></li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" type="checkbox" />&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/cobalt/tree/master/api/buildings">UofT Building API</a></li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" type="checkbox" />&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/cobalt/tree/master/api/food">UofT Food API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They are also building their own <a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/uoft-scrapers">scraping module</a>, which is available in the repository, complete with a list of target sources, where they will be scraping valuable data for inclusion in the course, building, and food API. I find the project repository is very focused, informative, and simple--well done.</p>
<p>I would call this a minimum viable blueprint for API operations on any campus, and is something that should be forked, and cleansed of University of Toronto information,&nbsp; replaced with generalized how-to instructions--complete with a scraping tool. Anyone involved with a university should be able to set a project like this in motion, by forking, and following a simple blueprint.</p>
<p>With all the work available on Github, it also means anyone else can potentially get involved and contribute, and if a single project gets abandoned, someone else could potentially pick it up. Most importantly, when a university is actually ready to legitimize the API efforts, they can also fork, and build on top of any work that has been already accomplished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this approach to doing APIs at the higher educational level may not be optimal, sometimes its all we have to stimulate the API discussion on campus, something that we just can't wait for--it needs to be set in motion as soon as possible..</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-experience-monetization.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had another one of my regular check-ins with Anne and Bailey over at <a href="https://www.popuparchive.com/">Popup Archive</a>&nbsp;today, with a focus around the monetization strategy for their <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer">AudioSear.ch API</a>. I thoroughly enjoy my conversations with the team, because they have worked really hard on their audio API solutions, and are extremely open to discussion, and sharing the stories of their API journey.</p>
<p>During our talk, they tuned me into where they were at with their road-map, which includes now having <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer">a solid set of API resources that provide access to the episodes, people, and shows involved in podcasts across the Internet</a>. They talked about how they have been iterating on these core API resources, with more experience focused endpoints including relatedness, trending, and tastes, to name a few. All of this really demonstrates that the company are well along in their API journey, moving beyond just the definition of core aPI resources, and actually getting in tune with how these resources will actually be put to work.</p>
<p>Next they walked me through some of the core use cases for their podcast API, ranging from radio stations looking to provide better recommendations, to advertisers who want to better understand the exploding world of podcasts, and understand where the opportunity is. Audiosear.ch is working to quantify the world of podcasting, by indexing not just the metadata surrounding audio files, but also its contents, and relationships between them--busting open a brand new realm in cyberspace, that like video, that is poised for explosive growth, and will be ripe with opportunities.</p>
<p>Now that AudioSear.ch can crack open, index, and develop awareness around the contents of podcasts, which includes the episodes and people involved with shows, they are also faced the hard part of actually defining, and delivering APIs that developers will need, and actually pay for. Meaning which API endpoints do we provide, and what do we charge for them? The number one conversation I am having with companies who have embarked on their own API journey.</p>
<p>These conversation always begin with discussion the hard costs: what did we invest in developer hours? what are our licensing costs? what does compute cost? what does our storage cost? what does our bandwidth cost? All of these costs are rooted in the resource side of the conversation. Where do the data, content, and other resource originate? How much work have we put into? How do we perceive the value of our own resources? Leaving every API provider trying to figure out what people will pay, and calculating their margins--resource-based monetization strategy.</p>
<p>Resource-based API monetization strategies are where all API operations begin when they trying to figure things out. Once you are further along in your API journey like Anne and Bailey are, you need to start thinking about more experienced based pricing, something that will be more closely aligned with how API consumers actually see things. As an API provider, you tend to be too closely aligned with your resources, focused on an API design derived from this view, and a monetization strategy that looks to cover the costs, while also bringing home a potentially good margin. When you are rooted in this way of thinking you are always chained to your core resource-based assumptions, which is often very distant from what will be important to your customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you<a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer"> look at how Audiosear.ch is iterating with the more experience based API designs like /trends, /relatedness, and /tastes for podcasts</a>, you see how they are beginning to uncover what is actually valuable to end-users. As they keep iterating on these experience based API endpoints, driven by API consumer needs, you can't have your pricing solely anchored to the resource, it needs to also reflect the value perceived by the consumer. You never know when you will find just the right endpoint for a resource, that has high perceived value to end-user, but relatively low costs associated with actually delivering--add entirely new dimensions to your margins.</p>
<p>Approaching API monetization based upon how resources will be experience, decoupling from just a resource based approach, will first and foremost increase the chance that anyone will purchase API access for any sustained period, but secondly opens up a whole new world for price increases (or reductions) based upon demand (think AWS). These are just some initial thoughts from our conversation, something I will be thinking about more in coming weeks, and hopefully provide some other more concrete examples of this in the wild.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just needed to work through some initial thoughts as I got out of the Google Hangout--thanks Anne and Bailey #GoodTimes</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apittie-node-endpoints.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>in my time as API Evangelist I've seen a number of API deployment as a service providers come and go. It is something that is technically hard to do properly, and something that historically had been hard to monetize, but as a wider awareness around APIs grows in the mainstream, the demand landscape for API deployment is shifting.</p>
<p>I got a demo of an API provider today called <a href="https://www.apitite.net/">apitite</a>, which provides API deployment and management services in the cloud. The core of the service is built around the common need to deploy APIs from datasources like MySQL, SQL Server, etc. However I wanted to highlight another feature of their platform <a href="http://blog.apitite.net/2015/07/introducing-nodejs-code-endpoints.html">which they call code endpoints</a>.</p>
<p>When I help folks understand what is possible with APIs, I break into four main groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - APIs are about making data more accessible, and usable.</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong> - With a focus on data, many forget to talk about serving of media and content via LAPIs.</li>
<li><strong>Functional</strong>&nbsp;- Providing more algorithmic and functional features that accomplish a task.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware</strong> - Allowing for a device to connected to by other applications and systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know this is simplified, and some tech pundits will love to poke holes in it, but when you are explaining the API opportunity to business leaders, as well as the average business user, this has worked well for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>apitite delivers on the functional portion of this API equation forward for me, with their endpoints service. Their platform is Node.js based, but allows for very small scripts to be deployed as simple API endpoints. When you couple this with marketplace-like abilities so users can find ready to go scripts they can reverse engineer, as well as a place for developers to publish and share / sell their scripts--you have a potentially very powerful API deployment formula.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen other similar solutions emerge like <a href="https://algorithmia.com/">Algorthmia</a>, but nothing that is bundled with the data API capabilities that apitite also brings to the table. Anyways, I just wanted to highlight this single point from this conversation, while it was fresh in my head. I will have more to share on <a href="https://www.apitite.net/">apitite</a> as I play with the platform more, and incorporate into a project I am working on around government data.</p>

<p><a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/universities.html">With my latest look at APIs in universities, I increased the number of institutions I'm watching from 17 to 48, more than doubling the number of API efforts in higher education from 2014 to 2015</a>.

<p>I could spend hours looking through each university's search, finding new APIs from student and class projects, and from research going on across campus. LIke all of my research it is a work in preogress, and I depend on my audience to help me discover what is out there.</p>
<p>If you know of a school who is doing interesting stuff with APIs please let me know, or if you work at one of the schools listed above, feel free to reach out anytime. I'm always looking to hear more stories out of universities about API design, deployment, maangement, evangelism or integration.</p>
<p>I will work harder to update my university research more frequently, and <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/white-paper.html">if you want to visit more of my research in detail, you can download as HTML or PDF for enjoyment late</a>r(helps put me to sleep). Once I get this round of papers updated, I'm going to provide ePub as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in!</p>

<p>I am currently trying to move forward the&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/">917 companies, from 223 business areas, with a total 882 APIs catalogued, and 407 Swagger definitions created</a>, while working on a distributed way to understand where the profiling for each company is, and how far in defining this in a machine readable way. <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">I had kicked off another prototype APIs.json type a few months back I'm calling api-questions to handle just this</a>, in a way that allows me to ask human readable questions about APis, while also storing in a distributed, machine readable format that can be indexed via each APIs.json file.</p>
<p>I have long tracked on what public APIs are doing in a database. I keep links to Github and Twitter profiles, blogs to pricing, and terms of service. I started publishing this information to APIs.json for the companies I track on a while back. I have the information, and I'm working my way through thousands of APIs, trying to make sure there is a complete definition available, I needed an automated way to help make sure I'm asking the right quesitons consistently of each API.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">in addition to my list of Swagger oriented questions</a>, I've compiled a list of the most common APIs.json defined, API operations related questions that I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there an API? (the most important question of them all!)</li>
<li>Is there an APIs.json File?</li>
<li>Is there a blog?</li>
<li>Is there a blog RSS feed?</li>
<li>Is there a portal?</li>
<li>Is there a platform description?</li>
<li>Is there getting started information?</li>
<li>Is there documentation for the API?</li>
<li>Is there interactive documentation for the API?</li>
<li>Is there an authentication overview?</li>
<li>Is there self-service registration?</li>
<li>Is there request for access?</li>
<li>Is there code samples?</li>
<li>Is there code libraries?</li>
<li>Is there SDKs?</li>
<li>Is there email for support?</li>
<li>Is there an FAQ section?</li>
<li>Is there a knowledge base?</li>
<li>Is there a forum?</li>
<li>Is there a Twitter account?</li>
<li>Is there a LinkedIn account?</li>
<li>Is there a Github account?</li>
<li>Is there a pricing page?</li>
<li>Is there a rate limit page?</li>
<li>Is there a road map?</li>
<li>Is there a change log?</li>
<li>Is there a status page?</li>
<li>Is there a terms of service?</li>
<li>Is there a privacy policy?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help me along, I've created a <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/">simple API for management of my API related questions</a>, then I created <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/ask/organization/?apisjson_url=https://kin-lane.github.io/api/apis.json&amp;questions=19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45">another API for asking these questions of specific APIs.json files</a>. However if you want to use this API, you need an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> index for your APIs, which all of mine in the API stack do--then it will spider and do its best to answer the &nbsp;questions above, and return specific answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results are far from perfect, but it is a start. I will be making the questions more precise, and adding new questions. My goal is to have a real-time way of telling how complete my APIs.json files are, and where the work is that needs to be done--as I am doing the work.</p>
<p>I'm sure the definition of exactly what is a complete APIs.json definition is will continue to evolve, always resulting in a human having the final vote, but for now I will just keep defining, until I find the right balance between programmatic, and the human touch.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/07/29/asking-the-right-questions-of-api-operations/">Asking The Right Questions Of API Operations</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-questions-ask.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I ask a lot of questions about the API space. In m quest to make sense of the growing number of APIs in the space, I partnered with 3Scale to define the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json format</a>. In the year since we launched, I've used it to help me define almost 1000 companies that I keep an eye on in the space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be able to understand APIs at scale, I had to develop a way to ask questions about a companies API operations, while also asking them of my own APIs. This project was born out of some research into making API terms of service (TOS) machine readable, which led me to the project <a href="https://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn't Read</a>--a very important project you should know about. Long story short, I realized how much work it would be to make APIs TOS machine readable, and distilled things down to just be able to ask simple questions about APIs like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there self-service registration?</li>
<li>Can I delete my account?</li>
<li>Do I own my data?</li>
</ul>
<p>I then quickly realized the potential for my api-questions format, and that it could help me avoid getting tangle up in the legaleze of API TOS, and speed up making sense of how APIs work. I also saw that I could apply api-questions to other areas of API operations that I already track on like code resources, pricing, and support. api-questions would be a machine readable index of the questions I ask most about APIs, from A-Z.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin with I compiled almost 60 of the most common questions I ask about APIs, and launched an API to support the adding, editing, and modifying of these questions. I broken these questions down into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/29/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-apisjson-edition/">APIs.json Questions</a> </strong>- Things I generally wanted to know about API operations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">Swagger Questions</a> </strong>- Things I wanted to know specifically about the API, and since I profile them using Swagger...</li>
</ul>
<p>I have started apply an api-questions approach to the APIs that I depend on to run API Evangelist. You can see this in action with the Alchemy API. I ask the same two groups of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/ask/organization/?apisjson_url=http://theapistack.com/data/alchemyapi/apis.json&amp;questions=19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45">APIs.json Questions</a> - </strong>I want to understand how complete the Alchemy API operations is, and where all the moving parts are in a machine readable way.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/ask/organization/?apisjson_url=http://theapistack.com/data/alchemyapi/apis.json&amp;questions=46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73">Swagger Definitions</a> -</strong> I want to be able to ask the Swagger questions of each of the Alchemy APIs, where you really start seeing the need for automation here.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://theapistack.com/data/alchemyapi/apis.json">If you look at the APIs.json I maintain for the Alchemy API you will also notice I added both these api-questions to the main API index</a>. I'm still working on the format, and the best way to reference the questions for each API, as well as the whole collection. However the goal is to provide a machine readable list of questions, anyone can put to use when evaluating what API they want to use, while also making the questions available in <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>.</p>
<p>While formulating api-questions as a way to automate the questions I was asking of public APIs, I felt it should also be asked of my own internal APIs. I wanted to make sure my APIs meet the bar I set for the APIs I monitor in the API sector. This is where api-questions move from an external discovery thing for me, to an internal discovery plus operational quality of service.</p>
<p>api-questions gives me the ability to ask consistent questions of all of my APIs, knowing that they are indexed in each centralized APIs.json index. Right now I just have APIs.json and Swagger related questions, but I will be adding to these groups, as well as establishing entirely new groups from the business and politics of API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When applied to API operations, api-questions takes on a different lens when you are looking at external APIs, but when applied to your own internal APIs it changes views again, and helps you understand potentially where the gaps are, and helps you establish a checklist for overall operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I am using api-questions to make sure my APIs have consistently designed interfaces, interactive documentation, complete SDKs in all languages, Postman collections for integration, and monitors that keep my APIs as available as possible</a>. While I'm still working out a lot of kinks, this approach is helping me manage my own operations at scale, which also involves understanding thousands of public APIs, establishing a pretty virtuous cycle for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another layer I am adding to api-questions is the concept of api-certification, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/certification/">which I have deployed another API to support</a>, which basically groups questions together, but looks for specific answers to those questions, and certifies an API meets these requirements on a regular schedule. Stay tuned for that...</p>
<p>The purpose of this story is to help me grasp whats next for this work, while also sharing this methodology, and the tooling I have developed with my partner team at <a href="http://apiware.io">APIWare</a>. I want to make sure all APIs that are deployed and managed in a consistent way, with all the essential building blocks for success.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/07/27/politics-of-the-api-economy/">Politics Of The API Economy</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-protest.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I did a napkin doodle the other day at my favorite local hangout during lunch and beers. I was thinking about the finer points of the API economy that I dwell on, and feel are important not just for API success, but also developer, end-user, and industry level health. In this doodle, I'm trying to think about where I need to focus my energy when working to keep the API pipes as transparent and open as possible.</p>
<p>For me, this isn't just an API story, this is a story about the evolution fo the web, and ultimately a story of the journey humans are on, when it comes to defining our virtual self, that participates in the online domains that capture our attention on a daily basis. I wanted to better understand how companies are moving digital assets online, generating new resources, which are often times user-generated resources, empowered by developers. This is a complex world unfolding, and here was my attempt to better understand.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Virtual Domains.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I worked to distill this down, and represent the key actors, and struggles, we are facing as the API economy becomes a reality. Companies are moving more digital resources online, while also developing platforms for users and developers to generate, and work with valuable resources like images, text, videos, and more. These resources (or lifebits to users) live within the growing number of virtual domains.</p>
<p>In the early Internet days, these resources were often static content, but around 2005, during the web 2.0 phase, things became much more more dynamic. This evolution continued with mobile, and is only picking up momentum with the Internet of Things. These resources x domains x users x apps x developers = the units that make up the API economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relationship between all the actors involved in the exchange of these units, are often being managed by oAuth, but also other more simplistic ways like keys, passwords, etc. Identity is king, of serious value to platforms, but simply your digital self to the average online user. This relationship is heavily impacted by government and industry influences ranging from regulation to patent and copyright challenges, as well as the higher level NSA and cybersecurity conversations that plague the online world.</p>
<p>If we are lucky the resources we depend on, and the life bits we generate daily, are securely stored and transmitted with end-users knowledge and consent, and enjoying a high level of ethics by developers, with transparency at the corporate and government levels. Unfortunately this isn't something we enjoy across the board, and will be the biggest challenge of the API economy.</p>
<p>Access to resources, security, transparency, licensing, ownership and other items I included in my doodle will come into play heavily across this new economy. This isn't just about companies deploying APIs. This will be a real-time balance between platforms, developers, users, and the government, that will have to be constantly managed by everyone involved.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-write.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Most of the APIs you find out there are read only, meaning they act like a website and just allow you to retrieve data, content, and other media types, but usually do not let you read or write any data to them. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/11/augmenting-a-read-only-api-with-an-external-post-put-and-delete/">I wrote a while back about&nbsp;augmenting a read only API with an external POST, PUT, and DELETE</a>&nbsp;as I came out of the government, but wanted to update the topic, based upon some open data work I'm doing with <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">RESTlet API Spark</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://restlet.com/resources/detail/summer-of-apis-workshop/">I am preparing for my Restlet Summer of APIs webinar tomorrow morning</a>, so I am publishing some open data files (CSV, Excel, etc.) to the platform, generating data stores, and ultimately APIs. A simple example of this in action would be with <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/farmers-markets-geographic-data">farmers market data from the US Department of Agriculture</a>. <a href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html">There is a farmers market API, but it leaves a lot to be desired</a>, something others, <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2011/08/08/farmers-market-api/">like Code for America have tried to solve</a>, but I figured I could not just launch an API from the open dataset, I would make it read and write.</p>
<p>Deploying an API with Restlet's APISpark is pretty straightforward, something I will build a more detail walk-through in the future, but to summarize, you just download the Excel file from data.gov, and upload to Google Spreadsheet. Once you have cleaned up the spreadsheet, fields, and other elements, you can connect to your Google Drive using API Spark, and generate an entity data store--you now have a separate copy of the Google Spreadsheet, stored on APISpark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, you can publish a web API using the service, something you can use to launch multiple versions, require authentication to use, track usage, and much more. The great part, is it doesn't just generate the GET for your API, you also get the POST, PUT, and DELETE. You have now have a full read and write API for Farmers Market dataset. You could now accept submissions from Famer Market owners, merchants, and attendees to expand on the dataset, outside the original USDA source.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how you could augment existing open data sources, or even an existing API, and improve on them using Restlet API Spark. The best part is you can do this without any coding. While it does take some work to massage the data, and API design into shape, I did a handful of APIs with never actually writing any code. <a href="http://restlet.com/resources/detail/summer-of-apis-workshop/">If you want to see this in action, catch my workshop tomorrow morning at 10 AM</a>, and maybe you can find a dataset you would like to see improved with a simple API, and <a href="http://restlet.com/summer-of-apis/">participant in the Restlet Summer of APIs</a>.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/280px-Environmental_Protection_Agency_logo.svg.png" alt="EPA" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was asked by folks at the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/services.html">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> to provide some feedback on the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/services.html">Envirofacts Data Service API</a>, as they prepare to work on the next iteration. I took a quick glance at the landing page for their service, I saw a simple URL layout showing how to make API calls, and made an estimate that it would take me probably an hour or two (at the most) to profile the API.</p>
<p>As I dug into the process of profiling the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API one evening in May, I realized I was wrong about the scope of the API, and became unsure how long it would actually take me. Then this work got lost in the shuffle of my summer, and is something I only recently picked up. I'm not happy if I can't provide an agency with some direction on where to go next, and after about 12 hours of work, I think I have some valuable feedback that they can run with.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/services.html">The&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API program consists of a single landing page</a>, with an overview of how to use the API, and a myriad of pages below, that explain the underlying data model put to use. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/22/an-example-of-resource-based-api-design-over-at-the-envirofacts-data-service-api/">The API is what I consider a very resource driven API design, meaning it reflects the database resource it came from, and not much emphasis on how the API driven resources will be used</a>.</p>
<p>While the API does use the URL, it uses few of the other HTTP components that make some RESTful. I can see how the design would make sense to a database engineer, but will be a little confusing for API developers.</p>

</table>
<p>After I discovered the 411 tables across these 13 groups, and learned the common URL pattern for querying, I decided to define each table as its own endpoint, rather than relying on each table to be included via a {table} path parameter, I opted to hard code it. Even though most of them are incoherent, some still articulate a little bit more about what they resource might do, and once you make a request, you get an even better idea. All of this can go a long way towards helping people understand what is going on.</p>
<p>It wouldn't take much to apply a coherent summary&nbsp; to each endpoint that describes what is stored in the table for use. Once I had a list of all tables, I went ahead and made a call to each of the 411 endpoints in the 13 areas, and generated a Swagger API definition for each. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/21/parsing-charles-proxy-exports-to-generate-swagger-definitions-while-also-linking-them-to-each-path/">Using Charles Proxy I was able to generate the underlying data model for each</a>, which is necessary for generating SDKs, and can be used as a central truth throughout other aspects of API integration. The current API design also allows you pass in a field, and apply an operator against it when searching--I opted to leave this out of this iteration, until I had a clear diction of endpoints, and the underlying data model defined for each.&nbsp; The API is perfectly usable without this.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping Things Simple</strong><br />My recommendation for any future API release out of the EPA team would be focused on just simplifying things. When you land on the home page, you get the idea there is an API present, but you do not grasp the depth of the resource. A simple list of the various API groups is important. A list that I hydrated from the acronyms, to better demonstrate what lies beneath. Calling things by their actual names just makes things more intuitive. You need to reach out of your government silos. I had to really work hard to make sense of the data model at play, I was sure there would be a meta API or download allowing me to quickly understand things, but I couldn't find it. By creating Swagger definitions for all API endpoints, complete with associated definitions for the data model, I can now easily build querying, filtering, and other mechanisms into my clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speaking In Plain English</strong><br />While FRS_PROGRAM_FACILITY&nbsp;may had made sense to the database administrator when naming the original, it does not adequately describe the resource it is serving up. A big part of the next version for these APIs needs to focus on renaming towards more meaningful endpoints over the cryptic table names, and more descriptive fields for each of the underlying data definitions. After crafting the Swagger definitions for these APIs I am blown away by the amount of information in here, obfuscated by the cryptic database naming conventions.</p>
<p><strong>Wrap In A Clean Portal</strong><br />The current landing page for the Envirofacts API is fairly cluttered, and ultimately doesn't say much--it made me work to hard to get what I need. My goal was to distill down the 13 APIs I found buried in the Envirofacts API page, and expose exactly what you need to understand and get to work using any of the 13 APIs and the over 400 endpoints--nothing more. &nbsp;<a href="http://epa-envirofacts.apievangelist.com/">I started with a simple Github Pages hosted template, with a single APIs.json home page, and interactive documentation for each of the APIs</a> (which you can fork).</p>

The EPA was proposed by President Richard Nixon and began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is led by its Administrator, who is appointed by the president and approved by Congress. The current administrator is Gina McCarthy. The EPA is not a Cabinet department, but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank.</td>

<p>With my new portal, you get the overview of the EPA API, with link to each API, but I also use the Swagger definition to generate Swagger interactive documentation, rather than sending you to the EPA data model page. This is just the start. I can also use Swagger to generate sandbox environments, cloning APIs, and maybe allowing for updates and changes. I could also use the Swagger to generate client libraries for EPA APIs using <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a>. <a href="http://epa-envirofacts.apievangelist.com/roadmap/">I'll add all of this to the roadmap, I think I have done enough work for now, and ready to hand things back to EPA</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see EPA consider some of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common building blocks</a> I recommend as part of <a href="http://api-portal.apievangelist.com/">my default developer portal</a>. You don't have to do everything, but the more you do to engage the public around your API, the more chances they will actually use it. Additionally if you go through all APIs, and translate everything from databaseze to English, the potential someone will build on it will exponentially increase.</p>
<p><strong>Continue On The API Journey At EPA</strong><br />Beyond the portal, and better describing the APIs, my advice is to just continue on the API journey at EPA--this is where the learnings come from. On the current Envirofacts API page, there is another API in addition to the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API, the UV Index API. I can tell the thinking that went into this, are the beginning steps of more experience based API design, focusing on how the API will be used. There is still a lot of the same design mistakes in crafting URLs for this API, but I can tell the desire is there to continue improving on the original design.</p>
<p>When you look at the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/multisystem.html">Envirofacts Multi-system Search</a>, and the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/widgets.html">widgets that are present</a>, you also see some serious thought put into usability--this needs to be applied to the API design. The API is for other developers, but you can assist them in better understanding the potential through better API design.</p>
<p>I haven't changed anything with the current EPA&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API, I just worked to understand how it works, profiled each service I found as a Swagger definition, <a href="http://epa-envirofacts.apievangelist.com/apis.json">and then brought them all together as a single APIs.json driven collection</a>. This process helped me understand the 13 APIs and 400+ endpoints, while also distilling this definition into a set of machine readable index, that I use to <a href="http://epa-envirofacts.apievangelist.com/">drive the Github Page developer portal I launched</a>. APIs.json drives the home page, and each APIs Swagger definition drives its associated interactive documentation.</p>
<p>When it comes to the next iteration of the EPA&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API, I'd focus on a simple, concise portal for supporting developers, complete with the common building blocks found in other leading API platforms. I would also focus on taking the API definitions I've created, and get to work humanizing the design of these 13 APIs, and 400+ endpoints. Make the endpoints intuitive, standardize your approach to query, and pagination based upon other leading approaches established by API architects. Then do the dirty work of humanizing the underlying definitions, field names, and descriptions. Think deeply about both the request and response structure, and make it speak to developers--your simple, intuitive portal, with the right building blocks will provide a potential feedback look for this cycle (if you do it right).</p>
<p>If you do this, then get to work generating some SDKs, setup some monitors with <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a> or <a href="http://runscope.com">Runscope</a>, and provide <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collections</a> for your API consumers, and&nbsp; get busy evangelizing that these APIs even exist--the API will get used. There is a lot of value present here, it just needs to be brought out, polished, and presented in a way that showcases the hard work going on at EPA.</p>

<p>API Evangelist has always been about helping on-board the masses with concepts involving APIs, something that takes a lot of work, because more often than not, an API is a very abstract concept, far removed from the everyday lives of normal people. When services like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> launched, I became very optimistic about how APIs can be put to work by the average individual, and today my optimism went up another notch, with the redesign of <a href="https://www.blockspring.com/">Blockspring</a>.</p>
<p>The Blockspring home page image says it all in my opinion--<span style="text-decoration: underline;">valuable API resources, neatly available in Google Sheets, and Excel on the desktop, and in the Cloud with Office 365</span>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blockspring.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Blockspring-Money-Shot.png" alt="" width="100%" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>This is it! This is the window to the API economy that will be required to take things to the next level. Most of the worlds business is conducted through this interface, without drag and drop access to valuable API resources, the API economy is a non-starter.</p>
<p>I've been tracking on Blockspring for a while, <a href="http://theapistack.com/">and have been working with them to define machine readable API definitions in Swagger that they can use in their spreadsheet connector(s)</a>. However their site redesign really struck a chord with me when it comes to the API Evangelist mission, something I wanted to take a moment to share.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-icon.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>Bruno Pedro (<a href="/admin/blog/bpedro">@bpedro</a>) who has been building <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> into his <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com">API Changelog service</a>, made a pull request to the specification recently, pushing forward the link relation conversation for APIs.json. As listed in the specification, we have long intended to make APIs.json an official media type:</p>
<p><strong>3.5. &nbsp;Media Type</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is intended that if there is sufficient traction, the media type "application/apis+json" will be&nbsp;&nbsp; submitted to IANA as per RFC:&nbsp;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4288</p>
<p>However when it came to expressing your APIs.json as a link relation, we didn't even really have a plan in our road-map, resulting in a very generic allocation of a link relation for APIs.json.</p>
<p><strong>3.8. Link Relation</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In order for an API to reference its own description, it is recommended that it include header or in-line references to the APIs.json file using the existing described by link relation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[Note, this is a generic link relation but seems to fit the bill]</p>
<p>What Bruno is suggesting that we get a little more precise when it comes to our link relation, something the rest of the governing group for APIs.json agrees with. Here is the last update to the link relation:</p>
<p><strong>3.8. Link Relation&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In order for a Web site to reference its API description, it is recommended that it includes a header or&nbsp;&nbsp; in-line reference to the APIs.json resource using the api link relation, e.g.:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is intended that if there is sufficient traction, the link relation &ldquo;api&rdquo; will be&nbsp;&nbsp; submitted to IANA as per RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988</p>
<p>As with the media type, we intend to submit the link relation to Iana, per its RFC. Bruno's pull request sets in motion the formal link relation, but then also escalates the media type submission as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the interest and usage we have seen in the first year of the specification, we are confident the API discovery format will get traction. We are already seeing exploration around the link relation, achieving RSS like experience in the browsers, when visiting websites that have an active API program.</p>

<p>I have added a link relation to my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a href="/admin/blog/Kin Lane">Kin Lane</a>, and <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">Master API project</a>, all pointing to my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/apis.json">central APIs.json</a>, which provides an index of not just each of the APIs I use to operate the API Evangelist network, but also the supporting building blocks of API operations like pricing, support, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Bruno for the pull request, pushing out a minor release of the APIs.json spec, <a href="http://apisjson.org/format/apisjson_0.15.txt">moving us to&nbsp;0.15</a>. This release primes the pump, for a queue of APIs.json requests that are in the works, like more API property types, country origin, and much more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I open up my Thursdays to briefings, calls, demos and other phone,  skype, and hangout related activities. This morning I received a  walk-through of the <a href="http://justapis.com/">JustAPIs platform</a> from <a href="http://www.anypresence.com/">AnyPresence</a>, taking my thoughts in a much different direction than in my conversation with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/23/pushing-my-api-gateway-thoughts-forward-api-and-single-page-app-development-with-wavemaker/">Wavemaker, which was at the intersection of API design and API gateway in  this new cloud-based, single page application design studio</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>JustAPIs is a downloadable, installable, portable, little API design, deployment, and management engine, which you can install on Linux, Windows, Mac, and even your Raspberry Pi. This represent the functionality I have in mind, when I think about the future of what is an API gateway--a little node that can put <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYWHERE</span> to serve up, proxy, and manage my APis.</p>
<p>I downloaded JustAPis, ran at localhost, and begin mapping it to a handful of my remote APIs, and crafting a couple simple APIs to understand what is possible. Its obvious there is still a lot of work to be done, as the whole management side of JustAPIs is under construction, but I like what I see so far. I like the micro gateway characteristic. I think it has potential in not just the API economy, but specifically in the mobile, and IoT layers of the API economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/JustAPIs-Admin.png" alt="" width="75%" /></p>
<p>As with my Wavemaker discussion today, there are aspects of JustAPIs I'd like to see a become a reaility, in the realm of hypermedia, discovery with APIs.json, and portability, and interoperability using API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, but it is a great start. JustAPIs is a significant movement forward in the evolution my perception of just what is an API gateway, and after talking with the JustAPIs team, I am confident that because of the extensibility available in the solution, it will become a ubiquitous layer of the API economy.</p>
<p>JustAPIs dovetails nicely with other movements I'm watching in the API space around containerization, and software defined networking. When you have a lightweight gateway that you can launch anywhere, with the ability to launch existing API blueprints, as well as allow extensibility by other API driven services--the landscape will begin to shift quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a number of other stories, derived from my conversation with JustAPIs today, but I will save them for the future. I will keep playing with, and exploring the JustAPIs engine. Todays conversation with Wavemaker and JustAPIs has done wonders for my API gateway perspective, at a time where I'm open to possibilities, and determined to move the conversation forward.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wavemaker/wavemaker-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I open up my Thursdays to briefings, calls, demos and other phone, skype, and hangout related activities. This morning I received a walk-through of the <a href="https://www.wavemakeronline.com">Wavemaker Online platform</a>, and got a look at the intersection of API design and API gateway in this new cloud-based, single page application design studio.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/10/aws-is-selling-the-api-solution-the-enterprise-will-buy-not-necessarily-the-api-solution-they-need/">I bitched a little the other day about the Amazon API Gateway released, talking about how I was underwhelmed</a>, and I also <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/22/thoughts-on-api-gateway-deployment-over-artisan-farm-to-table-api-design-and-deployment/">blew some hot air about deploying APIs using a gateway solution vs. what I call farm to table API development</a>, but ultimately I'm just pushing myself to think harder about how we not just deploy our APIs, but keep in alignment with our design, and management processes. It was interesting that more than one call this Thursday are in alignment with this journey I find myself on--good timing Wavemaker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screenshot below from my WaveMaker Studio workspace tells an important story. This is API design, deployment, and management, all in the service of rapidly deploying a single page app client, via a single platform.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/gateway/">While Wavemarker has their own gateway solution as well</a>, the WaveMaker Online Studio has "gateway-esque"features in it, allowing me to design and deploy APIs in support of my single page application, and widget development.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wavemaker/WaveMaker-Studio.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Wavemaker speaks the common gateway speak I would say that your average application designer would need to speak, allowing you to craft APIs for your apps from other web APIs, SOAP, APIs, feeds, and databases (the common gateway building block). You just define each of the resources you depend on, and they are available in your toolbox.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wavemaker/WaveMaker-Studio-Web-Service.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I'm going to call this API gateway light(wish I had better word). This gateway is in the service of single page application development (which is another spect I like), and I'm assuming they could be part of your larger Wavemaker API strategy, but they might also never be used past this single implementation. With all of your newly configured, "gatewayed" resources in your toolbox, you can being crafting apps, widgets, visualizations, and other common API driven implementations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wavemaker/WaveMaker-Studio-3.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Ideally any application designer who was using the Wavemaker Studio to craft their APIs, would also have a wealth of internal API resources to depend on, who are managed by skilled API teams, but even if they don't, Wavemaker acts as an API gateway to existing internal infrastructure, as well as the wealth of public API resources available to us today. To me, API design solutions like Wavemaker are beginning to look like web design solutions of the last 10 years, but are applying gateway logic to help move beyond just data and document stores for sources, and going API-first.</p>
<p>This is just the start of API gateway discussions I am having with Wavemaker. They are going to schedule regular conversations with me, and the next one is specifically about their actual API gateway offering. While there are aspects of Wavemaker I think are slightly behind where API design is going (ie, <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">Hypermedia</a>, <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com">Swagger</a>, Postman, <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>), I think their approach to baking in common features of gateways into existing API, as well as app design workflows, is pushing the conversation forward.</p>
<p>Stay tuned as I keep gathering my thoughts on how to push the API gateway conversation forward, as well as learn more about Wavemaker.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Jul 2015</span>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/09/the-new-aws-api-gateway-anyone-who-does-not-do-this-will-be-fired-thank-you-have-a-nice-day--jeff-bezos/">I was wallowing in the exhaust of my previous story on Amazon API Gateway</a>, and talking with an API development team about their preferred way to launch an API today. Leaving me thinking...what is the better way to design, and deploy an API? Gateway or hand-crafted? &nbsp;Ok, cut to the chase, its a bullshit question, but for the sake of working through my own anxiety, I'm going to explore.</p>
<p>For my audience, I'm going to oversimplify what an API gateway is by stating it is a hardware and / or software appliance you can you use to connect to any existing, internal system like a database, CRM, or other, and then quickly and efficiently design, deploy and manage APIs driven by these resources.</p>
<p>Personally I am from the artisan, farm to table guild of API architects--I prefer to hand craft my APIs. Well OK, that is bullshit--I use an API framework, but I wire it up by hand to whatever is the original resource is (database, file-store, other API). This is just my style, and probably most aligned with the fact that I cannot afford any API gateway--something the release of Amazon API gateway has me thinking more about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My overall opinion of the gateways I've used is that they lack the amount of granular level control I desire--maybe this is just me. However this is something that is being re-examined for me because of the emergence latest cloud-based API service providers like <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">Restlet APISpark</a>, <a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/">Wavemaker</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/">DreamFactory</a>, <a href="https://www.apitite.net/">Apitite</a>--and AWS. Honestly I think Amazon will skew the concept of what is an API gateway with their new offering, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/10/aws-is-selling-the-api-solution-the-enterprise-will-buy-not-necessarily-the-api-solution-they-need/">they just took the name to sell it to the enterprise</a>.</p>
<p>I guess I didn't even have a real point to this story. I just wanted to talk to my API therapist about my own enterprise API gateway baggage and PTSD, and justify my hippie dippe, artisan approach to APIs. Sucka...I got you to listen!! In the end I think I support your API offering, by any name, as long as you help move the conversation forward, which I have to admit I think AWS is doing with their new AWS API Gateway offering--even though they used that name!!!</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/280px-Environmental_Protection_Agency_logo.svg.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I told a contact of mine at the Environmental Protection Agency I would provide some feedback for the next iteration of <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/services.html#uvindex">the Envirofacts Data Service API</a>, and as I prepare my formal response, there is a huge opportunity for me to carve off some other smaller stories. These stories are what make API Evangelist go around--pulling off these nuggets of learningz, as I'm working with API various providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A concept I work hard to help API designers and architect adopt is around <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/12/17/future-api-design-orchestration-layer/">experience-based API design over resource based API design</a>. Something I learned from my friend Daniel Jacobson (<a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>) at Netflix, but have been taking it in different directions to help designers and architects from smaller API groups, adopt this way of life--I feel like my work today on the Envirofacts Data Service API provide a great opportunity to move this conversation forward.</p>
<p>When you land on <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/services.html">the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API page</a>, you are given a single base URL to employ when "constructing a search" for the API:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/epa-envirofacts-api-base-url.gif" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Ok, not the best API design, a little confusing, but where do I find the list of possible values for every potential path variable? I scroll down and see some examples, but I have to read the opening paragraph again, before I find a link to the data model. Once I click on the text link, I'm faced with 20 separate "tables"--which in reality are 20 separate APIs, all housed under the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API. (who named this??)</p>
<p>This is resource based API design. You craft an API, that either resembles, or in this case is exactly named just like your database, and its fields. This type of API design, while very appealing to database administrators (DBA), but will leave any new API developer and potential "customer", pretty lost, left with having to work overtime just to understand what is possible. (you can do more work on my behalf)</p>
<p>I had no idea the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API had such a wealth of resources. The overall API landing page, and API design does not tell the story of the value that lies within. Anyways, I'm just embarking on the profiling of this API, and providing a formal review that the team can put to use in their efforts. I'm not trying to bash their work, just help demonstrate to other folks, what I mean when I say "resource based API design", furthering my work to help folks design APIs more focused how they'll be used, not just where they come from, only ticking the box on the task you were given--launch API.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/reddits-future-future-internet/">As I tune into the fallout around the Reddit community</a>, I think it is a good time to pull a story out of my notebook, that I began writing a month or two ago. These thoughts are born out of my post&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/09/ask-the-stack-when-you-need-api-support/">Ask The Stack When You Need API Support</a>, where my friend&nbsp;Jeremiah Lee (<a href="https://twitter.com/JeremiahLee">@JeremiahLee</a>) commented, disagreeing with my recommendation that API providers use Stack Exchange as part of operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeremiah shares his story about how hostile Stack Overflow can be (I'll let you read his comment on your own), something that has been re-enforced many times along the way. While I still endorse Stack Overflow as a valuable building block for some APIs, I completely agree with Jeremiah about the overall community tone. While Stack Overflow is definitely a different beast, it suffers from some of the similar systemic illnesses, that Reddit does. I find some very valuable information on Stack Overflow, which I use regularly, but if you are looking to develop an API community, I can envision the community potentially working against you, in several ways.</p>
<p>It really depends on your API, and the target audience you are trying to reach. Sometimes, the male dominated, "gamified community of meritocracy, where established members have many rules and politics", as Jermiah says, is exactly who you should be engaging, but you really need get to know the personae of your ideal customers, and decide on your own. For API Evangelist, both my storytelling, and the APIs I provide, I've long felt Stack Overflow is not my target audience.</p>
<p>Similar to Reddit, Hacker News, and DZone, I get very little value from these communities. While I do find nuggets of information at these places, I do not post my stories, and engage in conversations there, because the hostility that can come from these channels I have found outweighs any value they might bring in traffic. I seek a much wider audience, than the individuals who often dominate these tech hangouts.</p>
<p>I encourage you to think deeply about who you want to reach with your APIs, and while building your own community in your own wiki, forum, or other solution, might take a lot of time and work, it gives you greater control over the tone your forum takes--which might make the difference in attracting the right developer and business audience you seek.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-monetization-level.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have spent a lot of time thinking about API analytics. Understanding who is signing up to access API resources, and how they are putting those API resources to use, is one of the most valuable aspects of modern API management solutions in my opinion. The awareness derived from API operations that use analytics, can have the biggest impact on not just how you run your API, but how you craft your API products, tailor your monetization strategy, evolve your overall roadmap and company.</p>
<p><a href="http://wso2.com/library/webinars/2015/07/building-enterprise-awareness-with-api-analytics-in-the-api-economy/">API analytics was the topic of a webinar I conducted with WSO2, one of my partners, this morning</a>. I've been invested in WSO2 since they first contacted me for feedback on their then upcoming release of their <a href="http://wso2.com/api-management/try-it/">open source API management solution</a>. During this mornings webinar, I gave the basics on "why" API analytics during this mornings webinar, then sat back and listened to&nbsp;<a href="http://wso2.com/about/team/nuwan-dias/">Nuwan Dias</a>&nbsp;demonstrate the "how" of it.</p>
<p>First thing that caught my attention was the WSO2 predictive analytics, which is a concept I have to say I have never thought about, but will be pondering more around what this might mean (or not) to the business and politics of API operations. Another thing that caught my attention was an idea Nuwan shared during the QA, about API monetization at the API analytics layer--very interesting thought.</p>
<p>While the conversation is not as far as long as I'd hoped by 2015, the concept of using API analytics to help you craft your API monetization strategy is pretty well established. API providers like 3Scale and WSO2 have been helping API providers understand the value delivered via APIs, while also providing a framework for crafting service tiers, pricing, and manage usage and billing for API consumers--what Nuwan is thinking about, takes this up another level.</p>
<p>A generation 1.0 API monetization scenario might be an art gallery, who could have an API that feeds the gallery web or mobile app, and during the planning of their API they identified that they shouldn't charge for API access, because it just adds value to their overall business objective--get foot traffic in the door. So the more developers building their art gallery content, products, and services into other 3rd party apps and sites, the better. Maybe along the way the gallery might also choose to serve up high resolution, or interactive version of exhibits for a fee, adding another layer to their monetization strategy--this is a classic example of API monetization discussions I've seen in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>A generation 2.0 of this API monetization scenario, reflecting Nuwan's vision, could involve the Art gallery actually selling leads in real-time, to partner galleries, restaurants, and other businesses that their customers might also be interested in. To reference the WSO2 real-time API analytics example, you could craft a definition of what ideal scenario would look like, and when a user logs into the web or mobile app, matches the profile, the exhaust from the API usage could also be accessed via a higher level API crafted off of your API analytics API (head scratcher). Of course you'd want to design some sort of layer that would require users to opt-in so that they are aware that their data was being captured, and shared, but in theory that exhaust from a single users API transactions could provide a whole new API monetization opportunity.</p>
<p>I'm still thinking this through, but gen 1.0 is about identifying the value of the digital resources of the gallery including the physical locations, art inventory, artist details, etc. You try to establish ways of extracting direct, and indirect value from these digital assets, by making them available via an API. Indirect monetization would be about driving web and mobile usage, as well as in-person foot traffic, where direct monetization would be about selling high resolution images, or possibly virtual gallery experiences. A gen 2.0 API monetization conversation in this art gallery scenario would be about identifying specific personae of users and experiences via the web, mobile, or even device and sensor based APIs that could be targeted in real-time, triggering other secondary, API driven event and experiences.</p>
<p>This type of APIs for the meta layer of API operations seems like more of a partner level API composition layer. Meaning as an API provider you'd have access to these APIs, but as far as your community, you'd probably only extend these APIs to trusted partners, who you have an established relationship with. As I try to think through API monetization at this layer, I'm guessing partners would pay a flat fee, or maybe a per transaction fee depending on the amount of data shared, or perhaps based upon successful transaction or sale? IDK, just spitball'n.</p>
<p>This is just me thinking through a single hypothetical scenario to help grasp the potential here. It adds a new dimension to both the API analytics discussion, as well as the API monetization one. Lots to chew on, from the business and politics side of API operations. Would love to hear your thoughts...</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-design-guide.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">I recently went through my API design research</a>, updating and evolving it, to help me better understand changes in the API design space, while also sharing as much of the information as I can with my readers. <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html">One of the resources I include under my tools section are the increasing number of API design guides being published</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently I'm showcasing the API design guides for <a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">18F in the federal government</a>, <a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">Heroku</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/paypal/api-standards/blob/master/api-style-guide.md">PayPal</a>, then the other day my friend Holger Reinhardt (<a href="https://twitter.com/hlgr360">@hlgr360</a>), formerly of <a href="http://www.ca.com/us/default.aspx">CA Technologies</a>, now the CTO at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.haufe.de/">Haufe Group in Germany</a>, shared his teams API design guidie with me. The executive summary for the guide says it well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Purpose of this style guide is to gather a list of rules, best practices, resources and our way of creating REST APIs in Haufe Group. The style guide addresses API Designers, mostly developers and architects, who want to design an API. Intention is to ease the design process by providing helpful rules to create a successful API that your customers will love.</em></p>
<p>One thing I really like, is they also added "p<span>lease follow the guidelines but don't follow blindly! you can break the rules with justification". Overall the API design guide is full of very pragmatic API design theory, much of what I've heard before, but also emphasizes some very import, forward thinking aspects of modern web API as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The design guide leads with some very sound API wisdom:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>You should think of an API like a product. Indeed a Business API is a product.</li>
<li>Design your API with a customer, or at least with a customer in mind and Get Feedback.</li>
<li>Do not implement API Management (use existing services)</li>
<li>Every API MUST be described using a formal API description language</li>
<li>API clients MUST use a self-service API portal to get access to the API via an API Key</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, they do not miss a beat going into REST principles stating: "<span>All our REST APIs MUST support hypermedia." The way they lay out their API design best practices makes everything very accessible, leaving hypermedia seeming a very sensible practice, not a bleeding edge design theory. I'm going to try and go through each section and apply to my own internal API design practices, there are several things here I could do so much better, by following.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.haufe-lexware.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Logo_Haufe_Gruppe.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><span>I may even begin work on my own API design guide, based upon what I've learned from the&nbsp;Haufe Group, 18F, Heroku, Paypal, and others. Not that my version would be any better than the sources, but I'm feeling the process of parsing the work of others, and assembling into my own document will be a healthy journey all by itself. An API design guide is quickly becoming an essential building block for API providers of all shapes and sizes, and publishing it publicly via Github is becoming a badge of leadership and transparency for the rest of the API community.</span></p>

<p>All of my public web sites, research projects, API portals, and micro apps run on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, which means there is always a Github repository behind each website. I'd say 75% of my projects have a publicly available master repo, as well as a publicly available gh-pages repo. This approach to running public infrastructure, i feel does one important thing--it opens up all of my work for community contributions.</p>
<p>Beyond just accepting outside contributions, there are many other secondary effects to this way of operation. The first is that anyone can submit blog posts, pages, and any other data or content they desire. The second is that anyone can fix or correct anything you find across my network of sites and apps. Some of my favoritest grammar and spelling trolls in the world, have forked, and submitted pull requests to help edit my work. :-) &lt;3</p>
<p>I have had other grammar trolls who laugh at me when I suggest the fact that they can edit my work. I know that most of it is centered around insecurity in understanding Github, and Jekyll, but they also think it is ridiculous that I wouldn't polish my work, let alone ask others to do it for free. i mean c'mon!!</p>
<p>The API Evangelist network is an open workbench for the API space. I actively work here, to curate information, data, and content that is relevant to the space. If you see something missing, you can add it. If you see a typo, or grammar hiccup, you can correct. Remember the API space is yours too, and it is what we make it.</p>
<p>Thanks for your contributions--I depend on all of you to help me make sure API Evangelist is complete.&nbsp;</p>
