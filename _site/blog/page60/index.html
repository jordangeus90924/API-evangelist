        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/05/03/apis-help-deliver-on-early-visions-of-the-internet/">APIs Help Deliver on Early Visions of the Internet</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 May 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/internet-commerce.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As my professional career moved online during the years between 1995 and 2000, I had numerous visions about what the World Wide Web could do for businesses.  I think I shared these visions with millions of other individuals, fueling what we now know as the first Internet bubble.</p>
<p>I saw e-commerce driving entirely new businesses that could operate entirely online, and strengthen existing brick and mortar businesses allowing anyone to buy and sell goods and services from anywhere, instantly.</p>
<p>What we ended up with was still important, but the web 1.0 world was not quite as grand as I think some of us had envisioned.   <a title="E-Bay History of APIs" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">E-Bay</a>, <a title="Amazon History of APIs" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a> and Paypal definitely went further than many e-commerce platforms and service providers, and I firmly believe their embrace of web APIs was the reason for this.</p>
<p>While e-commerce has undeniably grown and evolved, other new concepts like social and cloud computing took center stage in creating an entirely new vision of the Internet, concepts we didn&rsquo;t even conceive in the early days of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Years later, driven by APIs, I think we are just now beginning to deliver on the early visions of commerce on the Internet.  <a title="E-commerce APIs like ElasticPath" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">E-commerce APIs like ElasticPath</a> are delivering on this vision by offering up a mature and robust <a title="e-commerce engine" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/products/features">e-commerce engine</a> completely accessible by a truly RESTful API.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elasticpath-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Using ElasticPath you can define and execute against any vision of commerce whether it involves physical or virtual goods, with any type of pricing, offers or subscriptions that enable purchasing of these products on truly any platform or any device, in a myriad of ways only limited by your imagination.</p>
<p>ElasticPath delivers by starting with a hardened and complete e-commerce engine that drives clients like Google and Sony, and proven by driving extreme online and offline commerce scenarios like the <a title="Vancouver Winter Olympics" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/company/news/2007/vancouver-2010-olympics">Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics</a>.  Next ElasticPath bundles a robust Level 3 REST API with the their e-commerce engine, providing not just programmatic access to every aspect of the e-commerce engine, but a hypermedia driven experience ensuring developers can deliver on the business logic and user experience defined by any company that deploys their e-commerce platform using ElasticPath.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elasticpath-api.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Level 3 REST also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State</a> (HATEOAS), it is an enhancement to REST, that enables a client to have no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.  So in the context of e-commerce, when a developer requests a product the API, you get back the usual JSON describing the product, but you also get supporting media types for these &ldquo;products&rdquo;, and supporting link relations.  So if purchasing the product means streaming in media player you will get media types as well as link to load into player, where if it is a product that you can add to shopping cart, you will get the link to add to cart, and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning about the technical details and benefits of HATEOAS REST, but i can see the benefits when bundled with ElasticPath&rsquo;s very mature e-commerce engine.  It allows you to not only build robust product catalogs that drive your website, but an e-commerce engine that can drive digital commerce across multiple platforms and devices, without developers having to fully understand the business rules and logic set forth by your company, leaving them to do what they do best, while ensuring your products, information and brand are reflected wherever your conducting e-commerce.</p>
<p>I guess e-commerce isn&rsquo;t the only vision of the Internet, but it definitely is a large part of it, and I think APIs have been fueling the growth of e-commerce since the first part of the last decade, and now with platforms like <a title="ElasticPath" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">ElasticPath</a> we will truly see this vision mature and allow us to sell physical and digital goods anywhere in the world, in real-time.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/reaching_out.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>The best thing about owning <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> is I get to write about whatever I want.  I have full editorial control, and because of my unique view on the API space I tend to write about APIs from three separate perspectives:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API Owner</li>
<li>API Service Provider</li>
<li>Developer</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the three main actors in the API game.  There are others, but these are the three viewpoints I write about the most.  I tend to rail on API owners a lot, and today I think I will rail on API developers.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m doing a lot of reaching out to my developers.  I personally email everyone who registers for CityGrid APIs.  Sure I use template emails, but I customize them and send the email one by one so I can <a title="profile my API developers" href="/2012/04/17/profiling-api-developers/index.php">profile my API developers</a> and understand what they are doing.</p>
<p>So far, my findings are that many developers don&rsquo;t have any sort of verifiable online persona, and even more don&rsquo;t bother responding when I email or tweet at them.  Its not my business to police the <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/">CityGrid APIs</a>, but I definitely apply a grade to every developer I look at, and make recommendations based upon this grade, where online persona and responsiveness are two big factors.</p>
<p>We hear a lot of developers (me included) complain about API owners not being responsive, but remember there is another side to the coin.  If you're using someone&rsquo;s API for FREE, and they take time out of their day to email you or tweet at you, it might be cool if you took 10 seconds to respond and say hello, and let them know you're an actual person.</p>
        <ul class="actions" style="text-align: center;">

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a title="deploying and managing APIs" href="http://www.3scale.net"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At most <a title="Hackathons" href="/events/">hackathons</a>, the end goal is building a web or mobile application, using various platforms and APIs.  Even though I&rsquo;ve seen this evolve to data visualization, or mashing up SaaS platforms at some events, the app really tends to be the primary deliverable at hackathons.</p>
<p>So this week I&rsquo;m spending time thinking of unique and interesting ways to present my sponsors for the <a title="CityGrid hackathon this weekend in Santa Monica" href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Hackathon this weekend in Santa Monica</a> at <a title="CoLoft" href="http://www.coloft.com/">CoLoft</a>.  One of our sponsors is <a title="3Scale API Service Provider" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, one of my favorite API service providers, and while we see many of the API service providers including <a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a> and <a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> involved in many of the hackathons you really don't see anything built using their platform. (I know they&rsquo;ll ping me and say they do, but really your building using their clients.)</p>
<p>So for the <a title="CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon" href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Los Angeles hackathon</a>, I want to encourage developers to come up with ideas for APIs, develop the API and using 3Scale, deploy the building block that are essential that enable other developers to build on top of the API.</p>
<p>Not only do we need more, high value APIs, we need developers to be fluent in not just developing and deploying mobile and web apps, developers need to be fluent in designing, developing, <a title="deploying and managing APIs" href="http://www.3scale.net">deploying and managing APIs</a>.</p>
<p>So if you have a great API idea and are in the Los Angeles area this weekend, come down to the CoLoft in Santa Monica and form a team and build your API, and deploy it using 3Scale, and you just might have a chance at winning $5,000.00 for your API.</p>

<p>One of my self-appointed roles in the API industry is to shed light on, and discuss the business of APIs when many other API owners and evangelists tend to keep their strategy and business closer to their chest.</p>
<p>Many API owners don&rsquo;t discuss their roadmaps, either because they feel they will be giving away their secret sauce, or quite possibly because they don&rsquo;t have a clue where they are going with it.  I think it&rsquo;s more the latter, as we are all making this shit up as we go along.</p>
<p>One subject you don&rsquo;t hear API owners discuss often, is when their API will be deprecated or shuttered, leaving developers and tech bloggers to speculate on the subject.  Because of this you tend to hear just the extreme views on the subject.  Popular perspectives on API life-span tends to be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs Are Forever - Once you put an API, you have to support it forever</li>
<li>APIs Can Go Away Anytime - There is no stability whatsoever when it comes to APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written on this subject several times including <a href="/2012/04/09/what-happens-to-instagram-api-developers-after-facebook-acquisition/">What Happens to Instagram API Developers After Facebook Acquisition</a> and <a href="/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">Building Your Business Around Google or Any Other APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Even with my stance on the subject I fall prey to the hype sometimes.  I saw the post from Google today called <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2012/04/changes-to-deprecation-policies-and-api.html">Changes to deprecation policies and API spring cleaning</a>, and I immediately thought oh no, here we go again.  After reading deeper I realized they are updating their API deprecation policy for many popular APIs.  As they state:</p>
<blockquote><em>The new policy simply states that we will strive to provide one year notice before making breaking changes.</em></blockquote>
<p>Google is setting a clear window, for which they will make sure and give developers a heads up before deprecating an API.  This allows you to know that you can count on an API being around, until you hear otherwise, and then, you still have a year to figure out what you are going to do.</p>
<p>I know this is something other API owners do, but it rarely is something you hear any news about, giving the API extremists free range to use page view grabbing headlines about <a href="/2012/03/30/why-tech-bloggers-suck-and-not-apis/">APIs owners being no better than satan, and eat their developers for dinner</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to work on a more formal post about API deprecation policies, and how API owners can put them to use, setting better expectations around API life cycles.</p>

<p>One of the essential ingredients of a successful API, is a self-service area to support your API developers.  In my opinion this is a no-brainer.  You have to have registration, documentation, code samples, forum and other <a title="essential building blocks" href="/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential API building blocks</a> available to developers in a self-service way--so they can engage with your API 24/7 without asking for access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked hard to make sure the CityGrid API area has a logical navigation, taking developers to the essential information they will need to learn about and integrate with the APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

<p>I keep a regular flow of information going through the blog to make sure there is excellent SEO content, so developers can search for anything at Google, and the blog will support linking to whats relevant in the <a title="CityGrid Developer Center" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid Developer Center</a>.</p>
<p>Even with all of this, I still get some pretty basic questions like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>I need PHP code samples?</strong> - Immediately available on the code samples page.</li>
<li><strong>What does the API cost?</strong> -  Says that it is FREE on Getting Started and FAQ.</li>
<li><strong>Can I save your data in my database? </strong>- Says it on the Usage Requirements</li>
<li><strong>Do I have to show your logo?</strong> - Says it on the Usage Requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/building%20blocks.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>That is just the tip of the iceberg.   I&rsquo;ve posed this question before...<a title="Are there enough doers to make this whole API vision work?" href="/2012/02/13/are-there-enough-doers-for-this-api-vision-to-work/">are there enough doers in the world to make this whole API vision work?</a> It&rsquo;s hard to tell if its just my view, while in the pit of despair, or if it is just the way it is.</p>
<p>It seems like there will always be some users who need hand holding, and they refuse to read the self-service material available in the API area.  When I&rsquo;m hacking on an API, I always make sure I search exhaustively before I ask a question, but I&rsquo;m discovering a new breed of developers who won&rsquo;t search, won&rsquo;t ask questions--then when you reach out to them they&rsquo;ll ask for what they need, no matter how basic.</p>
<p>It seems, that self-service API resources are essential, but there will always be a segment of our audience who aren&rsquo;t quite doers, they need more hand-holding and information presented to them before they get what they need.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/developer-profiling.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>For the last couple weeks I&rsquo;m neck deep in getting to know the developers who already use the <a title="CityGrid Developers" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a>.  I want a better understanding of who a developer is, what kind of business they have and what they are looking to get out of the API.</p>
<p>To find this out I start out profiling them socially using <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>&nbsp;(which I plan on automating using the&nbsp;<a title="Full Contact API" href="http://www.fullcontact.com/">Full Contact API</a> as soon as I have more time) for the following information:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twitter Profile</li>
<li>LinkedIn Account</li>
<li>Facebook Profile</li>
<li>Google + Profile</li>
<li>Github Profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually I know the URL of their website, but if I don&rsquo;t, I can extract from their email address or sometimes Rapportive will provide for me. I visit each developer&rsquo;s site and look for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blog w/ RSS Feed</li>
<li>Business Contact Email </li>
<li>Business Contact Form</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I build a quick one sentence description, telling me who they are and what they do.  I also assemble a comma separated list of keyword and key phrases that best represent what they do.</p>
<p>Before I&rsquo;m done looking around their site I take a picture of their home page, so I have a visual reference to go with the developer profile. The home page image can go further than just a logo sometimes.</p>

<p>I take all of this information, put it into a database, and connected it to a JQuery Carousel that allows me to watch a slideshow that walks me through the world of my developers, and watch like a TV channel.</p>
<p>This process not only gives me a 100K understanding my developer ecosystem, but helps me remember as much as I can about each developer.  From this I hope to better engage them on a daily basis as well as provide feedback to the CityGrid API roadmap based upon quality API developer segmentation.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/citygrid-la-hackathon/citygrid-los-angeles.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently planning a 9 city hackathon tour, starting with the <a href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon</a>, and following up with Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, NYC, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Austin.</p>
<p>The CityGrid Hackathon tour is meant to bring together commercial and civic hackers to build the next generation of apps we use in our everyday "local" lives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find a blend of developers, business, marketing and advertising folks that will come together and develop commercially viable ideas that can also make our cities better places to live.</p>
<p>So I'm looking for sponsors that really enhance the local theme of the event, so I started with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Local API Stack" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/tag/stack/">Local API Stack</a></strong> - These are APIs that I track on for CityGrid, providing direct value to local mobile and web app developers.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mobile Back-end as a Service Providers" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup/">Mobile Back-end as a Service</a></strong> - Service providers that exclusively provide back-end platforms and tools for mobile developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy if all of these companies could provide the sponsorships that I need to support the event, but it probably won&rsquo;t be enough.  So I&rsquo;m looking elsewhere with some of the usual suspects like Amazon Web Services, Rackspace and Twilio.</p>
<p>Regardless of what my sponsor line-up looks like I think I will still provide a directory of local APIs for developers to use, so that they have a robust listing of high quality APIs to choose from when building their local web and mobile apps.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2012</span>
        <p>When I was a tech blogger for <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a> and API-related news broke, we writers would often shudder. &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t use API in the headline,&rdquo; the argument in the newsroom went. It&rsquo;s the page-view-kiss-of-death. That&rsquo;s not because APIs aren&rsquo;t super-important or super-ubiquitous on the Web (they are both). It&rsquo;s because most &ldquo;<a href="http://cdixon.org/2010/01/22/techies-and-normals/">normals</a>&rdquo; don&rsquo;t know what they are or why they matter. They&rsquo;d rather click on a story that says &ldquo;101 Ways to Use Pinterest to Plan Your Wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision to cover APIs regularly on ReadWriteWeb and eschew stories that fall into the &ldquo;[Number] Ways to Use [Hot New Social Media Tool] to [Conduct a Seasonally-Relevant Activity]&rdquo; goes a long way to explain the popularity of RWW versus that of Mashable, incidentally.</p>
<p>Also incidentally: Pinterest <a href="http://tijn.bo.lt/pinterest-api">has an API</a>.</p>
<p>This all presents a bit of a challenge, of course, if I want to make an argument for my readers here about why APIs really matter in education. Do I frame the argument for &ldquo;normals&rdquo;? (Wait! HA! &ldquo;Normals&rdquo; don&rsquo;t read Hack Education!) Do I frame it for educators? Entrepreneurs? Technologists? The answer: hopefully all of the above.</p>
<h2 id="whatisanapi">What is an API?</h2>
<p>API stands for &ldquo;Application Programming Interface.&rdquo; At its most basic level, an API allows one app to talk to another app. It&rsquo;s the way in which Web and mobile technologies can open up their data and their software&rsquo;s functionality to others. It&rsquo;s how Zynga integrates its games with your Facebook profile. It&rsquo;s how websites handle accepting payments via Paypal and play YouTube videos. It&rsquo;s how Instagram can share your photos to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Tumblr.</p>
<p>Rather than having to export a file from one system, then import it into another, APIs allow programs to &ldquo;make calls,&rdquo; sending and receiving just the information they need just when they need it. Web APIs (also known as REST APIs) do this &ndash; well obviously &ndash; via the Web using the protocols of the Web (HTTP). But instead of returning HTML like a website does when you &ldquo;call&rdquo; it, Web APIs return XML or JSON &ndash; that is, machine-readable data that other apps and websites can make us of.</p>
<p>But enough with the tech&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="whydoesthismatterineducation">Why does this matter in education?</h2>
<p>Educational data is <a href="/2012/04/11/download-all-your-education-data-with-the-click-of-one-button/">stuck in silos</a>, something fostered by educational software &ndash; administrative and instructional &ndash; that makes it cumbersome at best and impossible at worst to move data in and out of systems. As a result, there&rsquo;s lots of extra clerical work that educators and administrators have to do &ndash; recreating rosters, copying grades, downloading CSVs, copying-and-pasting, and so on. All because educational apps and software do not, as a rule, talk to one another.</p>
<p>Student Information Systems don&rsquo;t know which level of Angry Birds students are on. (Um hello, don&rsquo;t laugh: <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/04/another-gravitational-experiment-in-angry-birds-space/">Angry Birds is science</a>!) A better example, perhaps: a school&rsquo;s SIS might not talk to the district&rsquo;s database or the state&rsquo;s records system. Parents probably don&rsquo;t get an automatic SMS when there&rsquo;s an attendance issue or library book due. Learning management systems don&rsquo;t automatically capture what or how far students have read in their e-readers or what they&rsquo;ve annotated.</p>
<p>These functionalities (and lots more) are possible when there are APIs, opening the door to all sorts of <em>real-time</em> connections between products, services, and systems that are currently impossible due to time constraints, burdensome download and data entry processes, and vendors who&rsquo;d prefer to maintain data lock-in.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/darcy_modified.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="wherearetheeduapis">Where are the EDU APIs?</h2>
<p>The absence of APIs from a lot of education applications, I&rsquo;d argue, is a good indication that we&rsquo;re still dealing in many cases with pre-Web era technologies (or at least a pre-Web era mindframe). Student information systems. Learning management systems. Educational software for your desktop computer. All pre-Web. And even newer versions of these older systems often carry forward this legacy of a world without Web (or hell, even Internet) connectivity.</p>
<p>APIs played a crucial part in the explosion of Web technologies. E-commerce. Social networking. Cloud computing. Now mobile computing. All facilitated by APIs. APIs have enabled companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Twitter to become <em>platforms</em>, allowing other developers to build on top of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Platforms&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t necessarily something we talk about in education, although they do exist and are being developed <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/10/13/the-race-to-platform-education/">with increasing frequency</a>. Google Apps for Education is certainly an example of one. <a href="http://edmodo.com">Edmodo</a> is attempting to carve a similar path, and with the release its API last month, I described the startup as making the move &ldquo;<a href="/2012/03/06/edmodo-makes-the-move-from-social-network-to-education-platform/">from social network to education platform</a>.&rdquo; Edmodo&rsquo;s and Google&rsquo;s APIs allows other companies &ndash; <a href="http://mathalicious.com">Mathalicious</a>, <a href="http://desmos.com">Desmos</a>, <a href="http://aviary.com">Aviary</a>, for example &ndash; to connect their apps to these platforms, tapping into rosters, roles, feeds, assignments, calendars, documents and so on.</p>
<p>The LMS could be a platform too, I suppose &ndash; <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/">and with APIs, that&rsquo;s the direction it could go</a>. But what&rsquo;s interesting to me is that, with their origins in a pre Web 2.0 world, LMSes have devised a separate standard to offer connections to external modules &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/">LTI</a>,&rdquo; not API. Is there widespread interest among third-party developers to integrate with LMSes via LTI? (To make the process simpler, <a href="https://lti-examples.heroku.com/index.html">Instructure co-founder Brian Whitmer has created a site</a> with examples and code samples.) Or will the pervasiveness of Web APIs mean that developers' interest goes elsewhere?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m veering dangerously back into the technical realm here &ndash; the type of discussions that, as I started this post, tend to make &ldquo;normals&rdquo; not read and not care about APIs.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re incredibly important, why we should pay attention to them in education, and why I recommend having an API is something you should look for in the tools you adopt: APIs make data accessible. APIs foster interoperability. APIs extend functionality. And APIs create an ecosystem -- of technology, of developers, of users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We want that for ed-tech, don't we?</p>

<p>I was going to write this story when I got an email from <a title="Qwerly" href="http://qwerly.com/letter.html">Qwerly after they got acquired by Fliptop</a>, then after <a href="http://urbanairship.com/blog/2012/01/12/update-on-our-plan-to-integrate-location-and-context-services-into-our-push-messaging-platform/">SimpleGeo was acquired by Urban Airship</a>, then when I got the email from <a href="http://blog.indextank.com/1221/indextank-linkedin-acquires-indextank/">LinkedIn announcing they were shutting down IndexTank</a>.  Four acquisitions later, I&rsquo;m finally making time today after the announcement of <a title="Facebook Acquiring Instagram" href="http://tmblr.co/ZMPd3xJMuYI9">Facebook acquiring Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>So, what will happen to Instagram API developers, now that Instagram is owned by Facebook?  We don&rsquo;t know.  It <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/04/09/facebook-probably-wont-kill-the-instagram-api/">sounds like Facebook will keep Instagram in tact</a>, but who knows where it will go from here, where founder Kevin Systrom will take it, or Facebook will step in and make changes.</p>
<p>If your like <a title="Postagram" href="http://postagramapp.com/">Postagram</a>, you&rsquo;ve already diversified beyond the Instagram API and acknowledged that you need to offer more than what you can build off a single API provider.  We&rsquo;ve hear the cry of many developers when Twitter poaches from its ecosystem, <a title="Google decide to shutter Google Translate" href="/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">Google decided to shutter Google Translate</a>, then quickly <a href="/2011/08/25/paid-version-of-google-translate-api/">decided to offer paid version</a>--it doesn&rsquo;t matter who your API provider is, nobody is immune from acquisition or their API service being shuttered.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask the question about Instagram API developers before the API haters, jump in and blame the API.  Its not about the API, its about the API owners acknowledging their API ecosystem exists, and its developers, and whether or not they have a solid business strategy that includes having multiple suppliers for their content and products.</p>
<p>Hopefully you are a developer that understands the APIs you use to power your web or mobile application are potential vendors that could stay around for the next 10 years, or they could go away tomorrow with the next billion dollar acquisition--and with the right business strategy, maybe you could walk away with $400 Million, with your 40% equity, when your killer app is acquired.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/04/04/hacker-storytelling/">Hacker Storytelling</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/ada-the-enchantress-of-numbers.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/ada-the-enchantress-of-numbers.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A big part of API evangelism, is storytelling.  Storytelling about the API, the value it delivers, and the solutions it provides.  Through my own hacking on an API, engaging with developers via email, a forum and social media, I gather ideas for projects that would help evangelize an API, while also educating users of how it works.</p>
<p>One example is a recurring question I get from <a title="CityGrid API Developers" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API developers</a>--how does CityGrid compare with other places APIs like Google Places and Yelp?</p>
<p>I set out to answer this question, quickly realizing it was easier said than done.  I found 11 places APIs that fit my criteria, and they had many differences, so I started by writing a quick <a title="overview of the 11 places apis" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/overview-of-11-places-data-apis/">overview of the 11 places APIs</a>.  This helped me identify and quickly understand what each places API delivered.</p>
<p>Then I realized that I needed to actually hack on each API to truly understand how they work, and develop enough of an understanding where I could compare them in detail.  To do this, I needed a project, to use as a anchor for my storytelling.  Not just one blog post, but many, with code samples and starter kits to help support the project.</p>
<p>I chose to build an <a title="Interactive Places API Comparison Tool" href="http://places-comparison-v1.hyp3rl0cal.com/index.php">Interactive Places API Comparison Tool.</a></p>
<p><a title="Interactive Places API Comparison Tool" href="http://places-comparison-v1.hyp3rl0cal.com/index.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CityGrid-Google-Yelp-1024x189.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>As a start, I chose 3 places APIs to compare:  <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid</a>, <a title="Google" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/">Google</a> and <a title="Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview">Yelp</a>.  The Interactive Places API Comparison Tool provides a what and where textual search as well as a latitude and longitude search, simultaneously across the 3 APIs.</p>
<p>Once I built the first prototype I <a href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/interactive-places-api-comparison-for-citygrid-google-and-yelp/">blogged about the comparison tool for the first time</a>, as well as some of the research that went into it, like <a title="places api comparison" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/interactive-places-api-comparison-for-citygrid-google-and-yelp/">Places API request format comparison</a>--talking about how CityGrid, Google and Yelp each tailored their API requests.</p>
<p>Today I finished a report to support the what and where search and one for the latitude and longitude search.  The report shows what was searched for, how many listings were pulled from each API and number of images, offers, reviews and tips for each place returned.  I will be adding other reporting items in the future.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve produced a lot of quality content from this hacker storytelling project:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>5 Blog Posts</li>
<li>Interactive API Comparison Web Application</li>
<li>Code Samples for Searching and Pulling Places Detail for 3 APIs</li>
<li>Code Libraries for Each of the 3 APIs</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/Hyp3rL0cal-Interactive-Places-API-Comparison-Tool-Listing.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>All blog posts are syndicated out to Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook as well as bookmarked at Reddit, StumbleUpon and Hacker News.  All code samples live as Github Gists so I can embed in blog posts and other places, while code libraries live as Github repositories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to post a bew blog post about the Interactive Places API Comparison reports I just finished, and will be adding Factual and Foursquare to the list of APIs that are compared as part of the tool.  This will give me probably four or five more blog stories in the next couple days.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell where the project will go after that.  The good hacker storytelling projects just keep living and producing blog posts, code samples, code libraries and starter kits.  But there will always be new ideas for projects and stories when I engage with developers within the API community and on the open Internet.</p>

<p>While assembling the building blocks for a successful API ecosystem, one of the requests I get from developers is for tools to help them build successful integrations with existing platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, Facebook and Salesforce.</p>
<p>Some of the requests I get are from non-developers who just want a plug and play tool, they can deploy without needing to write code--but many of the requests are for white label, starter kits that developers can use to quickly deploy API driven applications on popular platforms like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Wordpress" href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a></li>
<li><a title="Drupal" href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a></li>
<li><a title="Facebook" href="http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a title="Salesforce" href="http://developer.force.com/">Salesforce</a></li>
<li><a title="Joomla" href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert in any of these platforms, but I find the more I dive into developing on these platforms, the more I learn and the more I discover other experts who really understand the ins and outs of building plugins and add-ons for 3rd party systems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to building code samples, code libraries and generic start kits for your API, you may want to take a look at building white label, 3rd party platform plugins and add-ons your developers can use to quickly integrate your API into existing networks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the very least, you will learn a lot.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-api.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I read a post over at <a title="Cloud Ave" href="http://www.cloudave.com/">Cloud Ave</a> today by Martijn Linssen, <a title="Why API&rsquo;s suck, and what they lack" href="http://www.cloudave.com/18470/why-apis-suck-and-what-they-lack/">Why API&rsquo;s suck, and what they lack</a>. &nbsp;I'll start by saying, everything he says about APIs, can be true for some APIs, but the post has more to do with the state of tech blogging, than anything to do with APIs.</p>
<p>To Linssen's points:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>First of all, API&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t open</strong> - True many APIs use this term, without it being true.  But those of in the industry who get it, call these "public" APIs and have stopped using the term "open".  Open has been used by a few bad marketing seeds, and perpetuated by the blogosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Second of all, API&rsquo;s are for free, mostly, and no uptime is guaranteed -</strong> What? Really?  Maybe the 10 you've tried don't, but many of the APIs I depend on do.  Just to name a few:&nbsp;<a title="Google Maps" href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/earthmaps/maps_sla.html">Google Maps</a>,&nbsp;<a title="WebServius" href="http://www.webservius.com/corp/sla.html">WebServius</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Datasift" href="http://datasift.com/terms/sla">Datasift</a>,&nbsp;<a title="http://zencoder.com/sla/" href="http://zencoder.com/sla/">Zencoder</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Amazon EC2" href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2-sla/Amazon S3">Amazon EC2</a>, <a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3-sla/">Amazon S3</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Third, API&rsquo;s are badly documented, if any </strong>- Sure this can be a problem, and is something everyone is working on. This doesn't point to APIs sucking, more the documentation. &nbsp;Can you point me to the documentation you&rsquo;ve maintained?  Its&rsquo; not as easy as it looks.  And there are plenty of shining examples of how do you do it right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok those are your points?  And you went to <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> and looked at 10 APIs?  And you came to the conclusion all APIs suck?  I've spent hundreds of hours looking through ALL of the APIs in the ProgrammableWeb directory, and yes there is a lot of shit in there.  But there are some really amazing examples of the API vision, that you seem to be bothered by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you hacked on <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>?  Twilio rocks!  Have you used <a title="Stripe" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>?  Seen the forwarding thinking e-commerce APIs <a title="ElasticPath" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">ElasticPath</a> is working on? Have you hacked on any of the 97+ Google APIs lately?  They have come a really long way in pulling together their interfaces, standardizing documentation, making legal easier to use, and standardizing what is free and what is billing.</p>
<p>Linssen seems caught up on the fact that all APIs are some sort of social bullshit.  I counter with the fact that the last 5 years of Internet growth has been build on the back of Amazon Web Services, via APIs.  When I started using both EC2 and S3, it was all APIs, there were no interfaces.  I&rsquo;ve deployed, scaled and supported global infrastructure with millions of dollars running through those APIs, personally.</p>
<p>My recommendation to Linssen is he spend more time hacking on APIs, and look at the playing field a little more before you professionally blog on the subject.  But that brings me back to my title, and the fact that his blog post is about page views, and not about APIs, which represents the state of tech blogosphere and not APIs.</p>
<p>I just went over to Techmeme and look at the top 10 stories, and I decided that all tech bloggers suck and I'll stop reading tech blogs all together.  Actually no..I'll keep doing what I do with all tech blogs, evaluate them one by one and unsubscribe when they stop offering value. Much like you should do with APIs.</p>

<p>The largest portion of my time as API Evangelist is spent keeping the area around an API active.  Your developer&rsquo;s first impression when they enter your API area is critical, and if they see signs that your API is inactive, they might start looking elsewhere.</p>
<p>The most common ways I keep an API active is by:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Tweeting w/ Twitter Feature in API Area</li>
<li>Forum Posts</li>
<li>How-Tos</li>
<li>Starter Projects</li>
<li>Developer Showcase</li>
</ul>
<p>By actively posting content in these areas w/ timestamps showing when they were posted, I keep the API area looking like someone is home.</p>
<p>This active content doesn&rsquo;t just help developers visiting the site feel like the API is active, it also helps your SEO. Search engines and social networks will regularly index your content, providing fresh traffic, and potentially new developers to your API.</p>
<p>Just a couple hours a day, generating fresh content and engaging with your developers goes a long ways in attracting new developers and making them feel confident that your API is a priority, and they should integrate it into their applications.</p>

<p>With all the attention sexism in silicon valley has gotten, I wanted to make sure and showcase some positive news on the Hackathon front this week.</p>
<p>There was a great article in the Oregonian out of Portland called, "<a title="Intel 'Code for Good' hackathon helps nonprofits solve technology challenges" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2012/03/intel_code_for_good_hackathon.html">Intel 'Code for Good' hackathon helps nonprofits solve technology challenges</a>".</p>
<p>The theme for the hackathon: <strong>Girls in education</strong></p>
<p>Code for Good co-organizer Josh Bancroft worked with co-organizer Renee Kuriyan and employees in Intel's corporate affairs group to help four nonprofit organizations, <a href="http://www.worldpulse.com/">World Pulse</a>, a Portland-based nonprofit; <a href="http://www.roomtoread.org/">Room to Read</a>; <a href="http://10x10act.org/">10X10: Educate Girls Change the World</a>; and <a href="http://www.campaignforeducation.org/">Global Campaign for Education</a>.</p>
<p>"I felt like we could amplify the impact" by software and corporate working together, Bancroft said. The partnerships were already established by corporate affairs, and the software group simply brought the technical expertise.</p>
<p>Their task was to create software solutions to real-world problems facing girls in education, and for each team to develop an app by the end of the day that the nonprofits could then put to use. The hackathon theme is part of <a href="http://www.intel.com/shewill">Intel's "She Will"</a> campaign and with the company's overarching mission to "create and extend computing technology to connect and enrich the lives of every person on Earth."</p>
<p>You can read more about the great hackathon over at <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2012/03/intel_code_for_good_hackathon.html">Oregon Live</a>.&nbsp;I just wanted to point out that not all hackathons are male dominated, and the model can go much further than some of what we see coming out of Silicon Valley.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/linkedin/linkedin-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Every Monday I generate a list of all new API developer who registered for the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid&nbsp;API</a>&nbsp;the week before.  This list has the name and email address for each developer, and I manually go down the list, and email them individually, letting them know I&rsquo;m here to help.</p>
<p>As I email each new API developer I use <a href="/2012/01/23/engaging-my-api-developers-immediately-with-rapportive/">Rapportive to identify more information about them</a>, such as their website URL, Twitter and LinkedIn profile.  If a developer has a Twitter or LinkedIn profile, I engage them on those networks.</p>
<p>After 3 months of doing this, I&rsquo;ve noticed that developers who work for larger companies have LinkedIn profiles and developers who either are freelance, own or work with a smaller development shop tend to have Twitter.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-logo-puffy-border.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>It makes sense.  Twitter is a more public forum, and smaller companies tend to need to market their skills and services and actively engage the world around them.  While established companies tend to keep their developers in a more closed environment, suitable for the business social network LinkedIn.</p>
<p>This type of information helps me segment my API developer audience into various groups allowing me to craft blog posts, announcements and share other information with them on appropriate channels.  I&rsquo;m not a big fan of emailing, so being able to push out information regularly on LinkedIn and Twitter, and engage with users that are active on these networks, works very well for supporting my approach to API developer support.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-hackathon.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time trying to track on what gets created at <a title="hackathons" href="/events/">hackathons</a>. &nbsp;Some innovative programming occurs at these events and I&rsquo;d say 98% of it is forgotten by Monday morning.</p>
<p>I think a lot of attention is given to the myth that hackathons are about building startups.  When in reality, how many startups come out of hackathons?  In my opinion the top three things that come out of a hackathon are:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Marketing</strong> - For the event organizer, sponsors and for participants. </li>
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition</strong> - There is some seriously talented folks attending hackathons. </li>
<li><strong>Networking</strong> - Hackathons are a great place to meet people, network, make friends and sure maybe a co-founder. </li>
</ol>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Beyond that I think there is a lot of code that gets generated at hackathons, that really never goes anywhere.  Much of this code is not immediately VC fundable, but still some of it is really good.  And I see a lot of kids spending whole weekends writing the same or similar code as I saw the weekend before.</p>
<p>To help remedy this, I suggest that event organizers use&nbsp;<a title="Github" href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png">Github</a>.  Just like every <a href="/2012/01/08/hashtag-for-your-hackathon/">hackathon organizer should identify a Twitter #hashtag</a> for the event, you should setup a Github organization and add your hackers as users.  Encourage them to commit their code through-out the hackathon, and wrap up the weekend with a nice README file of their project.</p>
<p>Seems like a great way to showcase what was built over the weekend, make the intellectual property open and accessible for other people to use, and make it easier for other hackathon participants to build off what has already been created in the past.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2012</span>
        <p>Boston API Jam organizer Sqoot just got themselves into a lot of hot water with some very sexist comments on their hackathon home page (now removed):</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/boston-api-jam.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>From what I can tell, Sqoot was called out by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/BoazSender">@BoazSender</a>:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/Sqoot-Boaz-Sender-.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>Then the pressure quickly was put on in the Twittershpere:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/sqoot-jacobian.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>Resulting in Apigee pulling their sponsorship:</p>

<p>And Heroku pulling theirs as well:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/sqoot-heroku.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tCdfaMOC2xmx9LFsn7At_34uabeqjqaB4mbNjj1j4N8/preview?pli=1&amp;sle=true">Sqoot quickly released an "apology"</a> which included:</p>
<blockquote><em>"While we thought this was a fun, harmless comment poking fun at the fact that hack-a-thons are typically male-dominated, others were offended."</em></blockquote>
<p>Their "apology" definitely summarizes the misogynistic tone of the spreading Silicon Valley startup and hackathon culture.</p>
<p>This is a major problem.  One of my biggest complaints about many hackathons is that they are male dominated, and this is nothing to joke about, make fun of or take lightly.  You don&rsquo;t realize it when all you do is attend the all boy hackathons and do your bro-gramming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to hackathons where there are equal sexes, and they are awesome-- way more fun, and truly work to solve real life problems, not perceived problems.</p>
<p>I hope other blogs will publicize this, and make other hackathon organizers aware so this kind of shit doesn&rsquo;t not only go away, but we start working the other direction and making sure <strong>EVERYONE</strong> feels welcome at hackathons.</p>

<p>My recommendation to API owners is to always have a blog, however one the most damaging things you can do is stop posting to your blog.  A blog is a key variable in my <a title="API Stack Algorithm" href="/2012/03/15/qualifying-for-the-api-stack/">API Stack algorithm</a>, of whether or not an API is worth integrating with, and if you haven&rsquo;t updated your blog anytime in the last year, I immediately step away.</p>
<p>If you want people to find your API, have a blog.  If you want your existing developers to be educated about what can be done with your API, have blog.  If you want developers who find your API, to feel confident enough to integrate it into their app, keep you blog updated!</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.geoiq.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/geoiq/geoiq-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through hundreds of APIs and curating a list of APIs, for what I&rsquo;m calling the API Stack. &nbsp;The API Stack consists of APIs that provide clear value for developers and have demonstrated real investment in their API, and are in it for long haul.</p>
<p>There are quite a few things I consider when looking at an API, here are a few:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Value</strong> - The API offers clear value to developers, without needing an explanation.</li>
<li><strong>Web API</strong> - They don&rsquo;t have to be 100% REST, but web APIs make developers lives easier.</li>
<li><strong>Active Blog w/ RSS</strong> - A blog is a quick way to see what is behind the curtain of an API.  If they care enough to have a blog, and communicate with developers, and keep it active it demonstrates they care.  With an RSS feed I can programmatically understand whether they are active or not.</li>
<li><strong>Active Forum w/ RSS</strong> - A forum gives developers a voice and also shows an API owner cares what developers thinks, and is willing to support a large community.  An active forum is a positive sign of an API, and the RSS feed also gives me a programmatic way to assess.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active Twitter presence is a pretty key metric in understanding the value of an API.  If the company has the resources to actively engage developers via Twitter, they care.  And again I can programmatically monitor and see if someone exists behind the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other metrics I use, but these are proving to be the most positive characteristics of an API that developers can depend on.  Many APIs I come across don&rsquo;t even meet these basic requirements.  What triggered this post, was I had just looked at about 10 APIs that did not meet these basic requirements, and then I came across one that clearly met all of these, and more--<a href="http://www.geoiq.com/">GeoIQ</a>.</p>
<p>GeoIQ has a mapping API that provides clear value to developers, and its obvious they are investing the necessary resources, so the API is successful.  So I&rsquo;m adding GeoIQ to my API stack under the category of &ldquo;local&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you feel your API is a good fit for the API stack, make sure and ping me.</p>

<p>Social Data Analyzing API <a title="Knodes" href="http://knod.es/">Knodes</a> has just announced a $250K startup fund that will invest in the best products, websites and applications built on top of the Knodes API platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://knod.es/hot/dev">Knodes Social Data Analyzing API</a> provides developers with social data-based insights about their users across social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>With the launch of the Fund, the Knodes team is hoping to bring awareness to their API and jumpstart a new ecosystem of developers, businesses and campaigns whose next generation social applications will be powered by its API.</p>
<p><a href="http://knod.es/hot/fund">The Knodes Fund</a> which is in partnership with <a title="Quotidian Ventures" href="http://quotidianventures.com/">Quotidian Ventures</a>, will take the best websites, web and mobile applications and give them the resources they need to be successful, including up to $25,000 in equity funding, mentorship and access to new features and social intelligence available via the Social Data Analyzing API.</p>
<p>The Knodes Fund is open to all individuals and companies building an application, website or program using the Knodes API.  Applications can be submitted at Knod.es beginning May 1, 2012, and the deadline to apply for the Knodes Fund is June 1, 2012.</p>

<p><a href="http://se.linkedin.com/in/andreaskrohn">Andreas Krohn</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://twitter.com/andreaskrohn">@andreaskrohn</a>)&nbsp;first saw the potential of APIs when he in 2005 started working with enterprise web scraping solutions at <a href="http://kapowsoftware.com/">Kapow Technologies</a> (now Kapow Software). Conceptualizing the web as one big database and creating APIs to get to that data is not that different from the REST APIs used today. When leaving Kapow to start his own <a href="http://dopter.se">company</a> it was a given that the focus would be on APIs and open data.</p>
<p>Andreas API work is focused in Sweden where he regularly speaks at conferences. Mostly he focuses on the non-technical side of APIs since APIs are doomed to fail without a good business strategy and long term marketing plan. The ones that really need to understand the potential of APIs are the business people and then focusing on the money instead of technology is the way forward. He is also providing consulting services customers regarding API strategies and technologiesone such project he has been active in is <a href="http://trafiklab.se">Trafiklab</a> which is a portal for Swedish public transport APIs. The goal of the project is to collect Swedish travel related APIs in one place with consistent documentation, API-key handling and support to make them as attractive to developers as possible.</p>
<p>He writes about APIs on Swedens leading API blog <a href="http://www.mashup.se">Mashup.se</a> and has done so for several years. The focus of Mashup.se is international API news as well as highlighting local Swedish APIs. To increase the use of Swedish APIs he has recently launched the <a href="http://www.mashup.se/apikatalog">Swedish API directory</a> listing over 200 Swedish APIs. Not much compared to the 5000+ APIs listed on <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>, but a lot for a small country where the wave of APIs are just getting started. The development of APIs in Sweden is currently lead by government agencies and agencies due to European Union directives but Andreas hopes that showing the available private APIs will lead to a wider use of APIs and more private companies developing APIs.</p>

</p>
<p>
     <em>This post comes from the <a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a> newsletter.  I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.</em>
</p>
<p>
     People are constantly trying to come up with tools to make API documentation an easier task. If you are documenting an SDK built for C++, C#, or Java, there are tools such as Doxygen, Sandcastle, and JavaDocs to take comments from the code and automatically generate documentation from them. Why aren't there tools like this for REST APIs?
</p>
<p>
     The beauty of Web APIs is that they can be written in whatever language you like and in whatever manner you like. As long as when an HTTP request comes in, the proper HTTP response goes out, it doesn't matter how it actually happens on the server. But this very flexibility makes automated documentation nearly impossible, since there's no standard mapping between what an API request is and what the code is that generates its response.
</p>
<p>
     Nonetheless, there are some solutions out there to this problem. I need to start by saying that there are in fact two approaches to automation that are used to document REST APIs. One is similar to the tools I mentioned above, where comments are taken from code to generate the documentation. The other involves having the documentation separate from the code, but in a data format (such as JSON) that can be parsed and used to generate the documentation.
</p>
<p>
     I also should mention that documentation automation does not guarantee good documentation. Before choosing to to incorporate automation into your process, I recommend reading an excellent article by Dana Fujikawa: <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/t/" target="_blank">What to Consider Before Considering Auto-Generated Documentation</a>.
</p>
<h3>
     Automated Documentation from Code
</h3>
<p>
     There's no off-the-shelf tool that pulls documentation comments out of code that's going to work for all REST APIs. But there are two possible solutions:
</p>
<ol class="manliest">
     <li>Use a framework that both generates the APIs and the documentation
     </li>
     <li>Create methods with a one-to-one mapping with API requests.
     </li>
</ol>
<p>
     <strong>Framework.</strong> A good example of a REST API framework is <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/i/" target="_blank">Enunciate</a>. Enunciate is an open-source Java-based Web API framework. It creates full HTML documentation of the services it generates, where the documentation is assembled from JavaDocs comments.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>Mapping.</strong> Mapping requires some disciplined practices, but has the advantage that it can be used with any technology. In this case, you need to create public methods that map directly to API requests. So, for example, you might have an API request to get a brief user profile for a user with an ID of 23423 with a call like this:
</p>
<p>
     <code>GET <a href="http://api.example.com/users/23423/profile?type=brief" target="_blank">http://api.example.com/users/23423/profile?type=brief</a></code>
</p>
<p>
     When this request comes in, you need to structure your code so that it calls a method by the name of something like:
</p>
<p>
     <code>public get_users__id__profile(int id, string profile_type)</code>
</p>
<p>
     Note that the <code>id</code> is surrounded by double underlines, indicating that it is not literally the text "id".
</p>
<p>
     This method would then have comments that could be picked up by automated tool, such as JavaDoc, RDoc, or Sandcastle, and HTML documentation would be generated. Then you would need to run the HTML documentation through an automated process that would remove unnecessary information (such as class names), and convert the method names, replacing single underlines with slashes and double underlines with slashes and brackets so that
</p>
<p>
     <code>public get_users__id__profile</code>
</p>
<p>
     would become
</p>
<p>
     <code>GET /users/{id}/profile</code>
</p>
<p>
     The parameters table would also need some modification so that it's clear which parameters are part of the URL and which are query parameters.
</p>
<p>
     It's not a simple process, but I have seen it done successfully using Ruby code and <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/d/" target="_blank">RDoc</a>.
</p>
<h3>
     Automated Documentation from Structured Data
</h3>
<p>
     The advantage of taking comments from code is that if there are changes in the code, the comments are more likely to be updated. However, a simpler and very flexible solution is to have the documentation in structured data (JSON or XML), and then have an automated process create the actual HTML documentation from it. There are a several tools that will do this, merging documentation with an ability to try out the REST calls, which is extremely handy. Here are some examples.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/h/" target="_blank">Swagger</a>. Swagger is a tool created by Worknik that creates very nice looking API documentation with the ability to easily try any API request. You specify a resource discovery URL which returns JSON with information about the various REST resources, then for each resource, you specify the type of operation, the path, the potential errors, and the response. Although you are limited in how long your descriptions can be, it creates a very nice documentation system for straight-forward APIs.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/k/" target="_blank">I/O Docs</a>. I/O Docs is a tool created by <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/u/" target="_blank">Mashery</a> that is very similar to Swagger. The big difference is that it is open source. Written in JavaScript, the source is available on github, which means that you can taylor it to your own needs, as well as look-and-feel.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>Create your own</strong>. If neither of these tools are flexible enough for your API, you can create your own. A beautiful implementation that I had the priviledge to work on was created by <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/o/" target="_blank">Tendril</a>. Take a look at an example API request at <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/b/" target="_blank">Cost and Consumption for a Single Device</a>. You can see how you can try it out on the first tab, but then other tabs list parameters, response, and notes. By creating their own system, they were able to document a fairly complex API call which would not have worked with an off-the-shelf system.
</p>
<h3>
     Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
     Automated REST API documentation can be used to:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Keep the documentation near the code so that it's easier to update.
     </li>
     <li>Allow developers to try out of the API requests as part of the documentation.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Although it is impossible to have a tool that automatically generates REST API documentation from any code, there are a number of approaches that will let you autogenerate the documentation, including:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Using a framework that generates both the API code and its documentation.
     </li>
     <li>Creating a mapping between methods and API requests and using standard documentation tools.
     </li>
     <li>Writing documentation as structured data and generating HTML from it.
     </li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for new, relevant ideas to write blog posts on for the <a title="CityGrid Developer Blog" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/">CityGrid Developer blog</a>.  I have several topics I write about regularly including new projects I&rsquo;m working on, new releases around the API, and what I find during my local, mobile and social landscape analysis.</p>
<p>However it can be hard to find topics to write about that are relevant to CityGrid developers, or publishers as we call them.  To help write blog posts that are useful to my API community I started harvesting ideas and topics from actual forum posts from developers.</p>
<p>Earlier today a publisher submitted a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/citygrid-dev-talk/6x4j2g5Mqso">forum post stating their concerns about the age of some of the reviews</a> they get along with businesses, when making requests against the <a title="CityGrid Places API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">CityGrid Places API</a>.  It was an easy question to answer, since CityGrid also provides a <a title="business reviews API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">business reviews API</a>, that will give you more control how you can pull reviews for a zip code, neighborhood or specific business.</p>
<p>Using the topic that was posted on the forum I was easily able to <a title="create a quick blog post" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/more-control-over-citygrid-review-api-requests/">create a quick blog</a> post framing the question and providing a detailed answer explaining how the CityGrid Reviews API provides a solution.</p>
<p>Now CityGrid publishers can potentially be exposed to this solution via the blog, RSS feed and since I actively syndicate my blog posts, they will see it if they follow CityGrid on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and also using a search engine.</p>
<p>When evangelizing for an API, I feel it is important to try and provide as helpful content as you can via an active blog presence, while also reverberating it across the multitude of channels your developers might be listening on--turning relevant forum posts into stories is a great way to do this.</p>

        <p>Since starting as <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> here at <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a>, I have been asked a couple of times how we stack up against other places APIs. So I went through the 11 other places APIs, gathering info, in an attempt to see what each offered.</p>

     <a title="Foursquare API" href="https://developer.foursquare.com"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/foursquare/foursquare_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I am going through the <a title="Foursquare API" href="https://developer.foursquare.com">Foursquare API</a>, and found their section about how to get an increase in the number of calls you can make against the Foursquare API interesting:
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <em>If your application runs into any of our rate limits and you think you could use more, write us at api@foursquare.com. We'llneed your OAuth consumer id, an explanation about why you need an increased cap, and information about the following</em> 
</p>
<ul class="c3">
     <li>
          <em><strong>Usage</strong>: A description of the endpoints you're calling and how you're using the data retrieved. We use this to make sure you're abiding by our <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/api/platformpolicy">Platform Policies</a> and <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Sample requests are generally helpful.</em>
     </li>
     <li>
          <em><strong>Attribution</strong>: Screenshots of your application so we can confirm you're <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/attribution.html">attributing</a> foursquare correctly.</em>
     </li>
     <li>
          <em><strong>Caching</strong>: Cache venue details where appropriate to avoid making spurious requests to our servers. See theRetention section of our <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/api/platformpolicy">Platform Policies</a> for more details.</em>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I like the idea of rewarding developers with the ability to make more calls against your API, when they adhere to your terms of service and benefit your operations.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/02/26/what-is-api-evangelist/">What is API Evangelist?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2012</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Evangelist.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     <strong><a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a></strong> has grown beyond being just a research blog. It is time for me to update the <a title="about us page" href="/about.php">about us page</a>, and its time for me to tell the story of what is "API Evangelist", and how I view my role in the API industry.
</p>
<p>
     API Evangelist started in July 2010. I was burning out in my job as VP of Technology for an events management company that managed events for SAP and Google. I was looking for a way to re-invent myself, doing something that I enjoyed, but also keep me employed for the next 5 years or more. I was looking for something that I was knowledeable about, would be around for a few years. I quickly identified web APIs as this focus.
</p>
<p>
     Web APIs had been a big part of my career since the early 2000’s. I’ve designed and consumed a lot of APIs, and they were the glue in a platform I built for my web development company Original Web Solutions, which I ran from 2000 through 2008.  But I also saw web APIs as vital, but quiet player in the growth of the Internet:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Social</strong> - Web APIs grew up along with social platforms like Flickr, Delicous, Twitter and Facebook.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Cloud</strong> - Web APIs came of age, with proving they could deploy IT infrastructure via Amazon Web Services, and are the power driving Paas and Saas.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Mobile</strong> - Web APIs are becoming ubiquitous with the growth of iOS, Android, Blackbery and Windows mobile phone usage.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     This locked it in for me. APIs were not only growing, they were going to be around for a while. So I started API Evangelist, and began researching the space, looking for a way that I could make not only a career, I could also make an impact.
</p>
<p>
     I set out, researching the space. I evaluated over 200 of the top web APIs, and wanted to understand their approach, why they were successful (or not), and who were movers and shakers in the space. I quickly saw that there were plenty of technical pundits or <span><em>RESTafarians</em></span>, who had strong opinions on technically how to deploy your APIs, but there very few people addressing the business side of API deployment and management.
</p>
<p>
     This was my angle. I would focus on the <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">business of APIs</a>, and study the approach, and building blocks that were used by successful API owners. By the end of 2010, I had my focus, and in 2011 I spent a lot of time getting to know the space, and the key players in the API industry. I met influencers such as John Musser(<a title="John Musser" href="https://twitter.com/#!/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>) of <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>, Daniel Jacobson(<a title="Daniel Jacobson" href="https://twitter.com/#!/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>) of Netflix, Steven Willmott(<a title="Steve Willmott" href="https://twitter.com/#!/njyx">@njyx</a>) of <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net/">3Scale</a> and Sam Ramji(<a title="Sam Ramji" href="https://twitter.com/#!/sramji">@sramji</a>) of <a title="Apigee" href="http://apigee.com/">Apigee</a>.
</p>
<p>
     Throughout 2011 I developed my voice and approach to the space by blogging on <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> and API Evangelist and being the API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a>. In 2012 I feel this has moved beyond research and out of the PHD period, after 2 years exclusively focusing on the space, i feel like its a full-time career now. My role is <span class="c2">not</span> as "API Guru" as many people are quick to say, I see it as "API Luminary". All I do is shine light on what other really smart people are doing in the space, and thanks to my girlfriend Audrey Watters (<a title="Audrey Watters" href="https://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), I’m learning to shine the light by telling stories. Stories about the power of web APIs, and how they are transforming businesses and entire industries.
</p>
<p>
     This is my story of how I became the API Evangelist. Though I have worked to build a brand around the title, I’m not the only one out there. With the growth of APIs, there are many more API evangelist, developer evangelist and developer advocates popping up. I want to help give them a platform for telling their story of how they got where they are, and their vision of the API Industry.
</p>
<p>
     Here are a few of those stories:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Garrett Willkin - API Evangelist" href="/garrett_wilkin_api_evangelist.php">Garrett Wilkin - API Evangelist</a></strong>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     If you are an aPI evangelist, developer evangelist or developer advocate, and would like to share your story, email me at <a title="info@apievangelist.com " href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a> and I’ll publish your story here.
</p>
<p>
     This blog is no longer just about me, its grown larger than that. Its become about the power of change by using web APIs, the people who are implementing that change, and the businesses and industries that are being transformed.

        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>When new users sign up for the <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid API</a>, I immediately get an email with their name, email and phone number, which are required for registration.  The API is self-service, and I rely on the <a title="essential building blocks" href="/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential building blocks</a> I&rsquo;ve assembled as part of the API area to support them in their first hours and days of integration.</p>
<p>Five days after registration, if a publishers has not reached out to the CityGrid API team, or show any usage on the API, I reach out to them via email, asking if there is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYTHING</span></strong> I can do to make their integration successful.  I do not send an email blast, I email them one by one, and as I do this, <a title="I use rapportive in Gmail to identify if they have a twitter, linkedin or google+ account" href="/2012/01/23/engaging-my-api-developers-immediately-with-rapportive/">I use Rapportive in my Gmail to identify if they have a Twitter, Google+ or LinkedIn</a> account.  I then send a personal email, and follow them on their social networks and research their business web site, if they have one.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/LinkedIn.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say about 65% of my API users that are responsive, reply and tell me they are planning on integrating and just need more time or are waiting for the development resources to free up and then they&rsquo;ll tackle integration.  These are perfect candidates for social media, and because they are responsive they tend to follow me back on Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+.  Since I keep my social networks active on a daily basis, hopefully they&rsquo;ll see regular, informative posts from me, demonstrating not only is there a person behind the curtain at the CityGrid API, that I am actually investing in their success.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-plus/google_plus.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></p>
<p>New registrations are only one of my API success metrics.  My ultimate goal is to have them actively consuming the <a title="Places API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">Places</a>, <a title="Reviews API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">Reviews</a> and <a title="Offers API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Offers+API">Offers</a> API and making money using <a title="CityGrid Mobile and Web Advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">CityGrid Mobile and Web Advertising</a> and <a title="Places that Pay" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+that+Pay">Places that Pay</a>. &nbsp;To&nbsp;convert users from new to active users, I have to stay engaged with them, and I couldn&rsquo;t do this without the use of social media.</p>

<p>He feels passionately about the opportunities for collaboration and innovation that are being produced through the API trend of recent years. &nbsp;He recently attended and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/11/09/i-fell-into-a-burning-ring-of-fire-at-music-hackday/">participated in the hacking at Music Hack Day</a>&nbsp;in Boston. Having been inspired by the electric, creative energy at this event, he&rsquo;s seeking further engagement with the wider hacking community.</p>
<p>As a writer for ProgrammableWeb since March 2011 Garrett has written&nbsp;<a href="http://programmableweb.com/profile/garrettwilkin">more than 100 articles</a>&nbsp;on APIs and the strategies behind them. Because of their shared passion for creativity and innovation, he enjoys engaging the technical and business leadership from these companies in discussing their niche in the API space.</p>
<p>His latest web technology project seeks to use Twilio to bridge the technology gap in rural communities where many people lack familiarity with or access to the web. &nbsp;Seeing value in the wisdom and cultural perspectives of these people who do not participate in our digital age, he hopes to use the old fashioned phone to facilitate their involvement.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Feb 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/api-craft"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/API-Craft-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>I'm a member of a Google group called <a title="API Craft" href="http://groups.google.com/group/api-craft">API Craft</a>.  There are some really smart API folks talking about everything from API deployment to API business strategies there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The other day someone in the groups asked:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>How does someone measure success in developing and deploying a public&ndash;facing Web API?</strong></em></blockquote>
<p>Scott Regan (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/scottregan">@scottregan</a>) of <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a> gave a great response, and I wanted to share with everyone here.  Scott&rsquo;s suggestions for measurements were:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - For public APIs, could be affiliate program revenue, ad revenue, or if incremental traffic from apps to the website has a known monetization rate</li>
<li><strong>Reach</strong> -  Incremental new user accounts or unique users</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships</strong> - Number of new partnerships established around your API</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong> - The number of new apps developed using your API</li>
<li><strong>Traffic</strong> - Apply percentage of incremental traffic ("our API channel is now X% of total internet traffic")</li>
<li><strong>Brand</strong> - Measuring increased 'brand', but only if the company has an really established way to do this</li>
</ul>
<p>Scott goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><em>When it comes to business metric tracking one thing i've seen work well is when the  API team publishes a 'dashboard'  widely and regularly -   tracking actual results to estimates  -   because it helps PM focus the roadmap on what moves the business needle as agreed and avoid getting the team pulled in different directions.</em></blockquote>
<p>Each API could potentially have different success factors depending on the type of API or the goals of a company.  But revenue, reach, partnerships, apps, traffic and increased brand awareness are good places to start. &nbsp;Thanks Scott.</p>

<p>I first wrote about <a title="interactive API documentation with Posterous's new API area" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/deploying-smarter-api-documentation/">interactive API documentation with Posterous&rsquo;s new API area</a> in June 2011, then the follow-up when&nbsp;<a title="Mashery deploying their own version called I/O docs" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/26/mashery-delivers-smarter-api-documentation/">Mashery deployed their own version called I/O Docs</a> in July 2011.</p>
<p>Smart, interactive or I/O API documentation is an evolution of API documentation from static and often boring documentation, to more interactive and real-time experience, allowing you to make live calls against an API while also browsing the documentation that explains how it operates.</p>
<p>Peter Gruenbaum of <a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">SDK Bridge</a> has surveyed and done exhaustive research on <a title="what developers say about API documentation" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/20/what-developers-say-about-api-documentation/">what developers say about API documentation</a> and <a title="web api documentation best practices" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">web API documentation best practices</a>, proving that up to date, and complete documentation can be very successful in helping developers get up and running using an API.</p>
<p>The <a title="API Service Provider" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API Service Provider</a>, <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a> has stepped up with their own interactive API documentation for users of their platform using <a title="Swagger" href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>, an open-source framework that lets developers learn, play, test and debug each element of an API in real-time.</p>
<p>There are 3 main benefits for API owners coming from adopting <a title="Swagger" href="/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">Swagger</a>:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Automated, consistent generation of clean, beautiful, interactive API documentation</li>
<li>Generation of client code and SDK in Scala, Java, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, and Actionscript 3</li>
<li>Feeding into an industry wide API discovery language that both developers and non-developers can use</li>
</ul>
<p>While many companies are providing <a title="API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/api_explorer.php">API explorers</a> for their developers to make live calls against their APIs, I think interactive documentation holds more value in educating developers about APIs, while also allowing them to make real-time calls.  My feeling is that this makes some tough concepts stickier while trying to understand and integrate with an API.</p>
<p>Visit the <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a> site for more information on using their <a title="API management platform for deploying interactive documentation" href="http://www.3scale.net/2012/01/24/interactive-api-documentation-the-new-api-console-for-developers/">API management platform for deploying interactive documentation</a>, using Swagger, for your APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> &nbsp;I have consulted with 3Scale on industry strategy several times.</p>

<p>Much of the work I get as an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> starts with a review of an API area.  I have evolved a way to look at API areas, and identify which building blocks are present or missing, all contributing to the success or failure of an API.</p>
<p>I started evolved this methodology in summer of 2012 when I was first building API Evangelist, by reviewing over 250+ of the top APIs out there.  I generated a list of the common building blocks used by APIs, as well as identified a bunch of innovative and less commonly used <a title="Building Blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">building blocks</a>.</p>
<p>When I first started working with <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a> I reviewed their API area, which contained the following building blocks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Dashboard" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">API Dashboard</a></li>
<li>Documentation for <a title="content api documentation" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Content+by+CityGrid">Content</a> and <a title="advertising API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">Advertising</a> APIs</li>

<p>I have a list of what I consider <a title="essential api building blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">essential API area building blocks</a>, and most of them are represented here, but there were a couple missing.  So today I added 3 more areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Getting Started" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Getting+Started">Getting Started</a></li>
<li><a title="publisher overview" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Publisher+Overview">Publisher Overview</a></li>
<li><a title="FAQ" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/FAQ">FAQ</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An API has to have a getting started page as well as a place for frequently asked questions.  Developers have to find the information they need to go from evaluation to integration without asking for help.</p>
<p>The publisher overview page is unique.  It covers the different business tiers of developers, or as we call them at CityGrid, publishers.  Even though these tiers are unique to how we approach things at CityGrid, they are <a title="four potential levels of an api ecosystem" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">four potential levels of an API ecosystem</a>, that other API owners can employ.</p>
<p>The CityGrid API area is not up to par 100% by the standards I preach here on API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m working on a new code samples page which has PHP, Python, Ruby code samples and starter kits--which I will publish this week at some point.  But overall the <a title="CityGrid API community" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid API community</a> contains the essential building blocks I feel are necessary to build an ecosystem, and I&rsquo;m working on finding out what else my developers will need to be successful and put them in my roadmap.</p>

<p>I am an eternal optimist, especially when it comes to APIs.  I really feel that <a title="APIs can decouple business assets and resources" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/12/25/apis-can-decouple-business-information-and-resources/">APIs can decouple businesses assets and resources</a>, making these companies much more efficient.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen the power of the API when it comes to companies like Twitter, Twilio, Facebook and many others.  But to build something on top of an API, you have to be a do-er.</p>
<p>A do-er is a term invented by Jeff Lawson (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jeffiel">@jeffiel</a>) of Twilio:</p>
<blockquote><em><a title="Do-er" href="http://www.twilio.com/doers">Do-er </a>(n): A particularly driven individual, esp. a developer, who picks up their tools and builds something special.</em></blockquote>
<p>Do-ers are a fundamental ingredient in API ecosystems, and when I go to many conferences and walk by booths I see a fundamentally different process of holding peoples hands and showing them what they need to know.  I also see many companies relying on this process to even make money.</p>
<p>So I have to ask--are we creating enough do-ers? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very optimistic about the future of API growth, but I do worry sometimes about there being enough doers to make APIs continue to grow.  Many individuals are so used to the regular sales cycle and corporate training, they don&rsquo;t seem equipped to find solutions to their problems on their own.</p>
<p>Are you a do-er? &nbsp;Do you think there are enough do-ers out there?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/02/07/lets-remake-libraries-as-hacker-spaces-and-community-innovation-centers/">Let's Remake Libraries as Hacker Spaces and Community Innovation Centers</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2012</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Library-NYC.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     I was reading several stories yesterday about the <a href="http://kalw.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/post/goodbye-state-funding-california-libraries">State of California cutting funding for libraries across the state</a>. These kind of budget cuts really make me worry for the future of our children and our communities.
</p>
<p>
     I say it is time that we all come together and figure out a way to re-invent our libraries, and one possible way forward is to remake our local libraries as hacker space.
</p>
<p>
     Here are a few ideas I had today about this:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Dedicated Hacker Spaces</strong> - Each community could have a space to have hackathons that could be used for locally driven events as well as a place for out of town organizers to throw events.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Hackathon Model</strong> - Libraries could adopt a hackathon model for throwing small or large events in any area, allowing kids and adults to organize and participate in hackathons in any topic area.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Sponsorship</strong> - Bring in sponsors much like we do for hackathons, allowing tech and other companies to invest in single or ongoing hackathon efforts at libraries in the markets and subject areas that matter to them most.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Revenue Opportunities</strong> - These sponsorship opportunities would allow libraries to create new ways to fund their operations based upon the corporate sponsors that reflect the type of space libraries want to create.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Mentorship</strong> - Allow anyone to become a hacker mentor in any subject, allowing them to share expertise and knowledge with others in their community.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Resources</strong> - Libraries could provide access to computers, Internet connectivity, data repositories, code repositories, APIs, software and other resources that are essential to hackers.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Community Innovation</strong> - These new library hacker spaces could be centers for community innovation to occur, bringing in outside ideas, and circulating new ideas within existing community leaders.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Incubation</strong> - Library hacker spaces could be centers of business incubation, providing a rich and fertile environment for ideas to take root and find the resources and talent they need to actually become businesses, creating desperately needed jobs in communities.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I’m not sure entirely of the reasons why libraries are not a funding priority in this country, at a time when we are more than happy to fund wars, prisons and other areas that do not enrich our communities.  The whole thing just boggles my mind, and leaves me very concerned.
</p>
<p>
     Times are changing, and I’m sure this has something to do with it--regardless ibraries need to find new ways to stay relevant in this digitial age within their communities, and the tech community needs to step in and help.
</p>
<p>
     I think the hackathon model could provide a very positive way to remake our libraries into innovation centers within our communities, turning anyone into a potential hacker and mentor in the subject area they are most skilled and passionate about.
</p>
<p>
     I’d love to hear other ideas, about how we can do this, and I’ll work them into my future stories as well as my hackathon schedule as I travel around the country.

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/kaia-at-trojan-hack-2.JPG" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I brought my 11 year old daughter Kaia, to the <a title="Trojan Hack" href="http://trojanhack.co/">Trojan Hack</a> at USC Friday night and Saturday, which was a new experience for her. I wouldn&rsquo;t say she is on a track to be a hacker like her dad, but she does have a Chromebook, iPhone and is pretty technologically literate.</p>
<p>She has asked me a couple times about teaching her how to build a game, or some sort of fashion web site.  She has her own Wordpress blog and even went and setup her own Wordpress.com account to blog about Harry Potter without my help.</p>
<p>I asked her if she found any of the projects that were being built at the hackathon interesting--she said no, except the Wolves with Friends video game.  Then she said, &ldquo;maybe if there were more girl hackers, the projects would be more interesting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Kaia is at a very important age, where I think she can be influenced or turned off in many different ways, and within a variety of subjects.  I don&rsquo;t want to push my hacker ways on her, but I want to influence her as much as I possibly can--and leave the decisions up to her.</p>
<p>When I go to hackathons with Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) and my daughter I can&rsquo;t help but see it through their eyes--where not only the programming challenges are intimidating, but a room full of boys are a big turn off.  Something that isn&rsquo;t apparent to me, when I go by myself as hacker white guy.</p>
<p>One of things I&rsquo;ve noticed at various places I&rsquo;ve worked is that the tone of the workplace, the focus of projects, and the overall energy is different when there are more girls on teams.  This is something that is very apparent working at <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a>, not just the diversity of the workplace, but that there are many female managers and team leads, which sets a very positive tone for the company.</p>
<p>We <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HAVE</strong></span> to begin to have more discussion about how do we evolve the face of hackathons to include a more diverse range of problem owners, including making sure women and girls feel much more comfortable, and are a much larger presence at hackathons.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2012</span>

     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/nationl-park-ranger.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     I've been having a lot of discussions with folks around the country about how to make money from data. There is a lot of data being pushed out there from federal, state and city governments, as well as from private companies and individuals--without much evidence of revenue.
</p>
<p>
     At this point there seems to be money in acquiring, processing, storing an deriving meaning out of the data, but not much money in actually selling access directly to the data. Through portals like <a href="http://opendata.socrata.com/">opendata.socrata.com</a> we are seeing more government agencies and cities publish their data, and after talking with the guys from Socrata last week, their focus is on helping more agencies get their data up, not metering or building business models around the data. 
</p>
<p>
     Socrata has some great tools, that let developers customize how they want to access the data, and use in their applications, but there really are no mechanisms that allow data owners to make money from their data. Granted this is public data, so it should be publicly available for anyone to access and use. However there are costs associated with acquiring, processing and making this data available for download and via APIs.
</p>
<p>
     I've had discussions with several data evangelist about how government could maximize their efforts around data in the virtual space and even charge for it under certain circumstances, allowing them to generate revenue to cover operational costs as well as fund more data projects.
</p>
<p>
     If you think about it the government does this with public domain in the physical space. Cities and National Parks are free and open spaces for anyone to use, but once you begin looking to use these spaces for commercial use, you are required to apply for permits, and often pay fees and revenue share for access to these spaces and facilities. Why shouldn't this same thinking be applied to the virtual public domain?
</p>
<p>
     Don't get me wrong. I'm not a huge fan of having to pay for accessing public data at first thought, but if the data is still open for me to access, play with and use in a non-commercial setting, and I only start paying once I use for commercial purposes, it starts to make sense. It seems like the government could come up with a data licensing model that allows this type of free, limited usage, then paid commercial usage with some sort of attribution and contribute back when data is cleaned and enhanced.
</p>
<p>
     Obviously this model would require a lot more discussion, but if we could not just fund the operations of government data marketplaces, but also finance the acquisition and generation of new, high quality data--not only would our government be in a better position, I think businesses and the public would reap the benefits as well.

        <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2012</span>

     <a title="Developer Connect" href="http://developer.mashery.com/devconnect"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashery/Mashery-Developer-Connect.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     One of the biggest areas around APIs I think needs attention in 2012 is more tools that focus on developers. There are plenty API services and tools focusing on API owners, but we need to start making sure developers are taken care of.
</p>
<p>
     So its nice to see the Mashery’s new <a title="Developer Connect" href="http://developer.mashery.com/devconnect">Developer Connect</a>, which matches developers with companies looking for specific API development skills. Mashery partnered with <a title="Elance" href="https://www.elance.com/php/landing/main/login.php?crypted=cGVyc2lzaWQ9Mzg5ODQ5OTMx">Elance</a> to develop the API skill matchmaking service, powered by Elance’s huge network of professional technical talent.
</p>
<p>
     There are plenty of developers out there who have polished their skills working with specific APIs, either on production, or hobby development projects, and would love to find freelance work, and make some money of their talent.
</p>
<p>
     On the flip-side, there are plenty of companies looking to build web and mobile applications that use one or many APIs, and would prefer to contract with developers who already have experience with those APIs.
</p>
<p>
     Its a win-win situation for developers, API owners and companies looking to build on top of APIs. I think it is also a sign that the API space is really maturing. With platforms like Mashery’s Developer Connect, powered by Elance, developers may now be able to make a good living specializing in API development.
</p>
<p>
     Its a great idea, I wish I had come up with it! Oh wait. I did!! In fall of 2010, and pitched it to Elance, after pitching the idea, I even built a <a title="Elance Developer Area Prootype" href="http://elance.apievangelist.com/index.php">Elance Developer Area prototype</a>, and did a <a title="four part series on the potential" href="/2011/02/28/plug-and-play-api-developer-area-with-elance/">four part series on the potential</a>.
</p>
<p>
     I actually don’t have a problem with this, I thoroughly enjoy my ideas getting used, rather than sitting on the back burner. What did piss me off, is when I was offered the exclusive by Elance after they actually built their version...they sent me a <a title="TechCrunch Post" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/09/mobile-component-marketplace-verious-exits-beta-partners-with-elance/">Techcrunch post</a>, saying here is your exclusive.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">Four Potential Levels of an API Business Ecosystem</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/CityGrid.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I'm working on a framework for the <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">City Grid API</a> that helps define the different types of developers that are using our APIs, helping me understand how to better support them, and ensure their success.
</p>
<p>
     This particular approach is different than segmenting my developers by type of development, like web and mobile or by industry like real estate or medical. I'm focusing on the business side of the API, and identifying what developers need to be successful in the business of the applications they are building on the CityGrid API, and where I should focus CityGrid resources.
</p>
<p>
     I'm breaking down our API developers into four distinct levels:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Open</strong> - Publicly available, self-service use of the API, with general forum and email support via developer area.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Associate</strong> - Motivated app developers who demonstrate their understanding of an API, submit their app for internal approval and take advantage of revenue sharing opportunities around the API.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Partner</strong> - Developers who already have successful businesses or have built businesses around the CityGrid APIs, and may have higher usage needs, and usually contribute some value back to the CityGrid business model and API ecosystem.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Incubation</strong> - Developers who have grown their businesses in significant ways, but need mentoring and investment of additional resources to take their business to the next level.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Anyone can register to use the API and become an open developer, integrating businesses, <a title="places" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">places</a> and other related content like <a title="reviews" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">reviews</a>, <a title="offers" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Offers+API">offers</a>, images and videos in their web or mobile apps. The API is self-service, allowing anyone to participate.  I can speculate what these developers need, but its up to them to let me know how they are building on the API and what they need to go to the next level.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Photo Credit - Sustainable Labs" href="http://sustainablelab.co.za/idea-incubation"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/incubation.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     To rise up to the next level of associate, you need to demonstrate you've integrated CityGrid APis into your app, using best practices, while adhering to the CityGrid <a title="Terms and Conditions" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Terms+and+Conditions">Terms and Conditions</a> and <a title="Usage Requirements" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Usage+Requirements">Usage Requirements</a>. Once approved as an associate you can start making money with your application or site using <a title="web advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Web+Ads+API">web</a>, <a title="local mobile advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Mobile+Ads+API">mobile</a> or <a title="custom advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Custom+Ads+API">custom advertising</a>, as well as taking advantage of <a title="places that pay" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+that+Pay">Place that Pay</a>.
</p>
<p>
     To become a partner your business usually provides some sort of value to CityGrid, and have potentially higher usage needs when it comes to CityGrid APIs. Not every developer has the opportunity to become a partner, but with the right business model, its an option that can be negotiated.
</p>
<p>
     We are all watching as technology incubators like <a title="Y Combinator" href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> and <a title="TechStars" href="http://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a> mentor and invest in tech startups from Silicon Valley to New York City. CityGrid is integrating this model into its API ecosystem. Companies like <a title="UrbanSpoon" href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/">UrbanSpoon</a> and <a title="BuzzLabs" href="http://buzzlabs.com/">BuzzLabs</a> have started out as open developers, rising up the ladder, with hard work and incremental success, until they are in need of a higher level of attention from CityGrid, as well as providing a lot of value to the CitiyGrid network.
</p>
<p>
     Not all companies have the capacity to approach their APIs in the way I'm laying out, but for those looking to build a vibrant ecosystem around their API, where developers can not just play with your API, but truly build businesses and the next generation of startups, you may want to consider how you can define a similar set of levels, that help you identify and meet the business needs of your developers.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/books/apis-a-strategy-guide.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I had the pleasure of getting an early copy of the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do">APIs: A Strategy Guide</a>, Creating Channels with Application Programming Interfaces, by Daniel Jacobson(<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), Greg Brail(<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gbrail">@gbrail</a>), Dan Woods(<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/danwoodscito">@danwoodscito</a>), published by O’Reilly Books.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do">APIs: A Strategy Guide</a>, provides the essential knowledge needed for planning, implementing and managing an API in this emerging API driven world. Written by Daniel Jacobsen who has managed two of the fastest growing and progressive APIs I know of--Netflix and NPR, and Greg Brail who is probably the one individual who has deployed the most number of APIs in the industry, and not leaving out Dan Woods who's is responsible for bringing this book together.
</p>
<p>
     The APIs: A Strategy Guide is sound advice for any executive, business, marketing or engineering person looking to deploy an API. But it doesn't stop there, as an experienced API product manager and evangelist it provides a framework to better look at much of what I already do, while also introducing some new concepts I hadn't considered.
</p>
<p>
     From a business perspective the book describes the API opportunity perfectly while providing the necessary business, product and value chain understanding to take on an API initiative within any company. As an author who's written a book on the <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">Business of APis</a>, Jacobsen, Brail and Woods take it even deeper and perfectly describe the business imperative for using APIs in your company.
</p>
<p>
     From a technical guide, you can't ask for a better approach than Jacobsen and Brail provide. API design is more art than science and they describe a balanced, but deeply technical approach for designing your API, wearing a very pragmatic hat, which is crucial in deploying a successful API.
</p>
<p>
     Beyond technical, the book provides the necessary legal considerations that come up when deploying an API, that could make or break your efforts. There is also concrete operational advice regarding how to approach the day to day operations of your API and ensure that you are able to measure and define the success of your API.
</p>
<p>
     The authors didn't neglect the most important aspect of any API, its developers. The book provides a key overview of what it will take to attract, engage and build a community of developers around your API. Without developers, your API will go nowhere.
</p>
<p>
     I've personally been working with RESTful APIs since their early days and have been studying the business of APis full time for the last year and half exclusively. Reading the APIs: A Strategy Guide, I added two extremely important concepts to my API model:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>APIs Expose Business Assets</strong> - APis are channels for exposing your most important business assets--products, services and information.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>API is a Contrac</strong>t - Developers are enticed to use the API because they know they can rely on it. The contract increases confidence, which increases use. The contract also makes the connection between pro-vider and consumer much more efficient since the interfaces are documented, consistent, and predictable.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The authors leave us with the knowledge you will need build a case for an API within your company, plan, implement and manage internal, partner and public APIs. The book ends right where you will be once you successfully launch your API; the beginning. The beginning of a whole new world of innovation, R&amp;D, equipped with a biz dev 2.0 platform that will enable your company to stay competitive in the emerging API economy.

        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2012</span>
        <p><a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/sdk-bridge/SDKBridge-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><em>This post comes from the&nbsp;<a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a>&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.</em></p>
<p>I recently received an email with the subject "FW: boring job". It was a long email chain that started with someone casting about for someone to write API documentation. It got me thinking about how most developers must wonder&nbsp;<em>why on earth</em>&nbsp;someone with the skills to program would choose to write API documentation instead.</p>
<p>"Why" is a good question to ask yourself when starting up a new year. In fact, I recently saw a&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/r/" target="_blank">TED talk video by Simon Sinek</a>&nbsp;on how the most effective people, companies, and organizations, start by thinking about&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;they do something instead of&nbsp;<em>what</em>. In the video, Sinek brings up examples like Apple, the Wright Brothers, and even Martin Luther King, whose most famous speech began with "I have a dream" (why) and not "I have a plan" (what).</p>
<p>In this newsletter, I'll talk about why we write API documentation, from how it impacts the world to how it challenges us personally. But first, here's what SDK Bridge been up to since our last newsletter:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Writing C++ documentation for software embedded into agricultural vehicles.</li>
<li>Writing REST documentation for a company that creates software for governments.</li>
<li>Writing REST documentation based on&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/y/" target="_blank">OpenSocial</a>&nbsp;to be able to create and manage online meetings.</li>
<li>Writing IT documentation for&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/j/" target="_blank">Microsoft HealthVault</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>- Peter Gruenbaum, President, SDK Bridge</p>
<h2>Why We Write API Documentation</h2>
<p>To most developers, writing <a title="API Documentation" href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php">API documentation</a> is nothing short of torture. But to a few of us, it's a fascinating area. What gets us so excited?</p>
<h3>Enormous Impact</h3>
<p>In case you haven't heard, the biggest technology revolution is happening since the invention of HTML. We've all heard about the explosion of smart phone, tablet, and software-as-a-service technology, but not everyone knows that APIs are what's driving all of these technologies, providing people with instant access to data. It used to be that only the people who had the data could write the software that granted access, but with APIs, the number of software developers who can create applications with that data is vastly increased. Companies are discovering that developers are doing things with their data that they had never dreamed of. It's an exciting time to be working in software.</p>
<p>Ask anyone in the API industry what the biggest obstacles are to creating apps, and I guarantee that they will bring up API documentation. Good documentation results in application innovation; bad documentation stifles it. API writers have the power to get an API adopted and used.</p>
<h3>An Interesting Human-Computer Interaction Challenge</h3>
<p><a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/t/" target="_blank">Donald Norman</a>, the Human-Computer Interaction guru, once wrote an&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/i/" target="_blank">interesting essay</a>&nbsp;of how the qualities of human beings are different than the qualities of computers. The way that we think is different than the way that machines "think", and a good user interface bridges the gap, making the computer intuitive to the person.</p>
<p>When your product is a software platform, then your API and its accompanying documentation is its user interface. If you want the API to be usable, then you have to figure how to bridge that difficult gap between the linear, inflexible world of computer programming and the non-linear, flexible way that people think and learn. It's a fascinating challenge.</p>
<h3>Extreme Variety</h3>
<p>Writing documentation for an API is a much faster process than writing the API itself. This means that an API writer often gets to learn about something, explain it, and then move on to the next thing. In just the last two years, I've gotten to learn about eCommerce, health care, traffic prediction, agricultural vehicles, online meetings, call centers, mobile phone applications, electric utilities, and noSQL databases. I even once wrote documentation to help the search for extraterrestial intelligence.</p>
<p>In the near future, everyone who has data will have an API to access that data, and all of those APIs need documentation. Writing that documentation is a way to get a taste of all of the different worlds that software is touching.</p>
<h3>On the Cutting Edge</h3>
<p>One of the big challenges of being a developer is staying on top of the latest technologies while there is so much legacy code to maintain that's built on old technology. Often developers get stuck working in old technology, wistfully wishing they could be on the cutting-edge.</p>
<p>Companies like to promote their platforms that use the hottest languages and protocols. That means that they will prioritize documentation for those platforms. Not only that, but I find that writers are given even more permission than developers when it comes to learning technology on the job. Between these two, API writers often get to work with the latest and greatest technologies</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Enormous impact, thinking about how people learn, extreme variety, and getting to work with cutting edge technology - it's pretty cool being an <a title="API Writer" href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php">API writer</a> these days. Of course, you have to love to write and you have to love to program. But if you are good at those two things, there's never been a better time to be an API writer.</p>

</p>
<p>
     When new developers register for the <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API</a>, I get an email with their name and email address. I want to make sure each developer knows I’m here, and available to help them get up and running as quick as possible.
</p>
<p>
     Emailing them as soon as they register seems a little too pushy, but following them on Twitter, with <a title="my personal Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/kinlane">my personal Twitter</a> and the <a title="CityGrid API Twitter Account" href="https://twitter.com/#!/CityGridAPITeam">CityGrid API Twitter account</a> makes sense. So how do I get their Twitter handle, without spending too much time and derailing whatever I’m working on?
</p>
<p>
     In comes <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>. For those of you who don’t know what Rapportive is, it is an browser add-on that runs in my Gmail and shows me everything about a contact I’m emailing with. On the right hand side it lists as much information associated with the email as the service can find, such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.
</p>
<p>
     So when I get a new registration email from CityGrid APIs, I highlight the email address and it shows me information about the user. Many users don’t maintain active online profiles, so it returns nothing. However a handful, have Twitter accounts associated, which I immediately follow with my personal and CityGrid API Twitter accounts.
</p>
<p>
     Both of my Twitter profiles clearly reflect <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a>, so when I follow them on Twitter, my developers know who I am, and they should now be aware that I am here to help. If they have any questions, they know they know how to find me.

        <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/CityGrid.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I started with <a title="CityGrid API Evangelist" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/citygrid-api-evangelist/">CityGrid as their API Evangelist</a>, I wanted to make sure and share as much of my strategy with my audience here, in real-time.  Of course I&rsquo;ve been so busy executing I have forgotten to tell the story about what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>So let me take a few moments to kick off telling the story of what I&rsquo;m doing to build awareness of the CityGrid <a title="places" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">Places</a>, <a title="reviews" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">Reviews</a>, <a title="offers" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Offers+API">Offers</a> and <a title="advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">Advertising</a>&nbsp;APIs.</p>
<p>Let me paint a picture from the 100K foot view, then in other posts I&rsquo;ll go into more detail.  Here are the areas I&rsquo;m focusing on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API</strong> - The CityGrid API already provides clear value and has a developer base, but there are always ways to improve.  I will be providing feedback regularly, to the CityGrid API team on where we can improve on our APis.</li>
<li><strong>API Area</strong> - Spending time in December hacking on the CityGrid APIs, I experienced first hand what it takes to get started hacking using the content and advertising APIs.  While it is still fresh in my mind, I&rsquo;m working on building a new getting started, publisher overview, FAQ and code samples and SDK page to help my publishers get up and running with their own development.</li>
<li><strong>Hyp3rL0cal</strong> - To wrap my head around the CityGrid APIs I needed a project, so I started <a title="Hyp3rL0cal" href="http://hyp3rl0cal.com">Hyp3L0cal</a>, a playground for building local applications using CityGrid and other local and social APIs. I will be publishing all my code there, for others to use in their projects. </li>
<li><strong>Presence</strong> - A healthy presence is important to the success of the CityGrid APIs.  I am focusing on equal doses of an online and offline presence for CityGrid.  The online presence consists of actively blogging, tweeting and coding on projects, while my offline presence includes a non-stop tour schedule of hackathons and conferences.</li>
<li><strong>Publishers</strong> - CityGrid calls its developers, &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;. I am focusing on helping attract new publishers, and educating them about what CityGrid APIs can do for them, while also listening to existing publishers about what they need to be more successful with their web and mobile applications.</li>
<li><strong>Landscape</strong> - CityGrid is working hard to dominate and lead the local content and advertising space, I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time working to understand this arena.  I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time understanding the landscape and the other players like Foursquare, Factual, Yellow Pages and Google to not just understand their approach, but also help CityGrid publishers understand which tools are the best for them.</li>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - Not everything I&rsquo;m doing is outwardly focused.  I&rsquo;m working hard to share what I learn from working with publishers and studying the local, social and mobile landscape and bring what I learn back to CityGrid.  Internal evangelism is very important to the success of CityGrid APIs, without a larger awareness our internal teams can&rsquo;t build the next generation of local content and advertising platform.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Updates</strong> - I&rsquo;ve worked to report on four main areas of what I&rsquo;m doing, to help track on what my efforts and the results I&rsquo;m delivering.  I provide a general overview of my week, as well as a schedule of events that I&rsquo;m attending, overview of the industry landscape and list of stories I&rsquo;m working on for blogging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are a lot of details in these eight areas, but this provides an nice overview of the things I&rsquo;m focusing on while evangelizing for <a title="CityGrid" href="http://citygrid.com/">CityGrid</a>.</p>
<p>Even though I feel like I have a solid strategy around what I what need to accomplish for CityGrid, there is so much to learn on a week to week basis.  That is why my weekly evaluation and updates are so important.  I need to stop an evaluate what I&rsquo;m doing every week and learn from it in as real-time as possible--so I can adjust quickly to prevent mistakes and maximize opportunities.</p>
<p>This is the best part of what I do, I&rsquo;m constant learning at the forefront of technology that is changing the face of multiple industries.    Not only do I get paid to do this, I get to share it here on API Evangelist so that others can learn from my success, and my mistakes.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2012</span>
        <p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-513" title="HTML5_Logo_512" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/HTML5/HTML5_Logo_512.png" alt="" width="225" height="225" align="right" />I just wrapped up two separate Facebook Hackathons, one in&nbsp;<a title="New York" href="http://www.hackweekends.com/events/facebook_mobile_hack__new_york.php">New York</a>&nbsp;and the other in&nbsp;<a title="Boston" href="http://www.hackweekends.com/events/facebook_mobile_hack__boston.php">Boston</a>. &nbsp;Both events started with presentations from various Facebook team members, demonstrating different aspects of the Facebook platform.</p>
<p>After the Facebook workshops, there was a presentation by Jim Zimmerman&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Thuzi" href="http://www.thuzi.com/">Thuzi</a>, a preferred Facebook mobile development shop from Florida. &nbsp;During both his talks, he asked audience &nbsp;to raise their hand and show which platform they developed their mobile apps on.</p>
<p>The breakdown in New York, from my view was about:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>25% iOS</li>
<li>25% Android</li>
<li>50% HTML5</li>
</ul>
<p>While the breakdown in Boston, from my view was about:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>&nbsp;10% iOS</li>
<li>10% Android</li>
<li>80% HTML5</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cities HTML5 was the clear choice of developers. &nbsp;Even though Facebook still heavily focused on native app development during their workshops you can tell they were leaning heavily towards HTML5, by inviting PhoneGap to present, and giving away HTML5 t-shirts.</p>
<p>I don't think HTML5 has won the mobile battle by any stretch, but after seeing Adobes heavy focus on HTML5 at the&nbsp;<a title="Designing &amp; Developing for Mobile Workshop in San Francisco" href="http://www.hackweekends.com/events/designing__developing_for_mobile_workshop.php">Designing &amp; Developing for Mobile Workshop in San Francisco</a>, and now the dominance of it by developers at both Facebook Mobile Hacks, I think the tide is turning.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Hundred-dollar-bill.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the areas of API development I'm focusing a lot of energy on in 2012 is around monetization.  I want to help define the playing field, of how API owners make money from their APIs, as well as how developers make money from their apps.</p>
<p>Both areas are extremely critical for the success of any API ecosystem.  If the API owner does not have a clear path to generate revenue, the API won't be sustainable, and eventually will go away.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, developers have to be able to make money from their apps in order to sustain their work, and build a viable business around an API.</p>
<p>As part of my work on understanding the developer side of things, I'm doing several posts asking developers how they make or plan to make money from their apps. Two obvious ways immediately come to mind:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>App Sales </strong>- Download and service based fees around apps.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising</strong> - Web and mobile ads in apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advertising has long held the title when it comes to monetizing apps, and iTunes and iOS sparked the mobile app gold rush.  But what other ways are there?</p>
<p>How can developers make money from their apps in ways that make them successful and sustainable? At CityGrid we have "<strong><a title="Places that Pay" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+that+Pay">Places that Pay</a></strong>", where users get paid for showing certain business profiles, and we are working on other versions of "Content that Pays", in the future.  But there has to be other innovative ways to make money from web and mobile app development.</p>
<p><strong>Let me know how you are making money from your apps!</strong></p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <a href="http://developer.att.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/att/ATT-API-Platform.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>

<p>
     <em>This is a guest post by <a title="Travis Spencer" href="http://travisspencer.com/">Travis Spencer</a>, a Software engineer specializing in federation, SSO, cloud computing, Web services, &amp; enterprise architecture.</em>
</p>
<p>
     This week, <a href="http://www.attinnovationspace.com/innovation/story/a7779618">AT&amp;T announced</a> the release of a <a href="http://developer.att.com/">new API platform</a> that is made up of various components designed to simplify mobile Web application development and utilize resources only available through them. Specifically, the new offering is made up of the following:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <span>A number of RESTful cloud services such as device location, MMS, digital signing, and direct carrier billing</span>
     </li>
     <li>An application marketplace and distribution channel
     </li>
     <li>A hosting environment for the HTML5 and server-side components used by applications running on the platform
     </li>
     <li>SDKs for common development environments such as C#, PHP, Ruby, and Java that can be used to call the API
     </li>
     <li>An HTML5 client-side SDK built atop Sencha Touch that abstract away the various mobile UI differences of Android, iOS, Blackberry and others while simultaneously simplifying the integration w/ their new cloud services
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/att/att-1.png" alt="" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     <span>These are complimented by extensive samples, documentation, forums, on-line support, and a non-production environment where you can create an unlimited number of test applications.</span>
</p>
<p>
     <span>After</span> <a href="https://developer.att.com/developer/urlRouter.jsp?referer=callToAction"><span>joining the developer program</span></a><span>, you can use the portal to create applications. When you do so, you specify which services your application will use (as shown in the adjacent screenshot). If you are developing a mobile Web application w/ HTML5, the SDK for that platform greatly simplifies the process and reduces the effort required.</span>
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/att/att-2.png" alt="" align="left" />
</p>
<p>
     <span>It does this using the architecture shown in the following figure. As depicted, an HTML5 application calls the new cloud API via a proxy (possibly hosted by AT&amp;T). This intermediary hides the security of the API in a Sencha plug-in, simplifying the programming model clients must follow.</span>
</p>
<p>
     <span>This JavaScript library ensures that a user has authorized an application to access her AT&amp;T resources without having to share a username or password. It does this using a standard security protocol called OAuth, which many other APIs</span> <a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=OAuth"><span>discussed previously on this blog</span></a> <span>also use. Because all calls to the API go through this proxy, the fact that the user has authorized the application can be maintained, ensuring that this step is only done once (or at least on an infrequently basis). After this initial call, the proxy will tack on a token to subsequent ones, proving the user has granted the application the right to use their resources. (See my other blog post for a</span> <a href="http://travisspencer.com/blog/2012/01/atts_use_of_oauth_in_new_api_p"><span>deeper dive into the security of the API</span></a><span>.)</span>
</p>
<p>
     <span>Once the application is done, you can deploy it into production. After doing so, you can monitor it in the same management portal. The available reports show you API response time, number of MMS and SMS messages sent, the number of errors encountered, the number of payments made, and more. This type of data will help measure ROI, optimize future releases, and better design other applications. Once the app is live, it can also be submitted to the AppCenter (though not through the portal). This widget presents applications to AT&amp;T subscribers right on their devices, helping market your inventions.</span>
</p>
<p>
     <span>After digging into and toying w/ this new platform for a bit, I have to say I’m impressed. Not every mobile network operator could pull this off, especially to the extent and quality AT&amp;T has done. Their use of an industry standard like OAuth, a common architectural paradigm like REST, and an extension to a popular framework like Sencha is very modern and appealing, which is unexpected coming from an industry where the opposite is often the case. These things together w/ the fact that the API exposes resources only available from the carrier itself, certainly make the API worth checking out.</span>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 1px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ifthisthenthat/ifthisthenthat-api-evangelist-to-tumblr.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I think email is highly underrated as a content API.  I know its not what we traditionally think of as an API, but has a lot of potential as a basic interface into an application.</p>
<p>An example of this is <a title="If This Then That" href="http://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (iftt)</a>. I use iftt to syndicate content to some of my blog platforms.  As part of my blogging strategy I want posts I publish on API Evangelist, to also show up on my <a title="Blogger" href="http://kinlane.blogspot.com/">Blogger</a>, <a title="Posterous" href="http://kinlane.posterous.com/">Posterous</a>, <a title="Tumblr" href="http://kinlane.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and <a title="Wordpress" href="http://kinlane.posterous.com/">Wordpress</a>.</p>
<p>Using iftt you can setup tasks that get triggered on certain events.  One such trigger is a new post to an RSS feed.  So when a new blog posts shows up in the <a title="API Evangelist RSS Feed" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ApiEvangelist">API Evangelist RSS</a> feed I can have iftt pull the title and body and push to a channel.  iftt provides channels for Posterous and Tumblr, allowing me to automatically syndicate using their APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 1px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ifthisthenthat/ifthisthenthat-api-evangelist-to-wordpress-via-email.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are no channels for Blogger and Wordpress, so I use their Gmail channel in conjunction with the post by email features on Blogger and Wordpress.  So instead of using an API to syndicate my content, I use email as an interface for these blogging platforms.</p>
<p>Using email as a content API is obviously not for every situation, but for some application processes, it might just work for moving content from one application to another, without much overhead.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret to Amazon's Success--Internal APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/amazon-com-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="225" />Last year there was an <a title="accidental post from a Google employee" href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">accidental post from a Google employee</a> about Google+.  The internal rant was accidentally shared publicly and provides some insight into how Google approached APIs for their new Google + platform, as well as insight how Amazon adopted an internal service oriented architecture (SOA).
</p>
<p>
     The insight about how Google approached the API for Google+ is interesting, but what is far more interesting is the insight the Google engineer who posted the rant, Steve Yegge, provides about his time working at Amazon, before he was a engineer with Google.
</p>
<p>
     During 6 years at Amazon he witnessed the transformation of the company from a bookseller to the almost $1B, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) API, cloud computing leader.  As Yegge's recalls that one day Jeff Bezos issued a mandate, sometime back around 2002 (give or take a year):
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.
     </li>
     <li>Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.
     </li>
     <li>There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.
     </li>
     <li>It doesn’t matter what technology they use.
     </li>
     <li>All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The mandate closed with:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <p>
          <strong><em>Anyone who doesn’t do this will be fired.  Thank you; have a nice day!</em></strong>
     </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
     Everyone got to work and over the next couple of years, Amazon transformed itself, internally into a service-oriented architecture (SOA), learning a tremendous amount along the way.<br />
     <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><br />
     Think about what Bezos was asking!   Every team within Amazon had to interact using web services.  If you were human resources and you needed some numbers from marketing, you had to get them using an API.  He was asking every team to decouple, define what resources they had, and make them available through an API.  Every team within your company essential becomes a partner of the other.
</p>
<p>
     Some of the lessons Amazon learned along the way:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Support</strong> - Support for your teams interface becomes critical
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Security</strong> - Every teams becomes a potential DOS attacker requiring service levels, quotas and throttling
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Monitoring / QA</strong> - Monitoring and QA are interconnected, you will need smart tools for not just telling if something is up and running, but actually delivering the expected results
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Discovery</strong> - Service discovery becomes important.  You will need to know what APIs there are, if they are available and where to find them.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Testing</strong> - Sandbox and debugging is essential for all APIs
     </li>
</ul>
<div>
     Of course this is a very small sampling from a rant of a former employee.   There are dozens, maybe hundreds of individual lessons like these that Amazon had to discover organically.
</div>
<div>
     <p>
          Yegge’s  points out that, <em>“Organizing into services taught teams not to trust each other in most of the same ways they’re not supposed to trust external developers.”</em>
     </p>
     <p>
          This makes deploying internal APIs a great exercise for preparing your company for the coming API economy where, you will have to have expose self-service, partner and public APIs to stay competitive in your industry.
     </p>
     <p>
          When Amazon started, it was difficult to see how the bookseller would be come the e-commerce powerhouse it is today, let alone to see that Amazon would transform culturally into a company that thinks and operates as a service oriented architecture, delivering Amazon Web Services, that not only changed how the company operates, but created an entire platform that would change how the Internet works.
