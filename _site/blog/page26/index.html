<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php" target="_blank">While we officially launched </a><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice, San Francisco edition</a> back in May, we've been pretty quiet during the summer months. Well, now summer is coming to a close, and we are now less than 60 days away from the API community conversation that is #APIStrat.</p>
<p>To start ramping things up, I'm going to start showcasing the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/speakers.php">amazing line-up of speakers</a> we have for the event, and giving the <a title="kick-ass sponsors" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/sponsors.php">kick-ass sponsors</a> who have stepped up to support the event, the "love" they deserve.</p>
<p>Early bird pricing has ended, but you have less than a month to get in on the mid range pricing. Don't miss out like so many did in February when #APIStrat New York City sold out--<a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/register.php">buy your tickets</a> now.</p>
<p>Even with large number of speakers we have lined up, we still have some slots left open, and will be making some announcements of other big names to the lineup-so stay tuned.</p>
<p>I will be exploring the wide range of topics and tracks we have planned here on API Evangelist as well as the <a title="APIStrat Blog" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/blog.php">#APIStrat blog</a>, so subscribe to our RSS feeds and tune in on Twitter for more details.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-greed.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I used to think that the API space is resistant to defining standards around REST, data formats, webhooks, hypermedia, api definitions and other key areas of the space, because after the top down, strict structure of SOA, the community just wanted to let the space organically define the best approaches.</p>
<p>The API world just seemed like a wild west of strong minded individuals, who had a sort of "markets will work it out" approach, and the best approach will win in the end. You know, kind of like the Amazon cloud API battle?</p>
<p>By 2013, the only thing we've come to agreement on is around oAuth, and by many accounts that was a failure. I used to think that many of the bitter battles by the RESTafarians about API design, RESTfulness and Hypermedia were because these were very smart, stubborn folks trying to craft the best approach possible.</p>
<p>After many years of advocating for open source tooling, open events in the space and sharing of common API design patterns, I don't think there is much goodwill for any of it, because companies are more interested in their intellectual property(IP), seeming competitive and ultimately making the most money and pleasing their VCs.</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong, there are some very fine companies, do good in the space. I'm not saying the entire sector has lots its way. However the majority of the vibe from major players is, we don't want to share design patterns, open tooling, work together to support industry events and gatherings, we will just do it all ourselves, keeping the IP and value for themselves.</p>
<p>I understand I'm less interested in the whole business and VC aspect of this than many of you are, but I think APIs got their start in openness, collaboration and sharing in the spirit of transparency and interoperability. It seems like like after 10 years and finally getting some traction in the space, we are starting to lose our way.</p>

<p>When it comes to API discovery, as an industry we haven't been able to find a satisfactory technological solution yet. While I often feel the right approach hasn't emerged yet, I think we are just overlooking "good enough" solutions, because we are waiting for the holy grail of API discovery.</p>
<p>I can't imagine that indexing, search and discovery of the myriad of web APIs out there is that much harder than indexing, search and discovery of the billions of HTML documents available online.  Sure, when you are talking about programmatic interfaces, you need a little more precision, but I think us technologists are caught up our own beliefs that APIs should be perfect.</p>
<p>It would make sense that we adopt some evolution of the common <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html">sitemaps format</a>, retrofit it to be JSON, accommodate open data catalogs, and allow for various API definitions in <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">I/O Docs</a> or even <a title="API Blueprint" href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API blueprint</a>.  Sure these formats won't have the precision of an evolution of the precious WSDL, or some actually agreed upon standard, but it will get us over the hump we are in.</p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> is 8 years old now, and in 2013, we still don't have any next step, let lone an actual usable solution for API discovery? I just have a hard time believing this is a technological problem, that it is more the stubbornness of the leaders in the space to just take any meaningful step towards API discovery, and lead.</p>
<p>There isn't going to be any money in API discovery, so this isn't something a single startup can emerge to solve. It is something we will all have to discuss and play with until we can find something will get us to the next step, together.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/08/27/oauth-101/">OAuth 101</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/oauth/OAuth2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>With APIs beginning to enter the mainstream consciousness, it is time to spend more time educating the masses about OAuth. We've had plenty of conversations between two of the OAuth legs, provider and developer, but we now need to <a title="3 legged conversations" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/26/which-of-the-three-oauth-legs-is-the-most-important/">bring the third leg into the conversation</a>--the user.</p>
<p>First, what is OAuth? - An open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not, OAuth has become the industry standard for accessing resources, being served up via APIs, that are being consumed through desktop, web and the fast growing mobile space.</p>
<p><strong>OAuth Platforms &amp; Data Providers</strong><br /> If you are an online platform, OAuth is something you need to understand. At a minimum, if you require users to establish an account, you need to consider allowing users to create their accounts and login in the future using other popular OAuth providers like Facebook, Twitter and Google. Next if you want to provide access to your platform user's data via an API, you need to take a deeper dive into OAuth, and consider establishing yourself as an OAuth provider.</p>
<p><strong>OAuth for Desktop, Web and Mobile Developers</strong><br /> In 2013, if you are a developer, you are probably using APIs. OAuth has been very intimidating for developers for quite some time, but with the increased availability of quality OAuth clients, better implementations and educational materials from API providers, and standardized approaches by startups like <a title="OAuth.io" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/08/13/simplifying-oauth-with-oauthio/">OAuth.io</a>--OAuth is something you shouldn't fear anymore. You need OAuth as a default tool in your developer toolbox.</p>
<p><strong>Everyday Online User</strong><br /> Like the term API, OAuth is something that should be added to the vocabulary of every tech savvy user. You should understand that OAuth exists, and that it gives you the ability to create accounts and login to your favorite platforms without filling out endless new forms and sharing your passwords unnecessarily. The platforms you use daily, like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google all are OAuth providers, and you should leverage these providers to manage your online presence. The control is in your hands to securely manage your online persona using OAuth, and with a little education and maintenance you can ensure you profile(s) are secure, and only the providers you trust have access to your important data.</p>
<p>This is a first post in series of OAuth related information that is looking to educate the masses about the importance of OAuth. Hopefully increasing the number of quality OAuth providers, knowledgeable developers and OAuth aware online users--making OAuth something that is ubiquitous across the web, and enabling meaningful 3 legged conversations that make data accessible, incentivizes developers while protecting end-user's privacy.</p>
<p>I will be deploying an entirely new research project dedicated to OAuth, where I will work on stories about OAuth that hopefully resonate with the masses. As with my other research, it will take me a while to dial in. As I work to do this, I will curate the best stories and tools in the OAuth space, eventually trying to create a polished repository of OAuth resources that providers, developers and users will find valuable.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Aug 2013</span>

<p>I've been doing API Evangelist for three years now, a world where selling APIs to existing companies outside of Silicon Valley, and often venture capital firms is a serious challenge. While APis have been around for a while in many different forms, this new, more open and collaborative approach to APis seems very foreign, new and scary for some companies and investors--resulting in them often very resistant to it.</p>
<p>As part of my storytelling process, I'm always looking for ways to dovetail API tools and services into existing business needs and operations, making them much more palatable to companies across many business sectors.  Once part of the API space I'm just getting a handle on is the area&nbsp;<a title="API Integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">API integration</a>, which includes testing, monitoring, debugging, scheduling, authentication and other key challenges developers face when building applications that depend on APIs.</p>
<p>I was having a great conversation with Roger Guess of <a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://therightapi.com">TheRightAPI</a> the other day, which I try to do regularly. We are always brainstorming ideas on where the space is going and the best way to tell stories around API integration, that will resonate with existing companies. Roger was talking about the success they are finding dovetailing their testing, monitoring and other web API integration services with a company's existing QA process--something that I can see will resonate with many companies.</p>
<p>Hopefully your company already has a full developed QA cycle for your development team(s), including, but not limited to, automated, unit and regression testing--something where API tests, monitoring, scheduling and other emerging API integration building blocks will fit in nicely. This new breed of APi integration tools don't have to be some entirely new approach to development, chances are you are already using APIs in your development and API testing and monitoring can just be added to your existing QA toolbox.</p>
<p>I will spend more time looking for stories that help relate some of these new approaches to your existing QA processes, hopefully finding news ways you can put tools and services like TheRightAPI to use, helping you better manage the API integration aspect of your web and mobile application development.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-start.jpeg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy the assortment of emails, LinkedIn messages and phone calls I get from people in the SMB and enterprise, letting me know the role my blog plays in them starting, cultivating and evolving their own API initiatives.</p>
<p>I received once such call this week, from an unnamed individual, at an unnamed company, letting me know the role API Evangelist played in providing the information they needed to find success. Like many other companies who reach out to me, their efforts aren't to the point where they feel comfortable telling stories publicly, so I'm happy to keep anonymous, until they are ready.</p>
<p>The stories that come out of these companies are all very similar.  The API initiatives were started by single person, or small group of passionate individuals who start small, find safe and sensible wins, while keeping risk and failures to a minimum.  They start with data and resources that are not mission critical, but still offer value to either internal, partner or public developers.</p>
<p>These innovators usually start with a handful of trusted partners, keeping the experimentation very controlled in a safe environment, before opening up to a wider base of partners, and then when ready, to a self-service public audience.  This approach allows API innovators to find small successes and report these wins to business leaders and stakeholders, before moving forward with other efforts.</p>
<p>Taking this approach in small, iterative cycles, providing decision makers with the necessary reporting and education, allows for you to slowly change internal culture. API change does not happen overnight, and it is easy to fail if you try to go big in companies who aren't quite ready.</p>
<p>I can't get enough of these stories, I can't wait until these program mature, where I can tell them publicly on the blog. Until then, remember that when you are starting with a brand new API initiative within your company, start small, find success, minimize risk, repeat and tell stories of your efforts to everyone you can. You will be surprised what can happen in six months to a year, with the right environment you can find your culture changing and becoming much more open to API experimentation.</p>

<p>Github is really doing some cool stuff to help open data folks manage and share their data.</p>
<p>They just launched the ability to <a href="https://github.com/blog/1601-see-your-csvs" target="_blank">render data from .csv (comma-separated) and .tsv (tab-separated) files as an interactive table</a>, including headers and row numbering.  They even let you link to a specific row for sharing specific data from the file.</p>
<p>As I'm working on opening up government data, I'm pushing for agencies to use Github when publishing and sharing CSV, TSV, XML and JSON files. These kind of features really go a long way in helping me achieve my goals.</p>
<p>Make sure and also check out what Github has done around <a href="https://github.com/blog/1465-stl-file-viewing">3D models</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blog/1528-there-s-a-map-for-that">geographic data</a>, pretty cool stuff.</p>

<p>I've had the joy of watching a lot of you bash on my girlfriend, from the misogynistic douche bags telling her to get back in the kitchen because she questions their technology startup, to the recent <a href="https://twitter.com/FakeAudryWattrs">@FakeAudreyWatters</a> Twitter account spending a good portion of their day mocking her.</p>
<p>Audrey and I are very different personalities when it comes to expressing ourselves in an online environment, but we share one common thing--a passion for helping encourage meaningful dialogue about where we are going with this whole technology roller coaster.</p>
<p>Audrey is extremely passionate about education and where we are going with the education of our kids, and how we are applying technology in the classroom.  If she is critical of your startup, idea or otherwise, you may not like it, but there might actually be a reason behind it--why don't you engage her in dialogue about it?</p>
<p>She spends at least 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, researching, writing and stressing over her work(unpaid). I spend every moment with her and I see how much thought she puts into all of this. She is a very positive person, and extremely intellectually stimulating to be around, which is why I'm with her. Together, as a team we have achieved some amazing things in the last three years.</p>
<p>I strongly believe Audrey and I have positively impacted the online world by helping folks think critically about education, and across numerous other industries through analysis of APis. I depend on Audrey to bounce ideas off, ranging from oAuth to API terms of use. API Evangelist <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would not exist</span> without her.</p>
<p>When I was first with Audrey she often frustrated me with her confrontational approach, but over the course of four years, I have found it to be essential to what I do. She battles me on ideas, sometimes to the point where we both stomp off, but in every case, I've been able to apply her critical feedback and make my work more polished as a result.</p>
<p>What I hope is, that you can learn to do the same. If she says something that bothers you, have a dialogue with her and either change her mind, or I bet she'll change yours. If you don't like what she is saying, come to DC and sit with us and talk it out over a couple pints or bottle of wine.</p>
<p>If not, I think secretly you have more problems than just Audrey. You are probably insecure, greedy, sad sack o shit like the creator @FakeAudreyWatters. Someone who could be spending their time actually contributing to the education space, but they are actually working hard to suck value from their space, just like the company you work at. Something that is just unacceptable, c'mon these are our kids asshole, get a fuck'n life.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.census.gov/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/digital-strategy/logos/census.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote a piece about <a title="providing a full download vs. API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">providing a full download vs. API</a> last month, where I used the <a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/" target="_blank">Census Bureau API</a> as an example. The post got the attention of the folks at the Census, and they invited me out for a discussion yesterday about their API strategy.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau API team asked me what I thought of their <a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/" target="_blank">API developer area</a>, and while I have lots of suggestions of where they could do, I first focused on what they have already delivered.</p>
<p>I don't know if you understand the size of the census, but it is a massive undertaking, resulting in data at a scope that we are only seeing matched in the last few years, with the Google's and Twitters of the world--the only difference is the census has been going on since 1790. it gives you an ideas of the serious big data potential behind the Census Bureau API.</p>
<p>Faced with data at this scope, I understand that delivering a simple, web API is not easy. I was impressed with the teams efforts before I came to D.C., but now I'm really impressed that such a simple, web API could be delivered out of such a large government entity. Many other agencies are still trying to even learn what an API is, and even if they do attempt at delivering APIs, the result is often the much more technical cousin of web APIs, SOAP web services.</p>
<p>I totally respect the simple start to the Census Bureau API. The current API landing gives you brief introduction to the API, shows you how to access the data via the URL endpoints, gives you example responses, error codes and addresses what you need to use the APIs in JavaScript.  They also give you quick access to getting API keys, a developer forum, application gallery and of course you still get full access to Census downloads.</p>
<p>What a great start. So simple. Giving developers exactly what they need to get going.</p>
<p>Then before I gave my feedback on where they could go next with the APis, the Census team gave me a quick overview of the API road-map, to make sure I wasn't going to suggest anything they were already working on.</p>
<p>I was pleased to hear the Census Bureau API road-map centered around making sure all the public survey data at the Census was accessible via the API for developers. After that, the focus was on making it easier for developers to access, filter and work with all data via the APIs. One of the biggest challenges is that there are hundreds of thousands of fields developers can use when querying the API, and potentially millions of fields when all of it is made available. Opening up the question, how do you educate users that these fields exist, let alone put these fields to use.</p>
<p>I think the Census Bureau API road-map reflects the mission of the Census Bureau, with a focus on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Complete Data Downloads</li>
<li>Simple API Interfaces</li>
<li>Access to All Public Data</li>
<li>Usability for Developers</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach totally satisfies my number one requirement for all APIs--deliver value. If you focus on delivering value, the rest will work out. Developers will come, and build on that value.  The Census team is on the right track with their road-map, dovetailing with any feedback I had brought with me to the meeting:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Value</strong> - Keep focusing on providing value to developers. Make the data they desire available, make it as easy to access as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - The key to success will be to keep building on the simple interfaces you've created. Complexity will slow API adoption for developers.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong> - Look at Swagger, I/O Docs and API Blueprint for approaches to make learning about Census APIs interactive, exploratory and hands-on for developers.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - Keep up the good work on providing JavaScript resources for integrating with the developers, this will help encourage embeddable tools, single page apps and meaningful visualizations.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> - Consider providing spreadsheet integration resources for using Census APIs in Excel and Google Spreadsheets, allowing spreadsheet packages complete with built in graphs, charts and other visualizations. This is a growing trend in the API space and will meet the needs of non-developer users, which will mean massive new adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Landing Page -</strong> Keep the home page simple, but consider surfacing other valuable resources, making everything a developer needs to get started is one click away.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not want to overload the Census team with too many ideas, I want to keep my feedback as simple as their initial approach to their API. I had feedback loop on my list before arriving, but the team walked me through their existing feedback loop of partners, advisory groups, conferences, forums, list serves and Twitter. Add me coming by the office regularly, I think they have the feedback loop covered! :-)</p>
<p>In 2013, we are all excited about the potential of big data. I'm excited to see the OG Big Data provider, stepping up to the plate in such a meaningful way. There are some seriously smart people at the Census, and I'm really excited to see what they have coming down the pipeline, and I'm honored that they respect my opinions enough to have me out to the office.</p>

<p>As I immerse myself in the federal government, I have left my private sector world where web APIs have become commonplace. Sure I still worked hard to get outside of Silicon Valley and reach out further into land of "normals", helping spread the API gospel, but in Washington D.C. I seriously have my work cut out for me.</p>
<p>I have a great support system within the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp">Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) at the White House</a>, but as I go deeper within specific agencies I see fewer web APIs, and fewer people who understand them. When I do come across a web service, it makes me hopeful, but still these SOAP driven services may get the job done for programmers, but lack the simplicity needed to get wider adoption.</p>
<p>This is only my second week in DC, I'm spending a lot of time going through websites, getting to know the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies, and recognize there is a lot of web talent, even though much is probably contracted, within the Federal Government.  I can't help but think how CMS platforms like Wordpress, Drupal and others have helped our government publish valuable information and resources via the web, but we still are lacking a complimentary web API movement.</p>
<p>The value of websites has been accepted across federal government, what can we do to get web APIs to the same level? Web services are embraced, but they are still a very black box, developer centric tool, something out of reach of the common gov worker. But web APIs aren't much different than the websites being produced, they just trade their HTML output for data formats like XML and JSON--I'm looking to change this.</p>
<p>In 2013 and 2014 I want to pose the question in within government, why aren't open data and API skills part of the federal government's web developer toolbox, alongside the skills you already posses. You can increase the productivity of government 10x with this little change. Every time you publish web content via HTML, simultaneously publish an XML and JSON version of the same information. This little change will transform how our federal government works, much like it did when website development was adopted in the 90's.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I spend time in Washington DC, I get a lot of questions regarding API design, deployment and management. It is quite likely my writing will evolve here at API Evangelist during the next year. You will see me quickly scrub answers that I'm giving to questions that I receive from any number of federal agencies.</p>
<p>One question I received today was a classic one: what are some good examples of API docs? But in this particular case it wasn't just for an API, there is also a full download of data available as well.</p>
<p>First, regardless of whether or not it is data download (CSV, XML, JSON) or API you need to provide a wrapper area, or portal, that will onboard users and helps them understand what you are delivering, enabling them to go from 0-60 with as little friction as possible.</p>
<p>This is what I have studied for the last 3 years. After looking at thousands of APIs areas, you start to see patterns. You will find&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">my research in the form of "building blocks" on a section of my site</a>. Even though most of my research is focused on APIs, these patterns can apply universally to data download or API delivery.</p>
<p>But specifically to question of what API documentation I like? I also recommend looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">Stripe</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest">Twilio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.parse.com/docs/rest">Parse</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fullcontact.com/developer/docs/person/">Full Contact</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developers.box.com/docs/#folders">Box</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/dev/docs">Dwolla</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When looking through these make sure and take notice of how&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">Dwolla separates their intro page, between non-devs and devs</a>. This is a very significant concept for delivering onboarding materials for users where not everyone will be a developer.</p>
<p>Beyond those suggestions for API docs, here are&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/08/thirty-apis-to-look-at-when-planning-your-api/">Thirty APIs To Look At When Planning Your AP</a>I, if you are looking for more examples of quality API areas + documentation.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider when actually deploying specifically an API, is making your API documentation "interactive". There are several solutions for doing this right now, but the leading solution (in my opinion) is called&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>. This is a evolution from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">WADL</a>, but has come a long ways since just describing a web API in XML.</p>
<p>Swagger is developed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, and you can view the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html">documentation in action on their developer site</a>. In my examples above, Full Contact uses swagger to deliver their documentation in a very elegant way. Why Swagger is important, is the fact that it doesn't just deliver elegant documentation, it makes it interactive and learning about an API a hands on experience, which increases the potential for adoption. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of Swagger only begin with interactive documentation, it will also&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen">generate code samples in Java, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Ruby</a>&nbsp;automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just some thoughts. I hope it helps. Remember, open data and APIs only start with the download or interface. The success of your implementation really depends on the richness of the area around your data download and API.</p>

<p><em>I happened to look at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/apigee/apis-inside-enterprise-soa-displacement">slide and also related video</a> but unfortunately still do not have&nbsp;&nbsp;a crystal clear view.</em><br /><br /><em>Is my understanding correct?</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>SOA and API are complementary paradigms/technologies. APIs are a facade to SOA to expose them to the outside world?</em></li>
<li><em>SOA was aimed to provide an integration mechanism/guidelines for enterprise while APIs are generally aimed to make the backend systems public? Also, APIs can be internal to the organization.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>My response:</p>
<p><span>Your understanding is in the ballpark.&nbsp;&nbsp;APIs were one tool in the SOA toolbox. Except you are seeing APIs as just technology.</span><br /> <br /> <span>APIs have jumped out of the enterprise toolbox, and found success in the richer oxygen environment of the Internet, escaping from the claustrophobic environment of the restrictive enterprise network in which strict governance was imposed, and technologists decided everything.</span><br /> <br /> <span>After going outside the firewall, APIs became about the simplicity of REST + JSON over HTTP, putting these resources closer to actual problem owners--flipping the governance of SOA on its head, making APIs more about partnering, collaboration, transparency and openness, and not just about control. After escaping the governance and the bottleneck of traditional IT, this new breed of APIs allowed for new types of innovation, business models and opportunities amongst not just open developers, but actual business owners.

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Public Media Platform" href="http://publicmediaplatform.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/public-media-platform/public-media-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are just a handful of API platforms that I feel have greatly impacted the world of APIs and were significant in leading the space in important ways. These platforms include, but are not limited to Amazon Web Services, EBay, Salesforce, Google Maps and Twitter. All of these companies have changed the way we build applications and conduct business, by using APIs.</p>
<p>In 2013, as we watch 50-100 public APIs launch each week, it can be difficult to see any sign of meaningful impementations in each wave of new API deployments. Just as I'm getting completely depressed about this lack of true API innovation, I was introduced to a new <a title="Public Media Platform" href="http://publicmediaplatform.org/">Public Media Platform</a> that is pushing forward the tech, business and politics of APIs.</p>
<p>The Public Media Platform (PMP) is a non-profit organization formed by public media's leading organizations, APM, NPR, PBS, PRI and PRX, to establish digital content repository and distribution system that will enable users to easily discover and interact with the news, information, cultural and educational content that is produced across the public media landscape.</p>
<p>PMP has come together to develop a completely API driven platform, that will empower producers of public media to store and share text, digital video, audio, images and related meta data. This approach to media delivery will increase the distribution and reach, lower operating costs, while also handling the business rules, rights management necessary for media delivery in an online and mobile world.</p>
<p>By lowering these barriers of entry, and simplifying operations and distribution, PMP will open up opportunities for these leading players to get their work in front of the large public media audience. However, this isn't just about benefiting these existing players, who are investing in the platform, once deployed, the platform will be opened up to any media producer. With this newly developed ecosystem, any developer will be able to build tools and applications that will help public media stations and producers deliver content in new ways that will serve a growing audience--opening up entirely new opportunities for collaboration, distribution and innovation.</p>
<p>PMP is an important project, something that doesn't occur in the commercial space. With this approach to building an API platform, you have what could be perceived as competitors, who are working together to define a common API and data standards, while also defining best practices, then leveraging open source tools and approaches to establish a shared platform that is not just beneficial to these founding partners, but ultimately other independent, lesser known producers--establishing the groundwork for a true API ecosystem.</p>
<p>You just don't see this happening in the commercial space. You might see API providers like Twilio and SendGrid who work together, but trust me, as someone who has organized an <a title="API industry conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php">API industry conference</a>, where I work hard to bring API providers and service providers together--it can be like herding cats to even get them all in the same room, let alone collaborate on a common platform or standards. Something that seems counter to the underlying philosophy of the API space, in my opinion.</p>
<p>The PMP team is heads down in the build phase of the project, and will be launching pilot deployments in the fall, with full deployment planned for the beginning of 2014. I've been fortunate to have a chance to look at the technology behind the platform, and I'm seriously impressed with the PMP team's forward leaning approach to the platform's design.</p>
<p>I have crafted a 15 story series based upon the PMP platform, which I will be releasing in tune with the PMP roadmap, so make sure and tune in over the next six months. With the lack of commercial constraints, the PMP team is going to lead in not just the public media space, but deliver a platform model, API design definition and suite of open source tools that can be applied across numerous industries, and show many commercial API platforms a whole new world of API possibilities.</p>

<p>Securely accessing API with oAuth can be one of the bigger pains in the ass for developers. Poor understanding of how oAuth works and often lack of good client libraries, can make API authentication a hurdle developers can't jump over.</p>
<p>Now developers don't have to stress out over oAuth. The tech savvy team over at <a title="Webshell.io" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell.io</a> has created a dead simple oAuth solution that allows you to integrate with over 70 of the common API providers, with just three lines of JavaScript, called <a href="https://oauth.io/" target="_blank">oAuth.io</a>.</p>
<p>What I like about oAuth.io the most, is that it is a true client side oAuth solution. With as many pure client-side, JavaScript, <a title="Single Page Apps" href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">Single Page Apps</a> I'm building, this type of oAuth solution just rocks!</p>
<p>I really enjoy dead simple solutions like oAuth.io, that take powerful, but complex things and abstracts away the complexity, making it something anyone can use. I recommend taking a look at oAuth.io and saving yourself the overhead of API integration using oAuth.</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough, It gets even better. They have also open sourced the oAuth.io core under the name&nbsp;<a href="https://oauth.io/#/docs/oauthd">oAuthd</a>.</p>

No matter how much you try to organize, name and add metadata to documents, providing a quality search mechanism can be tough. Let alone one that you can use in web portals, web sites and even mobile and tablet applications.</p>
<p>One common way to to solve this problem historically has been using the Lucene Java Search Library, but in the age of web and mobile having an added API for integrating across all the place you will need search, is even better.  One of the quickest ways to deploy a document search API is using <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank">Apache Solr</a> which is built on top of the Lucene Java Search Library.</p>
<p>Apache Solr delivers a full-text search server that provides a REST-like API, where you put documents in it via XML, JSON or CSV, and then you can query it via API and receive XML, JSON, CSV results, which enables you to deliver a quick, cost effective, open source API driven search for your documents.</p>
<p>There are many types of APIs, from data to programmatic resources--when it comes to document search APIs for knowledge bases, catalogs and other document stores, Apache Solr is a solid option.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, will be my first official day in Washington D.C. as a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/round-2-fellows">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>. I'm super excited, yet also very calm about what is happening.  It seems like it is so meant to be, that I don't have any questions or reservations, I just want to get to work.</p>
<p>I was not in the realm, where I would take a job from anyone.  I was doing very well, educating the masses about APIs as THE API Evangelist.  However when the I got the call to be a Presidential Innovation Fellow, I did not hesitate.  Yes.  Of course I would take the role.</p>
<p>As a Presidential Innovation Fellow I will be assigned to the "VA Modernization Team", along with two other very talented individuals, Molly Ruskin (<a href="https://twitter.com/mollieruskin">@mollieruskin</a>) and Ben Willman (<a href="/admin/blog/benwillman">@benwillman)</a>. While we are working together as a team, I will be specifically assigned to the Digits-2-Digits (D2D) project which is:</p>
<blockquote><em>An enterprise Digits-to-Digits Electronic Claims Submission Service that will provide a common access point to standardize, centralize, and integrate the universal collection of Benefits Claim Forms and supporting evidence data to produce a streamlined, paperless Veteran/Service member-centric claims process.</em></blockquote>

<p>I couldn't think of a more meaningful project to be part of. I've gone through the project and begun to acquaint myself with its inner workings, and I'm impressed with the amount of work and detail that has gone on so far, in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>I'm really thankful for this opportunity, to really put APIs, and my experience to use for such a meaningful cause. I'm looking forward to the talented folks I will be working with over the next year, and the amount that I will learn on this new adventure in my life and career.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/John-Ronald-Kehoe.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>In closing wanted to give a quick shout out to my father Jim Bignall (top photo) who I never got to know, and my step-father John Ronald Kehoe (bottom photo) who impacted my life in so many ways. Both have passed on now, but both were Vietnam Veterans and left significant marks on who I am, and contributed so much to prepare me for the next year of service.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2013</span>
        <h1>Overview of API Integration</h1>
<p>Integrating with a single API can be tough, let alone multiple APIs. I see integration being about on-boarding, exploration, education, authentication, code samples, testing and sand-boxing of APIs--pretty much everything between the discovery of APIs and going into production.</p>
<p>The goal is to identify building blocks, tools, services and other knowledge that will help developers integrate APIs into their web, mobile and internet of things applications. API Evangelist as always been about the business of APIs from the API provider perspective, but now I'm looking to evolve it, and include the business of API consumption.</p>
<p>Some of the companies included in this research span other areas like API discovery or management, but they are also providing valuable tools and services that help ensure developers will be successful. Once I get, what I feel are the key areas of both deploying and consuming APIs up, I will work on the overlaps, and interoperability between these areas.</p>
<p>API integration tools and services are proving to be a very critical area to the space, one that will help stabilize the world of APIs and balance out much of the inconsistency that developers face when building apps that span multiple API providers or even depend on aggregate APis.</p>
<p>This area of API evangelist is brand new and will be evolving as I continue my research. &nbsp;If you have tools or approaches to development of apps using APIs, please let me know. I'd love to hear more about how you approach integration. As with all of my projects, this is a continuous work in progress, so stay tuned.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Runscope" href="http://runscope.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/runscope/runscope-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The word "open" gets thrown around a lot in the API space. So much in fact, the term has lost just about any meaning. We don't say "open API" anymore, we identify an API as public, partner or private, evolving to a time where open APIs have merged with open source, and success means building community.</p>
<p>In 2013, successful application development centers around community, which includes not just a healthy selection of valuable, stable API resources, but also a strong assortment of open source tools and cloud services that are community driven, and benefit all.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/02/the-continuing-netflix-api-story/">strong example of this evolution can be seen in the Netflix ecosystem</a>, where <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">a "public" API has been largely considered a failure</a>, but a strong API driven community of device vendors has flourished, as well as the release of a suite of open source API and cloud tooling from the online movie and TV streaming platform.</p>
<p>Another examples can be seen from the new <a title="Runscope" href="http://runscope.com/" target="_blank">API testing and integration provider Runscope</a>.  In addition to providing a suite of services for developers to use when developing API driven applications, Runscope also actively maintains four separate community projects:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Digest" href="http://apidigest.com">API Digest (apidigest.com)</a></li>
<li><a title="API Jobs" href="http://api-jobs.com">API Jobs (api-jobs.com)</a></li>
<li><a title="API Changelog" href="http://apichangelog.com">API Changelog (apichangelog.com)</a></li>
<li><a title="RequestBin" href="http://requestb.in">RequestBin (requestb.in)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>API Digest and API Jobs were pet projects of Runscope founder John Sheehan, prior to starting the company, but he has continued the same approach in a more formal manner, in which Sheehan calls the Runscope 'Community Projects' model, and adding API Changelog and most recently acquiring RequestBin.</p>
<p>All of these Runscope projects are "free-forever open to the community sites that I hope are valuable resources related to what we're doing", according to Sheehan. "our overriding philosophy for all this is this: the more tools the better. We obviously benefit from the links, etc. but the bigger picture is we're working in a nascent area of dev tools and we benefit more from general exposure to the ideas we're working on than trying to capture all the attention directly. Whatever we need to do to encourage devs to keep trying new ways to solve these problems, we're going to do it."</p>
<p>In addition to these core community projects at Runscope, they also sponsor four other open source software (OSS) projects, including <a title="LocalTunnel" href="http://localtunnel.com">localtunnel.com</a>, <a title="httpbin.org" href="http://httpbin.org">httpbin.org</a>, <a title="foauth.org" href="http://foauth.org">foauth.org</a>, and <a title="mocky.io" href="http://mocky.io">mocky.io</a>.  Sheehan says that, "some of these 'compete' with us, but we're more concerned with keeping them available".</p>
<p>Runscope's 'Community Project' model makes me happy. This approach is not just about providing paid services for developers who are building applications that use APIs, but truly providing the news, tools and other resources the space needs to be healthy.</p>
<p>Companies that are looking to provide APIs or API related services need to follow Runscope's lead, and evolve beyond just the concept of 'open API' or just 'open source', and adopt a community driven model where you acknowledge its not just about selling your services, but aso helping contribute the resources that will ensure the entire space is healthy and vibrant--a world where we all win!</p>

<p>Sentiment analysis and social media analytics API provider <a href="https://www.repustate.com/" target="_blank">Repustate</a> is providing a <a href="http://blog.repustate.com/provisioning-virtual-appliances-with-vagrant/2013/08/03/">virtualized, portable, on-premise version of its API</a>--adding a new twist to the concept of API deployment.</p>
<p>Using this new approach, Repustate is targeting the 5% of their user base who do not wish to transmit their data across the Internet, possibly because of legal or security concerns, and providing them with an on-premise version of their API, configured as a portable virtual appliance.</p>
<p>While the concept of on-premise vs cloud is nothing new, packaging up your API as a virtual appliance that can run anywhere is not that common.

        <p><a href="http://www.splunk.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/splunk/splunk-logo.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>During my monitoring of the API space this week, I came across an interesting blog post from data platform <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>, <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2013/08/06/a-developers-smorgasbord/">showcasing the tools they provide for developers</a> who are putting their real-time data platform to use.</p>
<p>Splunk has an amazing smorgasbord of developer tools, but there are a handful that I feel need highlighting, so that other data API providers can consider as part of their own offerings:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Command Line Interface (CLI) -</strong> Monitor, configure and search Splunk via a terminal/shell interface or wrapping the commands in a shell script</li>
<li><strong>REST API -</strong> Most of the functionality in Splunk exposed as a suite of REST endpoints Software Development Kits (SDK) - Development kits for accelerating integration with the Splunk API in six different languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, C#</li>
<li><strong>Apps and Add-ons -</strong> Packaging up of the various configurations, searches, knowledge objects, UI components and customizations, inputs, role definitions, field extractions etc. that you might typically create via Splunk on the web</li>
<li>Scripted inputs - Out of the box, Splunk has simple generic input options available for getting data from a file or receiving data over TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Modular Inputs -</strong> Modular Inputs build upon Scripted Inputs by elevating the creation of custom input add-ons to first class citizen status in Splunk</li>
Custom search commands - Splunk&rsquo;s Search language is incredibly powerful and extensive for deriving a wide range of analytical insights from your indexed data
<li><strong>Custom alert scripts -</strong> Splunk alerting channels provided by defaults are Email and RSS. But let&rsquo;s say for example that you wanted to send alerts via SMS, to a Messaging Queue, as an SNMP or directly to a trouble ticket system</li>
<li><strong>Custom REST endpoints -</strong> Splunk&rsquo;s REST API is very thorough, but this can also be extended with your own custom REST endpoints that you could then integrate with programmatically</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously Splunk is a big data platform, so the idea of custom search and other building blocks, may not work for all API providers. Regardless this list provides some thought provoking implementations that other data API providers should look as part of their own roadmap.</p>
<p>Make sure and head over to the <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2013/08/06/a-developers-smorgasbord/">blog post that sparked this story,</a> they have other goodies like App Frameworks, and specific connectors for Apache, Spring, Flurry and a long-tail of API integration building blocks.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-umbrella.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the smart people in Washington D.C. have decided to <a href="http://api.data.gov/about/">roll their own API management solution</a>, providing their own open source solution to many of the common problems faced by API providers like issuing API keys, rate limit and provide analytics.</p>
<p>Available at <a href="http://api.data.gov/about/">api.data.gov/about</a>, but powered by an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/">API Umbrella</a>, the project aims to be a free and open API management option for federal agencies.</p>
<p>API Umbrella provides some of the most common aspects of API management:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>API Keys</li>
<li>Rate Limiting</li>
<li>Analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>The roadmap for API Umbrella is also interesting, looking to deliver:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Self-service web admin</li>
<li>Interactive documentation</li>
<li>User management</li>
<li>Granular permissions and rate limits</li>
</ul>
<p>While creating, yet another API management solution may not seem like the best idea at first, I can see why federal agencies would do it. Because of terms of use, costs and vendor lock-in with proprietary solutions, they are just seeking a simpler, cost effective alternative to solutions available in the private sector.</p>
<p>I'd love to see a blueprint established for the features available in API Umbrella, the current implementation for the gatekeeper is in Node.js and the web interface is in Ruby--it would be nice to have an open blueprint which would allow for others to contribute PHP, Python and other iterations of the same model. Providing a way for organizations to choose an option that fits with the resources they have available, while still providing interoperability.</p>
<p>It would also be great to see other city, county and state organizations adopt, deploy and evolve API Umbrella, providing a solution for other types of government organizations. I'm not intimate with the various needs of different types of government, but I'm sure there are some nuances that might make a difference.</p>
<p>As I ramp up my time working in DC this year I will spend more time getting intimate with <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/">API Umbrella</a>, as well as other open data portal solutions like <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, and hopefully provide more resources on putting these solutions to use in the real world.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-padlock.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get a lot of questions from folks about the why, when and how of securing an API. And in keeping in sync with my audience, I wanted to provide a plain english story of securing your API, avoiding &nbsp;the often enterprise, service oriented architecture (SOA) jargon, which can confuse the situation for many who are just getting their feet wet.</p>
<p>So, you have created a basic API from your data or other resource, that returns XML or JSON for users--now you want to secure it. The reasons for securing your API will vary on a case by case basis. Your might be releasing data that you only want a handful of select people to access, or you might be looking to reduce the amount of server and bandwidth resources it takes to support an API, or you might just want to intimately understand who accesses an API and why and how they are using it. Or D) All The Above!</p>
<p>There are a handful of approaches to providing access to your API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Open</strong> - Just keeping your API wide open, accessible to anyone who has the URL. Obviously this isn't secured, but provides contrast for other options</li>
<li><strong>BasicAuth</strong> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">Basic authentication</a> is a native part of HTTP and the Internet, which employs a username / password combination that is passed when accessing an API, which the server then authenticates allowing or denying access</li>
<li><strong>Key</strong> - Requiring an application or user key which is usually a combination of alpha and numeric characters, which is obtained by each developers through a API registration process, providing a unique access key for each consumer</li>
<li><strong>oAuth</strong> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">oAuth</a> is an open authorization standard, that is usually employed when there is more sensitive, user specific data available via an API. oAuth is considered to be standard approach to securing API access, but increases the technical learning curve for API users</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm also investigating <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/2013/07/29/an-alternative-to-required-api-keys">another approach that is an alternative to API keys</a>, which addresses the concerns around server and bandwidth overhead of open API access. Once I have more understanding, I will include as part of my educational materials.</p>
<p>If you are looking to just make sure you have some level of control over who accesses your API, a simple API key approach is recommended.  An API key limits who has access, while also giving you a way to track the ways each user is interacting with your API.  There are currently around <a title="20 API management providers" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">20 API management providers</a> who specialize in providing API key solutions for API providers, as well as oAuth and Basic Authentication options. If you are looking for more help on securing your API, reach out to these providers.</p>
<p>If you are deploying an API for the federal government in the United States, <a href="http://api.data.gov/about/">there is also a new option from Data.gov,</a> which provides you with a solution to the most common needs of API providers including API keys, rate limiting and analytics. I'm still working on adding this solution to my API management resources, and will have more analysis in the future.</p>
<p>This post is meant to be a very simple, non-technical overview of securing your API. If you are looking to do this on a tight budget, I recommend looking at <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>. They have a self-service, easy to implement process for getting going, but can also provide the support needed for scaling and evolving your solution.</p>
<p>When securing your API, make sure and remember that securing is not just about preventing unwanted access and abuse, but also provide you with insight into who and how developers and other users are accessing and using your data. This type of insight is critical to evolving your API strategy, so make sure you are not just securing, but also measuring and analyzing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2013</span>

<p>I've been an advocate for non-developers being one of the most important audiences for your API, since I started API Evangelist. I know us developers love to believe we are the primary force behind the success of APIs like Twitter--it is partially true, we are. But we also had the assistance of the power Twitter user in getting the good word out. Tech savvy journalists, marketing and other folks who get the platform, API, and value that lies within, while also possessing a large or very influential audience.</p>
<p>Another example of this dynamic I'm seeing unfold in slow motion is from web APIs that are driving the Excel spreadsheet. I've posted before about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/11/twitter-api-is-not-just-for-developers/">using Google Spreadsheets in conjunction with APIs</a>, and I just saw a another <a href="http://octopart.com/blog/archives/2013/7/octopart-in-excel">great example of using Microsoft Excel from the electronics parts provider Octoparts</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://octopart.com/blog/archives/2013/7/octopart-in-excel"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/octoparts/octopart-excel.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Octoparts walks us through an API to Microsoft Excel solution, that has some pretty obvioius potential, by providing a direct connection between their product catalog to customers and partners via their API and an Excel spreadsheet.  The particular approach requires the usage of <a href="https://datanitro.com/">DataNitro</a>, a plugin for Excel that allow you to run Python functions within your spreadsheets. Once installed, you can import products using the Ocotoparts APIs, complete with functions for filtering by manufacture, SKU, price and other key catalog fields.</p>
<p>This is a pretty significant example of how APIs can be used by non-developers, and specifically power Excel users. I don't know about your experience, but pretty much every industry I've worked in, is being run by Excel wielding business and marketing power users. This isn't some small group of niche developers, this group of users represents the engine of business in our everyday world.</p>
<p>Think of the potential, when we educate these everyday users about APIs, then provide them with simple API usage examples, allowing them to access the valuable resources they need within an organization or externally from partners, government and other public sources of information.</p>
<p>Much like mobile has emerged as a focus area for API providers, I predict Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet connectors will become commonplace in API ecosystems. So make sure your products and other valuable corporate resources are accessible via API for the power spreadsheet users in your supply chain.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jul 2013</span>
        <p>This is my first blog post, following a very nice week, offline in Maine. I have purposely setup the API Evangelist network to be a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">mesh network of API research project nodes</a>, allowing anyone to to start from ground zero and work their way through the different aspects of the API universe.  The dirty little secret, is I set this up to benefit me first, then you, the reader.  After I get back to the world from time off, I'm very disoriented and I need a way to start over and work my way back through all of my projects.</p>
<p>Each time I pick my research up, I need to work my way through it, refresh my memory, and hopefully constantly realign my view of the universe, not just after vacations, but on a week to week basis. So this morning I started with the 100K view of providing APIs.</p>
<p>When I started API Evangelist, I acknowledged that the technology of APIs was being worked out, and the business of APIs was something that needed researching. Now in 2013, I'm seeing the same theme emerge around the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>This venn diagram is a rough, 100K view of what I consider to reflect a healthy strategy for an API provider. Depending on each company's goals, they may give more attention to any of these building blocks.</p>

<p>If you are coming from the enterprise you will see much of this as SOA governance, which I have spoken about in the past being the legacy inverse of API management, and will continue to articulate in future stories as I can.</p>
<p>Now that I'm warmed up with the 100K view of the API space, I'm ready to finish work on my API management, discovery and integration white papers I was working on before I left, as well as my weekly API monitoring and analysis.</p>

<p>Since 2010 I have had a page on this site dedicated to "API Management". In 2013 the API universe expanded, and I've broken my work in this area into three separate, open source API research projects.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><strong>Design</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><strong>Deployment</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><strong>Management</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm grouping these projects under a single umbrella, I'm now calling "<a title="providing APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/provide/">providing APIs</a>".  If you are a company or organization looking to provide API driven resources to partners, the public or even use them for internal operations, this section is for you.</p>
<p>I will be adding several other API research areas in the near future, including:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Monetization</li>
<li>Evangelism</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Embeddable</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the projects you will find building blocks, companies, tools, news and analysis. All projects stick to my new <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format, making sure my research is open, distributable and machine readable.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/07/28/analytics-for-both-api-providers-and-consumers/">Analytics For Both API Providers and Consumers</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-analytics-2.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm going through all of my bulding blocks and tools for <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a>, as I'm updating and expanding this area of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>. After doing this work, I'm surprised that are aren't any open source or even independent analytics solutions that serve both the API provider and consumer.</p>
<p>Generally analytics for API providers and consumers are provided by one of the numerous API management providers.But what I'm looking for is stand alone analytics solutions that API providers could deploy on their own, or even an API integrator could put to use to track their own API usage across multiple APIs.</p>
<p>I learned about using <a title="StatsD" href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/">StatsD</a> and <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a> from the <a href="http://www.infochimps.com/">InfoChimps</a> team, and I've discussed the potential of using Google Analytics API as a layer of your API deployment or integration. There are also a lot of mobile analytics packages, but there is no straightforward solution for API providers and consumers.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-analytics-4.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Maybe it is because API management providers are meeting the needs of API providers, and I think the new breed of API integration providers like Runscope and TheRightAPI will be addressing the consumer side of the demand.  Or maybe I'm just not looking hard enough, and there is another solution out there.</p>
<p>At first thought, it seems logical to use Google Analytics, and track your API alongside your website operations.  It could be that these two are connected?  Regardless, with the number of public and open APIs, as well as the growing number of APIs it seems that a focused solution would emerge, and possibly an open source solution.</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm just missing some existing analytics that could be easily converted and applied to server side APIs. If you have an existing and are not using an API management solution, how do you track the usage of your API resources? I'd love to understand this more.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/KinLane-04-2012-Headshot-3-250.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I turned 41 in June. As I retool, reboot and readjust during what I guess could be called "vacation", I'm reflecting on the last year and the major shift that has gone on in my world.</p>
<p>First off, turning 40 was hard. Usually birthdays come and go without any concern, but 40 was not easy for me. I'll spare you the details, but the first half of 2012 was a very trying period, and by the time my birthday came around in June I was not a happy camper.</p>
<p>With this in mind, looking back at the last 12 months, I can see it was about transition, and preparing for the period of my life. While the first part of 2012 was an uphill drive, during the second half things seem to fall into place, allowing me to shift gears, pick up speed, setting a significantly new pace for what I see as the next decade of my life.</p>
<p>In 2010, I realized my career trajectory, after achieving a VP level position, working on SAP and Google events was not satisfying for me, and I needed a course correction. I wanted to make sure I was doing something meaningful, but spoke to my experience in architecting distributed, data driven sites and applications.</p>
<p>I had just had a very meaningful experiences in scaling architecture for SAP and Google, powered by application programming interfaces (API) and the cloud. I seen the potential of APIs, in not just designing distributed apps, but make them scalable, portable, collaborative and modular--opening up not just a new way to design web applications, but mobile applications, while also introducing companies to new, more transparent ways of conducting business.</p>
<p>Its been 3 years since I made the decision to do API Evangelist, dedicating my world to studying not just the technical, but the business and politics of providing and consuming APIs. While studying the space, I've worked hard to tell the story of my research, finding a unique voice that was informative, while also establishing enough credibility, so that people would find my research and stories something worth listening to, sharing and re-using.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/audrey-kin-paris-2.JPG" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I strongly believe there is a some amazing changes going on in business, government and our personal lives--changes that are being powered via APIs. We can make meaningful change in our world through opening up data and resources via APIs, but at the same time, the potential for great damage to privacy, markets and other negative influences exist. This intersection of the good and the bad of APIs is where I want to exist. Not being dogmatic about any particular technology or approach, but openly showcasing and discussing how APIs are being used wisely, and where APIs are being used in potentially harmful ways.</p>
<p>After two years of studying and telling stories at this intersection, last summer things started shifting. An awakening had occurred around APIs, with government taking notice, the enterprise and some of the largest global companies suddenly seeing there was something important happening here. APIs weren't just for mashups, they could truly provide the data and resources for the growing demand for web, mobile and even an Internet of things--where common objects around us are connected to the web in real-time.</p>
<p>Now in the summer of 2013, I don't feel like I need to be a cheerleader for APIs anymore, and I am allowed to evolve my approach. I want to maintain my research and monitoring of both providing and consuming APIs, keeping an eye on trends and being a champion of the priorities like government, education and healthcare. To support this, over the last year I've successfully migrated my research and storytelling to a new, agile way of reading, curating, organizing and writing of short and long form stories from the API space--while staying true to the intersection of technology, business and politics.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/Kaia-And-Me.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>While not perfect, my website(s) API Evangelist, API Voice, API Stack, Hacker Storytelling and Kin Lane make me happy in their current state. Also while not perfect, I'm happy with the financial side of my world. I don't make a lot of money, but I find enough support to make ends meet, while staying focused on what is important and staying independent of any single company or product.</p>
<p>I have spent the last 3 weeks, enjoying time with my daughter Kaia, and my partner in crime Audrey in one of our favorite places on earth, Hermosa Beach.  While I've been reading, writing and doing some coding, I've been soaking in the sun and relaxing, making sure all my projects are wrapped up, allowing my platform to go into a maintenance mode, with no new work being added.  I will just maintain the current level of monitoring, curation and publishing I've done to date. Nothing more.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, I'm getting on a plane to Boston, then driving to Maine and spend a week relaxing with Audrey's family. I'm really looking forward to this time with not just Kaia and Audrey, but also with her family in such a beautiful place, during such a perfect time of year. I couldn't be more content.</p>
<p>Once done in Maine I will come back to LA, pick up a friend of Kaia's from San Diego, and help another friend caravan to Oregon. This will end an amazing summer with Kaia.  While in Oregon I will see family, friends as well as the continued business conversations I can't help but have. Then return to Los Angeles the first week in August.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-lane-apistrat-chair.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>Just days after I return, I will move to Washington D.C., and begin my one year as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, working the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>I'm finding it hard to relax, and thoroughly enjoy my time with Kaia this summer, but I will do it.  I'm super excited about the opportunity in front of me. My 40th year was pretty stellar, but now my 41st year will be spent in our nations capital, learning how our government works and tackling some of the biggest and in my opinion, some of the most meaningful challenges we face today--supporting our veterans.</p>
<p>In contrast to last summer, this July I'm extremely grateful for the last 12 months, and I'm not just optimistic for the next year, I'm totally psyched for the wild ride that is just getting started. The momentum Audrey and I have successfully achieved over the last three years with API Evangelist and Hack Education, and now we will spend the next year in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>I can tell is going to make for a seriously wild ride for the next decade, and most definitely beyond.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/flickr.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I received an email from Flickr today about a planned API outage later this month. I'm an afficinado of the interesting ways API providers communicate around maintenance and outages within their ecosystem, and wanted to share:</p>
<blockquote><em>We see that you own an active API key for the Flickr API, and wanted to let you know that Flickr is scheduling a maintenance outage for Thursday, July 25th, from 4 to 10pm PDT.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>During the outage window, the Flickr API will be unavailable. As such, you may want to adjust your app to gracefully handle the error that will result when it calls our API during the outage. (If your app is not yet public, this will only impact your personal use of the API.)</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>Specifically, a call to the Flickr API will result in the following error: 105: Service currently unavailable (Site Disabled). Here are example responses to expect: </em><br /> <br /><em>XML (REST): <!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?--> </em><br /><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?--> <br /><em>JSONP: jsonFlickrApi({ "stat": "fail", "code": "105", "message": "Service currently unavailable (Site Disabled)" }) </em><br /><br /><em>JSON: { "stat": "fail", "code": "105", "message": "Service currently unavailable (Site Disabled)" } </em><br /></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>We hope this helps, and thank you for being a member of our API community,</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The Flickreenos</em></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to communication around your API, it can be more art, than science. I don't think there is a precise formula for keeping people informed of what is coming down the pipes with your API. But if you keep it active, personal and informative--you can do alright.</p>
<p>While the Flickr API might not be in the limelight all the time, they've been doing it a while, and I can't help but cheer for the image and photo API pioneer.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dump-truck.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have a long, winding history of database administration in my past. I've been managing databases since my first job working on school district databases in the State of Oregon in 1988.  So I've been that database administrator you are asking for data access from, and I've personally managed and interacted with too many of these DBAs to keep track.</p>
<p>I was discussing strategies for getting access to your organizations central database today, and realized I don't have enough of these data acquisition stories on API Evangelist.</p>
<p>This data access quest will start with a burning need to build a website, mobile app or provide access to a 3rd party partner to some data. You know that this data is in your organizations database, all you need is access to make your project come to life.</p>
<p>In many organizations this can be easier said than done. There could be numerous reasons why this will be difficult ranging from technical to political, and be fuly prepared for it to often be political, masked as technical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Database access bottlenecks can range from security concerns to cranky, unfriendly DBAs or possibly just that the central database system has been in operation for many years and cannot handle large number of additional requests.</p>
<p>Unwinding the politics of database access can often be more time consuming than the technical side of database access.  In many organizations your time is better spent just getting what you need and moving on.  Make it only about access, and not looking to change the legacy process.</p>
<p>This legacy is why the most common way of getting at your organizations data will be a data dump to a network or FTP location, in a CSV, XML or JSON format. If your database administrator offers this to you, take it.  You can make use of this, design the application you need need, without the headache of battling to change things or getting direct access.</p>
<p>A data dump is a great for DBA's to give you the data you requested, but offload the processing and responsibility to someone else. So take it, if it will meet your minimal requirements.</p>
<p>Once you get your data dump, build your applications datastore, API and site or application. Then at a later date, you can take your blueprint and sell it back to your database administrator, IT or further up the management chain, on how things can be done better.</p>
<p>While a data dump may not be optimal, it might be all you can get for now. A great deal of education of IT and database folks is needed, to help them understand that APIs are not all publicly available like Twitter, and they actually provide much granular level security and access than traditional IT access levels.  But we have many years of education to occur before we will change the tides.</p>
<p>So take that data dump, build your own API and application and make evolving IT a separate battle from your project goals.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/download.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've had so many discussions on this topic, I felt like I had written a post on it, but when the topic came up again today, I realized I hadn't.  This is a regular conversation I get into with open data folks, regarding whether you should deploy open data as download vs an API.</p>
<p>I'll spare you having to read my entire rant, the answer is if you can, both. You should always provide a full data download, and additionally API access when the resources are available. There is no versus argument, there are scenarios where both are valuable and offer benefits over the other.</p>
<p>As a developer, I just want quick, complete access to data. I'm always in a hurry to just get to work, and I have the skills to parse, store, transform this data for whatever reason I will need. So let's just get to work.  Give me a download and get the hell out of my way. Pretty straight forward logic.  This is all true, but it is a very short-sighted, narrowly focused perspective and shouldn't impede larger, long term goals around data acquisition, management and access.</p>
<p>Taking your data, keying it up, and asking users to request a key and access via an API, might be a wall for the eager alpha dev, but there are many that could benefit from well thought out API end points, search &amp; filtering tools and the ability to offload all operations to someone else. Not all developers will be equipped to deal with the overhead of a full download.</p>
<p>Looking at it from a different vantage point, as a steward of data, an API can provide you with some very granular analytics on how people are using your data or even, not properly using your data. This valuable insight can provide an extreme amount of value in the future of how you gather your data, organize and make accessible. This is something you will never get from a single bulk download.</p>
<p>Many data folks argue that you can just rely on forums, IRC, Twitter to get feedback on this, no API needed.  Again this is the single perspective from an alpha developer who will actively participate in these channels and offer insight. In reality, this is a small percentage of any ecosystem, and in my experience users don't usually offer feedback.</p>
<p>Secondarily if you are dealing with large datasets and large user bases, dealing with human feedback channels are expensive, something that can also done with API analytics in a cost effective, scalable way. And don't think I'm arguing for not using these channels, I'm saying don't overburden them unnecessarily. They are still very important.</p>
<p>The best example of this, that I use in the wild, is with U.S. Census Data. A couple years ago I had conversations with database folk at the Census, and asked them their thoughts on how innovators like Google are using census data for flu tracking, and news outlets are merging with their data to track on politics, immigration and other relevant issues. The response was, "we are familiar with some of this, but honestly haven't heard of many of these usage scenarios".</p>
<p>I asked why they don't launch an API alongside of downloads, require developers to get a key, then utilize API analytics to provide insight into other use cases around census data. You still don't have visibility into all use cases, but you'd get another group of interesting integrations.</p>
<p>The response was quickly, NO! The Census has to balance the trust of being gatherers and keepers of this data, we can't lock it up or apply any interpretation on top of the data. We need to remain a neutral party. (They now have an API, but that is another story)</p>
<p>Ok. I get that.  But don't you want to make the census a more efficient process? Possibly completely digital? Or be able to gather new data points that could help people better understand health, educational, race or other issues that are reflected in our society?  An API isn't always about control (it can be), an API can be about understanding and empower sensible stewardship of data, providing the insight you might need to make the process better.</p>
<p>Every person I've had this discussion with is coming from an alpha developers perspective, who quickly wants access to data and has the skills and resources to get it done. They are not thinking about the rest of developers, or the stewards of this data and the lifelong process that goes into making data acquisition, transformation and publishing better for everyone involved.</p>
<p>So when you are thinking about data download vs. API, remember, if you have the resources, you should do both. A download is a great place to start, but the overall health of your data will be better off if you can introduce the more granular level access and the measurement that an API can deliver.</p>

<p>I'm rapidly expanding the areas I track on in the world of APIs, trying to understand the myriad ways APIs are influencing <a title="interoperability between companies and platforms" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">interoperability between companies and platforms</a>, being <a title="applied alongside voice" href="http://voice.apievangelist.com">applied alongside voice</a> or used in <a title="automobiles" href="http://automobile.apievangelist.com/">automobiles</a>,&nbsp;our <a title="homes" href="http://home.apievangelist.com">homes</a>, and beyond.</p>
<p>One area I'm currently researching, is on API usage in the very hyped world of data. I'm wading through numerous startups, looking for innovative approaches to data + APIs. One specific area of this research, that I'm hoping to have published soon is around API driven data analytics.</p>
<p>To provide a quick glimpse into what I mean when I talk about the future of data analytic APIs, I wanted to showcase two startups that resemble what I see coming down the pipes:</p>

<p>While these companies are providing pretty straightforward analytic solutions that run in the cloud, what I find innovative is their flexible data sources. Much like <a title="reciprocity providers are evolving ETL (Extract Transfer Load)" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">reciprocity providers are evolving ETL (Extract Transfer Load)</a>, moving beyond just internal data sources, to API driven cloud sources--this new breed of analytics providers are allowing you to visualize your data, directly from the cloud platforms where the data is generated and stored.</p>

This new breed of API driven analytic companies are going to help us get there.</p>
<p>Look for more research published on this in the near future.</p>

<p>As an evangelist, your responsibility is to get the word out about an API, and provide users with the resources they will need to be successful.</p>
<p>While executing on your evangelism strategy, there are numerous ways to generate stories for your blog, but one of my favorite approaches is to cherry pick the best issues on your Github repositories.</p>
<p>If you are like me, your <a title="using Github repos to manage everything from documentation and code samples to presentations and terms of use" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">using Github repos to manage everything from documentation and code samples to presentations and terms of use</a>. One of the perks of using Github, is you immediately gain the benefits of the Github issue management system.</p>
<p>While many of the issues submitted on your Github repos will be mundane and not very story-worthy. Always keep an eye out for ones that are ripe for picking and turning into an actual stories for your blog and social media accounts.</p>
<p>Earlier today, I received some great feedback via the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist/issues">issue management system on the API Evangelist repo</a>.  Ben Balter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@benbalter</a>) from Github recommended that I <a title="use a permalink frontmatter to simplify my file structure" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/2013/07/17/jekyll-use-permalink-frontmatter-to-simplify-file-structure/">use a permalink frontmatter to simplify my file structure</a>. In my migration from a PHP blog to using Jekyll on Github Pages, I hadn't considered this, and when I learn something new, I want to share it by crafting into a story and posting it on the blog.</p>
<p>Not only will this Github issue become a story, providing much needed SEO and education for my users, I will also turn this into a more structured resource, and provide as part of future educational content.</p>
<p>Pulling stories and educational content from relevant Github issues can be a great way to generate valuable content for your platform, and if it is done in real-time it isn't really that much work.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/07/16/the-next-iteration-of-government-data/">The Next Iteration of Government Data</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://next.data.gov/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/data-gov/next-data-gov-screenshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Our federal government is working on the next iteration of <a title="Data.gov" href="http://data.gov">Data.gov</a>, and just published a first look at what is being called <a href="http://next.data.gov/">Next.Data.Gov</a>. This next version is meant to build off the momentum of the recent <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/">open data policy</a>, which is looking to embed open data practices across our federal government, changing the way it operates.</p>
<p>To plan for the next iteration of Data.gov, the General Services Administration (GSA), a handful of Presidential Innovation Fellows, and OSTP staff studied usage patterns from the last version, and discovered that people were hungry for more examples of how government data is used. Equipped with this understanding, they are making sure the next version included a communication stream that will enable each data community to communicate how datasets are being used and making an impact.</p>
<p>The Data.Gov team also updated the search, adding data visualizations using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, used  open source fonts and implemented a responsive design for Next.Data.Gov.  Next.Data.Gov is also built on top of both Wordpress and CKAN, delivering the CMS and data management capabilities, using proven open source tools.</p>
<p>Beyond the approach to requirements gather, responsive design and adopting open source tools, what I think is the most important aspect of Next.Data.Gov is that the planning, design and deployment process is open and collaborative--which has the potential to alter how our government conducts business on a daily business.</p>
<p>The next iteration of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OUR</span></strong> federal government data portal is being planned publicly using Github, Quora and Twitter. Historically much of our government planning process is done behind closed doors, by government agencies, with the assistance of contractors. The innovation I'm seeing come from washington in the form of <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/">Open Data Policy</a>, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/healthcaregov-code-developed-by-the-people-and-for-the-people-released-back-to-the-people/277295/">Healthcare.gov</a> and now Next.Data.Gov makes me very optimistic for the future of how our government works, and I am honored to be going to DC to help.</p>
<p>If we can tackle the process of opening up government, agency by agency, project by project, make the process as open and collaborative as possible, we will be able to tackle this together. These sites, applications and platforms are not just using open data, open APIs and open source--the process for planning, deployment and management is an open, collaborative process between government, private sector and the public.</p>
<p>Make sure and get involved, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is up to all of us</span> to make sure this works.</p>

<p>When I first started API Evangelist, I quickly saw that there was more to this whole API game, beyond just the technology. Simple, logical, technological solutions like REST and JSON are essential, but there was more to the success of an API than just the tech behind.</p>
<p>After looking at hundreds of the most successful APIs, one pattern for success consistently emerged, storytelling. The most successful API platforms like Amazon, Twitter and Twilio all had one thing in common, stories were told about how their APIs were being used, and the value that was created.</p>
<p>While reading the story <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/16/the-next-iteration-of-government-data/">around the Federal Government redesign of Data.gov</a> I was happy to see a major revelation that came from requirements gathering for the next iteration called <a title="Next.Data.Gov" href="http://Next.Data.Gov">Next.Data.Gov</a>. Where after studying usage patterns around <a href="http://data.gov">Data.gov</a>, the redesign team found that many visitors were hungry for stories of how government data was being used, looking for clear examples of the potential of open government data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storytelling is essential for any open data or API platform. Consumers need examples of how data and resources are currently being used. A process that will stimulate the imagination and increase the potential for new ideas and development.</p>
<p>I can't stress enough the importance of storytelling. If you do not have the resources to tell your own stories, make sure there are ways that the community can tell their own stories.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter how solid your technological implementation is, if there aren't stories for users to discover and learn about the potential of open data and API resources, even the best platform implementation will fail.</p>
<p>So go forth and tell the stories of your API, and the value it has created.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Jul 2013</span>
        <p>I've been trying to organize my thoughts around emerging trends in using virtualized app containers, that are providing a much more modular approach to deploying and managing application backends. This is an evolution of earlier thoughts I've had around <a title="virtualized API stacks" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>.</p>
<p>From the last week, I'm looking at three separate approaches to application and API management using virtualized containers:</p>
<p><a href="http://docker.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/docker/docker-logo.gif" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.docker.io/">Docker - The Linux Container Engine</a></strong><br />Docker is an open-source engine which automates the deployment of applications as highly portable, self-sufficient containers. Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic, allowing them to run anywhere, freeing you from having to use a particular language, framework or packaging system--making them great building blocks for deploying and scaling web apps, databases and backend services without depending on a particular stack or provider.</p>
<p><a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/heroku/heroku-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/7/10/heroku-pipelines-beta">Heroku - Application Instances with Portable Features and Dependencies</a></strong><br />Heroku fork lets you create unique, running instances of existing applications in a single command, making it fast and simple to set up homogenous development, staging and production environments. Heroku pipelines then lets you define the relationship between apps and easily promote  from one app to another using what is known as a "slug". On Heroku, a slug is a bundle of your source, fetched dependencies, the language runtime, and compiled/generated output of the build system, ready for execution in development or production environments.</p>
<p><a href="http://stackmob.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/stackmob/stackmob-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://blog.stackmob.com/2013/07/ready-set-deploy-with-stackmob-apps/">StackMob - BaaS Development and Production Workflows</a></strong><br /> StackMob has its own unique approach application development workflow which includes use integrated SDKs, and custom configuration for establishing an applications separate development and production environments. Then using this separate environment, Stackmob offers multiple concurrent APIs in production through the use of API snapshots which ensures backwards compatibility of your app over time.</p>
<p>Docker, definitely offers the widest opportunity for what I'm talking about because it is an open source container solution. But it is interesting to see how Heroku is applying this concept to app management at the PaaS level, and how Stackmob is providing a very portable, flexible and backwards compatible API stack for use at the BaaS level.</p>
<p>While we have a long way to go, I think we are getting closer to being able to easily define, meaningful stacks of API resources. I envision a future where I can set out to build an app, bring together exactly the API driven resources I will need from private and public resources, into a single virtualized stack.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>As a developer I will be able to deploy this stack in development or production environments, take advantage of single application authentication approach without having to go out to each API and get separate application tokens.</p>
<p>Virtualized API resource stacks will have all the monitoring, versioning, scalability I will need allowing me to run them in any environment, helping me keep track of changes and evolution not just in the stack of resources, but also my applications.</p>
<p>These virtualized stacks can be designed for web, mobile or tablets as well as any Internet of Things implementation providing me with instant, secure, modular backends for home, car, sensor and any Internet connected object we can dream up in the future.</p>

<p>I was working my way through all the Dropbox news that came out of the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/dbx">DBX Conference</a> over the weekend. There was some pretty savvy moves by the cloud storage provider, continuing its evolution towards being the default storage for web and mobile applications.</p>
<p>After reading this weekend, I have three key stories still open in tabs:</p>

<p>Dropbox is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/24/dropbox-as-your-apps-default-file-system/">already the preferred choice for app storage system</a> for many developers, but with the introduction of the datastore API, they will definitely be stepping up the integration of Dropbox into future apps.</p>
<p>For the end users, the ability to save files to dropbox and choose files from their mobile devices will only increase their demand for native Dropbox functionality in web and mobile apps--feeding the cycle.</p>
<p>The combination of making developers lives easier, while also providing the features that end users needs will continue to establish Dropbox as a default file system API for application developers.</p>

        <p>I'm always looking for dead simple examples of what an API is to help average folk understand what APIs are, and how they can be applied in their worlds.</p>
<p>My current research on <a title="BaaS" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">backend as a service providers (BaaS)</a> providers a great example. On my research site i provide listing of BaaS providers for my readers:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/baas/example-api-baas.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>This listing of companies is a pretty common occurence on the web. As a web developer, if I want to show this listing I use HTML, which is markup that provides a visual formatting for this listing:</p>

<p>HTML makes content presentable for humans. Now if I want to make this same content available for other web sites and applications, instead of using HTML, I will use another open format called JSON, which is easy for other computers and applications to consume.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/baas/example-api-baas-json.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>In this particular case, I provide an HTML listing of BaaS providers, as well as a JSON listing. I actually use the JSON file to display the HTML, using a JavaScript templating library called <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to a static HTML and JSON listing of BaaS providers, I also provide an API which returns the same content as the JSON file, but allows you to do queries and get only the BaaS companies you are looking for. All of my data works this wa by providing:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hacker-storytelling/machine-readable-toolbar.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>HTML</strong> - An HTML listing meant for humans to view.</li>
<li><strong>JSON</strong> - A JSON listing meant for developers to use in other sites and apps.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong> - An API allowing querying, filtering and other dynamic access.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process always starts with API driven data, and I produce the HTML from my APIs. This is the beauty of API first. You can generate your web content from it, being the first user of all your APIs. Then encourage others to syndicate content by providing them with simple scripts for displaying HTML listings, driven from JSON and / or your API.</p>
<p>The only difference between web site content and an API is the resulting output, if it is a website--we use HTML. If its an API--we use JSON. Both websites and APIs using the same mechanisms of the web, specifically HTTP to deliver this data.</p>
<p>To provide machine readable JSON version of your content, or even more dynamic representations via APIs, you don't need special technology or skills. If you are developing websites, you have the skills to make the same content machine readable and potentially much more syndicatable, re-usable and accessible with APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hacker-storytelling/open-machine-readable.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>The primary reason I'm switching all of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/01/the-expanding-api-evangelist-network/">35+ research projects</a> in the API space to my new <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format, is to make everything I do open and machine readable by default.</p>
<p>Every project I'm working on is a Github project, with the public side of the research always available via an API Evangelist subdomain and pointed at a Github page. I publish a series of static pages, wrapped in an API evangelist template, combined with a blog to help organize my curated news and analysis in a chronological way.</p>
<p>Along with all the pages and blog I make all data available as JSON files, which I display across the research project using JavaScript templates.  My goal is to make every bit of my research machine readable by default, and ensure the widest possible re-use and distribution.</p>
<p>One active example of this in the wild, is my r<a title="Backend as a service" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">esearch around backend as a service</a>, also known as Baas. I've been monitoring all the providers in the space for the last year, and tracking on some of the common building blocks they use, much like I have been doing with APIs for last three years.</p>
<p>As part of my BaaS research I've published two datasets:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="BaaS Providers" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/companies.html">BaaS Providers</a></li>
<li><a title="Common Building Blocks of BaaS Providers" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">Building Blocks</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hacker-storytelling/machine-readable-toolbar.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>You can view the data on the website, using JavaScript templates that display the JSON data on HTML pages. When you view the page that lists the BaaS providers or the common BaaS building blocks, you can choose to get at the data behind the display as JSON, via API, as well as being able to grab the script I use to display the JSON data.</p>
<p>All of my research is ongoing, and I publish news, analysis and new companies and research on a regular basis. My goal with this evolving approach, is to remove machine readable from being after thought, making it default in all my work.</p>
<p>With data available via JSON and API, everything published publicly via Github, in lightweight formats like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON, combined with a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY licensing</a>, everything in my world is open and machine readable by default.</p>

        <h1>Building Blocks</h1>
<p>At API Evangelist I define things in terms of building blocks, meant to establish, easy to understand modules you can pick and choose from as part of any strategy, including API management. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2010 I started API Evangelist as a research project to look at how the top 250 popular APIs were doing business. I spent the summer of 2010 looking at these API providers and established a list of building blocks I found each provider using to manage their API operations.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining this list for 3 years now, looking at over 9,000 APIs and assessing the building blocks used by the top 2,000 APIs. I've tried to standardize these and establish a potential list that any API provider could consider when planning their own API management strategy.</p>
<p>These are the most common examples of API management building blocks.</p>

        <p><em>After looking back at 2012, I wanted a January 1, 2013 blog post for my blogs.  My first blog post of 2012 was my tour schedule for January, 2012.

I&rsquo;m not sure what, but I will play with the format year to year, until I find what I&rsquo;m looking for.</em></p>
<p><em>Every year I rewrite my bio, based upon where I am.  I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 2009.   This year I will write inaugural blog posts along with my bio rework, and post to each of my active blogs.  We&rsquo;ll see if it resonates again in 12 months and I do it again in 2014.</em></p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-voice/Tag-Cloud-API-Voice.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I started API Voice because I believe the politics of APIs is one of the most important areas that will make or break the API space.  APIs are not just technical.  There are a wide range of political issues facing companies when it comes to APIs.</p>
<p>The politics of APIs can range from terms of service issues to potential government regulation.  We are seeing the politics of APIs play out in the Twitter ecosystem and in the U.S. legal system with Oracle vs. Google.</p>
<p>My understanding of the politics of APIs still evolving.  I started API Voice in May 2012 to help me understand it more.  I&rsquo;m still trying to quantify all the areas, but so far the politics of APIs can include terms of use, data portability, branding, privacy, business models, service level agreements (SLA), acquisitions, copyright, regulation, patent and the ubiquitous, magical term &ldquo;open&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When I started <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I wanted to provide a platform for research into the business of APIs.  Over two years I&rsquo;ve begun to solidify some perspective on the space, and form clear opinions around potential best practices.  With API Voice, I want to do the same for the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>At this point, all I can do is write about things as they unfold--as APIs are acquired and as they make the terms of service changes that impact developers.  API Voice is in its infancy, and I will be working to cover as many of what unfolds in 2013 as I can.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel that 2013 is going to be a big year when it comes to the politics of APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/openi/openi-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with an important group in the European Union called <a title="OPENi" href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/">OPENi</a>, which is aiming to be an open-source, web-based, framework for integrating applications with cloud-based services via APIs. Straight from the organization's mouth:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi aims at inspiring innovation in the European mobile applications industry, by radically improving the interoperability of cloud-based services and trust in personal cloud storage through the development of a consumer-centric, open source mobile cloud applications platform.</em></blockquote>
<p>I will be providing feedback and guidance as a member of the group's user advisory board. While on the call today, there was a mention of concerns around being seen as the usual, heavy handed EU entity that is too focused on user privacy and ownership, which could prevent the group from being well received, but also ignore the economic opportunities APIs and interoperability afford businesses, developers and end users.</p>
<p>This is a reminder for me of how EU tech companies, and the countries where they reside, are often perceived around the globe and here in the US. But also stands in stark contrast to the illness I see from the Silicon Valley, and U.S side of the discussion. In a world where everything is about economic opportunity, and the data in these API pipes are the new oil, aka the new resource, that is meant to be extracted, with little or no concern for privacy and ownership of the end-users.</p>
<p>In 2014, there is a huge opportunity for all of us to meet in the middle, acknowledging that there is great economic opportunity around APIs, cloud services, interoperability and the data that flows between platforms. But there is even greater economic opportunity if we acknowledge and respect the privacy, ownership of users of the web, mobile and Internet of Things we develop in the cloud.</p>
<p>I would also add a 3rd dimension to this discussion. That there is also a massive non-commercial opportunity for APIs, interoperability and cloud services. When it comes to more efficient government, healthcare, education, journalism, media  and other aspects of our society, if we can better educate end-users, developers and platform owners while also improve technological approaches by honing concepts like hypermedia, licensing and ownership models defined on top of oAuth--everyone in the game will benefit.</p>
<p>There is a lot at stake right now. <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/06/27/i-dont-see-things-as-black-or-white/">It isn't black or white, but many, may shades of gray</a>. It is not all about privacy and ownership, or all about making money. APIs enable interoperability, data portability, transparency and openness that can really benefit society as well as open up opportunities for economic growth for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Even after 3 years doing this, I still get very hopeful for the potential of APIs on the global landscape. I predict 2014 will be a critical year.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://salesforce.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/salesforce/salesforce-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The world of API management is expanding, and to support this growth I've broke up my research into three separate buckets: <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, <a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a> and <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a>.</p>
<p>Zooming in on API deployment, one of the ares I'm looking to educate the masses about, is quick and dirty API deployment using existing PaaS. Providing ways for companies, and their internal problem owners to rapidly deploy APIs via their existing tools and services.</p>
<p>One great example I recently found is from Jeff Douglas (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeffdonthemic">@jeffdonthemic</a>), Platform Architect <a title="Cloudspokes" href="https://twitter.com/CloudSpokes">@CloudSpokes</a> &amp; Sr. Tech. Consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/Appirio">@Appirio</a>, on <a href="http://blog.jeffdouglas.com/2013/07/02/build-a-public-api-on-force-com/">using Heroku to deploy an API from your Salesforce organization</a>. Jeff's walkthrough is a little choppy, but it is full of extremely valuable nuggets of information, and he says he's working on a more polished version of it to present.</p>
<p>The approach is pretty straightforward. You are simply deploying an API on Heroku, that uses code to make calls to your Salesforce account via the Salesforce Apex API.  The API you launch on the Heroku PaaS platform will abstract away your custom code that you use to pull specific Salesforce resources, allowing you to scale and securely deliver existing data in your Salesforce platform, and ultimately use Saleforce as an administrative interface for your API(s).</p>
<p>Jeff gives examples of how you can do this in Ruby, Node.js and even Java, and talks about approaches to versioning the API and providing documentation.  He also recommends that for higher traffic APIs you should look at existing <a title="API management companies" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API management companies</a> to help you secure, meter, develop service packages, and provide you with billing and analytics options.</p>
<p>I'd like to see starter kits developed in PHP, Python, Ruby, Node and Java that allow for quick API deployment using data from Saleforce on not just Heroku, but other popular PaaS platforms like Amazon and Google.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies who use Salesforce to manage vital resources, and providing the business and marketing folks within these organizations with blueprints to quickly make these resources available via APIs, is important to equipping them to solve the big data and mobile challenges they are facing.</p>

<p>Simple, embeddable tools can be one of the most powerful tool in an API evangelists toolbox.  While there was a wide variety of forces that were at play in the social API evolution, contributing to the success of Twitter and Facebook, embeddable buttons, badgers widgets definitely played a leading role.</p>
<p>One embeddable implementation that will go down in history alongside the Twitter share button and Facebook like button, is the <a href="https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons">Github Ribbon</a>. The Github Ribbon is the thin little ribbon you are increasingly seeing on projects, sites and applications (notice them rolling out across the <a title="API Evangelist Network" href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>), letting you know you that a site's source is available on Github, and available for you to download or fork.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons">Github has created a simple page where you can find an assortment of embeddable Github Ribbons</a>, in multiple colors and positioning. If you are not satisfied with the colors, they also provide the PSD and even the original font that is used. A complete, fully branded, embeddable tool that encourages use.</p>
<p>While I actually prefer the simplicity of the Github Ribbons, my only suggestion to Github would be to either provide JavaScript version or tracking image version, that would allow each Github Ribbon to ping home. You could also integrate with the Github API to offer tighter repository integration. Think of the network visualizations you could create, mapping out the distributed world of Github implementations across languages, countries, etc.</p>
<p>Even without the tracking and API integration, Github Ribbons is an extremely powerful approach to branding, and great example of using embeddable tools in the wild.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2013</span>
        <p>APIs are providing much needed access and visibility into the backend technology that is increasingly driving our desktops, laptops, mobile phones and beginning its migration into our homes, cars and our personal self. APIs aren't just something for developers to play with, they crack open the often black box of IT and technology, making it accessible to everyone.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-transparency-1.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Without APIs, none of this happens. APIs provide visibility into what many businesses would like to keep hidden from us, taking away our privacy, ownership and ability to hold companies, government and developers accountable for what they do with our personal and private data, and ultimately how they extract value for our world.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-transparency-2.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>APIs are not perfect, they can be used for bad, and just because a company has an API, doesn't mean everything is on the up and up. However APIs introduce the ability for us to have 3 legged conversations, where platforms, 3rd parties and end users can have conversations about how are worlds are being connected and accessed in real-time.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-three-legged-v2.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>These conversations are critical to how our increasingly technology driven world will evolve. Technology can be good when it is applied in sensible, safe wayss, taking into consideration all parties involved. Without the oxygen and sunlight introduced by APIs, infections can be introduced that can prove bad for users, developers and even deadly to the overall platform.</p>
<p>I am all for APIs being used in our desktop, laptop and mobile computing and within the Internet of Things that is taking hold of our cars, homes and even our bodies. But let's make sure we do it in a way that promotes the healthiest ecosystems for everyone involved. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have <a title="Netflix API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">written about the well publicized failure of the Netflix public API</a>&nbsp;before, and how in the API space things are often not what they seem. By my measurement Netflix is a massive API success story, it is just not the classsic open API success story we all really want to be true.</p>
<p>In the end the experiment that was the Netflix API didn't pan out, but that is ok.  Netflix has found success with APIs internally, something I think will be the case with the majority of companies embarking on an API odyssey. And with Netflix continuing to tell the story of their successes and failures, everyone can learn from their hard work.</p>
<p>As I continue to follow the Netflix API story, I'm seeing new narrative emerge, one that is equally about open source software, than about open APIs. When I do my monitoring I am constantly seeing new blog posts coming from the Netflix tech blog, announcing the latest OSS release from the Netflix tech team.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/netflix/netflix-open-source-center.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Netflix is up to 34 public repositories currently, and before you dig into the details of their releases, Netflix also wins in the presentation of their Github open source site. Nice job!!</p>
<p>I wish someone would dive deeper into everything Netflix is releasing.  At first glance it looks like like everything I have been asking for when it comes to open source software for the API management space. Netflix isn't in the space of offering API management as a service, but they run one of the biggest API platforms out there--resulting in some serious skills, experience and technology.</p>
<p>If I had more time I'd go through the Netflix Open Source Center and see how it all applies to the larger API picture. As with the rest of the Netflix story, I'm sure there are some great lessons in what they are producing.</p>

<p>I've been slowly evolving API Evangelist from a single site, into an interconnected network of individual API projects.  API Evangelist started as a research project back in July 2010, making its shift to be a network of smaller, inter-connected research projects is fitting.</p>
<p>While API Evangelist currently still runs on my home brew CMS, shortly it will finish the migration to completely run on Github, making it merely a "hollywood front" for what is c<a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/07/01/the-expanding-api-evangelist-network/">urrently 37+ API related, living research projects</a> of mine.</p>
<p>I call my evolving approach to projects, <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>. I made up the name, but the approach is borrowed from several other philosophies which starts with concept of data journalism, but then has also evolved from conversations last year in Washington DC from very smart folks including Ben Balter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a>), Gray Brooks (<a href="https://twitter.com/gbinal">@gbinal)</a>, and the very forward thinking work of the <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a> team.  Then of course I add my own style and approach to what I've learned.</p>
<p>As I move my own network of research projects to run on Github, using this new approach, I'm also seeing other positive signs coming out of Washington on the same front.  First the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/">White House Open Data Policy</a> released in May was created and published on Github, but then I just finished reading <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/healthcaregov-code-developed-by-the-people-and-for-the-people-released-back-to-the-people/277295/">Healthcare.gov: Code Developed by the People and for the People, Released Back to the People</a>, by Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>). His post outlines how the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)launched Healthcare.gov to support the Affordable Care Act -- AKA "Obamacare".  The website was built iteratively, in public, over the last couple months and it was completely done using Github, using a similar approach to my Hacker Storytelling.  Seeing all of this, really makes me hopeful for my next year in Washington.</p>
<p>Alex does an amazing job of telling the story behind Healthcare.gov, I highly recommend reading his post. After reading, I wanted take a fresh walk through my approach, and talk about the importance of this new approach managing my projects, that I think will change the web, how we govern and conduct business.</p>
<p>My personal approach is derived from a need to quickly turn research into public stories, allowing people to take my work and put it to use in their worlds. Since my mission is to educate the masses of the benefits of APIs, and reach the largest audience possible, I needed a new approach that was fast, efficient and scaled--the result is Hacker Storytelling.</p>
<p>To manage my projects and tell my stories, I'm using a handful of building blocks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blog Posts</li>
<li>Static Pages </li>
<li>Widgets</li>
<li>Open Data</li>
<li>Presentations</li>
</ul>
<p>The best part about these building blocks is that they only use, lightweight, open protocols:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>JSON</li>
</ul>
<p>Each project becomes an open source repository, that I host at Github. Some projects start as private repositories, but if possible <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EVERYTHING</strong></span> becomes public.  If you are unfamiliar with how Github and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> works, Github is a cloud service that provides version control for code. However since code is usually just files, you can apply the same open source code process to web site or documents you can build with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.</p>
<p>I don't know about you. But I can build some pretty fast websites, prototype applications and even full blown production apps in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.  If you want to see the extreme version of what I'm doing, head over to <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a> and see what they are up to.  They are producing some mind blowing projects, using this approach</p>
<p>The really powerful thing about all of this, is this can run anywhere. You can run the <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2011/08/Jekyll-amazon-s3.html">same configuration of site on Amazon S3</a>, Dropbox, or anywhere you can setup hosting. This isn't just something for alpha geeks, look closer at the Amazon S3 example, that is the CTO of Amazon running his blog using this approach.</p>
<p><strong><em>So why am I doing this?</em></strong> There are so many reason, and to help me wrap my head further around them, I thought I would take a crack at listing as many as I could.</p>
<p><strong>Decoupling</strong> <br />This approach to my research and storytelling has allowed me to decouple the individuals pieces of my original API Evangelist work, which after three years has become very bloated.  I have a lot of content and structured data about the API industry. This has allowed me to decouple one very big project into 35 smaller projects, with the potential for many more in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Planning</strong> <br />When I kick off a new project, I start off the planning process with a new Github repository, with a fresh README file.  Then using the native Github features I can make the project public or private and invite other people to join me in the planning process.  The README quickly becomes an outline, giving a backbone to my project.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong> <br />Once a project has been kicked off, I kick of researching and publishing all notes, bookmarks and other relevant assets to Github after each session.  Pretty soon there is a wealth of knowledge located within the repository, with every step of the way versioned, allowing me to manage additions, removals and potential conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong> <br />Github has made the process of developing open source software, a social adventure.  You can create repositories within individual Github accounts or underneath the umbrella of an organization.  You can invite any other Github user to participate in the process, using open source software process, built into Github. Once you make public, you can also add <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and solicit public comments, if if so desired.</p>
<p><strong>Versioned</strong> <br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> is the central core of Github. Git was developed by Linus Torvalds to help him manage the developed of the open source operating system, Linux. Every document that is submitted to a Git(hub) repository, is versioned, allowing you to manage changes, accept contributions and even roll back to earlier versions when necessary. Git is well suited to open source, collaborative software development, but also works well for many other types of projects as well.</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling</strong> <br />My approach, that of <a href="http://Healthcare.gov">Healthcare.gov</a>, and Development Seed all uses <a href="/admin/blog/design.apievangelist.com">Jekyll</a> alongside each project deployment.  Jekyll is a simple, blog aware static site framework that runs very well on Github. Jekyll gives you a very simple, but powerful way to manage your pages as well as maintain a blog.  This has changed my view of what a blog is for, making it as simple as four chronological journal entries for a single project or powering the 800+ blog entries of API Evangelist.  Jekyll was actually developed by Tom Preston-Warner, the founder of Github, but the framework is so univeral it can run anywhere such as Amazon S3 and Dropbox.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong> <br />While this approach is not for everyone. I enjoy making projects open by default from birth to death. Hosting on Github, allowing it to be licensed openly and allowing collaboration and public input makes for a healthier overall project.  Transparency can let the sunlight into any process, providing a sort of disinfectant to the overall process. Something I feel is essential in all my work.</p>
<p><strong>Living Projects </strong><br />Most of the projects I embark on will be living, allowing me to keep updated weekly, monthly or as often as necessary.  Because I can open up projects to collaborators and public feedback, it opens up my work to even live beyond the attention I can give the project.  I can even transfer ownership and administration of a project to someone else, or they can fork my work and take in an entirely new direction, breathing life into my work I could never imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Portable</strong> <br />Each Github repository can be forked or downloaded as a zip file.  Allowing the entire project to be moved, unpacked and setup at a new location--not in hours but often in minutes. This type of portability is essential in this crazy, cloud based world we've created for ourselves.  It also allows me to easily deploy a project within the firewall of a company or government agency.</p>
<p><strong>Syndication</strong> <br />Github possesses one of the most powerful syndication tools, which is called "forking". Any Github user can fork one of my projects and set to work making it their own. Adding to it, cleaning it up and when appropriate make "pull requests" back to the original project, which allows me potentially to accept their work back into the central copy. After I add common social sharing tools, and you consider the native social features built into Github, this approach offers unlimited potential for syndication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics</strong> <br />Each project I fire up, gets Google Analytics added. Allowing me to track all traffic and usage of my projects. Beyond the page views, visits and other common metrics, Github gives me a whole other layer of metrics for tracking how many favorites, forks, downloads, commits and other vital data about how projects are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Common Formats </strong><br />Every project I build uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON. All of these common formats can be opened by simple text editors and do not require any proprietary software to create, access or edit. HTML and CSS is very accessible to many, and depending on how tech savvy you are, JavaScript and JSON are pretty easy to wield, with a little training.</p>
<p><strong>Open By Default </strong><br />Everything is open by default. Publicly available, collaboration, open formats and open licenses go a long way in setting the right tone for a project. Open by default takes away a lot of stress for me, and opens projects up for the widest possible collaboration, re-use, distribution and ultimately attribution to me and my work.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Readable By Default </strong><br />All data is stored via simple, lightweight JSON files. Every listing, chart, graph within a project has a JSON data source. The entire contents of a project can have a simple JSON manifest, allowing programmatic indexing of a project's content and data sources.  Machine readable by default, using JSON has changed the way I look at data management.</p>
<p><strong>Scalable</strong> <br />I do not have to scale the infrastructure for any my projects. I've run IT infrastructure for years and very capable in doing this for myself, but I don't have time. All projects automatically are scaled as needed, to meet, not just my projects demands, but everyone on the platform. For me, the backend has been reduced to my internal systems and a handful of APIs. Everything that is public is automatically scaled in the clouds.</p>
<p><strong>Speed</strong> <br />The usage of simple, light-weight open formats like HTML, CSS, JavaSCript and JSON. Plus all the benefits of the Github platform. Equal a pretty sweet opportunity for fast loading web pages. Everything is easily cached, providing for very fast page loads in addition to scalability. If projects are hosted on Amazon S3, there are additional opportunities for caching and distribution of content to regions around the globe using CloudFront.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong> <br />Along with the need to run back-end infrastructure, much of the concern with securing sites and applications goes away. I'm pretty confident that Github, Amazon and Dropbox have fairly decent security teams and with all projects being static sites and apps, using open formats, much of the opportunity for exploitation has been removed.</p>
<p><strong>Low Cost </strong><br />Github repositories are free, if they are public. Another incentive for being open by default. Even if you pay for repositories with Github, the costs are dollars each month. Amazon and Dropbox are both extremely affordable, further evolving past models for web hosting or rolling out costly infrastructure for projects. The cloud has enabled entirely new approaches deploying web sites, applications, as well as content and data oriented projects.</p>
<p><strong>Lifecycle</strong> <br />The entire life cycle of my projects has changed for the positive. I can start new projects, on a whim. Fire up new repository and generate an outline during planning stages, invite all participants and have a public site up in minutes. Some projects I work on for hours each week, others I give just minutes a month to make sure they have my latest research published. I can easily walk away from projects, passing the torch and potentially keeping a project alive.  Projects can be forked, downloaded and evolved, adding layers to the lifecycle that are totally out of my control. The potential for my research and stories to reach a larger audience has grown significantly, extending both the reach and the life of my work.</p>
<p><strong>Web Literacy </strong><br />When this approach is employed, each individual involved receives a healthy dose of web literacy. Introducing them to essential building blocks of our growing digital world, like DNS, HTML, CSS, JSON, Git and more.  The portability of this approach allows you to truly own your projects, enabling you to deploy them wherever you choose. Web literacy is critical in this day and age, for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering</strong>&nbsp;<br />For me, Hacker Storytelling has empowered me to do more research, tell more stories and reach a wider audience. I've only been doing it for six months. At first, all of this can seem daunting to learn, but once you get a grasp of all the building blocks at play, it can be very empowering.  It is something non-developers can employ to solve the problems they face everyday, in a way that encourages collaboration and even programmatic integration with other systems or projects.  It has the potential to empower each of us to innovate and work together in new ways.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> <br />Hacker Storytelling is my version of this new way to build sites and apps. Development Seed and the HHS are developing their own approach as well. While there are lot of common building blocks, each individual or organization can develop their own style and set of tools and building blocks that work best for them.</p>
<p>That is 21 reasons I'm moving my projects to this new approach to publishing sites and applications on the Internet.  I'm choosing to do this because it makes me more efficient at my research and storytelling, which is essential to my career.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to share my approach with as many people as I can.  I'm watching my girlfriend Audrey discover how easy it is to setup new projects, and publish her work there. Setting everything I listed above into motion for her world, developer her own approach.</p>
<p>I don't think this methodology is for everyone, but if you are interested I'm happy to share.  I will be adding more widgets and tools to my <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storyteling</a> project.  While also point you to other similar implementations like <a href="http://HealthCare.gov">HealthCare.gov</a>, and people who are innovating with this approach like <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>.</p>

<p>I've been organizing much of my research around APIs into groupings that I call "stacks".  The term allows me to loosely bundle common API resources into meaningful "stacks" for my readers to learn about.</p>

<p>As the API universe expands, I'm trying my best to stay in tune with where its going and try to help people understand the space, whether you are a newbie or API veteran--I want you to find what you are looking for at API Evangelist.</p>
<p>To support the fast moving space, as well as my ADHD working style, I've broken up API Evangelist into individual projects. Each project runs using my <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format, which in short means each projects lives as a Githb repository, allowing me to publish the research, data, short form and long form content to an open source repository that anyone can browse, fork and download.</p>
<p>To help you (and me) see the entire API Evangelist network, i wanted to publish an outline of all 37 projects I'm curently working on:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>* Projects that are still in progress of being setup</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My goal with this new format that I've rolled out over the last six months, is to give me specific project areas to do research within, each week. Some projects will get love an attention, while others will simmer in the background--moving everything forward in small chunks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All of these projects are accessible via landing pages on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, which I will be keeping as the main portal for the business of APIs. &nbsp;You can also find my work on the politics of APIs at <a href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a>, and you can keep up with my weekly monitoring via <a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a>, which is the seed for all of these projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Each project is meant to produce the following output:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog Posts</strong> - Stories and analysis from each area of the API space</li>
<li><strong>Research Data</strong> - Lists of companies, individuals, APIs, tools and building blocks</li>
<li><strong>Research Links</strong> - Curated links to important work by others in the space</li>
<li><strong>Presentation / Talks</strong> - Presentations and talks I've given around the world</li>
<li><strong>White Papers</strong> - Long form, summary white papers providing overview of individual projects</li>
<li><strong>Blue Prints </strong>- Specific blue prints of how to execute specific campaigns within the API space</li>
</ul>
<p>The research for some of these projects is funded by my partner network, while much of it is done on my own steam. If you are interested in making sure specific projects happen, please <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">feel free to reach out and get involved</a>.</p>
<p>I will be adding projects in the future, and you may see some of the existing projects stagnate from time to time, when I run out of time, or it might be possible the space is not producing new work. Based upon page views, funding, time and other variables projects will rise to the top.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who supports what I'm doing, its been an amazing 3 years so far. I look forward to the next 3 years.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2013</span>
        <p>One trend in API usage I'm closely watching is the <a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">aggregation of APIs by a new wave of startups</a>. As the world adopts more cloud services, the need to aggregate content across multiple APIs is growing.</p>
<p>I'm currently tracking on <a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">15 API aggregators</a>, who focus on bringing together data and content in 10 areas:</p>

<li>Invoicing</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Notifications</li>
<li>Personal</li>
<li>Social</li>
</ul>
<p>The companies I'm watching on may provide other services, such as integration or automation between cloud services.  However I focus on the aggregation of content and data, and the creation of new, aggregated APIs across multiple services.</p>
<p>Some comapnies also provide entirely new APIs with data, features and functionality that can only be uncovered by aggregating across multiple services.</p>
<p>In 2013 we will continue seeing API aggregation providers emerge, providing a new layer on top of the most popular API services that we are quickly growing dependent on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webscript/webscript-io-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/06/23/a-great-time-at-api-days-san-francisco/">I was at API Days this weekend in San Francisco</a>, I managed to catch a handful of talks Saturday afternoon after I landed at OAK. While listening to each talk, I kept hearing one technical API building block, over and over--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">webhook</a>.</p>
<p>Webhooks are a common way for API providers to make API integration a two ways street for consumer. Developers, or even non-developers, can setup webhooks via common API platforms, and receive notifications about different events and activities that occur.</p>
<p>Webhooks are also a common tool for <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API automation and reciprocity platforms</a> like <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=38">Zapier</a> and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=39">IFTTT</a>.  Users can setup webhooks, that respond to just about any action across multiple, API driven platforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webscript/webscripts-io-webhook-script-example.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>After hearing webhooks mentioned so often, I wondered if anyone out there is offering web hook as a service (WHaaS) (LOL).  Sure enough, John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) pointed me to <a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank">webscript.io</a>.</p>
<p>Webscripts are short scripts, written in Lua, that run in the cloud servers, and can respond to any HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Exactly what I was looking for. I had heard of webscript.io before, but for some reason it didn't stick in my mind.  It is precisely the simple approach I was looking for, and has many common examples like sending emails, counters, parsing RSS and Tweeting.</p>
<p>I really like dead simple implementations like <a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank">webscript.io</a>, that solve real world problems in such granular, yet powerful ways.  Nice work <a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/instructurecon-2013/instructurecon-keynote-utah.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had several important things happen over the last week. One of them was sharing the stage for the first time with my partner in crime, Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>).</p>
<p>Although I spent most of the week in Washington DC, Tuesday night I flew out to Park City, UT and shared the stage Wednesday morning for a keynote with Audrey at <a title="InstructureCon" href="http://www.instructure.com/instructurecon">InstructureCon</a>, put on by the LMS platform <a title="LMS by Instructure" href="http://www.instructure.com/">Instructure</a>.</p>
<p>Audrey and I delivered a talk on education, the LMS and data portability.  Audrey opened up and closed out the talk, you can read <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/06/19/the-lms-as-portal-instructurecon/">her perspective on Hack Education</a>, but I wanted to make sure and provide the overview of my section, as described by Audrey as&nbsp;<em>[Kin spoke here about the history of APIs and what APIs do.]</em></p>
<p>To help understand how mainstream Internet technology has influenced the LMS and education portal history Audrey has laid out, I wanted to bring the history of the web API to the table, helping people understand what APIs do:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs allow computers to talk to each other, and applications to inter-operate </li>
<li>Websites deliver HTML for humans to read, and APIs deliver JSON for other applications to use</li>
</ul>
<p>The earliest approaches to APIs on the Internet, can be seen from providers starting in 2000, as <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Roy Fielding publishes his dissertation on REST</a>.</p>
<p>The early API pioneers were looking to enable commerce around their products, sales efforts and auctions using early web enabled APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of Salesforce API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">2000 - Salesforce</a></strong> - The CRM and sales management provider Salesforce was the first pioneer to begin using web APIs to start developing an ecosystem of integration providers, planting the seeds of what we'd later call Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Ebay API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">2000 - Ebay</a></strong> - Ebay identified early on, the role web APIs could play in expanding its auction marketplace, allowing business and individual to manage their online auctions via a programmatic interface</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Amazon E-Commerce API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">2002 - Amazon</a></strong> - Early on the fast growing bookseller identified the potential of APIs in expanding its ecosystem of e-commerce storefronts, delivering on the commerce vision of early API pioneers</li>
</ul>
<p>After this wave of commerce APIs, a new approach to interacting, collaborating and building relationships on the web emerged, introducing a new flavor of API driven platforms:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of Flickr API" href="/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">2004 - Flickr</a> </strong>- The founders of Flickr identified APIs a potential new approach to handling business development. Allowing partners a self-service way to integrate with the photo sharing platforms, allowing Flickr to use the API as a filter to help establish which companies they should partner with</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Delicious API" href="/2013/06/09/history-of-apis-del-icio-us/">2004 - Delicious</a></strong> - The social bookmarking platform Delicious introduced the world to a simpler way to bookmark documents on the web, social sharing, tagging, a new way to organize your online world.  Delicious was the the first to introduce an approach to APIs that used HTTP to deliver XML responses alongside common HTML pages</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Facebook API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-facebook-development-platform/">2006 - Facebook</a></strong> - Following the lead of social API pioneers like Flickr and Delicious, Facebook deployed its developer platform, providing programmatic access to the social network, setting off a wave of social application development across sectors from events to online gaming</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-twitter/">2006 - Twitter</a></strong> - The social API evolution continued with the launch of an API by fast growing micro-blogging platform Twitter.  The social microblogging network relied on its API and developer community to deliver every aspect of the platform from mobile applications to analytics, as well as embeddable buttons and widgets</li>
</ul>
<p>As the social API phase continue to evolve with the introduction of platforms from Facebook and Twitter, an earlier API pioneer Amazon <a href="/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">put APIs to use in a way that would change the way would develop software forever</a>.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/12/history-of-apis-amazon-s3/">2006 - Amazon Web Services</a></strong> - After Amazon found success with its e-commerce APIs, the company adopted APIs internally, an approach that would eventually evolve into a new type of API driven service we now know as cloud computing.  AWS started with basic  resources like storage and compute, but would rapidly to evolve and deliver a suite of API resources for companies to use in building all types of applications</li>
</ul>
<p>There was one more ingredient necessary, before APIs would open up web portals that were established in the early days of the world wide web. A new type of phone was being developed, one that was smarter than earlier feature phones.  The new generation of smart phones, led by Apple and its iPhone would legitimize APIs as the preferred channel for delivering the distributed resources that developers of web and mobile apps would need.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of Foursquare APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/11/history-of-apis-foursquare-api/">2009 - Foursquare</a></strong> - The location-based social networking website for mobile devices emerged on the landscape providing developers with a set of APIs that they would need to build the localized apps for smart phones.  Foursquare has made applications locally aware, and allowing mobile users to discover and checking to the local world around them</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Instagram API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/11/history-of-apis-instagram-api/">2011 - Instagram</a></strong> - After a rogue API was deployed on top of the fast growing photo platform, Instagram responded with an official API launch, providing read and write access to the rich media content, which soon would attract the attention of earlier social API pioneer, Facebook</li>
</ul>
<p>While APIs provided essential ingredients for web and mobile applications development like commerce, social and cloud it is also providing some other essential elements that deliver value to end-users.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="API Integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">Integration</a></strong> - APIs allow for integration between the multiple platforms and services we have adopted as part of our online, digital worlds.  Integration in an online world is critical aspect of user adoption and the future growth of any online platform</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Reciprocity" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">Reciprocity</a></strong> - Beyond integration, APIs allow for reciprocity, not just delivering bits and bytes between platforms and services, it protects the interests of the companies behind these systems as well as acting on behalf of the end-users of applications built on top of these API driven systems</li>
<li><strong><a title="Real-Time APIs" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">Real-Time</a></strong> - Web and mobile phones have connected us, and users now desire more and more of our information, data and relationships in real-time.  APIs provide the ability to be the real-time channel developers need allowing self-service, instant access to resources, but also open up a two street that pushes information back to web and mobile applications via API technologies like Web Hooks and Websockets</li>
</ul>
<p>As this new approach to developing platforms has evovled, one that challenges earlier portals and platforms like AOL, other patterns emerge that are identified as successful ingredients of all next generation platforms.  These are elements that aren't necessarily technical, but are critical components that allow often very technical resources to be accessed and used in a safe and secure way.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Visibility</strong> - APIs provide partners, developers and end-users who are key stakeholders in a platform or portal the visibility they need to be educated and informed, providing a healthy base for any online community</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - APIs let the sunlight in to companies, organizations, government agencies or even individuals who expose their resources via the web. Embracing transparency is an essential aspect of any successful API strategy</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - As with any website, security is an important part of planning, deploying and managing API resources.  Security is primary concern for any API effort and its community</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use</strong> - Silently the terms of use for each API driven platform or service is defining interactions, relationships and the health of anything we do on the web and in the cloud.  Terms of use are definitely one of the single most important aspects of portals and online services, providing a single point of failure or exploitation of users, as well as potentially providing a wealth of opportunities for some thoughtful platforms and developers</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Privacy of any platform and service is defined via the availability of an API. Opening up access to a companies, platform or services resources via an API must consider privacy of its users.  Privacy is not an after thought in education, it mandatory</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs will provide the essential access, transparency and data portability that will be necessary for the platforms and services we are depending on across the education space. Every company listed above has affected how the world works, and provide blueprints for platforms and services that are targeting just about any business sector, including education.</p>
<p>APIs are necessary to enable 3-legged conversations in the education space, elminating the education walled garden.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://tech.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/PresidentialInnovationFellows.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The news is finally out.  I will be <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/24/new-round-innovators-joins-us-government-tackle-big-challenges">heading to Washington DC to spend a year as a White House Innovation Fellow</a>. APIs, open data and our government has been a passion of mine for my whole career, something that has escalated over the last year with my work on the White House Digital Strategy and Open Data Policy.</p>
<p>Now my passion for APIs+Government is being taken to a whole new level, and &nbsp;I will be heading to Washington DC, to<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/round-2-fellows"> join 41 very talented individuals from the private sector</a>, to tackle some of the biggest challenges in our federal government.  I will be enjoying the full backing of the White House, to employ APIs to help stimulate innovation within government.</p>
<p>I will be specifically working on the Veterans Affiars</p>
<p>(VA) modernization team with two other very talented individuals, Mollie Ruskin (<a href="https://twitter.com/mollieruskin">@mollieruskin</a>) and Ben Willman (<a href="https://twitter.com/benwillman">@benwillman</a>).  We will be working on various projects, with the overall goal of streamlining the VA claims process.</p>
<p>When I received the call from the VA, asking me to come to Washington and help, I could not say no.  I'm pretty mission driven, when it comes to APIs, but helping out veterans and using APIs is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ultimate</span> mission for me.</p>
<p>I have not one, but two dads who were Vietnam Veterans.  Both are passed on now, but I have personal experience seeing the VA process in operation.  I couldn't think of a more important mission for me to embark on, but to help streamline this process.</p>
<p>I will be keeping API Evangelist alive during my time in DC, but will not be taking on any new speaking engagements or projects. I will be dedicating myself 100% to my work at the VA.  However I would do the agency a disservice if I did not maintain my awareness of the overall API space.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who assisted in making this possible, and I look forward to this next step in my career.</p>

<p>I went to <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days SF</a> yesterday. Unfortunately, due to an unexpected obligation on the other coast I was unable to make it in time for the Friday kick-off.  But after my plane landed at OAK yesterday I headed over to enjoy the last few talks, participate in a panel and network with everyone in attendance.</p>
<p>I really like the API Days format.  I've done all 3 of the events now including Paris, Madrid and now San Francisco.  Each event is an intimate mix of API experts, craftspeople and the API curious.</p>
<p>You can easily rub elbows with everyone and learn from everyone there.  All speakers are accessible, and the spaces are always small enough that you have some amazing conversations, while enjoying good food and drink.</p>
<p><a href="http://sf.apidays.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-days-san-francisco/api-design-at-api-days-san-francisco.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'd love to see more API Days pop up around the world, I really think it is a great format for introducing APIs into new region and spread the API best practices, knowledge and wisdom we often take for granted here in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://apidays.io/2013/06/09/fork-my-conference-it-aint-a-franchise-its-open-source/">API Days event model is an open source approach to throwing API events</a>, so if you think you'd like to throw your own API Days gathering in your city, you can!  The community is extremely supportive and we will do what we can to help make sure you are successful, you just have to provide the local ingredients.</p>
<p>I know there is another, original API Days Paris planned for the end of the year, but I'd love to see the format spread to other locations around the globe.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-2015.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>APIs are quickly moving into the mainstream.  In 2012, companies, organizations and government agencies all took notice of the need for deploying and consuming APIs.  In 2013 there is still a lot of evangelism to be done, to make people aware of what an APIs is, and why their company should have one, but I think we are approaching the phase where APIs will be the default for any company.</p>
<p>If you frequent the tech conferences like I do, you've heard folks like John Musser say that in 1995 we were asking, "Do we need a website?", and by 2000 website was becoming the default. Fastforward to 2010, and we were asking, "Do we need an API?", and I believe by 2015 APIs will be default for companies, just like websites in 2000.</p>
<p>APIs are built on HTTP just like our websites. They are not just a new technology trend. Your website is a critical part of your company, telling the world about your company, and the products and services you provide.  If you are a company without a website in this century, you probably are pretty irrelevant in your industry.</p>
<p>By 2015 if your company's products and services are not available in both HTML and JSON on the web, you will not be accessible via web and mobile applications, including voice enabled platforms such as Siri. Resulting in pretty much the same irrelevance as not having a website.</p>
<p>I'm not saying there isn't a lot of work to be done, in educated folks about what APIs are, and why they are important.  But as I leave Washington DC this week, and I'm seeing our federal government solidly on track to institutionalize APIs and open data into their culture and operations. Government is known for always being several years behind the mainstream when it comes to technology.  So if your company is behind the government on APIs, you are seriously behind and may not be able to catch up to your competition.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apicultur/apicultur-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I went to Spain at the beginning of the month to <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/06/04/apidays-mediterranea-is-a-wrap/">speak at API Days</a>.  While there I had the pleasure of connecting with the team from <a href="http://www.apicultur.com/en/">Apicultur</a>.  If you are not familiar with Apicultur, they are a platform for linguistic APIs, providing resources ranging from word frequency, synonyms and sentiment analysis to word games.</p>
<p>Apicultur is relevant because language APIs <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WILL</strong></span> be central to evolution of not just mobile, but also the Internet of Things. Also, Apicultur isn't just trying to build the best linguistics API in the world, they are working to assemble a <a href="https://store.apicultur.com/">marketplace of the worlds linguistic API resources</a>.</p>
<p>The value of the API resources Apicultur is developing attracted me to them, but then I learned more about their overall business model, and was really hooked.  They want you to hang your valuable linguistics API in their marketplace, side by side with the ones they develop.  They truly want to build the most valuable marketplace of API driven, language resources from around the world.</p>
<p>The Apicultur team is in San Francisco this weekend for <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">API Days</a>, if you are a complimentary API I recommend you connecting with them. Also if you have a business that could use the resources they offer, I also recommend reaching out.  You can ping them @apicultur or feel free to contact me, and I'll hook you up.

<p>What Apicultur is doing, reflects the next iteration of APIs from an all the APIs directory like ProgrammableWeb, to niche marketplaces of valuable resources developers will be needing to build the next generation of applications.</p>

        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/19dMjBe" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-evangelist-white-papers-history-of-apis.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Understanding our history is critical to understanding where we are going. &nbsp;I have been studying the <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/history/">history of web APIs</a> for the last three years. Even though I have been through the API strategies of pioneers like Salesforce and Amazon several times, each time I go back through, I learn more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In May I went back through the history of APIs and added several stories that I feel are key to introducing people to the API space, as well as helping developers and people who already work with APIs, about why this has all worked.</p>
<p>I break the history of APIs into 5 phases:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Commerce</li>
<li>Social</li>
<li>Business &amp; Marketing</li>
<li>Cloud Computing</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
</ul>
<p>We are standing solidly within the mobile phase of APIs, looking forward at the next phase which is about the Internet of Things. The History of APIs is part of my API 101 series, which I publish to help introduce people to the world of APIs and prepare them for them for the API economy that will surround them.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://bit.ly/19dMjBe" target="_blank">download an updated copy of the History of APIs</a> via this blog post, and I will be adding an entirely new white paper section in the near future. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure and share the History of APIs with your friends and anyone you think would benefit learning about the space.</p>

<p>I'm doing a keynote this weekend with the infamous, edtech rabble-rouser Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) at <a href="http://www.instructure.com/instructurecon">InstructureCon</a> in Park City Utah, this Wednesday June 19th.</p>
<p>Audrey and I will be talking about the importance of data portability when it comes to education technology.  <a href="http://www.instructure.com/?utm_expid=41647821-3&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">Instructure</a>, the creators of Canvas, a next generation learning management system (LMS), has been so kind to bring us both out.</p>
<p>While Audrey and I spend a lot of time speaking at conferences, this is our first event where we will be both sharing the stage.  If you are unaware, Audrey and her&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>&nbsp;blog isn't just a partner in crime with <a>API Evangelist when it comes to data portability</a>, she has also played the role of my girlfriend for almost four years.</p>
<p>We are both super passionate about open data, open source, data portability, terms of use and privacy policies that protect and empower users. &nbsp;Because when it comes to education, those "users" are our kids, brothers, sisters, family and friends. Education is not just another Silicon Valley opportunity, it is way too important.</p>
<p>I'm stoked to be sharing the stage with Audrey in Park City, UT this Wednesday at <a href="http://www.instructure.com/instructurecon">InstructureCon</a>.  And thank you to the Instructure team for believing in us and bringing us out to cause trouble in Utah.</p>

<p>In 2007, a new API-as-a-product platform launched, called <a href="http://twilio.com/" target="_blank">Twilio</a>, which introduced a voice API allowing developers to make and receive phone calls via any cloud application.  Over the last 3 years Twilio has additionally released a text messaging and SMS short code API, making itself a critical telephony resource in many developers toolbox.</p>
<p>Twilio is held up as a model platform to follow when evangelizing to developers.  Twilio has helped define which technical and business building blocks are essential for a healthy API driven platform, set the bar for on the ground evangelism at events and hackathons, and worked hard to showcase, support and invest it its developer ecosystem.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2013</span>
        <h2>From Deployment to Management</h2>
<p>I have broken out API design and deployment into individual areas, separate from API management. However they are all intertwined and overlap is inevitable, but it is important to understand the overview of API deployment, from framework to gateway and where it fits in with API design and management.</p>
<p>API deployment was born out of SOA and the enterprise, and the API gateways have the longest history in API deployment. But over the last 10 years a wealth of frameworks and scrappier approaches to deploy APIs build on HTTP has evolved considerably. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After 10 years of evolving API frameworks, and RESTful approaches a new breed of API providers have emerged to provide the next generation of API deployments that will drive mobile apps and the Internet of Things. All of this is making API deployment something anyone can do.</p>
<p>API Evangelist is about educating the masses about the potential of APIs, and understanding API deployment is something that any savvy business person should have a grasp of, even if you won't be getting your hands dirty with the actual execution.</p>
<p>Maybe you have a wealth of data locked up in databases that you need to make available for mobile or tablet apps, and you just don't have the internal resources to design, develop and deploy you APIs. Five years ago, APIs were definitely a purely technical initiative, born out of IT. In 2014 anyone with a little tech curiosity can understand what is possible, and begin to put a plan in place and achieve deployment.</p>
<p>Now you should have a 100K foot view of the world of API deployment, and should now look to understand what is involved with managing an API in the wild.</p>

<p>In the early days, APIs were just about deployment and consumption--you were doing one or the other.&nbsp; Then from 2006 to 2012 API management was introduced from providers like <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/06/10/history-of-apis-mashery/">Mashery</a>, then <a title="3Scale" href="http://3Scale.net">3Scale</a> and most recently <a title="Apiphany" href="http://apiphany.com">Apiphany</a>. In 2013 the API universe is expanding at a ever increasing pace, and the concept of API design is expanding, with new approaches, tools and even companies stepping up to provide services.</p>
<p>I'm deciding to frame my API design research as everything that goes into planning and designing your API, as well as the resulting definition of your API, that will eventually become the&nbsp; API you will use in production, which also might drive your documentation and generate the code samples your developers will use to integrate their apps.</p>
<p>Depending on our needs, API design may begin with learning about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> as part of your design constraints, or API design might simply be about generating a Swagger definition so you can generate interactive API documentation.</p>
<p>Ultimately your API design will be the definition of each endpoint, its methods, fields and much more. In a technical sense it is a JSON or XML blueprint that describes your API, and in a creative sense, API design is an art form and can possess a technical beauty, one that will also speak to the value an API delivers to end-users.</p>
<p>Thoughtful API design early on can save you a lot of mistakes down the road. In support of this, and as I do with al of my API research projects, I started a Github repository at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design.apievangelist.com</a></strong></span>. This project is not meant to endorse any particular approach or methodology, but provide a single resource where you can find the best information on API design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of you who like to share via email and PDFs, I also published the <a href="http://bit.ly/151yBNn">API Providers Guide to API Design as a PDF</a>, which you can download and share as you wish. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This API design project will be an open source repository containing the building blocks of API design, tools for assisting you in your API design, and companies that provide services in the area of API design.</p>
<p>This is a living project, that will be updated weekly. If you know of missing building blocks, or tools and services that should be included, or think I'm complete wacko, send your emails to <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a> or tweet at me.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Jun 2013</span>
        <h2>Overview of The API Design Space</h2>
<p><span>In the early days of APIs, everything was just about deploying and consuming&mdash;you were doing one or the other.&nbsp; Then by 2006 we saw the stabilization of common API management practices emerge from providers like Mashery, and then 3Scale. Now in 2014 we are stabilizing again, and the API universe is expanding around the area of API design, with new approaches, tools and entire companies emerging to provide services that are dedicated to helping companies design the best APIs they can.</span></p>
<p><span>I define the world of API design as everything that goes into planning and designing your API, as well as the definition of your API that will eventually be deployed as your production endpoints, drive your documentation, generate the code samples your developers will use to integrate, test, monitor, and allow your API to be found--through this lens, API design is fast becoming the driver for all areas of the API lifecycle.</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on our needs, API design may begin with understanding HTTP, and REST, or may learning more about applying hypermedia as part of your design constraints, or API design might simply be about generating a Swagger definition, so you can generate interactive API documentation. I won&rsquo;t be going into the finer points of REST, Hypermedia or even Swagger definitions. My goal is to provide a 100K view of space, and highlight the various tools, services, and API design methodologies available today.</span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately your API design will be the definition of each endpoint, its methods, fields and much more. In a technical sense it is a JSON, YAML or markdown blueprint that describes your API, and in a creative sense, API design is an art that can possess a strange technical beauty, and speak to the value an API delivers to end-users. API design is far more than just how you structure URIs, or parameters, it is fast becoming a discipline, with a suite of services and tools to support a growing wave of API design professionals.</span></p>
<p><span>Thoughtful API design early on can save you a lot of mistakes down the road. This project is not meant to endorse any particular approach or methodology, but provide a single resource where you can find the best information on API design, and go there to find what you need. It can be difficult to stay up with the latest tools, and approaches, and API Evangelist looks to fill this gap.</span></p>
<p><span>This API design project will live as an open source repository, and resulting white paper containing the building blocks of API design, tools that assist you in your API design, and companies that provide services in the area of API design.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>In November 2006, API the first API service provider Mashery came out of "stealth mode" to offer documentation support, community management and access control for companies wishing to offer public or private APIs--from blog post in TechCrunch titled&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/11/06/mashery-api-management-service-is-open-for-business/">API Management Service is Open for Business</a>.</p>
<p>At this point in time, in 2006, we were moving from the social period of APIs into the cloud computing phase with the introduction of Amazon Web Services. It was clear that the world of web APIs was getting real, and there was opportunity for companies to offer API management as a service.</p>

<p>While there were tools for deploying APIs, there was no standard approach to managing your API deployment. Mashery was the first to bring a standard set of services to API providers, that would help set the stage for the future growth of the API industry.</p>
<p>It would take almost six more years before the API industry would come of age. The space we all know today was defined by early API commerce pioneers like&nbsp;<a title="Salesforce" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">SalesForce</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Amazon" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a>, social pioneers like&nbsp;<a title="Flickr" href="/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="/2013/06/09/history-of-apis-del-icio-us/">Delicous</a>, and from Mashery who helped define what is now known as the business of APIs.</p>
<p>In 2013, Mashery was acquired by Intel, helping recently validate that the API industry truly has come of age.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Box" href="http://box.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/box/box-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Enterprise content sharing platform <a title="Box" href="http://box.com">box</a> launched a <a title="new developer revenue sharing program with its API developer ecosystem" href="http://developers.blog.box.com/2013/06/06/welcome-to-the-new-app-economy-introducing-box-rev/">new developer revenue sharing program for its API developer ecosystem,</a> called <a href="http://content.box.com/?elqPURLPage=215">$rev</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://content.box.com/?elqPURLPage=215">Box $rev</a> is pretty straightforward.  You just integrate the <a href="http://developers.box.com/">Box API</a> into your app, enroll it into the Box $rev program, and box will monitor, track and report your activity--sending you checks for up to 15% of the per seat price as a commission, each quarter.</p>
<p>As a PaaS provider, the core value driven by the box API is not about making money, it is based upon adding new users, and getting them to depend on box for their everyday needs.  Offering developers 15% of the revenue generated via the core box platforms makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p><a title="Box" href="http://content.box.com/?elqPURLPage=215"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/box/box-rev.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>This approach to revenue share won't work for all API providers, but is a great way to incentivize developers when you have a core platform you need to drive new users to.</p>
<p>I like the Box $rev model, because it actually incentivizes developers to build meaningful, engaging applications that users will actually adopt.</p>
<p>Its nice to see API value quantified in engagement, allowing us to move beyond the eye-ball based economy we are drowning in currently.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42901" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/books/creatures-from-the-dark-cover.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the last two years I've seen the emergence of&nbsp; cloud platforms that focus on helping data administrators, owners and stewards, generate APIs from their data sources.</p>
<p>The new cloud services like <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=28">EmergentOne</a> will mount a MySQL database, spider the tables, and generate a web API for you, while providing you the basic tools you will need to manage access and consumption of that API.</p>
<p>In the same spirit of helping data owners generate APIs, I'd like to see the same types of tools, but designed for books and their authors or publishers.  When I create a book and generate the ePub version, I would like to be able to upload it to a cloud platform, where the service would spider the ePub file and help generate a simple, but meaningful API for the book allowing developers to search, annotate and interact with the books content via web, mobile or tablet applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/books/bw-epub-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>My thoughts are still in the idea stage, I have done very little research on what is out there.  But I would envision something like this would work well will existing platforms like <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>.  As I do with all my ideas, I will share my thoughts here in real-time as I do the research.</p>
<p>I think in the future, providing default API access to all books will be critical to the syndication across all available distribution platforms.  You can find the seeds of this idea&nbsp; in what <a href="http://developer.pearson.com/apis">Pearson is doing with their product catalog</a>.</p>
<p>As the publishing world slowly wakes up to digital distribution, APIs will become a common tool in the toolbox of authors and publishers.</p>

<p><a href="https://delicious.com/">del.icio.us</a>&nbsp;is a social bookmarking service for storing, sharing and discovering web bookmarks to web pages, that was founded by Jousha Schachter in 2003.</p>
<p>Del.icio.us implemented a very simple tagging system which allowed users to easily tag their web bookmarks in a meaningful way, but also established a kind of folksonomy across all users of the platform. Which proved to be a pretty powerful way for cataloging and sharing web links.</p>

</table>
<p>The innovative tagging methodology used by del.icio.us allowed you to pull a list of your tags, or public web bookmarks by using the URL http://del.icio.us/tag/[tag name]/. So if I was searching for bookmarks on airplanes, I could http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane and I would GET a list of all bookmarks that have been tagged airplane. &nbsp;It was simple</p>
<p>When it came to the programmatic del.icio.us interface, the API was built into the site, creating a seamless experience--if you wanted the airplane tags via HTML you entered http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane, if you wanted RSS of the tags you entered http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/airplane, and if you wanted XML returned you used http://del.icio.us/api/tag/airplane. This has changed with the modern version of Delicious API.</p>
<p>del.icio.us was the first, concrete example of how the web could deliver HTML content, alongside machine readable like RSS and XML, using a URL structure that was simple and human readable. This approach to sharing bookmarks would set the stage for future APIs, in making APIs easy to understand for developers and even non-developers alike. Any slightly technical user could easily parse the XML or RSS, and develop or reverse engineer widgets and apps around del.icio.us content.</p>
<p>del.icio.us has been sold twice since its early popularity, which included to Yahoo! in 2005 and AVOS Systems on April, 2011. However del.icio.us was one of the pillar platforms that ushered in the social era of the API movement, establishing sharing via APIs as critical to the API economy, but also showing that simple rules when it comes to API design.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2013</span>
        <p>There are plenty of tools and services you can use to manage your API and its developer community.  But there is no platform that provides as much benefit and versatility as <a title="Github" href="http://github.com">Github</a>.</p>
<p>Github is a social coding platform that developers have grown to love and respect.  With a high level of adoption by developers, and the versatility of the features available on Github, API providers have developed many innovative ways to use the platform to manage an API.</p>
<p><a title="Github" href="http://github.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have documented eleven approaches to using Github for API management to date:</p>

</ul>
<p>This list does not represent all the uses of Github for an API, but the approaches I've seen used by open API providers.  Not all APIs are created or managed equally and these approaches to using Github can be applied in many different ways, even within private platforms.</p>
<p>Github is about social coding and file versioning, an approach that offers huge benefits to API management practices.  You want all aspects of your API operations to be social and versioned allowing it to evolve over time--Github handles this like no other platform.</p>
<p>Consider Github as the core of your API operations and think about which of these eleven approaches you can use to make sure your API is as successful possible.</p>

<p>I just got back from Madrid, Spain, where I spoke at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIdays Mediterranea</a>.  I really enjoy the API Days format, because the events are small, intimate API learning and networking opportunities.</p>
<p>While at API Days I got to hang out with many of the usual suspects Andy Thurai of <a title="API Management" href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/api-management">Intel</a>, Guillaume Balas of <a title="API Management" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, Ronnie Mitra of <a title="API Management" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a>, Bruno Pedro of <a title="CloudWork" href="http://cloudwork.com">CloudWork</a>, Swift of <a href="http://sendgrid.com">SendGrid</a> and API Days organizer Mehdi Medjaoui of <a href="http://webshell.io">WebShell</a>.</p>
<p>I also had the opportunity to re-enforce some existing relationships in person, with Isabelle Mauny of <a title="API Management" href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a>, Jeremiah Lee a UX researcher from SF and Eduardo Basterrechea and Elena Alvarez of <a href="http://www.apicultur.com/en/">Apicultur</a>.</p>

<p>API Days Mediterranea was a great introduction to the API innovation occurring in Spain, and a great opportunity to have conversations with companies and developers from the region, and hear the challenges they face in getting the word out about APIs in their country.</p>
<p>I really dig going to new regions and helping spreading the API gospel.  Thank you so much to Apicultur for bringing me out, and Webhsell and <a href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">Fabernovel</a> for helping organize.  Also don't forget 3Scale, Intel, <a title="Email" href="https://www.mailjet.com/">Mailjet</a> and WSO2 for organizing.</p>
<p>I can't wait for the next edition of API Days, the model really works well for planting the necessary seeds in new regions to get the API conversation going.  Next up is API Days San Francisco (no seed planting required), but there will be other cities added, so make sure and step up if you'd like to see API Days in your city!</p>

I sent over my research and published some of my thoughts to <a href="/2012/11/02/help-eff-make-case-for-no-copryight-on-apis/">Help EFF Make Case For No Copryight on APIs</a> and why <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/12/08/api-copyright-would-restrict-api-interoperability/">API Copyright Would Restrict API Interoperability</a> and also lent my support as one of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google/amici">Signatories to the Computer Scientists&rsquo; Amicus Brief</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a summarized version of the arguement:</p>
<blockquote><em>As computer scientists, amici have relied on the open nature of APIs and the programs built on them to create and operate new software.  Amici depend on APIs remaining open to sustain wide spreads compatibility standards used by startups and incumbents alike.  Reversing the District Court would dangerously undermine the settled expectations of computer scientists who rely on the open nature of APis. </em><ol style="padding-left: 25px; list-style-type: upper-roman; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces were essential to the development of modern computers and the Internet</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>The BIOS of the Original IBM-Compatible PC</em></li>
<li><em>Major modern operating system reimplement the ground break UNIX API</em></li>
<li><em>The C programming language became universal because of its uncopyrightable interface</em></li>
<li><em>Computers rely on the uncopyrightable nature of APIs and network protocols to communicate over the Internet</em></li>
<li><em>The uncopyrightable nature of APIs for the industry standards for cloud computing</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces spur the creation of software that otherwise would not be written</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces allow software that makes different systems compatible<br /></em></li>
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces help programmers develop completely new capabilities for software</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Copyright in interfaces would creat an "orphan software" problem</em><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 25px;">
<li><em>Uncopyrightable interfaces protect both developers and users<br /></em></li>
<li><em>The orphan software problem disproportionately affects the public sector</em></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></blockquote>
<blockquote><em> Conclusion: </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The freedom to reimplement and extend existing aPIs has undoubtedly led to robust software and hardware industries, but also to an explosion of technological advances that do more than merely increase companies' bottom line.  They open the world for the sharing of information, increased communication, and technological advances that could never have been contemplated.</em></blockquote>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/amicus-brief-computer-scientists">full brief that was filed over at EFF</a>.  Keeping APIs open, and free from copyright is something I am passionate about and feel very strongly that it is critical to a healthy, vibrant online economy.</p>
<p>I'm confident that the Judge will throw out Oracle's case, but I do no think this is the last time we'll see a company step up and try to apply copyright to APIs.</p>
<p>I'm very thankful for the EFF and the other computer scientists who researched and supported the brief.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/29/have-you-checked-out-webshell-lately/">Have You Checked Out Webshell Lately?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://webshell.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Have you checked out what the <a title="Webshell.io" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell.io</a> team is up to lately? &nbsp;I know I haven't been in there for a couple months, and it looks like they've been heads down making some interesting improvements.</p>
<h3>New Cloud IDE</h3>
<p>Rather than re-invent the wheel, Webshell has integrated <a title="Cloud9" href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a>&nbsp;web-based IDE, into the API scripting platform:</p>
<p><a href="ttps://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<h3>New Documentation</h3>
<p>They overhauled their platform documentation on the continuous mission to make them more valuable by developers:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-2.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-2.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<h3>New API Explorer</h3>
<p>They've changed the API explorer making playing with APIs a better experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-3.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-3.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3>New Codecademy Lesson</h3>
<p>They have created "Webshell 101" course, providing an easy way to understand how Webshell works:<br /><a href="http://7za.r.mailjet.com/redirect/0v8nhcjr7rysybw5poob6n/www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-Gux11/0/1" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-update-1.png" alt="image" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>That is four pretty significant building blocks from the Webshell platform. If your not familiar with some of the innovative API integration Webshell is doing, I recommend checking them out. &nbsp;Also if you haven't taken a fresh look in a while, like me, I recommend taking a moment.</p>
<p>The Webshell team gets the future of API usage, what they are doing via their platform represents a meaningful blend of the technology, business and politics of APIs, providing a model for the programmable web.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/29/api-aggregation-for-federal-government-with-fedapi/">API Aggregation For Federal Government with FedAPI</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://fedapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/Fed-API-Logo-2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been tracking on what I call API aggregation for some time now.  I started seeing the <a href="/2010/11/19/universal-apis/" target="_blank">API aggregation trends in 2010</a>, then I saw this pick up in 2011 with the emergence of providers like <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=34" target="_blank">Singly</a> and <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=35" target="_blank">Adigami</a>.</p>
<p>While many new companies provide you with interoperability and automation between multiple APIs, I consider aggregators to be about bringing together multiple APIs into a single aggregated end-point for developers to use, then also providing potentially new APIs that are only possible, because of the aggregation.</p>
<p>Last year, after I started spending more time in Washington DC, I met a talented group of folks who were playing around with the idea of an aggregate API for federal government.  In the last couple weeks it looks like they were serious about it, and launched the debut version of <a href="http://fedapi.com/">Fed{API}</a>.</p>
<p>Fed{API} is looking to make government data more accessible and reusable by taking data from multiple sources, some easy to pull and some much more difficult, then collect, correlate and catalog into a single, aggregate API stack that developers can put to use.</p>
<p><a href="http://fedapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/fedapi/fedapi-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API Aggregation</a>.  I think this is the future of standardizing APIs and data across many sources, but as I'm watching providers tackle this, you begin to realize what a massive undertaking it will be.  And FedAPI is looking to do this by opening up federal government data, which by itself is a massive challenge.  So FedAPI is tackling two pretty massive problems, as a core business model.</p>
<p>Even with the massive challenge ahead, I will be supporting FedAPI 100%, and doing what I can to make sure their initiative is successful. To do so, I think they will have to get two other groups involved:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Other API Aggregate Providers</strong> - FedAPI needs to make sure and reach out to Singly, Temboo, Adigami and the other API aggregators and see what they can learn, share knowledge and wisdom.  Aside from FedAPI, all these providers need to work together and not re-invent the wheel when it comes to Auth and API connectors</li>
<li><strong>Public At Large</strong> - FedAPI has to introduce tools that allow figure everyday Joe and Jane citizen into the equation.  Some users are going to be very knowledgable and passionate about specific areas, and there has to be ways to share the load and let them help clean and verify data, and other meaningful tasks</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://fedapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/fedapi/fedapi-capital.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I don't think that API Aggregation is the answer to all the problems that plague API integration, but I think API aggregators will play a major role in helping standardize API interfaces, data formats and provide critical cross-provider, inter-agency knowledge and wisdom--something individual API providers may never be able to deliver alone.</p>
<p>One thing I want to lend a hand with, when it comes to FedAPI, is help create the blueprint of which federal agencies already have APIs and open data sets, and where these exists.  I can also be the aggregator of news, analysis and best practices across the federal API landscape.</p>
<p>I'm on board FedAPI, let's make this happen.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 May 2013</span>
        <p>Expansion is in the air.  Quarterly reports are in, we are moving into summer and companies like Twilio, Evernote, Salesforce and Foursquare are expanding and growing at healthy, steady paces.</p>
<p>Mobile is king.  I'm having trouble keeping up with the new mobile players in different niche areas, as well as all the big players paying strong attention to the mobile space including Yahoo, SAP, Intel and beyond. BaaS will continue to be a dominate theme throughout 2013.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things is prominent with tech blogosophere coverage, webinars and new companies rolling out IOT APIs and technology. &nbsp;As we see the rhetoric step up on autombiles, homes, buildings and other fast growing IOT areas we'll continue to see new companies and investment, the trick will be to sort through it all and make sense.</p>
<p>API management is definitely on everyone's minds.  I'm seeing existing PaaS platforms make plays with API management tools, new database to API discussions and all the big players are as active &nbsp;as ever, even Mashery and Layer 7 after their recent acquisitions.</p>
<p>API testing, monitoring and other developer focused tools is my favorite new area to research lately.  I'm seeing an explosion in this area with high profile launches from Runscope, TheRightAPI and a strong presence from existing players like SmartBear and Pingdom.</p>
<p>A new area I'm adding to my API trends monitoring is around what is being called Single Page Applications (SPA).  There was a great talk by Steve Willmott of 3Scale this week at Gluecon on the relationship between SPA and APIs.  But I'm also seeing major movement from devs and API providers in use of SPA oriented frameworks and libraries like Angular.js, Ember.js, Knockout.js and Backbone.js.</p>
<p>Beyond testing and monitoring, security is an important theme.  As the API space expands, the concern for securing APIs and their accompanying web apps is growing.  We are seeing major providers continue the roll-out of two-step verification, as well as security and identity providers stepping up to offer services in the space.</p>
<p>Overall the space is showing healthy expansion.  New APIs, service provers and tools are emerging, while the existing players are expanding at a healthy rate.  It has been a good spring for the API space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-stack/api-stack-logo.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Over the last year I've worked hard to standardize and automate as much of my monitoring of the API space as I can. The amount of information I was monitoring daily was getting overwhelming--I needed to scale what I do, so I created what I call my <a href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API Stack Ranking</a>.</p>
<p>The API Stack Ranking is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not meant </span>to be a top 25 list, it is meant to be a ranking that I can sort companies by each week, giving me a meaningful stack of companies, who are doing interesting things in the API space.</p>
<p>Each week I publish my <a href="http://theapistack.com" target="_blank">API Stack</a>, but you can also see this influence on any of my research areas. &nbsp;If you go to <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> or the <a title="Backend as a Service (BaaS)" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">Backend as a Service (BaaS</a>) research projects, the providers are sorted by their ranking for the week.</p>
<p>In addition to sharing my stack each week, I'd like to also share the criteria I use to determine my stack. &nbsp;Currently I bundle my signals into three areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - Signals within control of the companies I'm monitoring      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Has a Blog</li>
<li>Number of Blog Posts</li>
<li>Has a Twitter Account</li>
<li>Number of Tweets</li>
<li>Has Github Account</li>
<li>Number of Github Repositories</li>
<li>Number of Commits Across Repositories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>External</strong> - Signals from the public, outside of the companies control that I'm monitoring      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Number of Twitter Followers</li>
<li>Number of @Mentions for Twitter</li>
<li>Blogsphere (Techcrunch, GigaOm, ReadWrite, etc) Posts</li>
<li>Social Bookmark (Hacker News, Reddit, StumbleUpon) Links</li>
<li>Stack Exchange Reference</li>
<li>Number of Github Followers</li>
<li>Number of Github Stars</li>
<li>Number of Github Forks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analyst</strong> - Signals that are dependent on what I personally see and feel is important      
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Curated News</li>
<li>Curated News I Write Notes About</li>
<li>Syndicate to Twitter</li>
<li>Syndicate to LinkedIn</li>
<li>Syndicate to G+</li>
<li>Publish story on API Evangelist</li>
<li>Vote Up&nbsp;</li>
<li>Vote Down</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My API Stack Ranking is always in flux.  I'm considering other signals like job postings, events as well as sentiment analysist, but this listing represents what I'm currently evaluating to generate my stack each week.</p>
<p>While internal signals give me a good idea of what a company is up to, and the external signals give me some idea regarding what the open developer community is saying, it all really comes down to the analyst part of the algorithm. &nbsp;A company may tweet a lot, but its up to me to decide if those tweets are valuable.</p>
<p>The API Stack Ranking isn't perfect. &nbsp;But it has allowed me to quadruple the amount of information I take in, and surface what I feel are the real stories and reflect the companies that are truly impacting the API space each week.</p>
<p>I have also been able to expand the API Stack Ranking to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> business or topical sector I wish now, much like I applied to <a title="BaaS" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">BaaS</a> I'm now evaluating <a title="Federal Government" href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com">federal government</a>, <a title="healthcare" href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com">healthcare</a> and other sectors in the same way.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me directly about the API Stack, and the data and content I produce each week. &nbsp;I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/28/new-features-from-baas-provider-anypresence/">New Features From BaaS Provider AnyPresence</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.anypresence.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/anypresense_logo_New.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm adding some new BaaS features I found in a recent press release from BaaS provider <a title="AnyPresence" href="http://www.anypresence.com/">AnyPresence</a> titled, "<a href="http://www.anypresence.com/press-release/AnyPresence_Launches_4th-Generation_Mobile_Backend_as_a_Service_Platform.php">AnyPresence Launches 4th-Generation Mobile Backend-as-a-Service Platform with Unparalleled Enterprise Capabilities</a>", to my list of BaaS features. &nbsp;As I'm processing them I notice they are some pretty significant features:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Application Cloning -&nbsp;</strong>For organizations looking to build multiple apps that have common core functionality with only minor variations, this powerful feature allows them to create a copy of an existing app along with all data source, object, and user interface definitions, saving significant development effort.</li>
<li><strong>Automated App UI Testing -&nbsp;</strong>Developers who use AnyPresence to generate a starter mobile app user interface (UI), now get the added benefit of functional test scripts for native iOS, native Android, and jQuery Mobile web apps. These test scripts can be run to ensure the app is interacting with backend functionality as expected, saving time in testing and improving reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Server Extensions -&nbsp;</strong>While developers have always been able to add custom code to objects within AnyPresence, they can now create re-usable &ldquo;Extensions&rdquo; that can be shared across teams or lines of business. This also enables third parties to encapsulate their services as official AnyPresence Extensions, enabling a marketplace of add-ons that can be used across the AnyPresence customer base.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise App Store Integration -&nbsp;</strong>AnyPresence now supports the ability to deploy apps to employees directly via enterprise app stores powered by Mobile Application Management (MAM) or Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendors. Apperian EASE is first MAM partner solution to be integrated directly with the AnyPresence Designer.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure Management -&nbsp;</strong>For the default cloud backend server deployment to Heroku, administrators can now control the performance characteristics of their app, and choose from hundreds of Heroku add-ons, directly from the AnyPresence Designer. This seamless integration enables developers to plan for the required capacity and usage of each individual backend server instance, and manage them from one central location.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be difficult to interpret each BaaS provider's products and services, and establish any sort of common definition, but applicaiton cloning, automated testing, custom server extensions and enterprise app stores are pretty straight-forward and powerful BaaS features.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see where AnyPresence goes with their custom extensions. &nbsp;I think whoever can do this part of BaaS correctly will win the BaaS world championships! (That is an award, right?)</p>
<p>Lot's of exciting stuff coming from the BaaS sector lately! &nbsp;Fun space to watch.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/05/27/api-management-using-apiphany/">API Management Using APiphany</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 May 2013</span>
        <p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-logo-blue.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I'm working my way through all the <a title="API management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management providers</a>, making sure I'm up to speed on what service each provider is offering these days.  As part of this work I've been playing with the <a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank">Apiphany</a> platform, using a demo site the Apiphany team was so kind to setup for me.</p>
<p>Using Apiphany I can manage my APIs, and launch a portal which allows me to hang all my APIs, then manage all aspects of their operations. Apiphany focuses on the three main components of API deployment &amp; consumption:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - API resources and their operations you've deployed and would like to hang and manage via your Apiphany portal</li>
<li><strong>Products</strong> - Virtual products you create, which allow access to various combinations of API resources and operations</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong> - Applications that are registered with the platform, and consuming APIs via various product subscriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>The way Apiphany sets up the systems is very intuitive, giving you quick, administrative control over the systems you will need to execute on either a very simple, or even a very complex API strategy.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-apis.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>APIs</strong></span><br /> Apiphany provides all the basics for API management, allowing you to add to endpoints, manage the title, description and manage operations for each endpoint, allowing you to define service operations to enable service documentation, interactive API console, per operation limits, request/response validation, and operation-level statistics.  Beyond the basics you can mask APIs, implement sophisticated caching and import overall API definitions from a WADL, Google Discovery Document, Swagger or OData format.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/aiphany-import.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Products</strong></span><br /> After you have all your raw API resources defined, you can move to define your "products", composed from your valuable API resources. The Apiphany product manager allows you to provide names and descriptions for your products, choose who has access and whether their are published or unpublished and the terms of use for any developer who subscribes to a product.  API product management takes a lot of work, experience and creativity--the Apiphany management system makes it something anyone can do.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Policies</strong></span><br />The policies management area of Apiphany is where it gets seriously powerful.  Using the products, APIs and their operations, you can define granular level policies that are essential to API operations.  Policies can range from converting XML to JSON, providing JSONP or simply setting headers for specific APIs operations, and potentially within as specific product composition.  Policies gives you a library of common policies that are used across the API industry via easy to apply templates, but also allow you to define custom Node.js policies.  The ability to define and apply policies across products, APIs and their operations provides a very modular, reusable and granular control over all aspects of your API platform.</p>

<p>APIs, Products and Policies are the heart of the Apiphany API management solution.  These provide the essential operational building blocks every API owner will need to execute an API platform. Apiphany also provides the necessary CMS framework to manage and support the developer portal, which wraps around your products, APIs and operations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Portal Management System</strong></span><br /> The APIPhany solution gives you full control over a developer portal to hang products, APIs and operations within--giving yuo control to customize the look, navigation of the portal with full page, content and media management. The Apiphany API Portal comes complete with the essential building blocks like documentation, blog, support and other CMS essentials to support an API platform.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-dashboard.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Analytics</strong></span><br /> Apiphany has added a pretty robust suite of API analytics that allow you manage the most common aspects of API operations, in the following three areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Usage - Calls and bandwidth</li>
<li>Health - Status code, cache and API response time</li>
<li>Activity - By developer, product, API and operations</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apiphany analytics package allow you to filter by products and operations broken down by default dates like today, yesterday and 7,30,90 day or custom timelines. It gives you the basics of what you will need to be in tune with your API operations and make short or long term decisions for your API roadmap.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Developers</strong></span><br /> Developers are central to any API operations and Apiphany provides the tools you will need to manage developer details and their subscriptions to products, and how their applications are using API resources. Apiphany gives you the control to block, reset and define access levels and roles for each of your developers, providing the control you need to manage your API ecosystem.</p>
<p><a title="API Management" href="http://apiphany.com" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-developer.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is my first deep dive into the Apiphany API management platform. I like what I see.  It has all the tools you will need to define, secure, manage and evolve your APIs. Deploying APIs requires a certain level of understanding of APIs, but with Apiphany anyone could take a set of API endpoints and transform and evolve them into some meaningful API driven products.</p>
<p>After spending some time playing with what is possible with the Apiphany platform I'm left with thoughts about how I could craft products around the API resources I have.  I feel like I could easily define some pretty robust API products developers could subscribe to and integrate with.  But I also feel like I could easily iterate and add products, policies and create new APIs and operations to better meet potential consumers needs with very little effort.</p>
<p>I'm going to continue setting up my API infrastructure with Apiphany, and help me understand what is possible.  I'd love to have my core platform available on all self-service API platforms, helping me understand where the space is at, and what each company brings to the table.</p>

<p>Github lends itself to managing markup and markdown documents in a very collaborative way, allowing for tracking issues and revisions along the way.  There is something about the open source process that introduces transparency and visibility into the document creation and management process.</p>
<p>I'm wll keep tracking on the innovative ways I'm seeing Github used.  So far I'm pretty impressed with the different ways I'm seeing Github used. &nbsp;If you know of any other interesting ways, please send my way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 May 2013</span>
        <p>I wanted to share a quick visualization of the beneifts of&nbsp;<a title="Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obama's Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API</a><span>, following&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/pdf/2011-10732.pdf">Executive Order 13571</a><span>, and part of the Whitehouse CIO's strategy, entitled "</span><a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a><span>" and the potential of the recent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf">Open Data Executive Order and accompanying Open Data Policy</a>. </span></p>
<p>Each federal agency should have three things available online at their domain:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>agency.gov/digitalstrategy/</li>
<li>agency.gov/data</li>
<li>agency.gov/developers/</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are three pretty important signals in the API space. &nbsp;This represents each agencies technology roadmap, data and developer resources. Which can be some pretty interesting signals for the overall health of a federal agency.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, let's look at the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>Let's go to: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://energy.gov/digitalstrategy">http://energy.gov/digitalstrategy</a></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/energy-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://energy.gov/data/">http://energy.gov/data/</a></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/energy-data.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Then: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://energy.gov/developer/">http://energy.gov/data/</a></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/energy-developer.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>After the Department of Energy, let's take a look at another agency, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>
<p>Let's go to: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://irs.gov/digitalstrategy">http://irs.gov/digitalstrategy</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/irs-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Next: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://irs.gov/data">http://irs.gov/data</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/irs-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Then: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://irs.gov/developer">http://irs.gov/developer</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/irs-digital-strategy.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Granted, these are two very different agencies.  But I can't help but think that the IRS should hand out a copy of the White House Open Data Policy internally, and figure out how they can begin to let a little light into their operations and culture.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://okfn.org/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-knowledge-foundation/open-knowledge-foundation-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm reading <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2013/05/24/irs-turn-over-a-new-leaf-open-up-data/">IRS: Turn Over a New Leaf, Open Up Data</a>, from the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> blog.  I'll let you read it in its entirety, but these are the points that are sticking with me:</p>
<blockquote><em>One of Mr. Werfel&rsquo;s first actions on the job should be the immediate implementation of the groundbreaking Presidential Executive Order and Open Data policy, released last week, that requires data captured and generated by the government be made available in open, machine-readable formats. Doing so will make the IRS a beacon to other agencies in how to use open data to screen any wrongdoing and strengthen law enforcement.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>By sharing readily available IRS data on tax-exempt organizations, encouraging Congress to pass a budget proposal that mandates release of all tax-exempt returns in a machine-readable format, and increasing the transparency of its own processes, the agency can begin to turn the page on this scandal and help rebuild trust and partnership between government and its citizens.</em></blockquote>
<p><em><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/irs/irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></em></p>
<blockquote><em>Making IRS data open won&rsquo;t solve every problem; the recent scandal has proven that the IRS must be more transparent about both the information it collects, but also how it manages that information. A commitment on day one to share the data it collects in a machine readable manner would show true leadership by Mr. Werfel and help solidify the Obama administration&rsquo;s legacy as an open government.</em></blockquote>
<p>From my vantage point, in the world of APIs--I can't help but feel the solution to our "big government" illnesses is a little API therapy. &nbsp;The Open Data Policy has set the bar, and its up to the individual agencies to pay attention.</p>
<p>APIs are not just a technical band-aid.   APIs start with a technical seed, but if a business or government entity internalizes the concepts around opening up, providing access, and setting up a feedback look with the public, partners or even with other departments, they will potentially let in a little sunlight.  Something that can go a long way in preventing many of the illnesses we often associate with "big government".</p>
<p>I'm optimistic that the IRS can regain its footing.  I'm <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">seeing a lot of API and open data innovation coming out of the federal government lately</a>.  For such a controversial entity like the IRS to recover, they will need to open up, and communicate with the public, in a way that only APis can provide.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> is doing some pretty <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/tech-pubs/2013/05/sandbox-templates-and-a-new-look.html">interesting stuff with the sandbox environment</a> for <a href="http://developer.force.com/">DeveloperForce</a>.</p>
<p>Using the DeveloperForce sandbox you can create copies of your data, allowing you to develop, test or train against, not just a sandbox, but a relevant and meaningful copy of your company's data.</p>
<p>The Force.com sandbox has always allowed you to create a separate copy of your data, but now they let you create sandbox templates, allowing you to create specific data sets that you can reuse in different ways.</p>
<p>Seeing this feature coming out of Salesforce has prompted me to take a closer look at their approach to the DeveloperForce sandbox environment.  I'm sure there are other features and approaches to sandboxing we can learn from the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">API pioneer</a>.</p>

<p>I just had a demo of some of the new features in the <a title="API Manager" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager/">WSO2 API Manager</a>.   Since WSO2 is one of my partners, I have a regular call with them to discuss the space and I often get demos of their new products and features.</p>
<p>Today's topic was <a href="http://wso2.org/library/articles/2013/05/multitenant-api-management-new-wso2-api-manager-140">multi-tenacy in their API Management platform</a>, meaning&nbsp;you can easily deploy multiple API portals using the platform.  Not every company will need more than one API portal, but for some companies that are further along, it provides a pretty sophisticated way to engage with API consumers.</p>
<p>When it comes to slicing and dicing your APIs, we usually segment our API resources by service level, apps and users.  WSO2 introduces a fourth layer--by the domain.  So now you can group API resources under domains, crafting different "API storefronts" for your consumers.</p>
<p>I'm still thinking through all of the opportunities with API management multi-tenancy, but at first thought, it will help me counteract many of the questions I get around a company's concern that APIs have to be public.  Most companies have learned about APIs from the popularity of public APIs, so I spend a lot of time explaining the opportunities for internal or partner APis.</p>
<p>The WSO2 approach to API management multi-tenancy allows me to help companies understand that unlimited ways they can provide access to their valuable resources in not just public, private ways, but to any group, user base or target audience in a very organized and branded way.</p>
<p>You can hear me, and Chris Haddad VP, Technology Evangelism at WSO2 discuss multi-tenancy as part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2013/06/your-api-branding-strategy">Your API Branding Strategy</a> webinar on Thursday, June 13, 2013.</p>

<p>Cloud storage of documents is becoming commonplace. Individuals, companies, government and non-government organizations have increasingly seen the potential of storing files in the cloud using services like Amazon S3, Dropbox and Box.</p>
<p>As a web or mobile application developer, it is becoming more common to provide integration, syncing or even direct usage of popular cloud storage services like Dropbox as the application's storage system.</p>
<p>This last week I started playing with Dave Winer's (<a href="/admin/blog/davewiner">@davewiner</a>) simple idea outliner, notepad, todo list and project organizer--<a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo</a>.</p>
<p>What caught my attention is Dave's use of Dropbox as the central storage for the app.  It reminds me of another application I use called <a href="http://prose.io/">Prose.io</a>, which uses Github as the central storage system for the app.</p>
<p>I really dig this approach to delivering, dead-simple, meaningful apps like Fargo, that don't re-invent the wheel and focus on delivering value on top of the existing tools and platforms we already use.</p>
<p>I asked Dave what his thoughts are on this approach, in which he simply replied:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 50px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">kinlane</a> -- works like a dream</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
</div>
<p>I like Dave's approach to app development which is about delivering simple, useful apps that that sensibly put APIs to use, and establish a foundation using open formats like OPML.</p>
<p>As the hardware and operating systems developers depend on continues being vritualized and migrating into the cloud, the usage of open formats and common, API driven cloud resources like storage from Dropbox, will be common among successful app developers.</p>
<p>I think Dropbox as your apps default file system is here to stay.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://datasift.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/datasift/datasift-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm increasingly finding a company's approach to using Github, a vital signal of the health of a company, their team, and the products and services they are delivering.</p>
<p>An example of this is with social data platform, <a href="http://datasift.github.io/">DataSift's new open source area</a>.  DataSift has thrown up a Github page which re-enforces the company's commitment to consuming and producing open source software, as well as a list of important, Github driven signals:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Latest Updates</strong> - The latest repository updates acorss all of DataSift's repositories</li>
<li><strong>API Client Libraries</strong> - Java, Python, Ruby, PHP and other client libraries for the DataSift API</li>
<li><strong>Public Github Repos</strong> - Other tools and utilities that are avaiable via DataSift Github repositories</li>
<li><strong>Job Vacancies</strong> - A listing of current job openings at DataSift</li>
</ul>
<p>I think DataSift approach is a very meaningful demonstration in the potential of being "open". &nbsp;As a company, DataSift provides access to valuable social signals, that any company can access via their interface and API, allowing them to develop insight and intelligence.  If you look closely at their approach to deploying their Github hosted, open source site, it provides four very critical signals.  API client libraries, open source code projects, job openings and updates across the company's Github profile.</p>
<p><a href="http://datasift.github.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/datasift/datasift-open-source.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Think about it.  The number of platforms supported for an API, the number of public open source code projects and the number and type of job postings for a company are pretty significant signals regarding the health of a company these days. &nbsp;These can be pretty difficult areas to fake, and in many cases will quickly show the activity, growth and stability of a company.</p>
<p>I like DataSift's approach to their Open Source area.  It doesn't just provide code and tools for developers to be successful, it provides us a deeper look into how DataSift operates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the 1,640 tech companies I monitor, 751 of them have Github accounts. &nbsp;I think many of these companies can learn a lot from DataSift's approach to open source and how you can put Github to use.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/digital-services-innovation-center.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm working through the wave of API innovation coming out of our Federal Government recently. During normal days at API Evangelist, I'm pulling private sector API usage examples and crafting them into stories to help the Federal Government execute on their API own strategies.  Today, I'd like to showcase something the Federal Government is doing, in hopes that more companies in the private API sector will emulate as part of their API strategies.</p>
<p>The GSA's&nbsp;<a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/">Digital Services Innovation Center</a> has launched the <a href="http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/">Mobile Code Catalog</a>, an open source catalog of web and native applications that government agencies can use to jump-start their projects. Think application showcase, but all the applications are open source and allow for your API developers to download, fork and re-use code.</p>
<p>The idea of a code catalog is pretty interesting, and I see it as an evolution of several API building blocks I talk about--code samples, SDKs, starter kits and application showcase all rolled into one.  Imagine if your API consumers can come into your developer area and not just find code samples, they can find complete applications that they can download, reverse-engineer and put to use.  Talk about going from zero to API integration in as short of time as possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/mobile-code-catalog.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I know that many API owners compete with their ecosystems, by deploying their own version of their mobile, web or desktop apps, but for the others a code catalog is an excellent way to facilitate integrations with your platform.</p>
<p>Another cool thing about the Digital Services Innovation Center Mobile Code Catalog, is that the catalog itself is open source and hosted on Github.  This is a whole other aspect of the innovation around a code catalog, that the catalog itself can be downloaded, forked and published anywhere on a public website or private portal.</p>
<p>I envision hundreds of code catalogs available in the near future, across many business, government and NGO sectors.  While there is money in building proprietary apps on top of APIs, I think there is even more money to be made when you put meaningful, high quality apps in the hands of end-users.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/the-api-and-appification-of-the-web" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/single-page-applications/single-page-web-applications.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was looking through <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/the-api-and-appification-of-the-web">Steve Willmott's slide deck</a> from his talk at <a title="GlueCon" href="http://www.gluecon.com/">GlueCon</a> this week, called <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/the-api-and-appification-of-the-web">The API- &amp; App-ification of the Web</a>.</p>
<p>He talks about the evolution towards Single Page Web Applications (SPA).  Which is the migration <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">from</span> static web pages and database driven web apps to dynamically driven HTML, CSS and JavaScript apps designed using popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span></a></strong> - Ember<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span> is an open-source client-side JavaScript web application framework based on the model-view-controller (MVC) software architectural pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page applications<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">[</span>1] by incorporating common idioms and best practices into a framework that provides a rich object model, declarative two-way data binding, computed properties, automatically-updating templates powered by Handlebars<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span>, and a router for managing application state</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span></a></strong> - AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Google, that assists with running what <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">are known</span> as single-page applications. Its goal is to augment browser-based applications with model&ndash;view&ndash;controller (MVC) capability, in an effort to make both development and testing easier.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span></a></strong> - Backbone<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">.</span><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">js</span> gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Single page applications have benefits like speed, no page reloads, mobile optimization, real-time pushes, notifications and they just look <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">freak'n</span> cool.  But there are also downsides like needing some healthy JavaScript talent to maintain, SEO issues and a general deviation from the linked, document driven web we are used to.</p>
<p>The popularity of frameworks and libraries like Ember, Angular and Backbone, and the Single Page Application approach isn't something just developers are noticing.  Some top platforms are seeing the potential, and providing code and toolkits for integrating using Ember, Angular and Backbone:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

</ul>
<p>With the popularity of JavaScript libraries and frameworks, and growing number of <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">SPAs</span>, there is a huge opportunity for API providers to offer API driven libraries and widgets that are plug and play with frameworks like Angular and Ember, and are compatible with libraries like Backbone.</p>
<p>As I monitor the API space I will continue looking for examples of APIs doing interesting things with Ember, Angular and Backbone. Let me know if you see anything I should take a look at.</p>

        <p><a title="DFW API Professional Meetup Group" href="http://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/dfw-api-meetup-group/dfw-api-meetup-group.jpeg" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just got back from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. I visited Dallas last night to help kick off the first gathering of the DFW API Professionals Meetup.</p>
<p>We got together at Microsoft around 6PM and I talked from 6:30 until 8:00, evolving on my <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/api-meetup-dallas-tx/web-to-programmableweb-to-programmableworld/index.html#/" target="_blank">From Web, to ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld</a> talk.</p>
<p><a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://www.therightapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/therightapi-logo-2.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The meetup was about 45 people ranging from developers to investors.  I showed up with a lot of content, but I wanted to make sure and cover the full API spectrum, while also introducing some new content about specifically about API consumption.</p>
<p>During the event I had some time to get to know the <a href="http://www.therightapi.com/">theRightAPI</a>, <a title="BAaS" href="http://www.proxomo.com/">Proxomo</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a title="API Management" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer 7 Technologies</a>&nbsp;<span>and&nbsp;</span><a title="Tech Efficiency and Innovation" href="http://www.parivedasolutions.com/">Pariveda Solutions</a> folks--while connecting with the rest of the meet up group members.</p>
<p><a title="AT&amp;T Foundry" href="https://www.foundry.att.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/att-foundry.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Then, this morning theRightAPI crew brought me out to Plano, TX to the <a title="AT&amp;T Foundry" href="https://www.foundry.att.com/">AT&amp;T Foundry</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/attfoundry">@attfoundry</a>), where I got to talk with Vincent Button (<a href="https://twitter.com/vebutton">@vebutton</a>) and Jennifer Conley (<a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferconley">@jenniferconley</a>).  I was a little blown away by what I saw.  It wasn't what I was used when visiting the campuses of big telco companies in the past.  The facility was something you associate with Silicon Valley and Bay Area. Open layout with a variety of people working on things ranging from voice solutions to the internet of things.</p>
<p><a title="Gravity Center" href="http://gravitycentredallas.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/gravity-center/gravity-center-logo.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Afterwards, Jennifer walked us up to the <a title="Gravity Center" href="http://gravitycentredallas.com/">Gravity Center</a>, which has been provided access to AT&amp;T and Alcatel-Lucent resources to support multiple startups in the North Texas area.  I got to meet to the <a title="Bookshout" href="http://bookshout.com/">BookShout</a> team and hear about how they are navigating and working to change the book publishing space, while allowing people to discover books, and build social networks around books and authors.</p>
<p><a title="Bookshout" href="http://bookshout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bookshout/bookshout-logo.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm pretty impressed with what I saw in Texas in the last 48 hours.  I met some pretty tech savvy people building interesting startups, putting APIs to use in meaningful ways, and a community around them that is investing in what they are doing. While I was there, I saw all the same elements for startup success I see in Silicon Valley, but without much of the hype.</p>
<p>I was stoked to be able to help kick off the DFW API Professionals Meetup Group.  I appreciate theRightAPI for bringing me out, and  Proxomo, Layer 7 and Pariveda Solutions for making it happen.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 May 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dark-matter.jpeg" border="0" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I encounter many enterprise folks who dismiss APIs as nothing more that just one of the technical building blocks of SOA.  Folks who, no matter how much I explain, will never see APIs beyond a technical specification and implementation.</p>
<p>API Evangelist solely exists to shed light on not just the technology of APIs, but the equally important business and politics of the APIs.  It is the business and political building blocks that help the concept of API grow beyond just its technical roots.</p>
<p>An API won't  find success just because you made a resource available via a URL. An API is successful because it is logically priced, possibly has revenue sharing, code samples to jumpstart integration and a support and resource network that a developer can tap into.  An API is successful because it is open and self-service, but sensibly secured, providing a terms of service that benefit API owners, and developers, while also protecting the interests of end users.</p>
<p>APIs bring together a unique blend of technology, business and politics into a transparent, self-service mix that can foster innovation. As someone who is heavily invested at the enterprise scope, it can be difficult to see things through this lens sometimes.  You will need to upgrade your prescription with the eye doctor.</p>
<p>Why "API" is working is not just a REST+JSON technical answer, there is a dark matter that binds the whole movement together, while also providing the right about of lubricant and oxygen necessary for innovation. In the enterprise you will often see this dark matter as governance, in the world of APIs it will have a lot of the same characteristics as your governance, but it is actually the exact opposite of governance.</p>
<p>I don't expect to convert all you enterprise folks to see APIs like I do. I don't think you are equipped to view the dark matter that keep the API movement expanding and moving forward. You are focused on seeing things through another lense of control and about the extraction of value--a lense that will always prevent you from seeing the dark matter that makes APIs an evolution beyond SOA.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 May 2013</span>

<p>I've been tracking on a trend in the API space that I call <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API aggregation</a>.  Companies like <a href="http://singly.com" title="Singly">Singly</a> and <a href="http://www.adigami.com/" title="Adigami">Adigami</a> are aggregating APIs into more meaningful API stacks, than any single API provider can deliver on their own.</p>
<p>In my regular monitoring, I'm always on the hunt for examples of the benefits of API Aggregation, and last week I saw some pretty interesting payment gateway data being provided by payment API aggregator <a href="http://spreedly.com" title="Payment API Aggregator">Spreedly</a>--which definitely reflects the positive effects I'm looking to shine light on in the space. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://spreedly.com/">Spreedly is a cloud based credit card vault</a> that allows you to work with one or multiple payment gateways over time or simultaneously, and has published some pretty interesting <a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/">analysis of failed transaction rates across multiple payment gateways</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/spreedly/spreedly-success-failure-stats.png" border="0" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'll let you head over to Spreedly to <a href="http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/05/08/failed-transaction-rates-by-payment-gateways/">read the analysis</a>.  What I find interesting is that they are open to sharing this data with the public.  This type of information sharing by API aggregator providers is critical to the overall health of the space. I'm often frustrated by the lack of data that API providers share, because they so often are keeping their cards so close to their chest, trying to protect their valuable business data or often lack of business data.</p>
<p>There is huge opportunity for API aggregators to share information about their experience with the common APIs they integrate and aggregate with.  The whole industry can learn from this, but also work its way back upstream to the payment API providers, providing them with insight into how their APIs are operating, but also provide benchmarks of where they stand with their competitors, good or bad.</p>
<p>Let me know if you see any other examples of API aggregators sharing data like <a href="http://spreedly.com" title="Payment API Aggregator">Spreedly</a>.</p>

<p>After looking through the list of folks who have RSVP'd for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/">DFW API Professionals Meetup in Dallas tomorrow night</a>, it looks like an interesting mix of tech and business folk.  The tech group is definitely the larger, with a mix of mobile, web and enterprise.  The business folks look like a mix of VC, project manager, marketing and startups.</p>
<p>I'm heading out to Dallas in the morning, and I am spending my afternoon preparing my talk.  When it comes to meetups, I like to wait until the last moment, see who has RSVP'd and shift my talk to being more tech, more business or more API 101 depending on the audience.   I like the mix of people I'm seeing RSVP'd for tomorrow night.</p>
<p>I'm pulling together a talk from some of my regular material, but updating for what is going on right now.  Resulting in the following outline I'm calling, "From ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld":</p>

My groupings are sometimes in alignment with what we hear in the tech blogosophere, but other times I try new definitions to help expand my monitoring definition and see if I can identify emerging patterns like I'm seeing with <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com" title="Backend as a Service">BaaS</a>.</p>
<p>Each week I do a little more exploration in concept of <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com" title="API aggregation">API aggregation</a>, and this week after <a href="/2013/05/13/potential-for-api-aggregators-to-provide-valuable-industry-data/">studying payment API aggregator Spreedly</a>, I'm considering adding a new, overlapping area with aggregation, called API brokers.  Let's see if I can make this work.</p>
<p>API aggregators like <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> are providing personal data access to popular SaaS platforms by aggregating APIs.  You can pull a list of photos from Singly, for a user, and it could pull photos from Flickr, Instagram and Facebook.  This is pretty straightforward API Aggregation.</p>
<p>Other providers like <a href="http://temboo.com" title="Temboo">Temboo</a>, provide this functionality but focus more on the API interoperability or as i call it <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com" title="API reciprocity">API reciprocity</a> side of things.  Temboo does aggregate multiple APIs like Singly, but focuses on providing interoperability as well as aggregation.  While Singly does to, there are differences in their approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://spreedly.com/">Spreedly</a> has all the telltale signs of an API aggregator.  They allow you to program against 48 payment gateways in 71 countries.  It has aggregation, but rather than interoperability it seems to be about brokering transactions.  Spreedly can help you choose the gateway based upon location, cost and availability.  Which has all the elements of what I'd consider an API broker.</p>
<p>I envision other new API brokers emerging, in niche areas like images, video or messaging.  Imagine if you could use Twilio, Tropo or other SMS API provider, but use through a broker who will give you the best availability and costs based upon various needs.  This type of API aggregation is not meant for providing users with access to multiple cloud silos via APIs, it is more about brokering API resources and establishing a marketplace.</p>
<p>Not all APIs can be brokered, and maybe Spreedly is unique, but I bet I will find more of this behavior from other companies, once I start looking.  Let me know if you know of any companies who broker API resources in a similar way to Spreedly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.restful-labs.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restful-labs/restful-labs-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Curently I'm immersed in discovering, vetting and tracking on signals that show me which companies are trending in the API space.  I'm looking for signals that will tell me which companies are making movements on a week to week basis, and when the blogosphere and developer communities are buzzing about these companies and technologies.</p>
<p>Three very important signals I use are blogs, twitter and Github.  These tools provide me with great signals I can use to tune into what a company is doing, when they push code, write a story or tweet about it.  They also provide me with signals of when developers are engaging with API owners, because they follow on Twitter and download, fork, favorite and follow Github repositories.</p>
<p>However, in some scenarios a companies blogs, twitter and Github accounts can also tell me when a company has given up and has run out of money or just stopped putting energy and resources into a project.  An example of this is with a company I came across during my monitoring last week, called <a href="http://www.restful-labs.com/" target="_blank">RESTful Labs</a>. RESTful Labs has all the eye candy to draw me in.  I mean they have REST in their name, and they build tools for developers!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.restful-labs.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restful-labs/restful-metrics.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>RESTful Labs provides API analytics tools for developers.  I'm pretty stoked anytime I find something like this, then I immediately look at the common signals:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - Check! - Last blog posted 11 months ago</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Check! - Last Tweet 8 months ago</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Check! - Last commit was 8 months ago</li>
</ul>
<p>On the surface, RESTful Labs has all the right signal generators in having a blog, Twitter and Github accounts.  But immediately these signals start working against them, rather than the positive signals I would normally gather from someone having a blog, Twitter and Github accounts.</p>
<p>It is clear that RESTful Labs WAS something last year, but now it is all but a ghost town.  It is not a tool I will recommend anyone use because there is nobody home to support.  Since they have a Github account, there might be resources that can be picked from the bones of the startup, but not much else beyond that.</p>
<p>I keep companies like this in my database, as I want live examples like this to show people, and help them understand how to send the right signals that they are doing good things in the space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2013</span>
        <p>Does anyone else notice the evolution of the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter developer area</a>? The site has taken a page from the LinkedIn playbook and become more about embeddable buttons, badges and widgets than about APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/twitter-homepage-2.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Granted, you can click on documentation and get at the REST API v 1.1. &nbsp;I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing. &nbsp;I'm a big supporter of embeddable strategies for API providers. I think that evolution is very telling of Twitter's API strategy and what type of "developer" they want to support with the API.</p>
<p>Whether or not you agree with Twitter's overall API strategy, there is a lot to learn from their approach to API driven embeddable tools. &nbsp;I will produce more pieces aobut their approach to cards, timelines, buttons and other embeddable tools.</p>

<p>I've been working on expanding the amount of research and writing I can do via API Evangelist lately.  In the last couple weeks I rolled out new projects in three areas: <a title="API Toolkits" href="/2013/04/27/evolving-beyond-api-service-providers-and-api-tools-to-goal-based-api-toolkits/">API Toolkits</a>, <a href="/2013/04/28/api-trends/">API Trends</a>, <a title="API Priorities" href="/2013/04/28/api-priorities/">API Priorities</a>.  This new approach is helping me focus on the areas I think are most important or exciting to the API space and generate as much, high quality news, analysis and white papers for the API space as I can.</p>
<p>The first of my white papers, using my new approach is finished.  The new paper is called <a title="Overview Of The Backend as a Service (BaaS) Space" href="https://apps.facebook.com/marketpage/mu07n26dfwwupqoy6k0xj/item/MWP6Hfn" target="_blank">Overview Of The Backend as a Service (BaaS) Space</a>, and is the aggregation of all my research into the BaaS space.   Here is a breakdown of the white paper:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>What is BaaS?</li>
<li>How Does BaaS Differ From IaaS and PaaS?</li>
<li>What Are The Benefits of BaaS?</li>
<li>What Can You Build With BaaS?</li>
<li>Who Are The Top BaaS Providers?</li>
<li>What Are The Common Building Blocks of BaaS?</li>
<li>What Are the Common Approaches to BaaS Pricing?</li>
<li>What Are The Other Approaches to BaaS Pricing?</li>
<li>Who Are The Other BaaS Providers?</li>
<li>Watch Out As 1000lb Gorillas Set Their Sights on BaaS Space!</li>
<li>What Makes BaaS Relevant to APIs?</li>
<li>The Future Is About Virtualized Mobile Operating Systems</li>
<li>Investment in BaaS</li>
<li>What Are The Opportunities in BaaS?</li>
<li>Summing Up BaaS</li>
<li>Appendix A: Full List of BaaS Features</li>
<li>Appendix B: Curated News Sources</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the research, news, analysis and data that went into this white paper is available at <a title="Backend as a Service" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">baas.apievangelist.com</a>.  As I do with most of my work, I will be publishing all my BaaS research to this Github project, allowing anyone to view, fork or download.  The BaaS project will also have a full version, <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/marketpage/mu07n26dfwwupqoy6k0xj/item/MWP6Hfn">available as a PDF for $99.00</a>.  My goal is to subsidize my research via sales of white papers and the support of my partners.  If you can't afford, tune into the BaaS project, but if you'd like to support what I do you can purchase a copy.</p>
<p>I'm working on other papers that are part of all of my <a title="API Toolkits" href="/2013/04/27/evolving-beyond-api-service-providers-and-api-tools-to-goal-based-api-toolkits/">API Toolkits</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/2013/04/28/api-trends/">API Trends</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="API Priorities" href="/2013/04/28/api-priorities/">API Priorities</a> research areas.

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/xero/xero-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank">Accounting API platform Xero</a> has been taking a deeper look into the languages that their developers are using when integrating with the Xero API. Currently there are 1,600 active applications communicating with the Xero API, from a mix of Xero add-on partners to custom integrations engineered by 3rd party developers. &nbsp;But which programming languages were they using?</p>
<p>To create a snapshot of what tools developers are using, Xero needed to find the best source to obtain this data. Xero doesn't ask developers which platform they use upon registration, and since Xero doesn't require any sort of user agent or other identifying signature, it was difficult to know where to best acquire the data they needed.</p>
<p>The next best place to look for this data, is with the code samples themselves.  It would be nice, if Xero code samples were hosted using Github where they could track downloads, forks, followers, etc.  But the best they had, was the page views from the pages for each code library, within the Xero developer area.</p>
<p><a title="Xero Accounting Software" href="http://developer.xero.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/xero/xero-2013-usage-chart.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Using this approach, Xero was able to extract some pretty interesting data about which programming languages developers were clicking on.  Identifying the growing dominance of languages like PHP and the emergence of newer approaches using Node.js.</p>
<p>While Xero was able to learn a lot, I think we all should learn from Xero's story. There is a lot to be learned by other API providers: 1) API integration needs to be language agnostic 2) Working to understand which languages are beings used or in demand from developers, on a regular basis is important.</p>
<p>This seems like a pretty basic topic to some of us, but when an API is born out of a company that has a single language focus, it can be difficult to understand the needs of developers who are using other platforms and languages.</p>
<p>Make sure you prepare an approach to gathering and regularly evaluating data around which languages your API developers are needing to integrate ad work to support that as much as you possibly can.</p>
