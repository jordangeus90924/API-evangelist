{% include JB/setup %}<p>Storytelling in the API industry is critical to the healthy growth of the space.John Musser and ProgrammableWeb have been telling great stories in the tech industry, since way before APIs were all lthe rage they are now.While I was at API Days this year, I was speaking with Mike Amundsen (@mamund) of Layer7, and we started talking about how Amazon, Netflix (and Iâ€™d add Twilio) tend to dominate the API discussion.I considered my talks from API Days, and sure enough--Netflix and Amazon were in there multiple times!There are other stories we tell around Twitter, Facebook Google and other smaller APIs, but Amazon, Netflix and Twilio were cornerstones of API folklore in 2012.</p>
