{% include JB/setup %}<p>Superfeedr keeps showing what a pioneer they are when it comes to web, API and feed technology, with a release of an Ejabber module that builds WebSockets into an XMPP server.XMPP provides identity, authentication, presence, and notifications for APIs and other feeds, and with the growing adoption of HTML5, the WebSockets API is the perfect built-in browser client to interact with APIs and feeds in the browser.The Superfeedr Ejabber module is written in Erlang and available over at Github.They recommend you use the module with Strophejs, an XMPP library written in Javascript.XMPP is growing in popularity as a protocol for providing real-time API and feed updates, while increasing the efficiency of API networks by minimizing polling of API endpoints.</p>
