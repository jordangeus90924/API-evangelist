{% include JB/setup %}<p>I try to pay attention to how APIs are transforming as many industries as I can.I usually carve out at least an hour each day, to evalute a specific industry, the APIs in it, trying to understand what each API delivers and how the industry works, while also identifying where the opportunities lie.Right now I am looking at two areas or industries of APIs: Cloud Storage APIs Image and Photo APIs Even though I want to be familiar with both these areas, and will write stories on everything I find, my primary goal is to provide the Mimeo development team with as much information, about the best document and photo storage APIs available for integrating into our systems.There are 46 storage APIs and 120 photo APIs in the ProgrammableWeb directory.I went through all of the APIs and pulled out the APIs that were RESTful, had potential for print integration and were popular or were a stable, quality service.</p>
