{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just finished the NYTimes article, United Pilots Get iPad Flight Manuals.This follows Alaska Airlines adopting the iPad, and Delta Airlines testing the iPad as a viable alternative to on-board manuals.I dont think of the iPad as enterprise tool.It is a consumer tool, so this type of large scale adoption of the iPad at United, Alaska and potentially Delta says a lot.These major companies have made decisions that tablets, more specifically the iPad, and mobile applications are the future of their business operations.</p>
