{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m a firm believer in the power of the freemium model when it comes to APIs.Nothing is as it seems when you are deploying managing or consuming APIs.You have to have room to innovate and iterate without signing contracts or paying too much, before you find exactly the right integration or deployment that works.This freemium approach to APIs is one of the biggest reasons I’ve been supporting 3Scale since early days of API Evangelist.3Scale was the original API service provider to offer a truly freemium tier for anyone wanting to deploy an API, and remains passionate about this to this day.</p>
