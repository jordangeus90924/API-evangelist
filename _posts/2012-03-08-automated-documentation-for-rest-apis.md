{% include JB/setup %}<p>This post comes from the SDK Bridge newsletter. I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.People are constantly trying to come up with tools to make API documentation an easier task.If you are documenting an SDK built for C++, C, or Java, there are tools such as Doxygen, Sandcastle, and JavaDocs to take comments from the code and automatically generate documentation from them.Why arent there tools like this for REST APIs?</p>
