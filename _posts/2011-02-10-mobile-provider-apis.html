As mobile phone adoption and usage continues to grow we are seeing a parallel growth in APIs to support the mobile browsing market.
Many API providers are seeing the majority of calls coming from mobile phones vs. web or desktop clients.
Another unnoticed area of mobile API growth is from mobile carriers themselves. Verizon, Sprint, and AT&amp;T all provide developer APIs.

</ul><a href="http://developer.t-mobile.com/site/global/home/p_home.jsp" target="_blank">T-Mobile has a partner network</a> with platform specific SDKs and resources, but no visible APIs for developers.
Mobile carriers see first hand, the growth and potential of the mobile Internet, it is logical for them to also identify that value of providing their own APIs for developers to build upon.
Primary the Mobile Provider APIs are all focused around services like location and messaging, however AT&amp;T is already pushing into the cloud computing and storage space.
You will see more mobile providers launching APIs and more services from the existing Mobile Provider APIs in the near future.
