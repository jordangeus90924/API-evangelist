<p>Most of this API stuff isn’t technical. For APIs to work at scale within a single company, a wider industry, or across government agencies, you need people who are committed to evangelism, coaching, and communication around everything that is occurring across API ecosystems. We often times get caught up in our work, and operating within our silos and forget to email, call, and just walk next door sometimes to share stories of what is going on. If you are a regular reader of my work you know how I feel about storytelling, and just how important it is to all of this working or not. Which is why I like to make sure that I showcase the storyelling of other evangelists who are working their magic, and spreading API knowledge within their domains.

<p>I’m a big fan of what the GSA is up to with APIs across the federal government, and specifically what my hero Gray Brooks does to support API efforts acorss multiple federal agencies. He does a lot of legwork, but one thing that has stood out for me is his work to establish an <a href="https://digital.gov/communities/apis/">API community of practice</a>, and share relevant API stories on the US Government APIs Google Group. To help highlight what he is up to, and hep amplify the knowledge he puts out there, I wanted to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/xQQvLajni08">share his latest post from the Google Group</a> in it’s entirety because it is, well, beautiful.
