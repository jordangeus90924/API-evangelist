I'm happy to be a media partner for the [SOA Cloud 2012 Service Technology Symposium][1], the largest international conference dedicated to the exploration of SOA, cloud computing and modern service technologies.

SOA Cloud 2012 is happening September 24,25, 2012 in London, UK at the Imperial College London. The first day kicks off with:

  * **[The Era of Intelligent Service Technology][2]** \- Thomas Erl's well-known, visionary tour of relationships between and combinations of service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, and semantic Web technologies.
  * [New Paradigms for Application Architecture][3]: From Applications to IT Services Speaker by Anne Thomas Manes of Gartner about the convergence of mobile, social, cloud, and information forcing demand that we adopt new paradigms for application architecture and delivery

The first day keynotes have not one space agency talking APIs, but two. With [Vicente Navarro of the European Space Agency][4], and [Hook Hua of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology][5] (NASA Center).

Second day keynotes are pretty impressive too, with opening keynote by Dennis Wisnosky, US Department of Defense â€“ "[Heading, Altitude ][6]
