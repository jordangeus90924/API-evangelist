{% include JB/setup %}<p>While I’m wading through dictionaries and thesauruses in an effort to find a more appropriate term “governance”, when looking at SOA governance through the API lense--I figured I’d flush out another area I’m working to define a term that appropriately describes automation and interoperability using APIs.Yesterday I took a look at 31 backend as a service (BaaS) providers, in hopes of understanding more about what value they provide.Today Im diving into the automation section of my new API trends area.While reviewing, I noticed the exact same companies that were under automation were also in interoperability.So I set out to find a new word to apply to this next generation of ETL providers that are building bridges between cloud platforms using APIs, as well as legacy data connections.</p>
