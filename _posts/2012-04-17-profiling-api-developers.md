{% include JB/setup %}<p>For the last couple weeks I’m neck deep in getting to know the developers who already use the CityGrid APIs.I want a better understanding of who a developer is, what kind of business they have and what they are looking to get out of the API.To find this out I start out profiling them socially using Rapportive (which I plan on automating using the Full Contact API as soon as I have more time) for the following information: Twitter Profile LinkedIn Account Facebook Profile Google + Profile Github Profile Usually I know the URL of their website, but if I don’t, I can extract from their email address or sometimes Rapportive will provide for me.I visit each developer’s site and look for: Blog w/ RSS Feed Business Contact Email Business Contact Form Next I build a quick one sentence description, telling me who they are and what they do.I also assemble a comma separated list of keyword and key phrases that best represent what they do.</p>
