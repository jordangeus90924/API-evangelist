			<p><em>23 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>
The best thing about owning API Evangelist is I get to write about whatever I want.  I have full editorial control, and because of my unique view on the API space I tend to write about APIs from three separate perspectives:

API Owner
API Service Provider
Developer

These are the three main actors in the API game.  There are others, but these are the three viewpoints I write about the most.  I tend to rail on API owners a lot, and today I think I will rail on API developers.
Currently I&rsquo;m doing a lot of reaching out to my developers.  I personally email everyone who registers for CityGrid APIs.  Sure I use template emails, but I customize them and send the email one by one so I can profile my API developers and understand what they are doing.
So far, my findings are that many developers don&rsquo;t have any sort of verifiable online persona, and even more don&rsquo;t bother responding when I email or tweet at them.  Its not my business to police the CityGrid APIs, but I definitely apply a grade to every developer I look at, and make recommendations based upon this grade, where online persona and responsiveness are two big factors.
We hear a lot of developers (me included) complain about API owners not being responsive, but remember there is another side to the coin.  If you're using someone&rsquo;s API for FREE, and they take time out of their day to email you or tweet at you, it might be cool if you took 10 seconds to respond and say hello, and let them know you're an actual person.

			<h3><a href="/2012/04/23/api-as-the-deliverable-at-the-hackathon/">API as the Deliverable at the Hackathon</a></h3>
			<p><em>23 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>
At most hackathons, the end goal is building a web or mobile application, using various platforms and APIs.  Even though I&rsquo;ve seen this evolve to data visualization, or mashing up SaaS platforms at some events, the app really tends to be the primary deliverable at hackathons.
So this week I&rsquo;m spending time thinking of unique and interesting ways to present my sponsors for the CityGrid Hackathon this weekend in Santa Monica at CoLoft.  One of our sponsors is 3Scale, one of my favorite API service providers, and while we see many of the API service providers including Apigee and Mashery involved in many of the hackathons you really don't see anything built using their platform. (I know they&rsquo;ll ping me and say they do, but really your building using their clients.)
So for the CityGrid Los Angeles hackathon, I want to encourage developers to come up with ideas for APIs, develop the API and using 3Scale, deploy the building block that are essential that enable other developers to build on top of the API.
Not only do we need more, high value APIs, we need developers to be fluent in not just developing and deploying mobile and web apps, developers need to be fluent in designing, developing, deploying and managing APIs.
So if you have a great API idea and are in the Los Angeles area this weekend, come down to the CoLoft in Santa Monica and form a team and build your API, and deploy it using 3Scale, and you just might have a chance at winning $5,000.00 for your API.

			<p><em>20 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>One of my self-appointed roles in the API industry is to shed light on, and discuss the business of APIs when many other API owners and evangelists tend to keep their strategy and business closer to their chest. Many API owners don&rsquo;t discuss their roadmaps, either because they feel they will be giving away their secret sauce, or quite possibly because they don&rsquo;t have a clue where they are going with it. I think it&rsquo;s more the latter, as we are all making this shit up as we go along. One subject you don&rsquo;t hear API owners discuss often, is when their API will be deprecated or shuttered, leaving developers and tech bloggers to speculate on the subject. Because of this you tend to hear just the extreme views on the subject. Popular perspectives on API life-span tends to be: APIs Are Forever - Once you put an API, you have to support it forever APIs Can Go Away Anytime - There is no stability whatsoever when it comes to APIs I&rsquo;ve written on this subject several times including What Happens to Instagram API Developers After Facebook Acquisition and Building Your Business Around Google or Any Other APIs. Even with my stance on the subject I fall prey to the hype sometimes. I saw the post from Google today called Changes to deprecation policies and API spring cleaning, and I immediately thought oh no, here we go again. After reading deeper I realized they are updating their API deprecation policy for many popular APIs. As they state: The new policy simply states that we will strive to provide one year notice before making breaking changes. Google is setting a clear window, for which they will make sure and give developers a heads up before deprecating an API. This allows you to know that you can count on an API being around, until you hear otherwise, and then, you still have a year to figure out...[<a href="/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever-wait-no-they-can-go-away-at-any-time/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>One of the essential ingredients of a successful API, is a self-service area to support your API developers. In my opinion this is a no-brainer. You have to have registration, documentation, code samples, forum and other essential API building blocks available to developers in a self-service way--so they can engage with your API 24/7 without asking for access. I&rsquo;ve worked hard to make sure the CityGrid API area has a logical navigation, taking developers to the essential information they will need to learn about and integrate with the APIs: Getting Started&nbsp; Publisher Overview&nbsp; Ads by CityGrid Documentation&nbsp; Content by CityGrid Documentation&nbsp; Code Samples&nbsp; SDKs&nbsp; Usage Requirements&nbsp; Terms and Conditions&nbsp; Version History&nbsp; FAQ&nbsp; Blogs&nbsp; Forum&nbsp; Dashboard With those 13 links you can get to everything you need to know about the CityGrid Places, Offers, Reviews and Mobile, Web and Custom Advertising APIs. I keep a regular flow of information going through the blog to make sure there is excellent SEO content, so developers can search for anything at Google, and the blog will support linking to whats relevant in the CityGrid Developer Center. Even with all of this, I still get some pretty basic questions like: I need PHP code samples? - Immediately available on the code samples page. What does the API cost? - Says that it is FREE on Getting Started and FAQ. Can I save your data in my database? - Says it on the Usage Requirements Do I have to show your logo? - Says it on the Usage Requirements That is just the tip of the iceberg. I&rsquo;ve posed this question before...are there enough doers in the world to make this whole API vision work? It&rsquo;s hard to tell if its just my view, while in the pit of despair, or if it is just the way it is. It seems like there will always be some users who need hand holding, and they refuse to read the self-service material available...[<a href="/2012/04/17/will-a-selfservice-api-area-ever-be-enough/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2012/04/17/profiling-api-developers/">Profiling API Developers</a></h3>
			<p><em>17 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>
For the last couple weeks I&rsquo;m neck deep in getting to know the developers who already use the CityGrid APIs.  I want a better understanding of who a developer is, what kind of business they have and what they are looking to get out of the API.
To find this out I start out profiling them socially using Rapportive&nbsp;(which I plan on automating using the&nbsp;Full Contact API as soon as I have more time) for the following information:

Twitter Profile
LinkedIn Account
Facebook Profile
Google + Profile
Github Profile

Usually I know the URL of their website, but if I don&rsquo;t, I can extract from their email address or sometimes Rapportive will provide for me. I visit each developer&rsquo;s site and look for:

Blog w/ RSS Feed
Business Contact Email 
Business Contact Form

Next I build a quick one sentence description, telling me who they are and what they do.  I also assemble a comma separated list of keyword and key phrases that best represent what they do.
Before I&rsquo;m done looking around their site I take a picture of their home page, so I have a visual reference to go with the developer profile. The home page image can go further than just a logo sometimes.

I take all of this information, put it into a database, and connected it to a JQuery Carousel that allows me to watch a slideshow that walks me through the world of my developers, and watch like a TV channel.
This process not only gives me a 100K understanding my developer ecosystem, but helps me remember as much as I can about each developer.  From this I hope to better engage them on a daily basis as well as provide feedback to the CityGrid API roadmap based upon quality API developer segmentation.

			<h3><a href="/2012/04/17/finding-sponsors-for-my-local-hackathon-tour/">Finding Sponsors for my Local Hackathon Tour</a></h3>
			<p><em>17 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m currently planning a 9 city hackathon tour, starting with the CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon, and following up with Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, NYC, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Austin.
The CityGrid Hackathon tour is meant to bring together commercial and civic hackers to build the next generation of apps we use in our everyday "local" lives.
I&rsquo;m trying to find a blend of developers, business, marketing and advertising folks that will come together and develop commercially viable ideas that can also make our cities better places to live.
So I'm looking for sponsors that really enhance the local theme of the event, so I started with:

Local API Stack - These are APIs that I track on for CityGrid, providing direct value to local mobile and web app developers.
Mobile Back-end as a Service - Service providers that exclusively provide back-end platforms and tools for mobile developers.

I&rsquo;d be happy if all of these companies could provide the sponsorships that I need to support the event, but it probably won&rsquo;t be enough.  So I&rsquo;m looking elsewhere with some of the usual suspects like Amazon Web Services, Rackspace and Twilio.
Regardless of what my sponsor line-up looks like I think I will still provide a directory of local APIs for developers to use, so that they have a robust listing of high quality APIs to choose from when building their local web and mobile apps.

			<p><em>13 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>When I was a tech blogger for ReadWriteWeb and API-related news broke, we writers would often shudder. &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t use API in the headline,&rdquo; the argument in the newsroom went. It&rsquo;s the page-view-kiss-of-death. That&rsquo;s not because APIs aren&rsquo;t super-important or super-ubiquitous on the Web (they are both). It&rsquo;s because most &ldquo;normals&rdquo; don&rsquo;t know what they are or why they matter. They&rsquo;d rather click on a story that says &ldquo;101 Ways to Use Pinterest to Plan Your Wedding.&rdquo; The decision to cover APIs regularly on ReadWriteWeb and eschew stories that fall into the &ldquo;[Number] Ways to Use [Hot New Social Media Tool] to [Conduct a Seasonally-Relevant Activity]&rdquo; goes a long way to explain the popularity of RWW versus that of Mashable, incidentally. Also incidentally: Pinterest has an API. This all presents a bit of a challenge, of course, if I want to make an argument for my readers here about why APIs really matter in education. Do I frame the argument for &ldquo;normals&rdquo;? (Wait! HA! &ldquo;Normals&rdquo; don&rsquo;t read Hack Education!) Do I frame it for educators? Entrepreneurs? Technologists? The answer: hopefully all of the above. What is an API? API stands for &ldquo;Application Programming Interface.&rdquo; At its most basic level, an API allows one app to talk to another app. It&rsquo;s the way in which Web and mobile technologies can open up their data and their software&rsquo;s functionality to others. It&rsquo;s how Zynga integrates its games with your Facebook profile. It&rsquo;s how websites handle accepting payments via Paypal and play YouTube videos. It&rsquo;s how Instagram can share your photos to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Tumblr. Rather than having to export a file from one system, then import it into another, APIs allow programs to &ldquo;make calls,&rdquo; sending and receiving just the information they need just when they need it. Web APIs (also known as REST APIs) do this &ndash; well obviously &ndash; via the Web using the protocols of the Web (HTTP). But instead of...[<a href="/2012/04/13/why-every-education-company-needs-an-api-amp-why-educators-should-care-when-one-doesn039t/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Apr 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I was going to write this story when I got an email from Qwerly after they got acquired by Fliptop, then after SimpleGeo was acquired by Urban Airship, then when I got the email from LinkedIn announcing they were shutting down IndexTank.  Four acquisitions later, I&rsquo;m finally making time today after the announcement of Facebook acquiring Instagram.
So, what will happen to Instagram API developers, now that Instagram is owned by Facebook?  We don&rsquo;t know.  It sounds like Facebook will keep Instagram in tact, but who knows where it will go from here, where founder Kevin Systrom will take it, or Facebook will step in and make changes.
If your like Postagram, you&rsquo;ve already diversified beyond the Instagram API and acknowledged that you need to offer more than what you can build off a single API provider.  We&rsquo;ve hear the cry of many developers when Twitter poaches from its ecosystem, Google decided to shutter Google Translate, then quickly decided to offer paid version--it doesn&rsquo;t matter who your API provider is, nobody is immune from acquisition or their API service being shuttered.
I wanted to ask the question about Instagram API developers before the API haters, jump in and blame the API.  Its not about the API, its about the API owners acknowledging their API ecosystem exists, and its developers, and whether or not they have a solid business strategy that includes having multiple suppliers for their content and products.
Hopefully you are a developer that understands the APIs you use to power your web or mobile application are potential vendors that could stay around for the next 10 years, or they could go away tomorrow with the next billion dollar acquisition--and with the right business strategy, maybe you could walk away with $400 Million, with your 40% equity, when your killer app is acquired.

			<p><em>31 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
While assembling the building blocks for a successful API ecosystem, one of the requests I get from developers is for tools to help them build successful integrations with existing platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, Facebook and Salesforce.
Some of the requests I get are from non-developers who just want a plug and play tool, they can deploy without needing to write code--but many of the requests are for white label, starter kits that developers can use to quickly deploy API driven applications on popular platforms like:

Wordpress
Drupal
Facebook
Salesforce
Joomla

I&rsquo;m not an expert in any of these platforms, but I find the more I dive into developing on these platforms, the more I learn and the more I discover other experts who really understand the ins and outs of building plugins and add-ons for 3rd party systems. &nbsp;
In addition to building code samples, code libraries and generic start kits for your API, you may want to take a look at building white label, 3rd party platform plugins and add-ons your developers can use to quickly integrate your API into existing networks. &nbsp;
At the very least, you will learn a lot.

			<p><em>30 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>I read a post over at Cloud Ave today by Martijn Linssen, Why API&rsquo;s suck, and what they lack. &nbsp;I'll start by saying, everything he says about APIs, can be true for some APIs, but the post has more to do with the state of tech blogging, than anything to do with APIs. To Linssen's points: First of all, API&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t open - True many APIs use this term, without it being true. But those of in the industry who get it, call these "public" APIs and have stopped using the term "open". Open has been used by a few bad marketing seeds, and perpetuated by the blogosphere. Second of all, API&rsquo;s are for free, mostly, and no uptime is guaranteed - What? Really? Maybe the 10 you've tried don't, but many of the APIs I depend on do. Just to name a few:&nbsp;Google Maps,&nbsp;WebServius,&nbsp;Datasift,&nbsp;Zencoder,&nbsp;Amazon EC2, Amazon S3. Third, API&rsquo;s are badly documented, if any - Sure this can be a problem, and is something everyone is working on. This doesn't point to APIs sucking, more the documentation. &nbsp;Can you point me to the documentation you&rsquo;ve maintained? Its&rsquo; not as easy as it looks. And there are plenty of shining examples of how do you do it right. Ok those are your points? And you went to ProgrammableWeb and looked at 10 APIs? And you came to the conclusion all APIs suck? I've spent hundreds of hours looking through ALL of the APIs in the ProgrammableWeb directory, and yes there is a lot of shit in there. But there are some really amazing examples of the API vision, that you seem to be bothered by.&nbsp; Have you hacked on Twilio? Twilio rocks! Have you used Stripe?

			<p><em>28 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
The largest portion of my time as API Evangelist is spent keeping the area around an API active.  Your developer&rsquo;s first impression when they enter your API area is critical, and if they see signs that your API is inactive, they might start looking elsewhere.
The most common ways I keep an API active is by:

Blogging
Tweeting w/ Twitter Feature in API Area
Forum Posts
How-Tos
Starter Projects
Developer Showcase

By actively posting content in these areas w/ timestamps showing when they were posted, I keep the API area looking like someone is home.
This active content doesn&rsquo;t just help developers visiting the site feel like the API is active, it also helps your SEO. Search engines and social networks will regularly index your content, providing fresh traffic, and potentially new developers to your API.
Just a couple hours a day, generating fresh content and engaging with your developers goes a long ways in attracting new developers and making them feel confident that your API is a priority, and they should integrate it into their applications.

			<p><em>26 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
With all the attention sexism in silicon valley has gotten, I wanted to make sure and showcase some positive news on the Hackathon front this week.
There was a great article in the Oregonian out of Portland called, "Intel 'Code for Good' hackathon helps nonprofits solve technology challenges".
The theme for the hackathon: Girls in education
Code for Good co-organizer Josh Bancroft worked with co-organizer Renee Kuriyan and employees in Intel's corporate affairs group to help four nonprofit organizations, World Pulse, a Portland-based nonprofit; Room to Read; 10X10: Educate Girls Change the World; and Global Campaign for Education.
"I felt like we could amplify the impact" by software and corporate working together, Bancroft said. The partnerships were already established by corporate affairs, and the software group simply brought the technical expertise.
Their task was to create software solutions to real-world problems facing girls in education, and for each team to develop an app by the end of the day that the nonprofits could then put to use. The hackathon theme is part of Intel's "She Will" campaign and with the company's overarching mission to "create and extend computing technology to connect and enrich the lives of every person on Earth."
You can read more about the great hackathon over at Oregon Live.&nbsp;I just wanted to point out that not all hackathons are male dominated, and the model can go much further than some of what we see coming out of Silicon Valley.

			<p><em>23 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Every Monday I generate a list of all new API developer who registered for the&nbsp;CityGrid&nbsp;API&nbsp;the week before.  This list has the name and email address for each developer, and I manually go down the list, and email them individually, letting them know I&rsquo;m here to help.
As I email each new API developer I use Rapportive to identify more information about them, such as their website URL, Twitter and LinkedIn profile.  If a developer has a Twitter or LinkedIn profile, I engage them on those networks.
After 3 months of doing this, I&rsquo;ve noticed that developers who work for larger companies have LinkedIn profiles and developers who either are freelance, own or work with a smaller development shop tend to have Twitter.

It makes sense.  Twitter is a more public forum, and smaller companies tend to need to market their skills and services and actively engage the world around them.  While established companies tend to keep their developers in a more closed environment, suitable for the business social network LinkedIn.
This type of information helps me segment my API developer audience into various groups allowing me to craft blog posts, announcements and share other information with them on appropriate channels.  I&rsquo;m not a big fan of emailing, so being able to push out information regularly on LinkedIn and Twitter, and engage with users that are active on these networks, works very well for supporting my approach to API developer support.

			<h3><a href="/2012/03/21/using-github-for-your-hackathon/">Using Github For Your Hackathon</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time trying to track on what gets created at hackathons. &nbsp;Some innovative programming occurs at these events and I&rsquo;d say 98% of it is forgotten by Monday morning.
I think a lot of attention is given to the myth that hackathons are about building startups.  When in reality, how many startups come out of hackathons?  In my opinion the top three things that come out of a hackathon are:

Marketing - For the event organizer, sponsors and for participants. 
Talent Acquisition - There is some seriously talented folks attending hackathons. 
Networking - Hackathons are a great place to meet people, network, make friends and sure maybe a co-founder. 


Beyond that I think there is a lot of code that gets generated at hackathons, that really never goes anywhere.  Much of this code is not immediately VC fundable, but still some of it is really good.  And I see a lot of kids spending whole weekends writing the same or similar code as I saw the weekend before.
To help remedy this, I suggest that event organizers use&nbsp;Github.  Just like every hackathon organizer should identify a Twitter #hashtag for the event, you should setup a Github organization and add your hackers as users.  Encourage them to commit their code through-out the hackathon, and wrap up the weekend with a nice README file of their project.
Seems like a great way to showcase what was built over the weekend, make the intellectual property open and accessible for other people to use, and make it easier for other hackathon participants to build off what has already been created in the past.

			<p><em>20 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>Boston API Jam organizer Sqoot just got themselves into a lot of hot water with some very sexist comments on their hackathon home page (now removed):

From what I can tell, Sqoot was called out by @BoazSender:

Then the pressure quickly was put on in the Twittershpere:

Resulting in Apigee pulling their sponsorship:

And Heroku pulling theirs as well:

Sqoot quickly released an "apology" which included:
"While we thought this was a fun, harmless comment poking fun at the fact that hack-a-thons are typically male-dominated, others were offended."
Their "apology" definitely summarizes the misogynistic tone of the spreading Silicon Valley startup and hackathon culture.
This is a major problem.  One of my biggest complaints about many hackathons is that they are male dominated, and this is nothing to joke about, make fun of or take lightly.  You don&rsquo;t realize it when all you do is attend the all boy hackathons and do your bro-gramming.
I&rsquo;ve been to hackathons where there are equal sexes, and they are awesome-- way more fun, and truly work to solve real life problems, not perceived problems.
I hope other blogs will publicize this, and make other hackathon organizers aware so this kind of shit doesn&rsquo;t not only go away, but we start working the other direction and making sure EVERYONE feels welcome at hackathons.

			<p><em>20 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>As a building block, a blog is a very valuable tool for building awareness of your API, keeping your developers informed and give a personality to the team beyond an API.
My recommendation to API owners is to always have a blog, however one the most damaging things you can do is stop posting to your blog.  A blog is a key variable in my API Stack algorithm, of whether or not an API is worth integrating with, and if you haven&rsquo;t updated your blog anytime in the last year, I immediately step away.
If you want people to find your API, have a blog.  If you want your existing developers to be educated about what can be done with your API, have blog.  If you want developers who find your API, to feel confident enough to integrate it into their app, keep you blog updated!

			<p><em>15 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m going through hundreds of APIs and curating a list of APIs, for what I&rsquo;m calling the API Stack. &nbsp;The API Stack consists of APIs that provide clear value for developers and have demonstrated real investment in their API, and are in it for long haul. There are quite a few things I consider when looking at an API, here are a few: Value - The API offers clear value to developers, without needing an explanation. Web API - They don&rsquo;t have to be 100% REST, but web APIs make developers lives easier. Active Blog w/ RSS - A blog is a quick way to see what is behind the curtain of an API. If they care enough to have a blog, and communicate with developers, and keep it active it demonstrates they care. With an RSS feed I can programmatically understand whether they are active or not. Active Forum w/ RSS - A forum gives developers a voice and also shows an API owner cares what developers thinks, and is willing to support a large community. An active forum is a positive sign of an API, and the RSS feed also gives me a programmatic way to assess. Twitter - An active Twitter presence is a pretty key metric in understanding the value of an API. If the company has the resources to actively engage developers via Twitter, they care. And again I can programmatically monitor and see if someone exists behind the API. There are other metrics I use, but these are proving to be the most positive characteristics of an API that developers can depend on. Many APIs I come across don&rsquo;t even meet these basic requirements. What triggered this post, was I had just looked at about 10 APIs that did not meet these basic requirements, and then I came across one that clearly met all of these, and more--GeoIQ. GeoIQ has a mapping API that provides clear value to developers,...[<a href="/2012/03/15/qualifying-for-the-api-stack/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Social Data Analyzing API Knodes has just announced a $250K startup fund that will invest in the best products, websites and applications built on top of the Knodes API platform.
Knodes Social Data Analyzing API provides developers with social data-based insights about their users across social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and LinkedIn.
With the launch of the Fund, the Knodes team is hoping to bring awareness to their API and jumpstart a new ecosystem of developers, businesses and campaigns whose next generation social applications will be powered by its API.
The Knodes Fund which is in partnership with Quotidian Ventures, will take the best websites, web and mobile applications and give them the resources they need to be successful, including up to $25,000 in equity funding, mentorship and access to new features and social intelligence available via the Social Data Analyzing API.
The Knodes Fund is open to all individuals and companies building an application, website or program using the Knodes API.  Applications can be submitted at Knod.es beginning May 1, 2012, and the deadline to apply for the Knodes Fund is June 1, 2012.

The Knodes Fund represents a growing convergence of the innovation occuring within both API ecosystems and a growing number of startup incubators.  APIs provide a fertile environment to entice talented developers with fresh ideas to build new applications without commitment, while also being able to invest in successful ideas that prove themselves, bringing to life the original business development 2.0 promise of the API ecosystem.

			<p><em>14 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Andreas Krohn&nbsp;(@andreaskrohn)&nbsp;first saw the potential of APIs when he in 2005 started working with enterprise web scraping solutions at Kapow Technologies (now Kapow Software). Conceptualizing the web as one big database and creating APIs to get to that data is not that different from the REST APIs used today. When leaving Kapow to start his own company it was a given that the focus would be on APIs and open data.
Andreas API work is focused in Sweden where he regularly speaks at conferences. Mostly he focuses on the non-technical side of APIs since APIs are doomed to fail without a good business strategy and long term marketing plan. The ones that really need to understand the potential of APIs are the business people and then focusing on the money instead of technology is the way forward. He is also providing consulting services customers regarding API strategies and technologiesone such project he has been active in is Trafiklab which is a portal for Swedish public transport APIs. The goal of the project is to collect Swedish travel related APIs in one place with consistent documentation, API-key handling and support to make them as attractive to developers as possible.
He writes about APIs on Swedens leading API blog Mashup.se and has done so for several years. The focus of Mashup.se is international API news as well as highlighting local Swedish APIs. To increase the use of Swedish APIs he has recently launched the Swedish API directory listing over 200 Swedish APIs. Not much compared to the 5000+ APIs listed on ProgrammableWeb, but a lot for a small country where the wave of APIs are just getting started. The development of APIs in Sweden is currently lead by government agencies and agencies due to European Union directives but Andreas hopes that showing the available private APIs will lead to a wider use of APIs and more private companies developing APIs.

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE This post comes from the SDK Bridge newsletter.  I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you. People are constantly trying to come up with tools to make API documentation an easier task. If you are documenting an SDK built for C++, C#, or Java, there are tools such as Doxygen, Sandcastle, and JavaDocs to take comments from the code and automatically generate documentation from them. Why aren't there tools like this for REST APIs? The beauty of Web APIs is that they can be written in whatever language you like and in whatever manner you like. As long as when an HTTP request comes in, the proper HTTP response goes out, it doesn't matter how it actually happens on the server. But this very flexibility makes automated documentation nearly impossible, since there's no standard mapping between what an API request is and what the code is that generates its response. Nonetheless, there are some solutions out there to this problem. I need to start by saying that there are in fact two approaches to automation that are used to document REST APIs. One is similar to the tools I mentioned above, where comments are taken from code to generate the documentation. The other involves having the documentation separate from the code, but in a data format (such as JSON) that can be parsed and used to generate the documentation. I also should mention that documentation automation does not guarantee good documentation. Before choosing to to incorporate automation into your process, I recommend reading an excellent article by Dana Fujikawa: What to Consider Before Considering Auto-Generated Documentation. Automated Documentation from Code There's no off-the-shelf tool that pulls documentation comments out of code that's going to work for all REST APIs.

			<p><em>05 Mar 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m always looking for new, relevant ideas to write blog posts on for the CityGrid Developer blog.  I have several topics I write about regularly including new projects I&rsquo;m working on, new releases around the API, and what I find during my local, mobile and social landscape analysis.
However it can be hard to find topics to write about that are relevant to CityGrid developers, or publishers as we call them.  To help write blog posts that are useful to my API community I started harvesting ideas and topics from actual forum posts from developers.
Earlier today a publisher submitted a forum post stating their concerns about the age of some of the reviews they get along with businesses, when making requests against the CityGrid Places API.  It was an easy question to answer, since CityGrid also provides a business reviews API, that will give you more control how you can pull reviews for a zip code, neighborhood or specific business.
Using the topic that was posted on the forum I was easily able to create a quick blog post framing the question and providing a detailed answer explaining how the CityGrid Reviews API provides a solution.
Now CityGrid publishers can potentially be exposed to this solution via the blog, RSS feed and since I actively syndicate my blog posts, they will see it if they follow CityGrid on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and also using a search engine.
When evangelizing for an API, I feel it is important to try and provide as helpful content as you can via an active blog presence, while also reverberating it across the multitude of channels your developers might be listening on--turning relevant forum posts into stories is a great way to do this.

     I am going through the Foursquare API, and found their section about how to get an increase in the number of calls you can make against the Foursquare API interesting:


     If your application runs into any of our rate limits and you think you could use more, write us at [email&#160;protected] We'llneed your OAuth consumer id, an explanation about why you need an increased cap, and information about the following 


     
          Usage: A description of the endpoints you're calling and how you're using the data retrieved. We use this to make sure you're abiding by our Platform Policies and Terms of Service. Sample requests are generally helpful.
     
     
          Attribution: Screenshots of your application so we can confirm you're attributing foursquare correctly.
     
     
          Caching: Cache venue details where appropriate to avoid making spurious requests to our servers. See theRetention section of our Platform Policies for more details.
     


     I like the idea of rewarding developers with the ability to make more calls against your API, when they adhere to your terms of service and benefit your operations.

			<p><em>26 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>API Evangelist has grown beyond being just a research blog. It is time for me to update the about us page, and its time for me to tell the story of what is "API Evangelist", and how I view my role in the API industry. API Evangelist started in July 2010. I was burning out in my job as VP of Technology for an events management company that managed events for SAP and Google. I was looking for a way to re-invent myself, doing something that I enjoyed, but also keep me employed for the next 5 years or more. I was looking for something that I was knowledeable about, would be around for a few years. I quickly identified web APIs as this focus. Web APIs had been a big part of my career since the early 2000’s. I’ve designed and consumed a lot of APIs, and they were the glue in a platform I built for my web development company Original Web Solutions, which I ran from 2000 through 2008.  But I also saw web APIs as vital, but quiet player in the growth of the Internet: Social - Web APIs grew up along with social platforms like Flickr, Delicous, Twitter and Facebook. Cloud - Web APIs came of age, with proving they could deploy IT infrastructure via Amazon Web Services, and are the power driving Paas and Saas. Mobile - Web APIs are becoming ubiquitous with the growth of iOS, Android, Blackbery and Windows mobile phone usage. This locked it in for me. APIs were not only growing, they were going to be around for a while. So I started API Evangelist, and began researching the space, looking for a way that I could make not only a career, I could also make an impact. I set out, researching the space. I evaluated over 200 of the top web APIs, and wanted to understand their approach, why they were successful (or not), and who were...[<a href="/2012/02/26/what-is-api-evangelist/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>When new users sign up for the CityGrid API, I immediately get an email with their name, email and phone number, which are required for registration. The API is self-service, and I rely on the essential building blocks I&rsquo;ve assembled as part of the API area to support them in their first hours and days of integration. Five days after registration, if a publishers has not reached out to the CityGrid API team, or show any usage on the API, I reach out to them via email, asking if there is ANYTHING I can do to make their integration successful. I do not send an email blast, I email them one by one, and as I do this, I use Rapportive in my Gmail to identify if they have a Twitter, Google+ or LinkedIn account. I then send a personal email, and follow them on their social networks and research their business web site, if they have one. I&rsquo;d say about 65% of my API users that are responsive, reply and tell me they are planning on integrating and just need more time or are waiting for the development resources to free up and then they&rsquo;ll tackle integration. These are perfect candidates for social media, and because they are responsive they tend to follow me back on Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+. Since I keep my social networks active on a daily basis, hopefully they&rsquo;ll see regular, informative posts from me, demonstrating not only is there a person behind the curtain at the CityGrid API, that I am actually investing in their success. New registrations are only one of my API success metrics. My ultimate goal is to have them actively consuming the Places, Reviews and Offers API and making money using CityGrid Mobile and Web Advertising and Places that Pay. &nbsp;To&nbsp;convert users from new to active users, I have to stay engaged with them, and I couldn&rsquo;t do this without the use of social media....[<a href="/2012/02/26/role-of-social-media-in-managing-an-api-ecosystem/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>
Garrett Wilkin&nbsp;(@garrettwilkin) has been working with complex, high-performance, financial software systems for more than 6 years. &nbsp;During this time he has learned to analyze and understand large software applications with dozens of concurrent processes. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s accustomed to complexity and excels at translating technical issues into higher level concepts for non-technical audiences. &nbsp;
He feels passionately about the opportunities for collaboration and innovation that are being produced through the API trend of recent years. &nbsp;He recently attended and&nbsp;participated in the hacking at Music Hack Day&nbsp;in Boston. Having been inspired by the electric, creative energy at this event, he&rsquo;s seeking further engagement with the wider hacking community.
As a writer for ProgrammableWeb since March 2011 Garrett has written&nbsp;more than 100 articles&nbsp;on APIs and the strategies behind them. Because of their shared passion for creativity and innovation, he enjoys engaging the technical and business leadership from these companies in discussing their niche in the API space.
His latest web technology project seeks to use Twilio to bridge the technology gap in rural communities where many people lack familiarity with or access to the web. &nbsp;Seeing value in the wisdom and cultural perspectives of these people who do not participate in our digital age, he hopes to use the old fashioned phone to facilitate their involvement.

			<p><em>17 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>I'm a member of a Google group called API Craft.  There are some really smart API folks talking about everything from API deployment to API business strategies there. &nbsp;
The other day someone in the groups asked:
How does someone measure success in developing and deploying a public&ndash;facing Web API?
Scott Regan (@scottregan) of Apigee gave a great response, and I wanted to share with everyone here.  Scott&rsquo;s suggestions for measurements were:

Revenue - For public APIs, could be affiliate program revenue, ad revenue, or if incremental traffic from apps to the website has a known monetization rate
Reach -  Incremental new user accounts or unique users
Partnerships - Number of new partnerships established around your API
Apps - The number of new apps developed using your API
Traffic - Apply percentage of incremental traffic ("our API channel is now X% of total internet traffic")
Brand - Measuring increased 'brand', but only if the company has an really established way to do this

Scott goes on to say:
When it comes to business metric tracking one thing i've seen work well is when the  API team publishes a 'dashboard'  widely and regularly -   tracking actual results to estimates  -   because it helps PM focus the roadmap on what moves the business needle as agreed and avoid getting the team pulled in different directions.
Each API could potentially have different success factors depending on the type of API or the goals of a company.  But revenue, reach, partnerships, apps, traffic and increased brand awareness are good places to start. &nbsp;Thanks Scott.

			<p><em>15 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I first wrote about interactive API documentation with Posterous&rsquo;s new API area in June 2011, then the follow-up when&nbsp;Mashery deployed their own version called I/O Docs in July 2011.
Smart, interactive or I/O API documentation is an evolution of API documentation from static and often boring documentation, to more interactive and real-time experience, allowing you to make live calls against an API while also browsing the documentation that explains how it operates.
Peter Gruenbaum of SDK Bridge has surveyed and done exhaustive research on what developers say about API documentation and web API documentation best practices, proving that up to date, and complete documentation can be very successful in helping developers get up and running using an API.
The API Service Provider, 3Scale has stepped up with their own interactive API documentation for users of their platform using Swagger, an open-source framework that lets developers learn, play, test and debug each element of an API in real-time.
There are 3 main benefits for API owners coming from adopting Swagger:

Automated, consistent generation of clean, beautiful, interactive API documentation
Generation of client code and SDK in Scala, Java, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, and Actionscript 3
Feeding into an industry wide API discovery language that both developers and non-developers can use

While many companies are providing API explorers for their developers to make live calls against their APIs, I think interactive documentation holds more value in educating developers about APIs, while also allowing them to make real-time calls.  My feeling is that this makes some tough concepts stickier while trying to understand and integrate with an API.
Visit the 3Scale site for more information on using their API management platform for deploying interactive documentation, using Swagger, for your APIs.
Disclosure: &nbsp;I have consulted with 3Scale on industry strategy several times.

			<p><em>13 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>Much of the work I get as an API Evangelist starts with a review of an API area. I have evolved a way to look at API areas, and identify which building blocks are present or missing, all contributing to the success or failure of an API. I started evolved this methodology in summer of 2012 when I was first building API Evangelist, by reviewing over 250+ of the top APIs out there. I generated a list of the common building blocks used by APIs, as well as identified a bunch of innovative and less commonly used building blocks. When I first started working with CityGrid I reviewed their API area, which contained the following building blocks: API Dashboard Documentation for Content and Advertising APIs SDKs for iOS and Android Version History Blog Forum(s) Terms and Conditions Usage Requirements Self-Service Registration I have a list of what I consider essential API area building blocks, and most of them are represented here, but there were a couple missing. So today I added 3 more areas: Getting Started Publisher Overview FAQ An API has to have a getting started page as well as a place for frequently asked questions. Developers have to find the information they need to go from evaluation to integration without asking for help. The publisher overview page is unique. It covers the different business tiers of developers, or as we call them at CityGrid, publishers. Even though these tiers are unique to how we approach things at CityGrid, they are four potential levels of an API ecosystem, that other API owners can employ. The CityGrid API area is not up to par 100% by the standards I preach here on API Evangelist. I&rsquo;m working on a new code samples page which has PHP, Python, Ruby code samples and starter kits--which I will publish this week at some point. But overall the CityGrid API community contains the essential building blocks I feel are necessary...[<a href="/2012/02/13/citygrid-places-reviews-offers-and-advertising-api-review/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I am an eternal optimist, especially when it comes to APIs.  I really feel that APIs can decouple businesses assets and resources, making these companies much more efficient.
We&rsquo;ve seen the power of the API when it comes to companies like Twitter, Twilio, Facebook and many others.  But to build something on top of an API, you have to be a do-er.
A do-er is a term invented by Jeff Lawson (@jeffiel) of Twilio:
Do-er (n): A particularly driven individual, esp. a developer, who picks up their tools and builds something special.
Do-ers are a fundamental ingredient in API ecosystems, and when I go to many conferences and walk by booths I see a fundamentally different process of holding peoples hands and showing them what they need to know.  I also see many companies relying on this process to even make money.
So I have to ask--are we creating enough do-ers? &nbsp;
I am very optimistic about the future of API growth, but I do worry sometimes about there being enough doers to make APIs continue to grow.  Many individuals are so used to the regular sales cycle and corporate training, they don&rsquo;t seem equipped to find solutions to their problems on their own.
Are you a do-er? &nbsp;Do you think there are enough do-ers out there?

			<p><em>07 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>I was reading several stories yesterday about the State of California cutting funding for libraries across the state. These kind of budget cuts really make me worry for the future of our children and our communities. I say it is time that we all come together and figure out a way to re-invent our libraries, and one possible way forward is to remake our local libraries as hacker space. Here are a few ideas I had today about this: Dedicated Hacker Spaces - Each community could have a space to have hackathons that could be used for locally driven events as well as a place for out of town organizers to throw events. Hackathon Model - Libraries could adopt a hackathon model for throwing small or large events in any area, allowing kids and adults to organize and participate in hackathons in any topic area. Sponsorship - Bring in sponsors much like we do for hackathons, allowing tech and other companies to invest in single or ongoing hackathon efforts at libraries in the markets and subject areas that matter to them most. Revenue Opportunities - These sponsorship opportunities would allow libraries to create new ways to fund their operations based upon the corporate sponsors that reflect the type of space libraries want to create. Mentorship - Allow anyone to become a hacker mentor in any subject, allowing them to share expertise and knowledge with others in their community. Resources - Libraries could provide access to computers, Internet connectivity, data repositories, code repositories, APIs, software and other resources that are essential to hackers. Community Innovation - These new library hacker spaces could be centers for community innovation to occur, bringing in outside ideas, and circulating new ideas within existing community leaders. Incubation - Library hacker spaces could be centers of business incubation, providing a rich and fertile environment for ideas to take root and find the resources and talent they need to actually become businesses, creating...[<a href="/2012/02/07/lets-remake-libraries-as-hacker-spaces-and-community-innovation-centers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>I brought my 11 year old daughter Kaia, to the Trojan Hack at USC Friday night and Saturday, which was a new experience for her. I wouldn&rsquo;t say she is on a track to be a hacker like her dad, but she does have a Chromebook, iPhone and is pretty technologically literate. She has asked me a couple times about teaching her how to build a game, or some sort of fashion web site. She has her own Wordpress blog and even went and setup her own Wordpress.com account to blog about Harry Potter without my help. I asked her if she found any of the projects that were being built at the hackathon interesting--she said no, except the Wolves with Friends video game. Then she said, &ldquo;maybe if there were more girl hackers, the projects would be more interesting&rdquo;. Kaia is at a very important age, where I think she can be influenced or turned off in many different ways, and within a variety of subjects. I don&rsquo;t want to push my hacker ways on her, but I want to influence her as much as I possibly can--and leave the decisions up to her. When I go to hackathons with Audrey (@audreywatters) and my daughter I can&rsquo;t help but see it through their eyes--where not only the programming challenges are intimidating, but a room full of boys are a big turn off. Something that isn&rsquo;t apparent to me, when I go by myself as hacker white guy. One of things I&rsquo;ve noticed at various places I&rsquo;ve worked is that the tone of the workplace, the focus of projects, and the overall energy is different when there are more girls on teams. This is something that is very apparent working at CityGrid, not just the diversity of the workplace, but that there are many female managers and team leads, which sets a very positive tone for the company. We HAVE to begin to have more...[<a href="/2012/02/05/where-are-the-girl-hackers-at-hackathons/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Feb 2012</em></p>
			<p>I've been having a lot of discussions with folks around the country about how to make money from data. There is a lot of data being pushed out there from federal, state and city governments, as well as from private companies and individuals--without much evidence of revenue. At this point there seems to be money in acquiring, processing, storing an deriving meaning out of the data, but not much money in actually selling access directly to the data. Through portals like opendata.socrata.com we are seeing more government agencies and cities publish their data, and after talking with the guys from Socrata last week, their focus is on helping more agencies get their data up, not metering or building business models around the data.  Socrata has some great tools, that let developers customize how they want to access the data, and use in their applications, but there really are no mechanisms that allow data owners to make money from their data. Granted this is public data, so it should be publicly available for anyone to access and use. However there are costs associated with acquiring, processing and making this data available for download and via APIs. I've had discussions with several data evangelist about how government could maximize their efforts around data in the virtual space and even charge for it under certain circumstances, allowing them to generate revenue to cover operational costs as well as fund more data projects. If you think about it the government does this with public domain in the physical space. Cities and National Parks are free and open spaces for anyone to use, but once you begin looking to use these spaces for commercial use, you are required to apply for permits, and often pay fees and revenue share for access to these spaces and facilities. Why shouldn't this same thinking be applied to the virtual public domain? Don't get me wrong. I'm not a huge fan of having to...[<a href="/2012/02/01/should-the-government-subsidize-and-profit-from-data-markets/">Read More</a>]</p>

     One of the biggest areas around APIs I think needs attention in 2012 is more tools that focus on developers. There are plenty API services and tools focusing on API owners, but we need to start making sure developers are taken care of.


     So its nice to see the Mashery’s new Developer Connect, which matches developers with companies looking for specific API development skills. Mashery partnered with Elance to develop the API skill matchmaking service, powered by Elance’s huge network of professional technical talent.


     There are plenty of developers out there who have polished their skills working with specific APIs, either on production, or hobby development projects, and would love to find freelance work, and make some money of their talent.


     On the flip-side, there are plenty of companies looking to build web and mobile applications that use one or many APIs, and would prefer to contract with developers who already have experience with those APIs.


     Its a win-win situation for developers, API owners and companies looking to build on top of APIs. I think it is also a sign that the API space is really maturing. With platforms like Mashery’s Developer Connect, powered by Elance, developers may now be able to make a good living specializing in API development.


     Its a great idea, I wish I had come up with it! Oh wait. I did!! In fall of 2010, and pitched it to Elance, after pitching the idea, I even built a Elance Developer Area prototype, and did a four part series on the potential.


     I actually don’t have a problem with this, I thoroughly enjoy my ideas getting used, rather than sitting on the back burner. What did piss me off, is when I was offered the exclusive by Elance after they actually built their version...they sent me a Techcrunch post, saying here is your exclusive.

			<p>I'm working on a framework for the City Grid API that helps define the different types of developers that are using our APIs, helping me understand how to better support them, and ensure their success. This particular approach is different than segmenting my developers by type of development, like web and mobile or by industry like real estate or medical. I'm focusing on the business side of the API, and identifying what developers need to be successful in the business of the applications they are building on the CityGrid API, and where I should focus CityGrid resources. I'm breaking down our API developers into four distinct levels: Open - Publicly available, self-service use of the API, with general forum and email support via developer area. Associate - Motivated app developers who demonstrate their understanding of an API, submit their app for internal approval and take advantage of revenue sharing opportunities around the API. Partner - Developers who already have successful businesses or have built businesses around the CityGrid APIs, and may have higher usage needs, and usually contribute some value back to the CityGrid business model and API ecosystem. Incubation - Developers who have grown their businesses in significant ways, but need mentoring and investment of additional resources to take their business to the next level. Anyone can register to use the API and become an open developer, integrating businesses, places and other related content like reviews, offers, images and videos in their web or mobile apps. The API is self-service, allowing anyone to participate.  I can speculate what these developers need, but its up to them to let me know how they are building on the API and what they need to go to the next level. To rise up to the next level of associate, you need to demonstrate you've integrated CityGrid APis into your app, using best practices, while adhering to the CityGrid Terms and Conditions and Usage Requirements.

			<p>I had the pleasure of getting an early copy of the APIs: A Strategy Guide, Creating Channels with Application Programming Interfaces, by Daniel Jacobson(@daniel_jacobson), Greg Brail(@gbrail), Dan Woods(@danwoodscito), published by O’Reilly Books. APIs: A Strategy Guide, provides the essential knowledge needed for planning, implementing and managing an API in this emerging API driven world. Written by Daniel Jacobsen who has managed two of the fastest growing and progressive APIs I know of--Netflix and NPR, and Greg Brail who is probably the one individual who has deployed the most number of APIs in the industry, and not leaving out Dan Woods who's is responsible for bringing this book together. The APIs: A Strategy Guide is sound advice for any executive, business, marketing or engineering person looking to deploy an API. But it doesn't stop there, as an experienced API product manager and evangelist it provides a framework to better look at much of what I already do, while also introducing some new concepts I hadn't considered. From a business perspective the book describes the API opportunity perfectly while providing the necessary business, product and value chain understanding to take on an API initiative within any company. As an author who's written a book on the Business of APis, Jacobsen, Brail and Woods take it even deeper and perfectly describe the business imperative for using APIs in your company. From a technical guide, you can't ask for a better approach than Jacobsen and Brail provide. API design is more art than science and they describe a balanced, but deeply technical approach for designing your API, wearing a very pragmatic hat, which is crucial in deploying a successful API. Beyond technical, the book provides the necessary legal considerations that come up when deploying an API, that could make or break your efforts. There is also concrete operational advice regarding how to approach the day to day operations of your API and ensure that you are able to measure and...[<a href="/2012/01/30/review-of-apis-a-strategy-guide-from-oreilly-books/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>This post comes from the&nbsp;SDK Bridge&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you. I recently received an email with the subject "FW: boring job". It was a long email chain that started with someone casting about for someone to write API documentation. It got me thinking about how most developers must wonder&nbsp;why on earth&nbsp;someone with the skills to program would choose to write API documentation instead. "Why" is a good question to ask yourself when starting up a new year. In fact, I recently saw a&nbsp;TED talk video by Simon Sinek&nbsp;on how the most effective people, companies, and organizations, start by thinking about&nbsp;why&nbsp;they do something instead of&nbsp;what. In the video, Sinek brings up examples like Apple, the Wright Brothers, and even Martin Luther King, whose most famous speech began with "I have a dream" (why) and not "I have a plan" (what). In this newsletter, I'll talk about why we write API documentation, from how it impacts the world to how it challenges us personally. But first, here's what SDK Bridge been up to since our last newsletter: Writing C++ documentation for software embedded into agricultural vehicles. Writing REST documentation for a company that creates software for governments. Writing REST documentation based on&nbsp;OpenSocial&nbsp;to be able to create and manage online meetings.

But to a few of us, it's a fascinating area. What gets us so excited? Enormous Impact In case you haven't heard, the biggest technology revolution is happening since the invention of HTML.

     When new developers register for the CityGrid API, I get an email with their name and email address. I want to make sure each developer knows I’m here, and available to help them get up and running as quick as possible.


     Emailing them as soon as they register seems a little too pushy, but following them on Twitter, with my personal Twitter and the CityGrid API Twitter account makes sense. So how do I get their Twitter handle, without spending too much time and derailing whatever I’m working on?


     In comes Rapportive. For those of you who don’t know what Rapportive is, it is an browser add-on that runs in my Gmail and shows me everything about a contact I’m emailing with. On the right hand side it lists as much information associated with the email as the service can find, such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.


     So when I get a new registration email from CityGrid APIs, I highlight the email address and it shows me information about the user. Many users don’t maintain active online profiles, so it returns nothing. However a handful, have Twitter accounts associated, which I immediately follow with my personal and CityGrid API Twitter accounts.


     Both of my Twitter profiles clearly reflect CityGrid APIs, so when I follow them on Twitter, my developers know who I am, and they should now be aware that I am here to help. If they have any questions, they know they know how to find me.

			<p><em>22 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>When I started with CityGrid as their API Evangelist, I wanted to make sure and share as much of my strategy with my audience here, in real-time. Of course I&rsquo;ve been so busy executing I have forgotten to tell the story about what I&rsquo;m doing. So let me take a few moments to kick off telling the story of what I&rsquo;m doing to build awareness of the CityGrid Places, Reviews, Offers and Advertising&nbsp;APIs. Let me paint a picture from the 100K foot view, then in other posts I&rsquo;ll go into more detail. Here are the areas I&rsquo;m focusing on: API - The CityGrid API already provides clear value and has a developer base, but there are always ways to improve. I will be providing feedback regularly, to the CityGrid API team on where we can improve on our APis. API Area - Spending time in December hacking on the CityGrid APIs, I experienced first hand what it takes to get started hacking using the content and advertising APIs. While it is still fresh in my mind, I&rsquo;m working on building a new getting started, publisher overview, FAQ and code samples and SDK page to help my publishers get up and running with their own development. Hyp3rL0cal - To wrap my head around the CityGrid APIs I needed a project, so I started Hyp3L0cal, a playground for building local applications using CityGrid and other local and social APIs. I will be publishing all my code there, for others to use in their projects. Presence - A healthy presence is important to the success of the CityGrid APIs. I am focusing on equal doses of an online and offline presence for CityGrid. The online presence consists of actively blogging, tweeting and coding on projects, while my offline presence includes a non-stop tour schedule of hackathons and conferences. Publishers - CityGrid calls its developers, &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;. I am focusing on helping attract new publishers, and educating them about what...[<a href="/2012/01/22/api-evangelist-strategy-for-citygrid/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>I just wrapped up two separate Facebook Hackathons, one in&nbsp;New York&nbsp;and the other in&nbsp;Boston. &nbsp;Both events started with presentations from various Facebook team members, demonstrating different aspects of the Facebook platform.
After the Facebook workshops, there was a presentation by Jim Zimmerman&nbsp;of&nbsp;Thuzi, a preferred Facebook mobile development shop from Florida. &nbsp;During both his talks, he asked audience &nbsp;to raise their hand and show which platform they developed their mobile apps on.
The breakdown in New York, from my view was about:

25% iOS
25% Android
50% HTML5

While the breakdown in Boston, from my view was about:

&nbsp;10% iOS
10% Android
80% HTML5

In both cities HTML5 was the clear choice of developers. &nbsp;Even though Facebook still heavily focused on native app development during their workshops you can tell they were leaning heavily towards HTML5, by inviting PhoneGap to present, and giving away HTML5 t-shirts.
I don't think HTML5 has won the mobile battle by any stretch, but after seeing Adobes heavy focus on HTML5 at the&nbsp;Designing &amp; Developing for Mobile Workshop in San Francisco, and now the dominance of it by developers at both Facebook Mobile Hacks, I think the tide is turning.

			<p><em>21 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>
One of the areas of API development I'm focusing a lot of energy on in 2012 is around monetization.  I want to help define the playing field, of how API owners make money from their APIs, as well as how developers make money from their apps.
Both areas are extremely critical for the success of any API ecosystem.  If the API owner does not have a clear path to generate revenue, the API won't be sustainable, and eventually will go away.
On the other side of the coin, developers have to be able to make money from their apps in order to sustain their work, and build a viable business around an API.
As part of my work on understanding the developer side of things, I'm doing several posts asking developers how they make or plan to make money from their apps. Two obvious ways immediately come to mind:

App Sales - Download and service based fees around apps.
Advertising - Web and mobile ads in apps.

Advertising has long held the title when it comes to monetizing apps, and iTunes and iOS sparked the mobile app gold rush.  But what other ways are there?
How can developers make money from their apps in ways that make them successful and sustainable? At CityGrid we have "Places that Pay", where users get paid for showing certain business profiles, and we are working on other versions of "Content that Pays", in the future.  But there has to be other innovative ways to make money from web and mobile app development.
Let me know how you are making money from your apps!

			<p><em>16 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>This is a guest post by Travis Spencer, a Software engineer specializing in federation, SSO, cloud computing, Web services, &amp; enterprise architecture. This week, AT&amp;T announced the release of a new API platform that is made up of various components designed to simplify mobile Web application development and utilize resources only available through them. Specifically, the new offering is made up of the following: A number of RESTful cloud services such as device location, MMS, digital signing, and direct carrier billing An application marketplace and distribution channel A hosting environment for the HTML5 and server-side components used by applications running on the platform SDKs for common development environments such as C#, PHP, Ruby, and Java that can be used to call the API An HTML5 client-side SDK built atop Sencha Touch that abstract away the various mobile UI differences of Android, iOS, Blackberry and others while simultaneously simplifying the integration w/ their new cloud services These are complimented by extensive samples, documentation, forums, on-line support, and a non-production environment where you can create an unlimited number of test applications. After joining the developer program, you can use the portal to create applications. When you do so, you specify which services your application will use (as shown in the adjacent screenshot). If you are developing a mobile Web application w/ HTML5, the SDK for that platform greatly simplifies the process and reduces the effort required. It does this using the architecture shown in the following figure. As depicted, an HTML5 application calls the new cloud API via a proxy (possibly hosted by AT&amp;T). This intermediary hides the security of the API in a Sencha plug-in, simplifying the programming model clients must follow. This JavaScript library ensures that a user has authorized an application to access her AT&amp;T resources without having to share a username or password. It does this using a standard security protocol called OAuth, which many other APIs discussed previously on this blog also use....[<a href="/2012/01/16/atts-new-cloud-api-platform/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2012/01/13/email-as-a-content-api/">Email as a Content API</a></h3>
			<p><em>13 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>
I think email is highly underrated as a content API.  I know its not what we traditionally think of as an API, but has a lot of potential as a basic interface into an application.
An example of this is If This Then That (iftt). I use iftt to syndicate content to some of my blog platforms.  As part of my blogging strategy I want posts I publish on API Evangelist, to also show up on my Blogger, Posterous, Tumblr and Wordpress.
Using iftt you can setup tasks that get triggered on certain events.  One such trigger is a new post to an RSS feed.  So when a new blog posts shows up in the API Evangelist RSS feed I can have iftt pull the title and body and push to a channel.  iftt provides channels for Posterous and Tumblr, allowing me to automatically syndicate using their APIs. &nbsp;

There are no channels for Blogger and Wordpress, so I use their Gmail channel in conjunction with the post by email features on Blogger and Wordpress.  So instead of using an API to syndicate my content, I use email as an interface for these blogging platforms.
Using email as a content API is obviously not for every situation, but for some application processes, it might just work for moving content from one application to another, without much overhead.

			<p>Last year there was an accidental post from a Google employee about Google+.  The internal rant was accidentally shared publicly and provides some insight into how Google approached APIs for their new Google + platform, as well as insight how Amazon adopted an internal service oriented architecture (SOA). The insight about how Google approached the API for Google+ is interesting, but what is far more interesting is the insight the Google engineer who posted the rant, Steve Yegge, provides about his time working at Amazon, before he was a engineer with Google. During 6 years at Amazon he witnessed the transformation of the company from a bookseller to the almost $1B, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) API, cloud computing leader.  As Yegge's recalls that one day Jeff Bezos issued a mandate, sometime back around 2002 (give or take a year): All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces. Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces. There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network. It doesn’t matter what technology they use. All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions. The mandate closed with: Anyone who doesn’t do this will be fired.  Thank you; have a nice day! Everyone got to work and over the next couple of years, Amazon transformed itself, internally into a service-oriented architecture (SOA), learning a tremendous amount along the way. Think about what Bezos was asking!   Every team within Amazon had to interact using web services.  If you were human resources and you needed some numbers from marketing, you had to get them using an...[<a href="/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I needed a way to tell the story of the&nbsp;CityGrid API&nbsp;from the perspective of cities across the United States. &nbsp;The way I tell stories is through programming and hacking on APIs, so I needed a project that would allow me to hack on CityGrid&rsquo;s&nbsp;places,&nbsp;reviews&nbsp;and&nbsp;offers&nbsp;as well as play with different ways of using the&nbsp;web, mobile and custom advertising&nbsp;we offer.
So I created&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal, my playground for all things local. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal gives me a place to publish projects that I hack on using the CityGrid APIs, while also telling the story of what I build in real-time. &nbsp;You can find local applications I build in a variety of languages, complete with links to&nbsp;download and fork on Github, and even in some cases I publish Amazon Machine Images (AMI) with the code already loaded and ready to use.
As the API Evangelist at CityGrid I will be touring around the country attending hackathons and conferences, &nbsp;spreading the word about CityGrid, and interacting with developers in different cities. &nbsp;Each city I visit, I will launch a copy of my local directory prototype for that city, and publish to Hyp3rL0cal. &nbsp;This will allow me to see the quality of data available via CityGrid APIs for each city and community I visit.
I have added a&nbsp;blog to Hyp3rL0cal&nbsp;where I will tell the story of my projects and travels around the country evangelizing about&nbsp;CityGrid. &nbsp;Come back often, I hope this will be as much of a learning experience for you, as it is for me.

			<p><em>11 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>I just wrapped up the AT&amp;T Mobile App Hackathon in Las Vegas. I had a great time hanging out with developers at the Palms Hotel, and watching everyone compete for the 30K in prizes. My primary goal at these events is to get to know developers and hear what they have to say. I was fortunate to connect with one such developer, Ravi Singh (@Code4Ever), and he was so kind to share Ravi's Rules for Hackathon's: #1: Use Eventbrite or Meetup to organize the event. Don't spin your own system because it is a waste of time. Eventbrite has it's own systems to market and get info about your event out. #2: Build a messaging network BEFORE the hackathon and register a hash for it. So many times developers leave the main area to work out their idea and miss critical information. Establish a simple back-end for all messages and let the attendees now and blast all important information about the even through it. #3: BEFORE the event setup a Google Spreadsheet so teams can register for the final presentations and send that out in the first mails. Do not wait to do or announce it late or in slides. #4: FOOD: Do not waste your money in lots of cheap items that are bad for the developer. Pounds of candy and jerky don't help your developers become more productive. There is a reason Google has 640 chef's cooking with organic and healthy foods. Instead of wasting your money on that stuff, find a good local cook or chef to make a hot lunch for the developers. Do not invest in Red Bull or 5hr energy or other food items that are actually bad and questionable for the health of the developers. This doesn't mean you serve tofu and fruit , but that you actively consider making food and providing drinks that are in the benefit of making the best apps. #5: Networking, test the...[<a href="/2012/01/11/rules-for-hackathon-organizers-by-ravi-singh/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2012/01/10/definition-of-hack/">"Definition of Hack"</a></h3>
			<p><em>10 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>
     


     I’m spending a lot of time traveling around the country going to hackathons. I find myself constantly explaining what the term hack means.


     I’m blown away by the number of people, even in the tech industry that still see hack as a negative term. At the AT&amp;T hackathon in Las Vegas , I encountered quite a few hardware folks in town for CES, attending the event. I was asked by one guy, “Are all these people trying to hack someone’s network?”.


     So, as part of my 2012 hackathon roadshow, I will take on trying to rebrand the term. Currently, these are the common definitions of the word hack:


     To cut or chop with repeated and irregular blows: hacked down the saplings
     
     To break up the surface of soil
     
     To alter a computer program
     
     To gain access to a computer file or network illegally or without authorization
     
     To cut or mutilate as if by hacking
     
     To cope with successfully
     
     To chop or cut something by hacking
     
     To write or refine computer programs skillfully
     
     To use one's skill in computer programming to gain illegal or unauthorized access to a file or network
     
     To cough roughly or harshly
     
     A rough, irregular cut made by hacking
     
     A tool, such as a hoe, used for hacking
     
     A blow made by hacking
     
     A rough, dry cough
     


     The definition I’ve heard, and prefer is:


     A quick and dirty programmatic solution to a problem.


     I would like to solicit other definitions and feedback of how you’d like to see the term hack used widely in the media and Hollywood.

			<p><em>08 Jan 2012</em></p>
			<p>
There are a lot of reasons for throwing a hackathon, and what value you get out of a hackathon will vary depending on who you are.
As I explore the hackathon phenomenom in 2012, I&rsquo;m trying to track on what value hackathon organizers, API owners, mobile platforms, developers and other participants get out of hackathons.
I will be tracking on the different reasons people attend hackathons throughout the year, and share my findings, but here in January I know one thing for sure--hackthons are a marketing vehicle.  Whether you are the hackathon organizer, an API provider or developer you are depending on the event to market your organization, business, API or talent and skills as a developer.
In future posts I will write, more about the marketing effect of hackathons, but I wanted to talk about a common mistake I&rsquo;m seeing from hacakthon organizers--no Twitter hashtag for the event.
A Twitter hashtag is probably the most important marketing element of your hackathon.  It should be everywhere, on your site, print materials, slides...everywhere.  A hackathon organizer should be tweeting out every aspect of the event with the hashtag, before, during and after the event.
The hashtag will enable sponsors and other participating businesses to market themselves around the event.  It will also allow hackathon developers to showcase their ideas, skills and applications.
While researching hackathons I have to spend a lot of time tracking down the event hashtag, and many times I have to ask an event organizer to provide it, and often there isn&rsquo;t even one.
If your organizing an hackathon, make sure and establish a unique Twitter hashtag for event right away, and use it everywhere, everyone involved will benefit, and your event will be much more successful.

			<p>To kick-off my role as API Evangelist at CityGrid, I took a quick walk through the world of location and places API. The CityGrid API centers around places API which provides rich local business data via a RESTful API. So getting familiar with other location and places API is critical to my role. While going through each of these APIs in the space I flushed out what I'd consider the high levels areas that these APIs offer. This list is a work in progress, with a goal in helping see the industry, and potentially identify where players are leading the industry, and where there are gaps. Of course it all starts with places information. Rich content about businesses and other geographic points of interest. CityGrid, Google, Yahoo, Bing and other players like Foursquare, SimpleGeo, InfoChimps and Factual all bring places data to the table. CityGrid and Foursquare also bring merchant APIs to the game, allowing businesses to manage their profile data as well as how it gets syndicated across many networks. Along with places data there are various geo related services that are offered across these APIs: GeoCoding Directions Distance Elevation Geofencing The next area I'm grouping location services under would be other content directly related to specific places, pulled through APIs: Reviews Offers Images Videos Menus Editorials After location and business related content I'd say there is a growing pool of related content that may not be directly associated with a business or location, but provide context, and augment places data making it more meaningful to users: Weather Demographics Wikipedia Neighborhood Tagging That isn't a complete list of contextual places content, but a couple of quick ones I found. I will explore this area more later. After content I'm seeing very distinct actions that users can take around location and places data. Again, I'm sure there are more of these, but here is a short list of location actions: Check-In Push Notifications Recommendations You...[<a href="/2012/01/03/service-offered-by-local-social-mobile-api-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     


     2011 was an interesting year for APIs. I wasn't as good as I wanted to be at covering all major API events, but I got some traction with some posts I didn't anticipate.


     Here are my top 10 traffic posts on API Evangelist for 2011:


     
          Apple iCloud API
     
     
          Considerations When Planning Endpoints for your RESTful API
     
     
          Google Launches OAuth 2.0 Playground
     
     
          iCloud Storage APIs
     
     
          The Need for More Transit APIs
     
     
          You Think There Are a Lot of APIs Now? Wait Until Evrythng Has An API!
     
     
          A Flood of APIs Just Waiting to Happen
     
     
          Open Building Blocks for an API
     
     
          Providing Code Libraries is Not Enough for Your API
     
     
          RESTful Business Architecture
     


     I expected Apple related API stories to be big, but the other topics on here like endpoint planning, transit APIs, open building blocks, RESTful business architecture and a flood of APIs were a surprise.


     Overall it shows me that applying APIs and RESTful concepts to business in specific industries can really get people talking.


     A few of these posts were written while I was doing deep dives into government, water and transit industries and how APIs are changing the landscape.


     I hope to do many of these deep industry dives in 2012.

			<p>One of the most important fronts of API development is Government.  All of us API and data guys have all been screaming for city, county, state and federal government to open up their data via APIs for years now.  In 2011 I would say many government officials listened, and opened up almost 100 government APIs, according to ProgrammableWeb: Aadhaar UIDAI Authentication - Online authentication for Indian citizens Alameda County Service Provider - listings for social services in Alameda County (Oakland), CA API.LEIPZIG - Leipzig city data Örebro kommun - Örebro kommun information Baltimore Open311 - Neighborhood public issue reporting tool Berlin Open Data - Berlin data and information Brazil CKAN - Brazil open government data Capitol Words - Track words used by US government representatives Challenge.gov - Government challenge/solution platform Chicago Metropulse - Chicago quality of life data City of Boston Citizen's Connect - Boston residents reporting service City of Chicago Data Portal - Chicago datasets City of Edmonton Open Data Catalogue - City of Edmonton datasets City of Nanaimo - Nanaimo, B.C., datasets City of New Orleans - New Orleans city data City of Rennes - City of Rennes, France datasets City of St. Louis - City of St. Louis data City of Toronto: 311 - Toronto city government services CKAN Ireland - Ireland open government data Data Greater Manchester - Manchester, England open government data Data.CookCountyIL.Gov - Cook County, IL government data data.gov.au - Australia government data data.gov.sg - Singapore government data Data.Illinois.Gov - Illinois government data Data.OK.gov - Oklahoma state government data Data.Oregon.Gov - Oregon state government data Data.Seattle.Gov - Seattle City Government data Data.Washington - Washington state data DataGov.ru - Russian open government data Datahotell - Norway open government data Datanest Fair-Play Alliance - Slovakia government data DirectGov syndication service - UK government content syndication service Empire 2.0 Tech Talk - Government technology discussion platform European Union Legislation - European Union legislative data service FederalRegister.gov - Open source government data Find...[<a href="/2011/12/31/government-opened-data-via-apis-in-2011/">Read More</a>]</p>

     I pulled a list of the 2023 APIs that were added to the ProgrammableWeb API directory in 2011.  I took the description column and used Wordle to generate a tag cloud for 2011.  I think tag clouds can provide a 100K view of where people are focusing their APIs.

			<p><em>25 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>I'm reading The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood right now. So far its a great read. Very thought provoking stuff. I just read this passage on how the first dictionary transformed the way we were able to think about, understand and re-use words: ...the meaning of words come from other words. It implies that all words come from other words, taken together, form an interlocking structure: interlocking, because all the words are defined in terms of other words. This could never have been an issue in an oral culture, where language was barely visible. Only when printing---and the diction---put the language into separate relief, as an object to be scrutinized, could anyone develop a sense of a word meaning as interdependent and even circular. Words had to be considered as words, representing other words, apart from things. For the first time words stood on their own, apart from the stories and poems that contained them. The first dictionaries set into motion, much of what we take for granite today with writing and communicating. It made me think of what APIs are doing for business information and resources. APIs decouple them, making them independent of their original intended form and meaning.  Allowing them be accessed, distributed, re-used and transformed into new ways never even conceived by its original source or creator. The content of an existing travel book could become an interactive application, using Google Earth, Wikipedia and other APIs allowing someone to travel the global on their iPad without leaving their home.   The CityGrid API I evangelize for offers business and places data for cities across the country, with a web and mobile adveritising network.  This single resource can mean many things to different people, it could be a restaurant directory in Seattle or a medical assistance guide in Philadelphia.   APIs have a lot of potential in freeing up many of the business resources, media and content we use everyday and allow...[<a href="/2011/12/25/apis-can-decouple-business-information-and-resources/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>As 2011 comes to an end, I’d like to take another look at what I learned about the API management service provider space in 2011. I started the year engaging 3Scale, Apigee and Mashery, trying to find a platform to build the Mimeo Connect API platform on. Then spent the entire year getting to know each of the API management service providers, and the products they offer. At the end of the year, we are discussing the relevancy of API service providers, so I think a year-end API service provider post is due. The First DimensionTo make sense of the API management space, I’m looking at it in five separate dimensions. As of December 2011, I would set the first dimension and primary API management playing field as: 3Scale Alcatel Lucent Apigee SOA Software Intel Layer 7 Technologies Mashery Vordel These companies are going to provide a gateway, proxy or a connector for your APIs either on-premise or in the cloud. Then through that gateway, proxy, connector they will offer a variety of services to secure, translate, throttle, cache, distribute and scale your APIs as you need. Some of these companies will also provide you with a way to manage usage, billing, reporting and legal for the users, partners and developers who will be consuming your API. These companies will also bring a whole bunch of expertise to the table, that your company can tap while building your API strategy. Some will even help you market your API to developers online and at events. One thing to know about these API management service providers is, well...they are API management service providers. To my knowledge they don’t actually deploy your API for you, they help you build a strategy, and manage the API. But you still need to rely on other tools and in-house resources to deliver your API. A common Google search or in-person query I get is: Apigee vs. Mashery, 3Scale vs. Apigee and...[<a href="/2011/12/23/api-management-service-provider-roundup-for-2011/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2011/12/21/business-of-google-apis-2011/">Business of Google APIs 2011</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>ProgrammableWeb says Google has 94 APIs. I roughly count about 75 going through Google Code. I&rsquo;m more concerned with public web APIs, and Google has Android, Chrome and other non-web APIs, so its hard to tell. In any case I would consider Google to the largest public web API owner around. I don&rsquo;t think any other single provider, owns the number of, as well as size of public APIs, that Google does. As with any leading API providers I think there is a lot to learn in studying their approach to API deployment and management. With this in mind I wanted to take a look at the Business of Google APIs in 2011 as one of my year-end, API reflection posts. I think there are some important lessons to be learned from the work Google did over 2011, to get their API business in order. Google was already setting the theme for 2011, with the launch of Google Console in November 2010. The Google API Console helps developers manage their Google API usage across all of thier sites and apps. It was clear, Google was not just looking for a way to get a handle on how they deploy and manage large numbers of APIs, they were acknowledging developers needed a way as well. Google API Console centralized how developers managed the Google APIs they used, traffic generated via these APIs, introduced billing management for some APIs, and provided developers with project and team building tools. &nbsp;Google supports 30 APIs inside of the API Console now. In 2011 Google also worked to make their APIs more discoverable for developers with the launch Google API Discovery Service. The Google API Discovery Service provides a set of web APIs for discovering metadata across Google APIs by delivering a JSON-based API that provides a directory of supported Google APIs, and a machine-readable discovery document for each API. Now developers can integrate Google API discovery into client libraries, IDE...[<a href="/2011/12/21/business-of-google-apis-2011/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>The FCC just launched a new platform that&nbsp;allows anyone to create, save and manage a customized page, built from widgets that pull content from FCC APIs, called MyFCC.&nbsp; At first glance MyFCC might look like just another dashboard or start page, but it goes much further, as an API curation platform. To understand, you have to go back to the beginning and see the scope of the problem being solved. To deliver on its promise for a more open government, the FCC didn't just want a new website, they needed a platform. To do this the FCC embraced an API-driven methodology while building their web site, meant to standardize the way they deliver information between internal groups, government agencies and with the public. At the time, the managing FCC director Steve Van Roekel, partnered with Seabourne to architect a platform that could deliver on this vision. The new FCC web site would start with Drupal, providing a content management system (CMS) that would allow the FCC to focus on getting a handle on its content, centralizing it, preparing it to be shared with other departments, agencies and the public. The federal government is drowning in content, so the entry, storage and management of this content was the first problem to solve, and an open-source platform like Drupal, was an ideal solution. The new Drupal web site provided public access to the content, but the FCC needed to allow sharing of content with other departments, agencies and allow the public to get at the raw data for re-use. "Everyone is talking about opening up data with APIs, to me it makes more sense to focus on opening up content using APIs.", says Mike Reich, owner of Seabourne. So Seabourne developed the Content API module for Drupal, providing a plug-and-play API, not just for the FCC website, but for any Drupal driven website. Then in April, the FCC launched their API driven content platform, stating that &ldquo;Everything...[<a href="/2011/12/20/the-fcc-lanches-api-curation-platform-called-myfcc/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>
Google just launched their new Google Affiliate Network API, which allows publishers and advertisers to automate various tasks related to the Google Affiliate Network.
The Google Affiliate Network is the affiliate network, formerly known as Doubleclick Performics, which was part of Google&rsquo;s Doublick acquisition in April of 2007.
Using the new Google Affiliate Network APIs, developers can programmaticaly manage:

Advertiser Lookup - Publishers can now use the Google Affiliate Network API to access data that advertisers have chosen to share with them.
Event and Order Details - Developers can easily integrate data from events that occur in Google Affiliate Network into their own website's workflow and internal systems.
Publisher Lookup - Advertisers can use the API to look up data that publishers have chosen to share with them

I need to play with the network more to understand how it works from both an advertisers and publishers perspective.
It looks like an interesting addition to the suite of publishing, advertising and revenue generating tools from Google like Google Analytics, Google Adwords, Google Adsense and Google Webmaster Tools.

			<h3><a href="/2011/12/12/restful-business-architecture/">RESTful Business Architecture</a></h3>
			<p><em>12 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>In my quest to fully understand the underlying principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), i'm re-reading Roy Thomas Fielding original dissertation, Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures, where he first introduced the REST architectural style.
His dissertation explored the junction of two disciplines in computer science: software and networking.
He identifies that software research:
...has long been concerned with the categorization of software designs and the development of design methodologies, but has rarely been able to objectively evaluate the impact of various design choices on system behavior.
While networking research:
...is focused on the details of generic communication behavior between systems and improving the performance of particular communication techniques, often ignoring the fact that changing the interaction style of an application can have more impact on performance than the communication protocols used for that interaction.
 Fieldings work was motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software.  He wanted to rethink software design in the context of the World Wide Web.
The World Wide Web is intended to be an Internet-scale, distributed system, interconnecting information networks across organizational boundaries, and cope with the demands of scalability and independent deployment of software.
As Fielding states:
REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.
As I'm reading his abstract and introduction I can't help but think about where I stand as an API Evangelist, at the convergence of business and RESTful APIs.
When RESTful APIs are applied to business, what does this look like?  Is business currently restricted in the same ways as software?  When business is operating on the World Wide Web do we need to consider the network more?
Lots to consider at the intersection of business and RESTful APIs.

			<p><em>12 Dec 2011</em></p>
			<p>
Google has made another step towards a more common API infrastructure in line with their API Discovery Service, API Explorer, and API Console by launching a single terms of service for all Google APIs.
Google has rewritten their terms from the ground up with the goal of making them easier to understand for application developers.
At the moment it seems as though most of the APIs that use the central terms of service are content and data related APIs, like Google Tasks, Google Moderator,&nbsp;Google Charts and Blogger.
While more complex APIs like Youtube, Google Analytics, Google Adwords and Google Latitude still use their own terms of service.  Over time, more APIs will be migrated to the new, centralized terms of service format.&nbsp;
With almost 100 APIs now, it makes sense for Google to reduce the complexity of terms of use across APIs, increasing the chances a developer will &ldquo;legally&rdquo; build an application or business around one or multiple Google APIs.&nbsp;
Google provides tools for developers to easily discover, explore their APIs, while also providing centralized management of billing, usage reporting and terms of use. &nbsp;I predict we will see other API service providers offering tools for managing terms of use, branding and other legal aspects of API management in 2012.

			<p>I recently pulled the title, description and tags for all the APIs in the ProgramableWeb directory into a local MySQL database. At the time of this writing there are 4,480 public APIs in the directory. My goal is build a better search and discovery interface, so I can get a handle on all these APIs. Which ones I should be paying attention to, recommending to developers and generally just have an awareness of what types of APIs are available. Where do I start? First I start with a keyword search on the title, description and tags associated with each API. I will build a bunch of custom search queries, but no matter how good my queries are, I’m still limited by whatever descriptions are associated with the APIs and whatever tags were applied. This is just search, it isn’t discovery or real-time tracking. Having gone through whole categories of image APIs and storage APIs by hand I know there is a lot of crap APIs that aren’t in my opinion, real API efforts. They just throw up an API, register it with ProgrammableWeb and don’t actually have a supporting area for developers. I need a way to programmatically rank each API while searching through APIs. When I search for photo management APIs, I want them sorted by some sort of value. Currently ProgrammableWeb uses the number of mashups of an API as a “popularity” ranking. I need more and I figured Compete and Alexa APIs could give me some sense of the value of each API based upon its domain. This is just a start and I want to establish a wide variety of metrics for measuring the value delivered by an API. My API ranking algorithm is obviously a work in progress. I just figured I’d tell the story of how I evolve my API ranking algorthm here, and leave open for comment and others to add to.

			<p>
     


     Hackathons are growing into a popular way to spark innovation around hardware, data and APIs within developer and hacker communities. I count over 40 hackathons going on in December alone, and this is just what I can discover and keep up with in my research.


     Hackathons are also being used by many companies to drive innovation internally between departments. Businesses like LinkedIn and Zappos employ Hackathons and Hack Days internally to get recreate this same hackathon phenomenon within their own companies, in a much more controlled, safe environment.


     Now Zappos is going even further and opening up their Internal Hackathon to the public. December 12th through the 16th of 2011 they are holding the Zappos API Hackathon Hack-a-long, which in the past, has been an event open only to Zappos employees, but this year, they want the public to hack alongside of Zappos employees.


     On Monday, Dec 12th, Zappos will post a theme on their blog, and developers will have one week to hack up a project that fits in with the theme. Zappos will be awarding three $100 gift cards for Zappos.com to the winners in three categories: Best Mashup, Best Overall, and Most Fun and Weird.


     Public developer apps will be presented along side internal Zappos employee projects, during their Hackathon Open House. The goal of the event is to help inspire Zappos developers and expose them to the passion and creative juices of the public Zappos developer community.


     I’m spending a lot of time tracking on the evolving Hackathon phenonemon and how these events are spurring innovating both internally within companies and externally in public developer communities in cities around the globe. I’ll keep tracking on the innovation and talent coming out of hackathons and I am excited to see more companies adopt them internally and even inviting the public to come participate in the hacking!

     There was a post a couple weeks back in the New York Times Bits Blog called, "TaskRabbit Looks to Expand Cities and Offer an A.P.I."


     Its a pretty straightforward post about the San Francisco based start-up, that gets you in touch with friendly, reliable people who can help you get just about anything you need done. At first glance, it is a pretty standard post. However I feel there are two things very notable about this post and more specifically, it’s title:


     TaskRabbit Looks to Expand Cities and Offer an A.P.I.


     One, the launching of an API is tied directly to the startups expansion into other cities. Those of us in the know, understand the important role an API plays in scaling your company, but explaining this to mainstream audiences is so important.


     Two, that the acronym "API" gets used in a title of a mainstream publication like the New York Times.  Of course they spell it out in the article, but the editor expects that the user will understand the acronym in the title.


     There are many API stories in 2011, but I think this really shows APIs are coming of age, when it is acceptable for a wider, mainstream audience to accept the term into their vocabulary.


     One of the things I like about APIs is they are a silent, but powerful force behind many industry sectors including e-commerce, social, cloud computing and mobile computing. I think this use of API in the NYT represent classic API style, a silent coming of age, showing APIs are being adopted by a mainstream audience.

			<p>There was a post in the Atlantic about Twitter’s advertising network called, No One's Noticing Twitter's New Ad Experiment, Which Is a Good Thing. Twitter is dropping what they call “promoted tweets” into users timelines. Adam Clark Estes of the Atlantic states: Despite months of hemming and hawing over the danger of polluting the sacred Twitter feed, the few people that have taken notice seem reasonably pleased by the hands-off approach. A user, also cited in the article, Ellis Hamburger at Business Insider thinks the approach is awesome: I realized that Promoted Tweets really aren't that much different from TV commercials—brief interruptions from your content. Except they're not very annoying. … Twitter's commercials are different and have a leg up because they will be intermixed with incredibly time-sensitive content. They're also brief, which helps. And a lot of of the time, Promoted Tweets are from celebrities who tweet their thoughts in their own voice. I’m following Twitter’s rollout of their advertising network because its a big deal to finally see the popular micro-blogging platform finally move towards monetizing the network--even if some don’t like it. But I think the work Twitter is doing has even bigger implications, on the future of online advertising, even beyond social media. The Internets seem to be stuck in a rut, when it comes to monetization of our online real estate. There isn’t much innovation beyond the classic online and slightly newer mobile advertising platforms dominated by Google and a handful of others. What is next? APIs of course. As APIs also struggle to develop their monetization strategies, they tend to default to charging for their services, with some API providers like CityGrid are providing mobile and web advertising solutions alongside their APIs. I feel what Twitter is doing is one possible model for other API owners to follow in monetizing their API platforms. Provide relevant, seamless advertising embedded into each API stream.

			<p>"Are API service providers relevant? Will they remain relevant?" Thats the question asked by Ben Kepes at this years Defrag Conference, while moderating a panel with Apigee's Sam Ramji and Mashery's Neil Mansilla. It was a bold question to ask, perhaps, in front of an audience comprised of people from 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery and Alcatel Lucent -- all API service providers. And Sam's response was to dismiss Ben's question was &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;, steering the conversation elsewhere. Sam seemed to interpret Ben&rsquo;s question as an affront -- not just to Apigee but arguably to all the API providers in the room. But in light of Sam's own arguments about the importance of thinking about apps as intermediaries, I thought Ben's question was particularly interesting. After all, many of these API services providers do just that -- act as intermediaries. On the surface Ben&rsquo;s question may have seemed to be picking a fight with Sam, but I think he meant it, and was seriously asking it of the industry, and I feel it is an important question. I personally think API service providers have a role to play, and can stay relevant if...if they do not impose themselves as intermediaries, but I would love to hear what others think. I believe doing business in the API space, centers around providing clear value to your customers, without getting in their way. In the words of Jeff Lawson of Twilio, "Get out of the way of the Doers!". This philosophy applies to API service providers as well. To stay relevant, the API service providers have to practice what they preach to their customers; be service oriented, decouple and allow their customers to be doers via a self-service, clearly priced, secure platform while providing added value in the form of premium services. Without this practice, API services providers just reflect the old way of building and selling software, not the new API driven world.

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE There is a lot of discussion around the growth of APIs, and what the future will look like. How will we discover and make sense of the number of available APIs, and quickly get to work integrating with the APIs that bring the most value to our apps and businesses. One technology that comes up in every conversation I’ve had is Swagger. What is Swagger? Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. The goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server. The documentation of methods, parameters and models are tightly integrated into the server code, allowing APIs to always stay in sync. Swagger was born out of initiatives from Wordnik, developed for Wordnik’s own use during the development of developer.wordnik.com. Swagger development began in early 2010 and the framework being released is used by Wordnik’s APIs, which power both internal and external API clients. Swagger provides a declarative resource specification, allowing users to understand and consume services without knowledge of server implementation, enabling both developers and non-developers to interact with the API, providing clear insight into how the API responds to parameters and options. I’m familiarizing myself with the specification more and playing with the various tools they provide: Swagger UI - A dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger-compliant API Swagger Core - Defines Java annotations and required logic to generate a Swagger server or client. Swagger CodeGen - Contains a template-driven engine to generate client code in different languages by parsing your Swagger Resource Declaration.

			<p>
     


     Last March Google started support OAuth 2.0 for all of their APIs, and has been pushing all developers to switch to using OAuth 2.0 in all applications.


     Today they announced the OAuth 2.0 Playground which allows developers to experiment with APIs using the OAuth 2.0 protocol, and understand how the protocol functions and will make your life easier.


     The OAuth 2.0 Playground enables developers to walk through each step of the OAuth 2.0 flow for server-side web applications:


     Authorizing API scopes
     
     Exchanging authorization tokens
     
     Refreshing access tokens
     
     Sending authorized requests to API endpoints
     


     At each step, the Playground displays the full HTTP requests and responses for each API.


     Google’s endorsement of OAuth 2.0 was very important for the standard and the API industry as a whole. APIs need a secure and standard way for users to authenticate and allow access to their resources when using web and mobile apps.  With Twitter, Google, Facebook and other heavyhitters on board, OAuth is here to stay.


     OAuth has traditionally been difficult for some developers to implement, which has gotten easier with 2.0. But we all have to work to help developers understand its value and how to implement--tools like Google OAuth 2.0 Playground will go a long way in helping developers understand the standard, ensuring that users app experience is pleasant and secure, and APIs are seen as a secure and efficient way to builld applications around.

Pioneer Corporation just announced the availability of Zypr&trade;, a new voice-powered API that  provides a conversational, voice-control command API allowing developers to integrate Siri like functionality into their own applications.
The Zypr API provides a single RESTful API for developers to access voice UI, maps and routing, local search, social networking, music and radio, contacts, calendars and weather from multiple service providers, including:  Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yelp, AccuWeather, INRIX real-time and predictive traffic information, Slacker Radio, Tuner2 Radio, Wcities, xAd and VoiceBox.
I&rsquo;ve covered unified and aggregate APIs in the past, where within maturing industries like social and cloud computing, service providers are stepping up with a single API to work with multiple providers.  Zypr is similar in that it offers a single API for multiple providers, but uses voice as the mechanism for search.   Zypyr&rsquo;s goal is to normalize, stable and voice-enhanced method for accessing a wide array of constantly changing APIs, Zypr can reduces the impact of service-specific API changes.

&ldquo;Pioneer created Zypr so that any type of developer or device maker on any platform can easily offer compelling new services to enhance their own technology and brand equity,&rdquo; said Susumu Kotani, the president of Pioneer Corporation. &ldquo;We have also changed the rules by allowing developers and device makers alike the opportunity to share in revenue when they deploy Zypr.&rdquo;
In addition to providing revenue sharing opportunities, the Zypr API is available at no chrage to developers.  You can access documentation, code, sample application and other developer tools at www.zypr.net.
With a simple, but powerful RESTful API and the buzz around Siri, Apples new voice tasking system , the Zypr API is sure to be a hit.  If Pioneer Corporation can successfully evangelize the Zypr API and get it into the hands of hackers and developer globally, it could easy become the Twilio of voice tasking.

			<p><em>07 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>
I first reported on service oriented architecture (SOA) pioneer SOA Software&rsquo;s entry into the API management arena back in June, today at the Cloud Computing Expo in Santa Clara, CA they are announcing the beta release of their enterprise API management solution called Atmos.phe.re.
SOA has taken their enterprise API management solution, and bundled it with many of the features we are growing accustomed to within open API ecosystems, and deployed as a new solution with a focus on community.
The new platform intends to bring together API owners and application developers into a community, providing a central place where an ecosystem can grow around each of your APIs, whether its a private or public initiative.
Atmosphere is taking the social aspects of popular, open API ecosystems, and are applying these concepts to the enterprise, providing not only a place where API owners and developers can come together, but it also invites business, marketing and creative folks to get involved--creating a truly collaborative, enterprise environment around any API initiative.
&ldquo;Enterprises now have a choice in how they provide APIs. They can use Atmosphere Cloud to manage their developer community, and process messages on-premise.&rdquo; said Alistair Farquharson, Chief Technology Officer, SOA Software. &ldquo;This provides companies with complete control over their API traffic without requiring a large internal infrastructure to support their developer community.&rdquo;
This evolution of the API ecosystem makes sense, by providing the same set of social features available within both public and private communities as well as on-premise or cloud deployments it provides a very agile, business development environment for enterprises to take advantage of.
I haven&rsquo;t had a full test drive of SOA&rsquo;s new platform, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen it posseses all the characteristics I&rsquo;ve seen with other API management providers, but also brings to the table important social and community layers that I think are essential to the future of APIs.
Disclosure: &nbsp;I have consulted for SOA Software.

			<p>I came across this on the White House blog today, &ldquo;Request for Information on Public Access to Digital Data and Scientific Publications&rdquo;. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010, signed by President Obama earlier this year, calls upon OSTP to coordinate with agencies to develop policies that assure widespread public access to and long-term stewardship of the results of federally funded unclassified research. Towards that goal, OSTP last week released two Requests for Information (RFI) soliciting public input on long term preservation of and public access to the results of federally funded research, including digital data and peer-reviewed scholarly publications. The White House is now seeking additional insight from "non-Federal stakeholders, including the public, universities, nonprofit and for-profit publishers, libraries, federally funded and non-federally funded research scientists, and other organizations and institutions with an interest in long- term stewardship and improved public access to the results of federally funded research". Specifically the Working Group seeks further public comment on the questions listed below: What specific Federal policies would encourage public access to and the preservation of broadly valuable digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research, to grow the U.S. economy and improve the productivity of the American scientific enterprise? What specific steps can be taken to protect the intellectual property interests of publishers, scientists, Federal agencies, and other stakeholders, with respect to any existing or proposed policies for encouraging public access to and preservation of digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research? How could Federal agencies take into account inherent differences between scientific disciplines and different types of digital data when developing policies on the management of data? How could agency policies consider differences in the relative costs and benefits of long-term stewardship and dissemination of different types of data resulting from federally funded research? How can stakeholders (e.g., research communities, universities, research institutions, libraries, scientific publishers) best contribute to the implementation of data management plans?

			<p><em>03 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>
I wrote a piece yesterday on the FCC Open Commission recent proposal to require that television stations make their &ldquo;public inspection file&rdquo; available online called, &ldquo;Opening Up Information is Not Enough, Its Needs to be Accessible&rdquo;.
Since writing I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how APIs can become a self-service tool in government regulation.  Here are my rough thoughts on the subject, completely un-polished.
When a government agency mandates that an industry provide some information, along with that request should come with a mandate on a standard for the data format and making it accessible via an API. &nbsp;Of course this could come with some sort of security layer, so not everything is immediately open, but the more open the better.
Along with the regulatory mandate the requesting agency could have some sort of aggregate tool for pull the requested data from each entities API, making available internally and externally as needed for other agencies, researchers or the general public.
This type of self-service, API driven, regulatory framework could force businesses and organizations within an industry to comply with necessary information requirements, reduce the overhead for the governing body to collect and organize the data, while also opening up the data, to allow the public and other industry groups to police and make sure companies are complying.
Seems like it could make the overall process around industry regulation more efficient, while putting the responsibility for policing on the public and other public interest groups, reducing the need for government enforcement that can often be bought.

     According to PCMag.com, Verizon will publish an API that could allow consumers to "turbocharge" the network bandwidth on their smartphone, for a small fee.


     Developers could give users the option to pay for the extra bandwidth using a separate micro-transaction API, that Verizon Wireless is developing and hopes to have in place by the end of 2012.


     I understand that wireless networks are often congested. But isn’t allowing someone to pay money and circumvent that congestion, creating two separate Internets? A faster one for those that can afford it and a slower one for those that cannot?


     Would certain companies be able to offer users “turbocharge credits” when using their apps? So the Internet was faster, only when using the apps that could afford to buy its users attention.


     I am pleased to see Verizon Wireless working on network optimization tools, but is this where we need to monetize the network? Seems like you could make the Internet fast for everyone and charge for other premium services.  You know, really innovate.

			<p>
     


     Tru.ly just launched an age verification API that authenticates the age of an online user based by cross-referencing user-submitted personal information with data points from Tru.ly verification partners.


     Verification is done by matching user-submitted information with that in a national database of government and public data. In order to become verified, specific pieces of information must match. Tru.ly also uses a proprietary technology to flag users who may be trying to game the system.


     Using Tru.ly, websites with restricted content such as movies, alcohol and video games can programmatically verify its user’s ages, going beyond using just asking for a birth date.


     The API was developed to confirm an age while also promoting the guidelines set forth in the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), specifically section 1302-9, which defines verifiable parental consent as any reasonable effort, so as to ensure that the parent is aware of the website’s personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices.

			<p><em>02 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>The FCC Open Commission recently proposed to require that television stations make their “public inspection file” available online. The public inspection file is a traditional hallmark of broadcast regulation--a collection of documents that all radio and television stations must maintain and make publicly accessible. But as the Technology Liberation Front points out, “availability is not accessibility”, stating: "If the FCC follows its usual practice of having filers submit PDFs (many of which are often scanned from printed documents), this data may be nearly useless to the small number of researchers who would really benefit from having a large set of public inspection files available online." This is a common misconception among government agencies, that just publishing a PDF to a web is making the information “accessible”. Sure anyone can download this information, but it makes extracting meaning and value across many television stations so much work, pretty much nobody will do it. Researchers need this type of true access to compare data across stations, and identify larger trends and patterns that exist. This approach to information disclosure is does not meet the transparency guidelines set by the Obama Administration to implement Open Government by requiring agencies to: "publish information online in an open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used web search applications. An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information." Transparency offers an alternative to regulation that goes all the way back to President Clinton’s Executive Order 12866 (1993) which states "Each agency shall identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation, including … providing information upon which choices can be made by the public." Federal agencies requiring business to collect and make information to the public, without also requiring that they submit it in a machine-readable format, creates more bureaucratic, useless government. There needs to be more education of officials...[<a href="/2011/11/02/opening-up-information-is-not-enough-its-needs-to-be-accessible/">Read More</a>]</p>

     I’m spending some time getting to know the Topsy Labs API today. Topsy Labs offers access to its proprietary metrics, social content, and influence data via a RESTful API. As I was reviewing, their API access and rates limit page caught my eye.


     Here is their intro paragraph:


     We provide limited, free API access so that you can quickly and easily test the service and confirm the value it will provide to your business. We have three different tiers to match your implementation.


     What is interesting, is they not only provide a freemium level they have one better, a free and open tier, provider two introductory API access levels:


     
          No API Key - 3,000 queries/day – API calls that do not carry an API key will be limited to 3,000 queries/day.
     
     
          Free API Key - 7,000 queries/day – API calls that carry an API key will increase their limit to 7,000 queries/day.
     


     Then they provide a quick link: Register to get started


     What an inviting, frictionless way to getting started with an API. For those wanting more, they also provide information about obtaining a commercial API key:


     Once you confirm the value of our API, you can get a commercial license, giving you more volume to accommodate your business needs, exposes other valuable API calls, provides you with technical support, and ensures you are guaranteed specific service level parameters.


     The Topsy Labs approach provides an interesting model for some API owners to provide limited and free API access to their APIs, enabling developers to quickly and easily test the service and confirm the value before integrating.

			<p><em>01 Nov 2011</em></p>
			<p>I try to pay attention to how APIs are transforming as many industries as I can. I usually carve out at least an hour each day, to evalute a specific industry, the APIs in it, trying to understand what each API delivers and how the industry works, while also identifying where the opportunities lie. Right now I am looking at two areas or industries of APIs: Cloud Storage APIs Image and Photo APIs Even though I want to be familiar with both these areas, and will write stories on everything I find, my primary goal is to provide the Mimeo development team with as much information, about the best document and photo storage APIs available for integrating into our systems. There are 46 storage APIs and 120 photo APIs in the ProgrammableWeb directory. I went through all of the APIs and pulled out the APIs that were RESTful, had potential for print integration and were popular or were a stable, quality service. I found 19 storage APIs and 12 photo APIs I felt were a fit. After looking at 166 APIs and pulling out 31 APIs that offered value, you walk away with a pretty good sense of what makes a good API deployment. Anyone who is launching an API should spend time looking at at least 50 other APIs before building their own. API areas should simple, straight the point and employ the essential API building blocks. I’d say the biggest problem with each API is: What the hell does this API do? Every API should put a really simple explanation of what it does in 150 words or less. Pretend you just have one tweet to use. What value does your API deliver? Make it count! There are so many other things I consider when evaluating an API, these are a few of my immediate concerns while trying to quickly assess a lot of APIs.

     Twilio just made their first move into Europe by offering Twilio Voice service in the United Kingdom.


     The Twilio Voice API is now available in the UK, allowing developers to launch local phone numbers in the country.  Along with the release Twilio has announced the opening of their first international office based in East London.


     The UK launch is the first to go live of five countries currently in Beta including France, Poland, Austria, Denmark and Portugal with several more countries on the way.


     Twilio's APIs have proven a favorite of developers, and fast becoming an essential cloud computing service for applications.


     The move into Europe will only grow their developer base and the number of applications using the cloud telephony API. Something that traditional telcos should take notice of.

			<p><em>26 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>Last week Mashery rolled out a new on-premise version of their API management proxy. &nbsp;A solution meant to address a common concern of IT and API owners, that when using Mashery, all of their data and resources run through the Mashery proxy in the cloud. &nbsp;This concern can be a show stopper for many companies.
Until this last week, Mashery had four API management solutions that all ran in the cloud.

Now Mashery has separated the proxy portion of their traffic manager into two offerings, one for the cloud and one for on-premise.

Mashery has bundled the new Mashery Cloud and Mashery Local with their existing API Traffic, API Analytics &amp; Reporting and API Portal and are calling it, the Mashery API control center.  Using the API control center you now have the flexibility to deploy on-premise or in the cloud as needed.

Of course the full benefits of the Mashery API Distribution Network which includes scalability, redundancy, PCI compliance, access to global partner network and SLA&rsquo;s are only available for APIs deployed using Mashery Cloud.
Even though the&nbsp;Mashery API Control Center is meant to provide flexibility of deployment for API owners, the move is clearly a direct shot at their primary competitor Apigee, who have had an on-premise solution for some time, but Mashery claims their control center provides much more flexibility than "their competitors".

			<p>I have done a lot of research lately on the API service provider landscape. My goal is to understand who provides API delivery and management services, what they offer and help API owners understand the differences. I wrote a roundup of 11 of the API service providers on ProgrammableWeb last week. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of all the providers, but of course a new one came out of the woodwork. It wasn't a new API service provider like Mashape or Apiary.io, it is a veteran player in the space, Vordel. Vordel has been around for almost 10 years and I would consider them part of the old guard of service oriented architecture (SOA) and web services providers, that existed before web APIs were cool. Vordel provides a range of products we recognize with enterprise API deployments including API Gateways, XML firewalls and accelerators. Vordel specializes in the legacy system connectors that are needed to bring existing enterprise systems into the new web API game. The Vordel API Gateway compares to what I've seen from Layer7 and SOA Software, with the following key features: Protocol translation for REST and SOAP Versioning and lifecycle management Caching of frequently used calls Monitor, log and audit usage Secure API from threats Service level agreements (SLA) Vordel has an impressive client list including the FBI, Coast Guard and Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, and delivers some progressive integrations, like a deployment of their API gateway for Blackhawk Network, which extends REST services to their business partners like iTunes and Facebook. I see all the hardened enterprise services I've seen with existing providers, I think why they may have missed my radar is they lack the open API building blocks like developer portals, app showcases, forums and the self-service partner systems I tend to track on.

			<p>One of the ways I develop content for this site is by talking through my day to day experiences as an API Evangelist. I feel that talking through what I’m learning in real-time, is the best way to make it stick, while also sharing with the public. There is a lot of value that comes out of my daily learning, and it would be wrong to not share this. I had someone approach me on LinkedIn today and ask: I'm trying to convince my colleagues and managers on the importance of having internal API, not just as a prologue to public API, but also as a way to have cleaner, better-understood interfaces internally for our developers. Do you have any thoughts or tips on the subject? Internal evangelism is a big part of my role, and I know its something that other API advocates face as they are trying to sell the concept of APIs to decision makers within their company. Testing the water with APIs internally is the best way to get started, and learn what goes into planning, deploying and managing an API. When trying to sell your bosses on APIs for internal use, I would start with: Decoupling - Deploying resources and your data within your company as individual RESTful resources decouple them, allowing them to consumed and managed independently. This kind of of decoupling of data and resources enable more agile scaling, migration and integration into a wide range of organizations and applications across your company. Consider how APIs have enabled Netflix to migrate from the data-center to the cloud, with unprecedented growth simultaneously, and also enabling them to grow globally. Product Management - Allocating your companies data and resources as independent RESTful APIs will simplify your product management allowing them to be defined, launched, deployed and even killed off independently of each other.

			<p>Data.gov for me is like being a kid in a candy store. My experience with data goes back to High School when I got my first programming job right out of Mr. Smiths computer class. I built Cobol database for use by school districts in the State of Oregon, jump-starting my career as a programmer. Ever since I&rsquo;ve had an obsession with data, and specifically with government data, and trying to make sense of how our government operates. I have been playing with various data-sets at Data.gov since they launched, but today I finally spent some time evaluating their approach to delivering the Data.gov ecosystem. It is a pretty robust approach to opening up our government, agency by agency. The Data.gov sites centers around data-sets available by agency, category and topics, with the ability to view as raw data, files &amp; documents, charts, maps, calendars, filtered views and interactive data-sets. Data is made available in a wide range of formats including .csv, .xls, .xml, .rdf, .kml and .shp files when each format applies. Data.gov is not just for developers, many of the data-sets are available in interactive formats, as well as a wide variety of applications, making the data accessible and usable by anyone. A couple examples of applications include product recalls, travel warnings and hospital compare. What really makes these apps valuable, is the data-sets are usually available alongside, so if you want to dive in deeper and use the data in other ways, you can. Since Data.gov is a the top level site for the open data initiative, there is an obvious need to break it down into some smaller communities. These communities include: Energy - Data, tools, apps, challenges, resources, blog, forums centered around energy data, meant to facilitate public discussion of and awareness on our Nation&rsquo;s energy activity. Health - Data, apps, blog and forum centered around health and health care, intended to help the public make better informed decisions about...[<a href="/2011/10/25/a-walk-through-data-gov-with-some-thoughts-on-whats-next/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>As the number of APIs grow, the number of ways in which API owners control and incentivize their developers ecosystems evolves. APIs are your business development 2.0 platform, and it is up to you to tailor your services to incentivize your developers as well as control API usage to meet your business goals. One emerging way to control API consumption to meet your business goals is through a balance between pricing and terms of service (TOS). By offering branding opportunities to developers that they can deploy alongside the content and resources they consume via your API, you can easily turn your developer community into an extension of your marketing department. Price breaks can be offered to developers who extend your brand, encouraging them to build a business around your API content and resources as long as it adds value to your brand. API consumers who opt not to take part in branding, can be charged more, adding value to your company purely as revenue opportunity. Branding and pricing controls are a growing way to ensure your API adds value to your company either as revenue or brand syndication, but another way some content and data API providers are finding success, is through a contribution incentive. Just like brand extension, API contribution gives developers an opportunity to participate deeper and receive price breaks, while also be encouraged to contribute content back to an API, enriching content and add valuable information back to your companies API. Writeable APIs can be made available allowing developers to contribute user reviews, comments, annotations or even correct and update content that originated from your company. Proper service and key management around your API, allows you to track which users contribute content back to your system. As a result of this participation you can offer further price breaks in the form of credits, or even end up paying customers for their content contributions.

Both events re-enforced for me the importance of both on-the-ground and online evangelism. Both are necessary for ensuring the success of open data and APIs. At both series of events, I encountered many people who had never heard of Twilio or Amazon Web Services -- two API providers that are leaders in their industries (as well as were sponsors at the events). Both Twilio and Amazon Web Services provide essential cloud resources that can be used by any company and developer, but without the proper awareness and education, these resources go unused. Both companies are active in sponsoring start-up weekends, hackathons, codeathons, meetups and the like, but Twilio does much better at having "boots on the ground" at these events. This presence is one of the things that has made Twilio a developer favorite and, in turn, spawned thousands of apps and many start-ups. But clearly they still have work to do to get their name "out there," particularly at events outside of Silicon Valley. But having someone on-the-ground isn't always enough. At the Startup Weekend EDU events, for example, there were several people present from the Department of Education and to their credit, they spent the entire time engaging and listening to business people, teachers and developers about what they...[<a href="/2011/10/24/bringing-awareness-to-data-gov-with-grassroots-evangelism/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>Last spring when I started writing for ProgrammableWeb, my first post was "Everything Should Be an API," Says FCC. The story was about the new FCC web site, that was built entirely on top of RESTful APIs using the Drupal platform. Since that post, I met the company behind the FCC website redesign, Seabourne Inc., which builds some pretty innovative solutions using Drupal, employing APIs in everything they do. As part of the FCC.gov website project, Seabourne Inc. built a module for Drupal that leverages the platform for content publishing, powered by APIs. I spoke with Mike Reich, the CEO of Seabourne Inc. about APIs, he is as passionate about APIs as I am, but has identified the best place to start when it comes to opening up the government, is with content APIs instead of just focusing on data APIs. He’s right. In the rush to open up government data, many of us overlook the huge archives and content generated on a daily basis by our government. Recently, many government agencies are adopting Drupal as a content management platform, and using Seaborne’s Content API for Drupal, any agency or organization can make content openly accessible via an API. Their Content APIs can instantly make content from an agencies website available for other agencies to access in a self-service way, reducing the resources needed for inter-departmental coordination. In addition to making external coordination more efficient, it can make rolling out separate web sites, applications and mobile apps much more cost efficient as well. Content APIs can also open content to the public allowing media, companies and even individuals to pull content and mash it up, evolve, derive meaning and stories from it that a government agency may not have time or even perspective to do. In my opinion this type of content access by the public truly reflects the next generation of democracy, allowing anyone to get involved in government, even demonstrating better ways to understand...[<a href="/2011/10/22/open-access-to-your-drupal-site-with-a-content-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>At a recent presentation at the Business of API conference in San Francisco, Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson argued that two of the ways APIs can be successful in courting new developers are by being self-service and by having a "freemium" option. Both of these features empower developers to start using an API right away, without entering a credit card, talking to customer service, sales or having to wait for budget approval. They can just sign-up, get a key and start hacking! This shouldn't just be a model for APIs targeting the public developers; it can work with the enterprise as well. This model would allow enterprise developers to get up and running using an API quickly, building their own working prototypes, and in turn, using this prototype to make a case for why a company should use an API -- all without talking to their boss or getting approval. Of course, an API can still have a traditional sales funnel, where developers can get support, pay for premium services, and engage to get appropriate SLAs. But by providing both a self-service and a freemium option, there is the potential to reach new customers -- customers that may not respond to a traditional enterprise software sales cycle. I strongly believe that both self-service and freemium have a place with all APIs. These help expose what is needed for developers to see the value an API delivers so they can prove this value to their company; then later, they can engage sales and business departments to strengthen and harden the relationship. This approach is gaining acceptance and can be seen across many of the successful APIs in the space, like Twilio Self-Service and freemium pricing are things that all the major API service providers (3Scale, Mashery and Apigee) endorse when they advise their customers during setup of their own APIs. APIs open entirely new channels, attract new customers, and encourage the development of new ways of doing...[<a href="/2011/10/20/selfservice-and-freemium-are-important-to-the-success-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>Someone asked me recently for some advice regarding what they should consider when constructing the URL and endpoints for their RESTful API.  I thought I’d share the advice I passed along. I don't intend this to be a comprehensive guide to building URLs for a true REST API, just some things to consider for the newbie API product manager who may not have a hardcore REST developer on their team. When planning your endpoints for a RESTful API, there are 3 things I tell people to consider: Domain - Put your API at a separate domain or sub-domain than your website.  It will make it easier to migrate and scale, and your IT team will thank you.  For example:  https://api.yourdomain.com Versioning - Make sure and consider the versioning of your API in your URL structure.  How you version will depend on the preferences of your dev team, the most common patterns I see are a v preceding the version number of your API or using year and month of the version.  How often you release may impact your decision.  For example: https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/ https://api.yourdomain.com/2011/11/ Resources - The next part of your URL should be the resource of what you are offering.  Make it self-describing of the resource you are offering through the endpoint.  Make it reflect what a developer is looking to consume when using your API.  For example: https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/article/ https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/user/ How you define your API resources is very important, its something you will have to live with forever.  Make your resource descriptions count, your developers will thank you. The other thing I strong urge is to offer SSL for your API from day one.  Its not a huge problem down the road, but any change will come with issues, and many of your developers will request and even require SSL in some cases, before they integrate with your API. That is all the general advice I have, how you describe your resources is up to...[<a href="/2011/10/18/considerations-when-planning-endpoints-for-your-restful-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     


     USA Today has announced that they now support the commercial access of articles, reviews and census data through their content APIs.


     Any developer can request a key, and start making calls for free, with initial calls being restricted at a default rate. But as applications prove successful they are now willing to increase usage caps on a case-by-case basis. USA Today doesn’t describe what its commercial pricing will be, but they state in their terms and conditions:


     If USAT decides to charge a fee for use of or access to the USAT APIs, such fees will be disclosed to you prior to USAT charging such fees to you.


     Every couple of months USA Today rolls out a new API or evolution in their business model, as they get more comfortable with their API. This latest move seems to seems to be centered around encouraging commercial of its census data, which the NY Times makes available for commercial use as well.


     Its interesting to watch these media giants evolve their business models using APIs to make themselves more competitive.

			<p><em>14 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     


     NASA just launched a new Data API around its online archive of NASA data sets, that they launched back in August. The data.nasa.gov API provides a RESTful interface, with responses in JSON for the NASA data archives.


     The new NASA Data API is part of the ongoing NASA Open Government Plan, providing access to data sets in a variety of categories including aeronautics, climate, earth science, engineering, institutional, life sciences, operations and space sciences.


     There is a wealth of data available at data.nasa.gov. The APIs make it easier to access this data, but they are just data APIs. There is a huge opportunity for someone to abstract more meaningful, focused APIs delivering just photos of the moon, weather or climate change related data.


     


     For example, a developer looking to get earth, moon and other planetary photographs, can find what they are looking for in the data.nasa.gov data sets, but they have to navigate the different categories and build the proper requests to get exactly what they are looking for. Some developers are willing to go through this trouble, while others are not, and will give up quickly.


     There is opportunity for someone to deploy a earth photo API, moon photo API and mars photo API for example. These APIs would provide quick access API interfaces around specific and meaningful collections. Developers could quickly build calls pulling the information they need, while non-developers could also syndicate and share using widgets and other embeddable tools.


     Its great to see government agencies not only making data available, but deploying APIs making the data easier to access. But there are more opportunities to derive more meaning, and identify new opportunities around these rich archives of data.

			<p>
     


     I'm getting ready for the X.Commerce Innovate Developer Conference 2011, at Moscone Center in San Francisco this week.


     X.Commerce is the merging of Paypal, eBay and Magento's developer ecosystems into a single developer community empowering the next generation of merchants who need to operate in the world of global, multi-channel commerce.


     The APIs that make up X.Commerce are:


     
          Paypal - Website Payment Pro, Express Checkout and Adaptive Payments are a a couple of Paypals Payment APIs that X.Commerce developers can take advantage of.
     
     
          eBay - The hardened suite of search, trading and buying APIs from the popular auction platform that was one of the early pioneers in the web API space.
     
     
          Magento - The API allows access to the Customer, Catalog and Order modules of any users Magento E-Commerce account.
     


     X.Commerce strives to bring together Marketplace, Payment, Mobile Products into a single developer ecosystem, with essential Account Management, Information and Reporting Products.


     Even though you still have to go out to each individual sites developer ecosystems, you can tell they are working to bring together the communities in a central next generation merchant portal.


     


     This is what I expect at the X.Commerce Innovate Developer Conference, an event bringing together all eBay, Paypal and Magento developers and learn about each other, as well as share resources between the communities.


     X.Commerce Innovate Developer Conference 2011 is October 12th, 13th and 14th 2011 and registration is still open for the event. I can get you $200 off the registration price, if you use the code: API200. Hope to see you there!

			<p>I was introduced to the API service provider Socrata last week. Socrata has a government data platform that exceeds anything I&rsquo;ve envisioned. In the past, I have said that every state should have an API.&nbsp;Socrata looks like that platform. Socrata says it best: &ldquo;Social Data Discovery Solution Promotes Civic Engagement, Improves Decision and Policy Making, and Achieves Government Transparency.&rdquo; Socrata defines "Social Data Discovery" as a solution for public and private institutions to transform raw data, contained in large departmental databases, and deploy using the latest web and API technologies. &nbsp;According to Socrata: &nbsp;&ldquo;Social Data Discovery promotes civic engagement, enabling an online community of journalists, policy makers, scientists/domain experts, and citizens to visualize data and engage in discussion with one another. Together, audiences with disparate viewpoints can analyze and discover insights from datasets, improving decision and policy making.&rdquo; They seems to get the political, technical and economic challenges faced when delivering government data solutions, and provide a very comprehensive solution for city, county, state and federal agencies to manage their data: Data-Set On-Boarding - A process, acknowledging the need to clean and transform data so its accessible by an external audience. Web APIs - Ability to deploy RESTful APIs with for data sets with a key for authentication. Datasets and Feeds - Availablity of datasets in common formats like CSV, TSV, XML, KML, and Atom. Mobile - The platform appears to deliver necessary resources for iPhone, Android, and Blackery mobile platforms. Management - Socrata appears to offer many of the essential API maangement services as other providers. Analytics - Provides the necessary reporting and analytics to make sense of how data is being consumed and distributed. The problem with trying to get data from government agencies, is often that you end up with PDF and MIcrosoft Excel reports, and not the quality data feeds and APIs developers need.

			<p><em>08 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>
     


     I had a great response to my Learning Management System (LMS) APIs round-up last week after Startup Weekend Seattle EDU. After posting I quickly updated with another LMS suggestion I got for Sakai. Then a couple days ago the PR director for Instructure introduced me to their LMS platform, Canvas.


     Canvas is a open-source LMS created by Instructure and released under the AGPLv3 license. Instructure also provides a cloud version, with all the features of the open source version of Canvas, but comes with hosting, mobile apps, services integration, and automated provisioning.


     


     The Canvas LMS includes a REST API, using OAuth for authentication, enforces SSL, with all API responses in JSON. The API is currently under development and many areas of the application are still unavailable via the external API, but there are still quite a few methods available for the LMS already, and more to come.


     The Canvas solution appears to have all the latest features of a modern software as a service platform. They provide an open-source version, as well as a hosted platform.  Its built with Ruby, on a PostGres database, and runs on the Amazon Cloud.  The API is simple, and they intend to expose all features of the core LMS via the API, with all documentation hosted at Github.


     When the API is complete, I’d definitely say that the Instructure Canvas and API is the most robust LMS solution I’ve come across so far. When they finish their API, and pull together a community around the API, they will definitely be a strong force in the LMS space.

Factual has launch a new application gallery to showcase the diverse number of applications built using data provided by Factual.
You can search for apps, browse by category, and filter by open source, paid or free apps. &nbsp;Looks like there are about 18 apps in the directory currently ranging from augmented reality to daily deals.
The Factual App Gallery isn&rsquo;t a particularly unique launch, we are seeing app showcases popup within many APIs, but it shows that Factual is gaining steam, and I think it shows the appetite for building apps around datasets is growing.

			<p><em>08 Oct 2011</em></p>
			<p>
I just added four new API to my API stack series.  I&rsquo;m considering breaking the API Stack series into a separate feed, they kind of clutter the main feed.  Anyways, the four new APIs are from 3Scale:

Service Management API
Account Management API
Analytics API
Billing API

These four APIs offer the essential building blocks to control, manage and monetize the distribution of data, content and services via a web API. &nbsp;3Scale has had their Service Management API for a while, but recently added the account, analytics and billing services, making a complete set of API management APIs.
3Scale already has two significant differentiors from other API managerment service providers:

Proxy-Less - 3Scale is different than the other service providers in that they don't proxy your APIs.  3Scale only uses a "connector" to integrate the services you want into your API. 
Self-Service - 3Scale is the only self-service API management service with a freemium model.  Well, except for&nbsp;Mashape, they do to, but are in beta currently. 

Adding a set of APIs, definitely sets 3Scale apart from the other API management service providers.  You can sign-up, connect 3Scale services to your API, without routing your API through a proxy, and seamlessly integrate 3Scale service, account and billing management into your existing systems, complete with analytics.

Using 3Scale you can operate for free up to 50K calls per day, and start paying after your API grows or once you are looking to monetize your API and begin billing users.
Since 3Scale has a freemium model, I can play around with a lot of different deployments, until I find the configuration I'm looking for.   I think I'll launch an API for API Evangelist using 3Scale.  See if I can integrate 3Scale service and user management into my existing CMS, and deploy some API analytics.  I don't have anything at the moment I'd feel good about billing for, but maybe some day.
