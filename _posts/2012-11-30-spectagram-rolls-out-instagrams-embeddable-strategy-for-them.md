There was a great post last week on [ProgrammableWeb][2] from Curtis C. Chen ([@sparCKL][3]), on how a company called [Spectagram has launched a new JavaScript library built on top of][4] [Instagram][5].

[Spectagram][1] uses JQuery to provide a basic set of embeddable tools for Instagram allowing users to embed widgets showing latest photos, popular photos, and photos by tag.

Instagram has been notoriously focused on their core product, which leaves a lot of areas open to its developer community. Even the [first version of the Instagram][6] API was created by a passionate developer.

It is interesting to see such a sophisticated Javascript library developed by a developer, essentially rolling out something [Instagram][5] should be doing themselves, but obviously haven’t prioritized. Something I’m sure many API owners would love to have happen in their communities.

For more information you can visit [Spectagram][1] for more deails, and get at full documentation at their [Github repository][7].
