[bit.ly][1] is a popular URL shortening service that offers an API as part of its core software-as-a-service.

In January 2009 it held a successful API contest and is looking to do it again with a new [bit.ly API contest][2].

The prizes offered::

  * 1st prize - Makerbot Thing-O-Matic 3D Printer
  * 2nd prize - 1TB USB hard drive enclosed in a vintage nintendo game (Zelda, Metroid, etc)
  * 3rd prize - Set of BuckyBalls magnetic building spheres
[bit.ly][1] encourages developer to be creative and come up with unexpected uses, but it also plants a few ideas that the company woul'd like to see developers work on.

There are a lot of developers that may know about your API, but not actively involved. Your developers may need a little bit of motivation to get them working.

An API contest is a great way to light the fire under your development community, stimulate innovative uses of your API, and generate some buzz around your API community.
