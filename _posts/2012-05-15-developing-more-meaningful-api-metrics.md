API metrics are an essential, but what should we measure? There are two metrics that seems to dominate discussions about success of the API industry:

  * Number of New API Registration
  * Number of Daily and Monthly API Calls

Every API I’ve consulted with, use the same two metrics, if they have any at all. The tech blogosphere (driven by [API service providers][1]) have created a so call [billionaires club][2], showcasing APIs that have over a billion API calls within a day or month.

Investors are even using the number of API calls as a[ metric to consider the valuation of a company][3], and seen as a good indicator of the demand for a company’s services.

I agree that new registrations and number of API calls are a start, but we should be able to identify many other metrics to truly measure the activity and success of an API and the sentiment of it's API developer community.
