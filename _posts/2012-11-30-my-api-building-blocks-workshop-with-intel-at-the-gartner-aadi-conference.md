{% include JB/setup %}<p>I conducted two workshops this week in partnership with Intel at the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas.Working from my Building Blocks of a Successful API material, I put together a 30 minute workshop that I conducted at 12 and 6PM on Tuesday.My workshop started with the history of APIs, then walked through API building blocks in 3 areas: API Design  API Development  API Evangelist Then I stepped back and emphasized that APIs are all about research &amp; development and business development for your company.After stepping back, I looked into whats next with APIs with API aggregators like Singly, API automation platforms like IFTT and new API programming libraries like Webshell.The goal of my talk was to plant a few seeds in attendee’s mind: APIs Are More Than Tech  APIs Require a Business Approach  Politics Can Be Biggest Killer of APIs  Focus Delivering Value You can view the slide deck below for the workshop.</p>
