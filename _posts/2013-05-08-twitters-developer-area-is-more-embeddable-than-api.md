Does anyone else notice the evolution of the [Twitter developer area][1]? The site has taken a page from the LinkedIn playbook and become more about embeddable buttons, badges and widgets than about APIs.

Granted, you can click on documentation and get at the REST API v 1.1.  I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing.  I'm a big supporter of embeddable strategies for API providers. I think that evolution is very telling of Twitter's API strategy and what type of "developer" they want to support with the API.

Whether or not you agree with Twitter's overall API strategy, there is a lot to learn from their approach to API driven embeddable tools.  I will produce more pieces aobut their approach to cards, timelines, buttons and other embeddable tools.
