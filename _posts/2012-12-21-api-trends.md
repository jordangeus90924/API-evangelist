{% include JB/setup %}<p>In addition to helping people understand the history of APIs, Im looking to help people grasp what the future holds, when it comes to APIs. So, while tracking on the API industry, Im always on the lookout for patterns of API usage that can help me understand what might be next for the web API movement.  Based upon what Im seeing across the space I launched a new trends section to API Evangelist, where Im gathering news, analysis and company data in seven separate areas: Aggregation   Automation   Backend as a Service (BaaS)   Interoperability   Real-Time   Scripting Platforms   Voice   These areas reflect the patterns Im seeing, and while some API owners or API service providers may fall into one or many of these areas, Ive broken them down into, what I feel are meaningful groups that will help me explain the future of APIs to the masses. With a goal of demonstrating the value, power and importance of APIs.If you feel there are other trends Im missing, patterns Im not seeing or companies that are doing cool stuff in these areas, please let me know.</p>
