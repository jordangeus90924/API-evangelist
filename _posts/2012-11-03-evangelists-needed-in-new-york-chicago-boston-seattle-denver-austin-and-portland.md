{% include JB/setup %}<p>I call it being an evangelist, but it has other names, such as advocate or ambassador.Someone who is good at evangelism, in my opinion, starts with a love of hacking but is also having a love of helping others learn and understand technology.I can’t help being an evangelist, it’s just part of my personality.These days, I get enough requests for evangelists, so I decided to start finding passionate hackers within specific communities to help fill requests.Some requests for evangelists are full time positions, some part time, while others involve just going to meetups and hackathons in evenings and on weekends as needed.</p>
