{% include JB/setup %}<p>YouTube has decided to cease support for Youtube API QA via dedicated Google Group, and exclusively use Stack Overflow for developer QA support.Every developer knows that Stack Overflow is where you go to get the best answers for your programming issues, and API providers are taking notice too.Stack Overflow has always been something I recommend paying attention to for any API evangelist, but more API providers are considering it be the place where all API developer QA should exist.Facebook, Foursquare, and Salesforce have all moved their API developer QA to Stack Overflow.These API providers are still maintaining other API support building blocks like bug ticket systems, email and Twitter accounts, but when it comes to public developer forums they feel that Stack Overflow is enough.</p>
