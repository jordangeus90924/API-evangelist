I am going through the [Foursquare API][1], and found their section about how to get an increase in the number of calls you can make against the Foursquare API interesting:

_If your application runs into any of our rate limits and you think you could use more, write us at api@foursquare.com. We'llneed your OAuth consumer id, an explanation about why you need an increased cap, and information about the following_ 

  * _**Usage**: A description of the endpoints you're calling and how you're using the data retrieved. We use this to make sure you're abiding by our [Platform Policies][2] and [Terms of Service][3]. Sample requests are generally helpful._
  * _**Attribution**: Screenshots of your application so we can confirm you're [attributing][4] foursquare correctly._
  * _**Caching**: Cache venue details where appropriate to avoid making spurious requests to our servers. See theRetention section of our [Platform Policies][2] for more details._

I like the idea of rewarding developers with the ability to make more calls against your API, when they adhere to your terms of service and benefit your operations.
