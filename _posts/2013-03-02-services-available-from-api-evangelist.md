I've had a lot of questions lately about how I make money, and how companies can either support what I do, and / or take advantage of services I offer. So I wanted to take some time to outline the services I offer to support the space, and make ends meet--while also keeping things moving forward in a healthy and positive way.  

Here are a few of the common areas I help my clients across multiple industries.  Let me know if they are of interest to you.

##  Adhoc

  * **Hang Out** (15 minutes free then $40 every 15 minute increment) - Google Hangouts are a great way to interact.  Let's talk.  The first 15 minutes are always free, then let's dive deeper into your goals, the industry and anything API related you want to know.
  * **API Review **(1250.00) - Want your API reviewed by API Evangelist?  Payment ensures your API will be reviewed, but not guarateed to be positive. :)
