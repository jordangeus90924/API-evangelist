{% include JB/setup %}<p>In the last two years Ive seen the emergence ofÂ  cloud platforms that focus on helping data administrators, owners and stewards, generate APIs from their data sources.The new cloud services like EmergentOne will mount a MySQL database, spider the tables, and generate a web API for you, while providing you the basic tools you will need to manage access and consumption of that API.In the same spirit of helping data owners generate APIs, Id like to see the same types of tools, but designed for books and their authors or publishers.When I create a book and generate the ePub version, I would like to be able to upload it to a cloud platform, where the service would spider the ePub file and help generate a simple, but meaningful API for the book allowing developers to search, annotate and interact with the books content via web, mobile or tablet applications.My thoughts are still in the idea stage, I have done very little research on what is out there.</p>
