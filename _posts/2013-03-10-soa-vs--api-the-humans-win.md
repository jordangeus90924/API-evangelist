{% include JB/setup %}<p>As the API movement marches forward, it continues to grind against the enterprise and its legacy of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), which increases the frequency at which people ask me, What is the difference between API and SOA?This is not a technical explanation of the differences, but a philosophical one that many will argue does not apply, but in my opinion is the dark matter around the technological and business approach of SOA, that makes API work.Many say that a web API is just one component in an SOA toolbox.This is true.Using HTTP for an API is not that novel in itself.</p>
