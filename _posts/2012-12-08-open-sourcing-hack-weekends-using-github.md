{% include JB/setup %}<p>Iâ€™ve been maintaining a calendar of hackathons for all of 2012.Originally it was just a section off of API Evangelist, but eventually the site needed to be its own project.Up until now its just been a blog and calendar of events I curate from Eventbrite, Twitter, Google, Eventful and event organizers.I spend about 8-12 hours a week curating the events and stories for blog posts, and with the increase in the number hackathons over 2012, so does the time I need to maintain.I was adding an API so other users can add to calendar or event guest post, then I decided I would like to also have databases of hackathon organizers, sponsors, vendors, venues and other key building blocks of hackathons.</p>
