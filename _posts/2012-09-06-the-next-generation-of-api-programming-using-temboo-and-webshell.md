{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m exploring the future of web APIs, and have come to what I feel is what of the most fascinating areas of evolution in the usage of web APIs. An approach that is very developer centric, which is something you dont always see in the current API service landscape.There are two companies working hard on developing new libraries for popular programming languages that abstract away much of the authentication and other complexities developers face when using APIs.Temboo and Webshell are two pioneers that are taking API development to a new level.Temboo is building libraries in Java, PHP, Python, or Ruby and Webshell is building libraries in JS, PHP, Ruby as well as providing a command line interface for programming against APIs.</p>
