{% include JB/setup %}<p>When planning an API, I always tell people to go look at as many of the top APIs as they can before crafting their own API strategy.Im always surprised how many API owners I talk to dont actually use other APIs.They can usually reference the main ones like Twitter and Facebook, or the usual rockstar Twilio--but very few can cite 10 or more APIs they like.Recently I spent some time looking through all of ProgrammableWebs APIs, and I made a list of the 30 APIs I like, and would reference when designing an API strategy.Since Im more about the Business of APIs and not just the finer, technical points, these I feel are unique because of their business approach to delivering their API.</p>
