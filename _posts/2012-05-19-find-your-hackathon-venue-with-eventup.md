I am going through all my notes from organizing the [CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon][1] and trying to publish as many stories as I can, about how I planned and organized the hackathon.

One service that was a catalyst for the event occuring, was assistance from [EventUp][2]. EventUp is a service that assists event venue owners in finding people to rent their space, and in turn can help you find the ideal location for your hackathon. 

Tony Adam ([@tonyadam][3]) the owner of EventUp emailed me one day after I had submitted a request via eventup.com for more information on venues for my Hackathon in the Los Angeles area. He offered to help make sure I found the right location.

After a couple days he helped me secure [CoLoft][4] which was the best location for the hackathon imaginable. It was accessible, had great layout with tables, good wifi and the staff was extremely helpful.

[EventUp][2] isn’t in all markets yet, but if you’re planning a hackathon I recommend talking with Tony at Eventup, and seeing if they have the right location for your event.
