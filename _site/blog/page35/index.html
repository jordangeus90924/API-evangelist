        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/07/12/a-universal-me-api/">A Universal Me API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-me.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am pretty demanding today, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/11/i-wish-all-apis-had-sandbox-environment-by-default/">I just asked for sandbox environments to be default for all APIs</a>, and now I'd like to see a universal /me API. I am profiling AngelList API, <a href="http://theapistack.com/">as part of my API Stack work</a>, and while AngelList does not have it broke out as its own endpoint on the menu (it is just buried in the oAuth section), I thought it was worth breaking out all by itself.</p>
<p>At AngeList, when I hit the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">api.angel.co/1/me</span> endpoint, it gives me back everything <a href="https://angel.co/kinlane">about me on AngelList</a>. To make it work, I have to pass along a valid oAuth token, which I generated from my AngelList account, which is how the API knows who I am. As I was playing with this API, and breaking out as its own Swagger file, as part of my AngelList API profiling, I can't help but want this feature everywhere.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be given <span style="text-decoration: underline;">oAuth controls for ANY account online</span>, whether it was a tech company like Twitter, or a government agency like the US Census Bureau. Using oAuth, you could generate an App (w/ token), and easily make a call to /me, and find out everything a company knows about you, and I mean <span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVERYTHING</span>. Using oAuth you could easily open up this access to anyone 3rd party provider you wanted to, for any period of time you desired.</p>
<p>/me, provides a very powerful endpoint to frame discussions about our digital self. As we continue to spread our lifebits across the Internetz, we are going to have to demand more /me endpoints for platforms, as well as oAuth control over the lifebit exhaust we generate--as a basic human right. I'll keep building on my own definition of what /me endpoints should be available, and who knows maybe someday a universal /me API will be a default approach for any online domain.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-sandbox.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://angel.co/api">I am working through every endpoint of the AngelList API</a>, making sure I make as many successful calls as I can, as I work to generate Swagger definitions for the API, using Charles Proxy. To support this effort I setup each endpoint in Postman, and populate enough detail about an API to make a successful call--which I record through Charles, and then import to generate a semi-complete Swagger spec.</p>
<p>Some of the API endpoints requires adding and deleting of information. For example I will add a comment to my profile, then update in, and remove it, all in a series of API calls. Most of the time I can accomplish this without doing much damage to my live profile, but sometimes it requires sending messages to people, initiating processes that trigger other system aspects that I may not be able to undo.</p>
<p>As I'm playing with the AngelList Reservations API, which&nbsp;"are non-binding commitments to invest in a startup's current fundraising round", I can't help but think how nice a sandbox environment would be, as well as some dummy data to help me in my API journey. Some APIs I play with provide a sandbox environment, but I'd say it is not a common enough occurrence.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://getsandbox.com/">I'm seeing service emerge to cater to this need, as with Sandbox</a>, which is a service layer of the API lifecycle I think will only grow in coming months. I can see the need to create simple sandbox for any APIs as you are kicking tires, but I can also see the need for sophisticated simulation environments built on top of common APIs, allowing some apps to test out more advanced, and specialized scenarios.</p>
<p>If you need an example of this, <a href="https://www.carvoyant.com/">take a look at what Carvoyant is up to in the connected car realm</a>. While sandboxes, and simulations may not be as critical as in the world of cars, I think be critical for developers to build the next generation of web, mobile and IoT apps, and may not be something that every API provider can deliver on their own.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-highway.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/09/the-new-aws-api-gateway-anyone-who-does-not-do-this-will-be-fired-thank-you-have-a-nice-day--jeff-bezos/">I shared my view on the AWS API Gateway yesterday</a>. I'm all about the AWS kool-aid (oh yeah!), but overall I was left underwhelmed. I feel the release of the API solutions represents a pretty significant milestone along the API highway, but overall I think we should be further on down the road.</p>
<p>There is much to celebrate about what AWS is up to. It acknowledges the need to deploy APIs from the common resources we have move into the cloud, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/">and provides us some pretty forward thinking ways of crafting&nbsp;resource-based API that uses Hypertext Application Language (HAL)</a>. #WINNING</p>
<p><span>I'm sure AWS chose their wording very carefully when they named the project, but where the AWS API solution falls short for me, is with the concept of a gateway (that this moves us forward). I'm all behind what AWS is delivering for consumers, I just do not get behind paving over the lessons learned when migrating these legacy resources (holy shit--we have legacy resources in the cloud), and evolving them (along with our on-premise ones) towards a more sensible resource-based API-centric approach.</span></p>
<p>I just would like to see less gateway, and more HTTP, Hypermedia (Siren, Collections+JSON, JSON-LD), and API literacy along the way, something that could be incorporated into the road-map (wink, wink). While there are forwarding thinking aspects of the AWS API Gateway, I feel like it is more crafted to deliver what the enterprise will buy, and not necessarily what they need to put them on the meaningful API journey they need to be on--this feels more like a vendor journey to me.</p>
<p>As my friend Steve Klabnik says, it can be tough when your idols fail you--when we hold them up so high. Anyways, we are just getting started with AWS API Gateway, maybe there still is hope! ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/aws/aws-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>It has been almost 10 years since Amazon shifted the conversation on the Internetz, with their release of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/12/history-of-apis--amazon-s3/">Amazon S3</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/12/history-of-apis--amazon-ec2/">Amazon EC2&nbsp;</a>-- showing us that web APIs were more than just a hobby thing you do in this new social kids game, but that you could actually deploy any digital resource, including storage and compute, at a global scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-api-gateway-build-and-run-scalable-application-backends/">As I process the release information about AWS API Gateway today</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">I can hear the echoes of Jeff Bezos's now mythical mandate</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.</li>
<li>Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.</li>
<li>There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team&rsquo;s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what technology they use.</li>
<li>All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Closing with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t do this will be fired. &nbsp;Thank you; have a nice day!</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2015, Bezos is now making this mandate to you, in your own business operations. If you do not embrace APIs, as the next step in the evolution of the web, you will not make the cut. Goodbye! In the early 2000's, it was unacceptable to Bezos that his businesses didn't operate in an API -entric way. By 2006, Amazon was leading by example, showing all of us how Amazon had identified essential digital assets, optimze their usage internally using APIs, and then externalize via a publicly available API driven platform--something we now call cloud computing. In 2015, AWS is continuing to define their core competencies as API centric services, but this time opening their methodology to you, so that you will embark on the same API journey with your own business and organization.</p>
<p>As the AWS API Gateway press release information states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;create an API that acts as a &ldquo;front door&rdquo; for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any Web application&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The new gateway will take all that existing infrastructure you have accumulated (in the cloud), and it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;..handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Distilling down the lessons from the last five years, and selling it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;With the proliferation of mobile devices and the rise in the Internet of Things (IoT), it is increasingly common to make backend systems and data accessible to applications through APIs.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The new AWS API Gateway reflects all the modern approaches to API operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build, Deploy and Manage APIs</li>
<li>API Lifecycle Management</li>
<li>SDK Generation</li>
<li>API Operations Monitoring</li>
<li>AWS Authorization</li>
<li>API Keys for Third-Party Developers</li>
<li>Enhancing Legacy Services</li>
<li>Traffic Management</li>
<li>Data Transformation</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm on board!! I have been drinking the AWS Kool-Aid (oh yeah) since 2006. I was an early adopter, and honestly have built my career as the API Evangelist, on the work of Amazon, and what I have learned from their approach. To me, the release of the AWS API Gateway is a pretty significant milestones in the evolution of what is API. By 2006 the web had matured, and the Internet was being used for much more than just consumption, the API community was realizing that we could deploy vital digital resources using the Internet as a vehicle. Almost 10 years later, Amazon understands the opportunity in enabling you to do this for yourself--helping you either embark on, or speed up your API journey.</p>
<p>The best part is, this is all for the low, low price of:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"$3.50 per million API calls received, plus the cost of data transfer out, in gigabytes."</em></p>
<p>Allowing you to manage any of your digital assets as an API, using AWS API Gateway, is just the beginning of the expertise that Amazon is packaging up for all of us in the latest release. <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway is just the initial technical building block</a> they are making available. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-partner-program-for-saas/">AWS is also continuing the business conversation with their release of the&nbsp;AWS Partner Program for SaaS</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/">beating the politics of API drum of their Identity and Access Management (IAM), and security solutions, via the AWS platform</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the business opportunities that AWS has crafted, and shared with the world. I am also a big supporter of the standardization around IAM and security, that they are pushing (important). <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/07/time-to-remove-or-rotate-your-api-access-keys/">I just wrote about their API key practices, which are something the rest of the API space should emulate</a>. I think there are endless lessons that the API industry can be extracted from Amazon, and their "web of services". As with Twitter, I will keep holding up Amazon as a model for how we can do things right, but where I also think the healthy API focus begins to be degraded by big money, big companies, big systems, and a belief in scope and scale in a more centralized wall garden, rather than an open, truly distributed approach.</p>
<p>Like earlier offerings:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;Amazon API Gateway is a pay-as-you-go service that takes care of all of the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in securely and reliably running APIs at scale.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>You get all the benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalable</li>
<li>Efficient</li>
<li>Self-Service</li>
<li>Highly Usable</li>
<li>Reliable,</li>
<li>Secure</li>
<li>Performant</li>
<li>Cost-Effective</li>
</ul>
<p>You leave all the heavy lifting to Amazon. As I said, I'm a big Amazon Kool-Aid (tm) drinker--have been since the early days. While the release of AWS API Gateway is a huge milestone along the API journey for me, this is where the vision begins to fall short for me. Amazon, and Google at this point are starting to feel like just a newer version of historical approaches to delivering software, and take on a "VENDOR" vibe for me. I know SalesForce, Amazon, Google, and Twitter have all shifted the conversation, making a huge impact on how we deliver software, and architect our business systems, and will deliver on many of these comfort points, but at some point, when there is enough scale, and money on the table, everything eventually becomes what we all were seeking to disrupt (aka we have nothing nice).</p>
<p>I will keep using Amazon, and will explore deploying APIs with the new AWS API Gateway. I know Amazon put a lot of thought into the features of this service, as well as the naming, but the concept of a gateway under-delivers for me. I understand as a large organization you have a lot of legacy resources to move forward, and gateway solutions are very appealing. The problem is it abstracts away a lot of the heavy lifting that you should be doing, and need to be in tune with. When you rely on a single platform to deliver this for you, you aren't evolving -- you are stuck in a corporate circle jerk. Your infrastructure portfolio should be diverse, modular, and meaningful, reducing the bottlenecks, and points of failure. Our increased reliance on AWS isn't moving forward, its slowly being sucked back into what we just escaped.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I am on board with the AWS vision of the cloud (changed my life). I just do not think it is as decoupled, and distributed as it could be. Sure you can deliver on-premise, alongside your cloud infrastructure, but the spaghetti mess we proxy with the AWS API Gateway seems similar to what we gateway(ed) 5, 10, and 15 years ago. I enjoy the convenience a gateway brings to the table, and the ability to quickly define, deploy, manage, and monitor from our existing infrastructure, but I feel like some of the more important devops and microservice related lessons are being paved over in this vision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, I'm very excited about what the AWS API Gateway release means for the overall API industry. I also know that my vision of what should be, will not win out in the end, and that we are only capable of baby steps beyond what just was, especially when the powers that be, begin to tune into the conversation, and change things to be more in tune with their objectives. My mission is to just push back, and course correct where I can, until I'm ground up by the machine.</p>

<p>When API Evangelist began five years ago it was a single research into the business of APIs, which ultimately became a research project which I called API management. Over the last four years, I have spliced off other areas of research including the elements of my core research into API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">monetization</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal with each research project, is to evolve my understanding of each area of the API space by identifying the key companies and organizations involved, the open tooling being developed and put to work, and some of the common building blocks that make up each area. For each of my research projects, you can visit its Github repository to get regular updates, but I find many people seem to prefer browsing a single, portable paper of my research.</p>
<p>Each year I usually published a PDF version of each research project, something I have always intended to update regularly. However it seems, this is usually is an annual thing that I find time for in the summer. To helpl change this, I've evolved my own tooling for publishing for what I considers guides to my research areas, allowing me to more easily publish the information and content I regularly curate about the space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/paper/">finished v1 of my paper API</a>, which allows me to aggregate pages, organizations, building blocks, tools, and news that I curate, into field guides for my research. Using this new API, i intend to update each of my core research areas each month, getting more disciplined about distilling my research down to a single, coherent story.&nbsp;</p>

Now that I have my paper API stabilized, I will going through API deployment, and management, publishing a research guide for each. This process couldn't have come at a better time, as I'm carving out a couple of new research areas for API performance, testing, and monitoring, and I would like to be able to quickly publish guides for each of those areas as well.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-key-circle.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I got an email from <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> this morning, regarding a set of API keys I setup a while back, for a prototype I was building. The project was over a year ago, and the keys have not been evolved, and managed like I do with the rest of my regularly used AWS API keys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the email I received:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We noticed that your account contains root access keys that are more than 1 year old. As a security best practice, AWS recommends removing your root access keys entirely and using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instead. At a minimum we recommend rotating access keys regularly or removing access keys if they are no longer in use.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>To help you determine whether your access keys are safe to rotate or delete, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) now reports the time stamp&nbsp;when access keys for an IAM user or root account were last used, along with the region and the AWS service that was accessed. These details complement&nbsp;password last used&nbsp;data to provide a more thorough picture of when an IAM user or root account was last active.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>To view your root access keys and when they were last used, go to the&nbsp;security credentials page&nbsp;in the AWS Management Console. After you have located the old keys, rotate or delete them by using&nbsp;these steps. Note that you can also view the access keys of an IAM user in the&nbsp;IAM console&nbsp;or see a snapshot of all the access keys in your AWS account by downloading an&nbsp;IAM credential report.</em><br /><br /><em>To learn more, read&nbsp;Best Practices for Managing AWS Access Keys&nbsp;in the AWS documentation.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I like the fact that they notify me about keys like this, and they provide me with links to resources where I can management my API keys, see when they were last used, and also provide access to best practices around key management.</p>
<p>I am in a unique spot, because I sign up for hundreds of API keys, to test out the services I talk about, so management of my API keys gets pretty unwieldy. This is something I'm working on as part of my <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json work</a>, and something I'm hoping to share with others, as key management is both an API provider, and an API consumer problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">Along with other suggestions like the automation of account, app, and key management by providing an API</a>, I will track on approaches like what AWS is doing, and try to <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">standardize as common building blocks</a>, to help API providers (and consumers) better secure their platforms, through sensible API key management approaches.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.intuit.com/appconnect"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/itduzzit_formula.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">I wrote about Intuit's acquisition of API reciprocity provider&nbsp;itDuzzit last summer</a>, and <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/blog/2015/06/12/announcing-intuit-appconnect-beta">earlier this month they made the acquired technology available as a new platform extension</a>, they are calling&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.intuit.com/docs/0200_appconnect">Intuit AppConnect Beta</a>. I have been tracking on <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API reciprocity providers</a> for some time now, something you see API providers adopting at an increasing rate, as a standard building block for their API ecosystems.</p>
<p>API reciprocity tools and services like Intuit AppConnect, help connect APIs, in ways that even non-developers can take advantage of, making the overall API conversation, available to a much wider audience. Intuit describes their new offerings as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Intuit AppConnect is an iPaaS (integration Platform-as-a-Service) offering that runs wholly on Intuit&rsquo;s AWS stack. With Intuit AppConnect, 3rd-party developers have a faster, simpler way to create integrations between their apps and QuickBooks Online &ndash; without needing to cut or deploy code, and without writing directly to APIs that might change over time.</em></p>
<p>iPaaS is a huge growth area for the API industry. I choose to call this layer of the API world, API reciprocity, because if you don't make the approach about ALL parties involved, the platform, developer, and the end-user--it is just yet another IT effort. iPaaS is just the next step of ETL, where we move bits and bytes around online in the cloud as opposed to the corporate network. API reciprocity is doing this, but remembers those bits and bytes you are moving around, mean something to every human and business or organization involved.</p>
<p>As I stated in last summer's post about Intuit's acquisition, API reciprocity is increasingly important for API providers who are looking to reach a wider business audience, elevating an API platform from just a developer thing, to a business thing--something that is essential to Intuit's small business audience. API providers who don't have the resources that Intuit possess can use popular iPaaS / reciprocity providers like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, which is something I'm seeing become more common place--<a href="http://api.report/2015/07/06/weekly-apireport-for-july-6th-2015/">take a look at this last weeks APi.Report (search for API Reciprocity)</a>.</p>
<p>I'll keep an eye on the Intuit AppConnect program, and also look out for other large, and small API platforms who are doing similar things. As more tech savvy business users realize the potential of API reciprocity services like Zapier, IFTTT, and others, the importance of these integration tools and service will only increase for the average API provider, and consumer.</p>

<p>Building on what Orlando (<a href="https://twitter.com/orliesaurus">@orliesaurus</a>) brings up in his story on <a href="https://medium.com/@orliesaurus/the-missing-brick-in-the-api-industry-1163a9c25791">the missing brick in the API Industry</a>, we are missing a common place to discovery and share common API designs--<a href="http://theapistack.com">something I've been working hard on with my API Stack</a>. As I read <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/06/23/container-apps-now-available-in-the-azure-marketplace/">this piece from Microsoft Azure on&nbsp;Container Apps now available in the Azure Marketplace</a>, I'm reminded of how robust the app deployment, and management ecosystem has become with the containerization evolution, but when it comes to API deployment we are still way behind the times.</p>
<p>There are numerous containerized marketplaces of apps available out there today, what I am looking for is the same thing, but for common API patterns. After over 10 years of solid design, deployment, and management of web API patterns, we should have a wealth of API design patterns to choose from. I shouldn't have to launch my own user API, or image API, there should be the WordPress of APIs out there, ready for me to deploy.</p>
<p>These APIs should be available with common API patterns, well defined using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>, available in a variety of server side languages from PHP to Go. I should be able to search, and browse these APIs, and with a single click of a button deploy into my containerized architecture of choice, from Amazon to Google, and Microsoft to the Raspberry Pi in my living room--<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button">think Heroku deploy button</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">Ok, back to work on defining the common public APIs out there on my API Stack</a>, could someone please get to work on this containerized API marketplace? I have a number of standardized API definitions I can share to get you going, and happy to focus on crafting any new ones you need, derived from common patterns I'm finding across my API Stack work.</p>
<p>There is a reason we have the bespoke API design, and deployment way of life--everyone is lacking the marketplace of ready-to-go, containerized APis, that individuals, businesses, institutions, and government agencies will need for success in the API economy.</p>

<p><a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">I am working hard to generate detailed profiles, that include APIs.json indexes, and Swagger definitions, for each of the 1000 companies I have listed in the API Stack</a>. I have encouraged anyone to step up and help me profile these companies, join the conversation via the Github issues where the API stack is hosted, resulting in some really nice folks jumping in to hellp me tackle the hard work.</p>
<p>One of these brave souls who stepped up, and get their hands dirty is Bob Salita, who is also sharing his experience, via what he calls an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"API Police Report"</span>, derived from his experience onboarding with APIs. I thought his condensed thoughts reflect what I see everyday as I onboard with new APIs, and was worth sharing.</p>
<p><strong>He starts with a simple question: What do developers want?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To use your API. Duh! Don&rsquo;t get in their way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do we force a developer do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google for your website.</li>
<li>Sign up as a generic user (usually unstated).</li>
<li>Wait for email verification link.</li>
<li>Click on verification link.</li>
<li>Log into website.</li>
<li>Find link to developer site.</li>
<li>Find link to API documentation.</li>
<li>Register app (usually OAuth).</li>
<li>Figure out how to obtain API credentials.</li>
<li>Find link to endpoints.</li>
<li>Figure out how to use API credentials.</li>
<li>Play in playground.</li>
<li>Search for SDK in preferred language.</li>
<li>Cancel dinner date.</li>
<li>How can we improve onboarding?</li>
</ul>
<ol> </ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What you can do! Anticipate needs, minimize process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Big button showing &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;. No registration needed.</li>
<li>Transfer to Playground with temporary key installed.</li>
<li>Offer easy navigation to friendly API Docs, SDKs, permanent credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>The anti-patterns to onboarding</strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Secret onboarding. No Google hits.</li>
<li>No Developer or API link.</li>
<li>No Sign Up button. No Sign Up imperative.</li>
<li>No App registration link.</li>
<li>No Get Credentials link.</li>
<li>No Authorization procedure.</li>
<li>No authorization endpoints (shhh, secret).</li>
<li>No Rest API documentation link.</li>
<li>No Curl link.</li>
<li>No API playground</li>
<li>No safe sandbox (financial industry).</li>
<li>No SDK link. Too few languages choices.</li>
<li>Must interview with sales or support rep.</li>
<li>Must mail in API registration.</li>
<li>SSL certificate warnings. &ldquo;Get me out of here!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Inability to change locale, language or monetary unit.</li>
<li>USS (Ugly Site Syndrome). So 2005.</li>
<li>Unclear use case.</li>
<li>Uncompelling content.</li>
<li>Confusing website.</li>
<li>Confusing biz plan.</li>
<li>Too much unnecessary registration info requested.</li>
<li>Slow registration process, delayed email verification, snail-mail (s/b &lt; 10 seconds).</li>
<li>Missing page navigation.</li>
<li>IP blacklisting.</li>
<li>Short trial &ndash; 7/14 days. s/b 30 days.</li>
<li>Broken registration, broken authorization process, broken APIs.</li>
<li>Too much engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Are The Best Practices:</strong></p>
<ol> </ol> 
<ul>
<li>OAuth 2 support.</li>
<li>API Playground.</li>
<li>Safe sandbox (financial services).</li>
<li>Use mashery.com.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Sometimes you have to be a snob &ndash; for good reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limit registration size. Limit beta size.</li>
<li>Vet registrants for reasons of security, accountability (Bitcoin), company size, sales volume.</li>
<li>Refuse because of IP location.</li>
<li>Refuse because of free email account.</li>
<li>Be expensive.</li>
</ul>
<ol> </ol>
<p>I am just publishing his raw report as is, because I think it reflects what a tough job it is to profile these APIs, and the thoughts that go through your head as you do the work. This work is something API providers should be doing themselves! They should be going through their APIs, putting on their external developer hats, and try to think like a new developer might--experience the friction.</p>
<p>The process of trying to understand what an API does, how to get access, and the process of indexing the API operations using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and craft individual <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> definitions for each available APIs is a lot of work, but it represents the work, and thought you should be putting into your API--it is an important journey!</p>
<p>I will be referencing these "<em>API Police Reports"</em> in future stories, because Bob's honest thoughts, as he does this hard work, provide a wealth of detail that all API providers should be tuning into.</p>

<p><em>This is a guest post by&nbsp;Guillaume Laforge (<a href="https://twitter.com/glaforge">@glaforge</a>) of <a href="http://restlet.com">Restlet</a>. He did a very cool API deployment project over the holiday weekend, as was good enough to share the details of his project as a story. I've been trying to make time to do more of these simple how-to API deployment guides like this, so I'm always happy to guest post these when they help users understand that they can deploy APIs--no developer necessary.</em></p>
<p>For the 4th of July, to celebrate the United States&rsquo; Independence Day, <a href="http://restlet.com">Restlet</a> built a fun little website and API to list all the <a href="https://fireworks.apispark.net/v1/html/index.html">fireworks in your area</a>. You can see all the states where fireworks have been found, and lists of towns in those states where those fireworks were taking place. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s a Google Sheets form that you can fill in to submit fireworks in your area that were not mentioned.</p>
<p>This fireworks app is actually an API with an associated website served by APISpark, using a Google Sheets wrapper for storing the data and receiving form submissions, and a Github file store wrapper to deliver the HTML / CSS / JavaScript assets. In this blog post, I will explain how to make your own APIs with their associated web elements.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-1.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="471px;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it all started with this idea of listing all the fireworks. We also wanted to let people submit ones in their area, as it&rsquo;s difficult to find each and every possible event in the whole country. That&rsquo;s why we thought it&rsquo;d be important if we could use Google Sheets to store the data, as we can let people fill in the gaps in our listings thanks to a Google Form that automatically saves data in your spreadsheet. Thankfully, <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">APISpark</a> provides a <a href="http://restlet.com/technical-resources/apispark/tutorials/turn-spreadsheet-to-api">Google Sheets wrapper</a> which allows you to expose spreadsheets as a Web API.</p>
<p>Having data served through a Web API is nice, but you won&rsquo;t cURL it to find an event nearby! You might be a geek with cURL super powers, but I doubt, say, your neighbors are able to find fireworks nearby with a Web API. Thus, you want to be able to view everything through your web browser or mobile device. Which means we had to find a way to display the data from the API through some web pages. To do so, we used an APISpark&rsquo;s <a href="http://restlet.com/technical-resources/apispark/tutorials/github">Github file store</a> which serves the content of a Github repository as a Web API&hellip; but also as a mere website with its HTML / CSS / JavaScript, like on any website on the Web. For reference, here are my <a href="https://github.com/glaforge/fireworks-assets">own assets for the fireworks API</a>. In turn, this means that your Web API can serve the associated website that goes with that API for easier human consumption &mdash; no need for finding a host and setup a server for your website!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s replicate this little fireworks project together!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with creating a Google Sheets document and associating it the following form, which let anyone submit new fireworks, with details about the city, state, date and time:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-2.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="512px;" /></p>
<p>Your website visitors will be able to fill in a form like so:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-3.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="543px;" /></p>
<p>And your spreadsheet will be updated as new entries are flowing:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-4.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="267px;" /></p>
<p>The sole modification I&rsquo;ve done here is to rename the sheet to &ldquo;fireworks&rdquo;, but you can also do that later on when configuring the Google Sheets wrapper&hellip; speaking of which, it&rsquo;s time to create it and import that spreadsheet in APISpark!</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">created an account on APISpark</a> (if you haven&rsquo;t done so yet), login, then, from the dashboard, create an &ldquo;Entity Store&rdquo; and select a Google Sheets wrapper:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-5.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="545px;" /></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be asked to select a Google account (the one with which you&rsquo;ve created the spreadsheet), then select the spreadsheet document you&rsquo;ve created for that purpose.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that the import of the spreadsheet succeeded, and that some normalization has been done to the name of the properties of your entities, corresponding to the questions of the form (as the column names of the spreadsheet contained special characters like spaces of question marks).</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-6.png" alt="fireworks-6.png" width="624px;" height="391px;" /></p>
<p>As those property names will be appearing in the resulting Web API we&rsquo;re going to create next, I&rsquo;ve gone the extra step of going through each property to rename them to more succinct names (state, city, date, time):</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-7.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="496px;" /></p>
<p>Now is the time to deploy this first &ldquo;Cell&rdquo; so that it can be made available and imported into our future API (just click the &ldquo;Deploy&rdquo; button).</p>
<p>If you click on the little cog button in the top right hand corner, near the &ldquo;Deploy&rdquo; button, you can export a Web API from this data store directly, so that the API is pre-configured to import it:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-8.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="601px;" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve checked the &ldquo;Read-only API&rdquo; checkbox (as modifications are done only through the Google Sheets interface), and I&rsquo;ve selected &ldquo;No authentication required&rdquo; for the &ldquo;Default permissions&rdquo; as we don&rsquo;t need authentication here.</p>
<p>Your Web API is ready, and you can see the resource and representation for corresponding to our fireworks sheet:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-9.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The Web API is functional, if you deploy it, you&rsquo;ll be able to make calls to it with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie">httpie</a>:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-10.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="504px;" /></p>
<p>Alright, but we said earlier that mere mortals are not cURL warriors, are they? So let&rsquo;s make a light web frontend on top of that. We don&rsquo;t want the hassle of finding a host for our website, of dealing with the server, or anything of that sort. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going to let APISpark host the web assets too, thanks to a Github file store! The HTML / CSS / JavaScript / image assets can be served as part of the API.</p>
<p>Go back to the dashboard, and click the &ldquo;Create file store&rdquo; button to create a file store, selecting the Github flavor:</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; tab, you&rsquo;ll fill in your credentials to access Github, and add an &ldquo;Import&rdquo; pointing at your Github repository containing your web assets:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-12.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="279px;" /></p>
<p>When configured, you&rsquo;ll have to deploy your cell to make it usable. Then, heading back to your Web API cell, you&rsquo;ll be able to add a new import, in the &ldquo;Settings &gt; Imports&rdquo; section:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-13.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="332px;" /></p>
<p>Now the API will contain two imports: one for the Google Sheets wrapper, and this new one for the Github file store.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t detailed it yet, but what will your Github repository will be looking like? You&rsquo;ll have to create folders for the various categories of assets that you have. In my online fireworks demo, I had created an &ldquo;html&rdquo;, &ldquo;css&rdquo;, &ldquo;javascript&rdquo;, and &ldquo;images&rdquo; folders. For the sake of simplicity here, I&rsquo;ll just create an &ldquo;html&rdquo; folder, and put an &ldquo;index.html&rdquo; file that will contain the following HTML and JavaScript code:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/5d3a857b88897f621bf5.js"></script>
<p>This page will be served at <a href="https://fireworks.apispark.net/v1/html/index.html">https://fireworks.apispark.net/v1/html/index.html</a> by APISpark. I&rsquo;m using JQuery to call my API, and you will see this simple output in your web browser:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/fireworks-story/restlet-fireworks-14.png" alt="" width="624px;" height="199px;" /></p>
<p>Nothing really fancy, but &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.">Q.E.D.</a>&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what we had to demonstrate: a Web API delivering data off of a Google Sheets document, but also serving the web assets to offer a UI frontend to interact with that API. No need to host that website elsewhere on some server in the cloud, everything can be done and served through APISpark easily. Having setup Google Sheets for the data makes it easy for non-technical persons to contribute new content and data for your database of fireworks. APISpark then takes care of both exposing a reusable Web API, as well as serving a website to share your nice listing of fireworks to the world!</p>

<p>I'm working to profile as many of the top, publicly available APIs out there, <a href="http://theapistack.com/">as part of the API Stack</a>. While I've come to feel that no API definition will ever actually be complete, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/15/my-minimum-viable-definition-for-a-complete-swagger-api-definition/">I'm working to at least establish a healthy baseline for the APIs I am profiling</a>, while also automating as much of the process as I possibly can.</p>
<p>To help focus my work, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/23/the-over-30-apis-i-depend-on-to-run-api-evangelist/">I'm targeting 30 companies that I depend on to run API Evangelist</a>, and one of the first APIs I wanted to harden my process on was the AlchemyAPI. The API is fairly straightforward in design, and operation, so it made for an easy target--so far here is what I have:</p>

<p>My goal was to index the AlchemyAPI operations using an APIs.json file, while define each of the APIs using Swagger. I want each Swagger definition to be as complete as possible, so I can actually generate functional APIMATIC SDKs, and function Postman Collections--something I have achieved here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have everything I need from an AlchemyAPI profiling, for my needs. I have details about API operations like the pricing and terms of service, and I have each of the unique endpoints profiled at about &nbsp;what I'd consider to be 80% complete. All the APIs listed allow you to pass in a URL as the content source. For most of these APIs, there is also a version that allows you to pass in HTML or plain text--for now I am just profiling all of the APis which use the URL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help me complete this work, I am using my API questions tooling, which allow me automate what work needs to be done to each API, like ensuring there is a terms of service, parameters, data model, and security definition. <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/alchemyapi/apis.json">Using the APIs.json file</a>, I can ask these questions of <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">any of the almost 1000 companies listed on the API Stack</a>--it will help me tackle the work needed to get all the APIs in the stack profiled as complete as I possibly can.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a logo, description, and common URLs like website, blog, Twitter, and Github, I'm including links to APIs.json, SDKs.io profile, and Postman Collections. I haven't updated any of the SDKs.io profile, but the Postman Collection is current. I will make sure all of this is available in the Github issue I am using to coordinate work on the AlchemyAPI.</p>
<p>Each API could potentially be missing some parameters, and the definitions may still have some flaws (if you see any, feel free to fork and fix ;-). Shit, now I remembered I forgot to reference all the sub-models in some of the API data models. Oh well, will add to the list to be done, and get it tackled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also find a link to a crude Swagger editor available for each API, and a page to ask Swagger related or APIs.json related questions. All the Swagger related ones are answered, but I'm still working the configuration of the APIs.json ones, and the Swagger editor (work in progress)--this same functionality is available for each company, and APIs I have listed on the API Stack.</p>
<p>Ok, well anyways..on to the next microproject (tm). I have an overhaul on my API Design white paper almost complete, and then I think I will tackle the profiling of Angelist and the Crunchbase API--two APIs I depend on to run API Evangelist. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>P.S. One thing I also liked about the Alchemy API, is how easy it was to break the APIs down into the small possible units of value, and provide a single Swagger definition for each API. I think I will also provide a single Swagger specification for all of them, but for now I'll rely on the APIs.json index to link them together.</em></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/07/03/five-years-of-api-evangelist/">Five Years Of API Evangelist</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Jul 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-five-years-logo.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>In July of 2010, I started researching what would be the next step in my career. I was VP of Technology at WebEvents global, and was in charge of the technical side of running conferences for SAP and Google. I enjoyed the work I did, scaling the technology to support the events, using the Amazon Cloud and APIs, but I was not fully satisfied in the events industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I clearly remember spending my Fourth of July weekend researching some possible next steps. Building on my strengths at the time, I looked at what I could do in the cloud computing space. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/kinlane.com/cloud-computing/Home">My early research is still even online, forever preserved as a Google Site</a>. The last update to the research was mid half way through July, when after a couple weeks of careful evaluation and contemplating, I saw the core of cloud computing was really about APIs.</p>
<p>I had an epiphany -- APIs were central to the recent social and cloud evolutions in the Internet, and as I looked deeper, I saw that web APIs were also beginning to play a central role in the mobile evolution as well. As I continued my research in July of 2010 I also noticed that everyone was focused on the technical aspects of APIs, discussing, often arguing about the technical merits of REST, and very few people were talking about the business side of successful API efforts.</p>
<p>Through my early research in cloud computing, and ultimately APIs, I had found my focus -- the business of APIs. My partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) was also looking for her own direction, and we agreed that if she started <a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Hack Education</a>, I would help her run her server and other IT infrastructure, and if I started API Evangelist, she would help me learn to write, and craft better stories--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2010/10/09/why-a-tech-journalist-cares-about-your-api/">some of the early stories were actually written or edited by her</a>.</p>
<p>July 2010's research was all about finding my focus, and by August I purchased the domain apievangelist.com, where I would openly share my research, and by October I published my first story, which I think was appropriately titled, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2010/09/25/the-api-economy/">the API Economy</a>. The plan was to research the business of APIs, while sharing my research in real-time via the API Evangelist site. Five years later, I am still doing what I originally set out to do, I've just gotten more organized about how I conduct my research, evolved my storytelling voice, and have expanded the focus beyond just the business of APIs, to what I consider to be the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>I couldn't be more happy with the work I've been able to do over the last five years. Something that wouldn't happen without the support of my partners <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com">Restlet</a>, and <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a>--<strong>THANK YOU!!!</strong>! While I do have claustrophobic moments, where I freak out, questioning why the hell I do what I do, in 2015 I can see myself doing this for at least another five years. Who knows though, things could change, and go in a different way, at any point..but at the moment, I think API Evangelist will stick around.</p>
<p>From my current vantage point, the next five years will be focused more on the politics of APIs, continuing my work around the copyright of APIs, API patents, the importance of open API definitions, and advocacy around privacy, transparency, access, data portability, interoperability and security issues. I'll continue to rely on others to innovate around the tech of APIs, shining a light on the best practices, and work to understand how the business of APIs is evolving, as the API economy truly becomes a reality, but I feel the politics of APIs will be the biggest challenges we face in the next five years.</p>
<p>Thank you to all my readers, and people who support what I do. I really enjoy what I do, and from I can tell, there are a number of people, and companies who benefit from what I do, which keeps me going. I need as much help as I can, to make sure the API economy stays secure, accessible, transparent, and truly open for developers, in a way that includes end-users in the conversation, focusing on building healthy API driven platforms, that businesses, organizations, governments, and individuals can depend on.</p>

<p>I was doing one of my regular checkins with my friend Anne Wootton (<a href="https://twitter.com/annewootton">@annewootton</a>) of P<a href="https://www.popuparchive.com/">opup Archive</a> today, something we try to do regularly, to share stories about what they are up to in the world of audio and podcast API, and what I am seeing across the voice, audio, video, and wider API landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anne was walking me through their latest rollout&nbsp;<a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/">AudioSear.ch</a>, <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/">a&nbsp;full text search &amp; recommendation API for podcasts and radio</a>, that is API driven. One of the endpoints for the <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer">AudioSear.ch API</a> allows for searching of people who are involved with the podcasts and radio programs that they are indexing. As we talked, she articulated that in order to help people see the value the <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/developer">AudioSear.ch People API</a>, rather than just telling them about it, they were <a href="https://www.audiosear.ch/people/a">building micro applications, that demonstrated it</a>.</p>
<p>This may seem obvious too many, but I've made a career out of shining a light on the obvious, and with APIs being such an abstract concept, little ideas like this can go a long ways. In this era of microservices, the concept of micro, portable, simple, and focused goes a long way, and what AudioSear.ch is doing with their people API is something that other API providers should consider as well.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the little things like a demo micro application built on top of your API can be the thing that plants a seed in someones mind about what your API does--a seed that over time could grow into something much, much more. <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I already advocate for other code related building blocks like SDK, PDKs, and starter projects</a>--maybe I'll add micro apps as a building block and see if I can incite API providers to deploy more of them to support API operations.</p>

<p>I try to go through each of my areas of research as often as I can and update the content, as well as my understanding. Ideally I update the news each week, take a look at the organizations involved once a month, and evaluate the building blocks and tools each quarter. Unfortunately it doesn't always happen as planned, but as a one man operation, I think I do pretty well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just went through my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design research</a>, and adjusted my definition of what I felt needed be listed there. As I move API definitions to their own research area(s), I'm reconsidering what I want to keep an eye on when it comes to API design, and my current definition involves organizations who offer API design editors, either in the cloud or as download. They should allow you to add, edit, and manage the API details, then also provide the ability to import and export using common API definition format(s).</p>
<p>Currently I have nine organizations represented, as part of my API design research:</p>

<p>As I work to refine each of my research areas, it can be hard to draw the line where each projects starts, and ends. I had <a href="http://readme.io">Readme.io</a>, and <a href="http://wavemaker.com">Wavemaker</a> on this list, but I really felt they were more in the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a>, and <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a> realms, resulting in me drawing the line where I did.</p>
<p>Next I am looking to tackle the API design tooling, which I am looking to organize into groups, as there is kind of a mash-up of different things there now. Hopefully I can break it all into a more coherent breakdown of not just the open tooling, but also open content, and other resources that might help all of us all in our API design journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I have to say after updating the list of organizations on my API design research, is I am impressed how far the services, tooling, and overall API design mindset has come in just two short years. We have more than one editor, with a couple of the implementations being open source--I'd say this is pretty healthy progress. ;-)</p>

<p>I am going through each of my research projects, and tightening things down, now that I have them all driven through my new, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">master stack of APIs</a>. First up was <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/30/tightening-up-the-organizations-that-are-included-in-my-api-design-research/">the other day I spent time going through the organization I track on as part of my API design research</a>, and today mission was to refine the <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html">tooling section</a>.</p>
<p>Previously my tooling page was just an alphabetical list of tools, and I wanted to at least group things in a more meaningful way, reflecting how I break them down in my own monitoring system. So I reworked the publishing to allow me to group the tools by tags, resulting in the following list:</p>

API Blueprint, its parser, and most of its tools are completely open sourced so you don't have to worry about vendor lock-in.

<p>One area I am still working on, is cross linking areas of tooling, potentially with other research areas. For example <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> has its own evolving area, and <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/">Swagger</a> does as well. This is why I wanted to retool and break things down by tags, because some of these tags eventually become other projects, and when I break off a new area, I&nbsp; want to keep things connected.</p>
<p>Next I'll give the <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API design building blocks</a> page a little attention, but it was recently overhauled, so I think I am pretty good there. After that, I need to give my paper API a little love, which allows me to aggregate my design research into a white paper. Once I'm done with that I'll quickly go through some of my other core research like API deployment, management, discovery, and beyond.</p>

<p><a href="http://recode.net/2015/06/29/u-s-top-court-declines-to-hear-google-appeal-in-oracle-software-fight/">I just read on Re/Code, that the Supreme Court declined to hear Google's appeal on the Oracle v Google case</a>--prepare for the waves of stories from tech blogs, that this will suffocate the API economy. During the last response to the case by the US Solicitor General, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/28/regarding-the-solicitor-general-weighing-in-on-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case-are-you-really-surprised-they-do-not-get-apis-i-am-not/">I wrote about how I can't even argue the concept anymore</a>, and nothing has changed for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wanted to take the moment to remind everyone that this decision means nothing if we all share our API definitions, in open ways, using machine readable definitions like <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a> and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. The disturbing move by Oracle to bring a lawsuit against Google, and the very unaware decision(s) made all the way up to federal level, will NOT bring down the API economy--your inaction will!</p>
<p>If I've learned anything during my time defending APIs, as part of the Oracle v Google case, is that many of you are holding your API designs close to your chest, thinking maybe, just maybe, they are intellectual property we should protect, and can make money on, when we are the next unicorn start-up. You are willing to do this, even at the expense of the success of your APIs, ignoring that it creates huge amounts of friction with developers, and the businesses you are asking to integrate your APIs into their systems.</p>
<p>When you bundle this with the large numbers of folks who don't even understand the difference between an API definition or design, and its code back-end, you end up with a very dangerous, controllable group of folks, who will slowly stifle, and potentially suffocate any momentum we have built with the API economy. It will be these groups of individuals and companies, who will blindly do Oracle's bidding, and make sure any democratizing power APIs had, stays in the hands of the powerful few.</p>
<p>Why would anyone integrate your API definition into their application, if at some point they can be forced to license and pay for the naming, and order of API endpoints that are called? I sure wouldn't. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/05/3scale-launches-api-commons-to-allow-developers-to-share-apis-under-creative-commons-licenses/">This is why Steve Willmott and I started API Commons</a>, so that we can start sorting out the open API definitions, from the closed ones, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">index these API operations using APIs.json</a>, allowing the API economy to filter itself at run-time, leaving closed, potentially dangerous definitions behind.</p>
<p>Please join me in the fight, by helping me define the common API patterns available across the space, as part our&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>&nbsp;work--do not let this decision get you down.</p>

Shortly after publishing my post, someone kindly pointed me to a version of Swagger that was developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jensoleg">Jens-Ole Graulund</a>, which was exactly the evolution that I was looking for.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jensoleg/swagger-ui">The more response, Swagger driven version of Slate API document is perfect</a>!&nbsp;Giving API providers a more attractive, response version of Swagger UI (sorry Tony), while also keeping the core machine readable.--it is the best of both worlds! I plugged in one of my other complete Swagger definitions, and boom...I had a new version of my API docs.</p>

<p>Tips like this from my readers is why I blog about all my ideas out loud. If I kept my thoughts locked up, this type of discovery would never occur. I am going to play with deploying this version of the Swagger UI for my API stack, to see how versatile it is, and how well it works with my own site template.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wanted to put it out there that this new option for Swagger UI exists, in case you were looking for an alternate version of the Swagger UI. I predict this is the beginning of many different iterations on Swagger UI, resulting in one eventually that is themable. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://atom.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/atom-editor/atom-editor-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been using the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom editor</a>&nbsp;when I work on local files on my workstation for some time now. With the latest version 1.0 release I took a fresh look at the architecture, and under the hood at the packages that make the platform so powerful, and extensible. One of the packages I was reverse engineering this weekend, is the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-atom-api">Atom API Autocomplete Package</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-atom-api">The&nbsp;Atom API Autocomplete Package</a> is one of <a href="https://atom.io/packages/search?q=autocomplete">several autocompete packages</a> that gives Atom some of that IDE feel when you are editing files. I like the feel of Atom autocomplete, and I really dig that this functionality is extensible via Atom packages. This experience got me thinking again about the IDEs role in API design and development, and how I'd like to see more API definition driven dictionaries, defined using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, driving IDE autocomplete features like the Atom editor has.</p>
<p>Like everything in my world, my concept of APIs.json driven dictionaries is a work in progress, but to kick things off <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/dictionary/">I launched a new API I'm calling my dictionary API</a>, that helps me build and manage dictionaries that I can potentially use in an Atom autocomplete package. As I do with all of my work, I want to put my ideas out there early to get feedback, and stimulate other people's imaginations.</p>
<p>To provide the content for my dictionaries, I am using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, my primary API definition format. All I do is index any single, or collection of multiple APIs using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and pass the URL to my new dictionary API, and I get back a JSON dictionary.&nbsp;</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/378e4a9a4ec021fb7c4a.js"></script>
<p>This is my first draft of an potential dictionary output. I still have to get familiar with the Atom package design, and I've noticed different autocomplete packages handle their completions differently, but I at least wanted an automated way for importing Swagger definition(s), and create a single JSON dictionary that I could use as my Atom package completion store. My API will allow me to iterate on my JSON schema until I find one that works, while allowing me to generate dictionaries from existing APIs.json collections that I have defined.</p>
<p>Along with other APIs.json driven services that I am working on, like generating <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">Postman Collections</a>, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-apimatic-sdks-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">API Science monitors</a>, I want to be able to easily generate API dictionaries that can be used throughout the API lifecycle to enrich any developer's IDE experience, and make sure they have the paths, parameters, and underlying data models for the APIs they need, right at their fingertips, in the environment they already use.</p>
<p>Imagine what API dictionaries could do for enterprise groups, in helping them standardize their API design practices, across groups, and an entire organization when they are working from common dictionaries, that are kept in sync using machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>, bound into indexes using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">API documentation when done using Slate</a>. It creates very beautiful, and easy to use documentation, that makes learning about an API much more pleasant. You can find some pretty good examples of Slate being used in the wild, with the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/api/#overview">Travis CI API</a>, <a href="https://docs.dwolla.com/#introduction">Dwolla API</a>, and <a href="https://www.apiscience.com/docs/api">API Science API</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slate goes a long way in standardizing the documentation for APIs, but I would like to see this go further. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/23/the-over-30-apis-i-depend-on-to-run-api-evangelist/">I am working to profile both Dwolla and API Science as part of defining the stack of APIs that I depend on to operate the API Evangelist network</a>, and while I enjoy the attractive UX Slate brings to the table, I'm lamenting the lack of a machine readable API definitions along the way.</p>
<p>I have a set of import scripts I use to scrape API documentation, and generate Swagger definitions, which I will be using to auto-generate a first draft Swagger file for any API I come across using Slate for the documentation, but I'd like to see a formal solution emerge. It would make sense to have a Slate generator from Swagger, for the API providers who would prefer the attractive looking Slate documentation, over the more functionality interactive <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>.</p>
<p>We definitely need to make sure API documentation UX is as polished as possible, but we can't lose any of the momentum we've gained from machine readable API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">I have previously talked about moving forward the API documentation and UI conversation forward</a>, and making sure Slate, and other attractive API documentation tooling, are interoperable with common API definition formats will be critical to keeping things moving forward.</p>

<p><em>This is one of several stories I am evolving as part of series I'm calling API fairy tales. With these tales I want to educate business leaders, technologists, and government about the importance of Application Programming Interfaces (API), and how they are being applied in almost every aspect of business occurring online today--providing simple examples that mainstream users can learn from, as well as retell in their circles.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Internet is slowly changing almost every aspect of our society, and a major part of this evolution is rooted in how we develop software, something that has been slowly building over the last 15 years, in the form of what is known an Application Programming Interfaces, or simply called APIs. This new breed of web APIs are providing access to data, content, and the other digital assets that are essential in building websites, mobile applications, and increasingly even physical devices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This modern web API movement is not some new software from a company like IBM, Microsoft, or Google, it is simply the next step in the World Wide Web, where you don&rsquo;t just surf the web, consuming HTML documents. In the API economy you navigate the Internet, creating, consuming, and interacting with not just HTML files, but any type of content, data, or digital resource that can be accessed via the web, desktop, and mobile applications that we increasingly depend on in our personal, and professional lives.</p>
<p dir="ltr">APIs are being used by almost every type of company, across almost every industry, to deliver the web and mobile applications business and consumer users are demanding. Companies ranging from Amazon to AT&amp;T are putting APIs to work across business operations, and are something you increasingly see in governments as well, with APIs available for the city of San Francisco, New York, the White House, and across government of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you buy a product online, stream the latest movie, pay health insurance, send money online, or pay your taxes--it is likely your transaction used one or many APIs to make it happen, exposing the unit of currency for the API economy. This new API driven economy provides a digital transaction format that can be used in any business, any industry, anywhere in the world, via any Internet connected device.</p>
<p dir="ltr">APIs are not just the latest high tech product, they are the next evolution of the Internet. In 1995 companies were trying to decide whether or not they needed a website, and by 2000, having a website became critical for almost all aspects of business. In 2010 companies were trying to decide whether or not they needed an API, and in 2015, having an API is becoming critical to doing business in the rapidly expanding API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://form.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/form-io/formio-logo-full.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The concept of a form, is one one of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphs</a>, that have taken on an entirely new life on the Internet. The concept of a form is baked into HTML, PDFs, and many other commons aspects of our digital lives, while also still dominating many of the information exchanges in our physical worlds. There are a handful of APIs out there that let you build forms, and their are APIs that let you build forms for platforms like Drupal, but I have yet to see a platform that uses the concept of a form, as carrot to design, deploy, and manage your API--until now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://form.io/">I was introduced to Form.io at Gluecon this year</a>, and was very please with the demo I was given (and my time playing with since). Form.io is a platform that enables developers to build web and mobile applications using a drag &amp; drop interface which allows you to create both the forms and the RESTful APIs all at once. I like this concept, because forms is something the average business user will potentially understand, and is something that has helped them also better understand web, PDF, and other digital platforms--whcih tells me it might do the same for the world of APIs.</p>
<p>Form.io lets users craft their resources, from a forms point of view, allowing you to construct using common elements like email, password, address block, as well as being able to define the custom elements you will need. This is important because it is shifting API design to begin from the standpoint of how it will gathered or put to use, rather than just the system resource it came from like a database. This approach, in my opinion, has the potential to bring API design, closer to the people who are trying to solve everyday problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://form.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/form-io/form-io-builder.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have crafted your forms, and the underlying resources, Form.io gives you the ability to publish <a href="https://angularjs.org/">an application front-end as an AngularJS driven Single Page Application (SPA)</a>, which will be a whole other aspect that I will write about in coming weeks. Using Form.io, you end up with simple, embeddable forms you can publish anywhere, and a complete API that you can easily integrate with other systems, or web, and mobile applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am putting Form.io into the category of meaningful approaches to API design, deployment, and management for the masses, like <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">APISpark for building APIs from common file and data sources</a>, or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono for scraping web data, and publishing as simple API</a>. I also feel it will <a href="https://www.blockspring.com/">move the API conversation forward significantly with mainstream business users like Blockspring is doing</a>, because like spreadsheets, users just get forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will hear more about Form.io from me in coming months. The platform is in beta right now, but will be announcing a wider release soon. I am also helping them work through their thoughts about how they deliver their services in the cloud, on-premise, and their overall business model and service level agreements. I am eager to support services like Form.io because while they help move the API discussion forward, they do it in a way that supports the average business user, not just developers, and the API elite.</p>

<p>As I am doing with the rest of the APIs in my stack, I am profiling each of these company's API operations, down to the underlying data model. My goal is to establish a complete profile of the operations using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, as well as each endpoint, using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to my own internal, master stack of APIs, I will break each API down into the smallest possible unit of value, and generate Postman Collections, link to SDKs.io SDKs, API Science monitors, and other essentials of API integration. At the very least, I now have a coherent list of APIs I depend on for my business, something that in my opinion, every company should have in 2015.</p>

<p>As part of my monitoring of the API space, I keep track of new posts on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">CodeProject</a>, and occasionally I come across an API integration project. Some of the times it references it as an API project, while most of the time it will just reference the platform being used, like a Magento Commerce project, or a Youtube project.</p>
<p>As I was reviewing a couple of interesting projects this week, I was thinking it would be nice to have a more modern, simpler version of CodeProject, but exclusively dedicated to APIs. The site could provide regular walk-through of API <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/">integration</a>, <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">aggregation</a>, or <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a> patterns. The site wouldn't have to do that many projects, just a couple a month would be fine to begin with, increasing the volume after things get going.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important feature would be the ability browse project by API provider, so you could find all the Twitter how-tos, or the Instagram how-to. The site would use Github to host each how-to, providing a simple, forkable way for API projects to submitting for inclusion by the community, while also empowering the audience to take each how-to-project with them.</p>
<p>I would totally love to do this idea, but I need another project like I need a hold in my head (any new ones). I would surely support anyone who setup a site like this, provide how-to, and help get the word out about it. ;-) I think you could easily monetize by getting paid to do how-to for specific APIs, and within specific business uses cases and industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alighty, idea share, back to work.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/22/apimatic-adds-new-api-validation-endpoint-to-their-api-client-code-generation-api-stack/">I wrote a story yesterday about APIMATIC releasing a new API validation API to compliment their existing API client code generation API</a>. I received an email from the APIMATIC team is how I found out about the API, but as I'm processing that story, and thoughts around what I'd like to see for <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API Changelog</a> (something Paul of <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockSpring">@BlockSpring</a> brought up), I'm lefting thinking about how antiquated our whole world of API discovery is.</p>
<p>As soon as APIMATIC updated their API Blueprint file, all who use APIMATIC, and us API pundits (clowns) in the space should, should receive a push notification. This type of notification is exactly what API Changelog does, but it does it based upon a document diff, rather than finer grain, machine readable detail like what is available in a Swagger or API Blueprint definition. This is something I know they are working on changing, using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using APIs.json, companies like APIMATIC can publish a machine readable index of API operations in a "known location", aka the root of their domain--in this case, it would be at http://apimatic.io/apis.json. This index lists all of the APIs, and their supporting elements, in a machine readable way, that companies like API Changelog could parse, and provide notification to API consumers, and the pundits like me--providing us with fine grain notifications like, change to existing API, addition of new API, or changes to parameters, data model, etc.</p>
<p>I know API Changelog is working on all of this, but I wanted to recount, to keep the topic fresh in my head, and also acknowledge that one of the problems in all of this, is the initial discovery. API Changelog is good at tracking on known or existing APIs, but how do you find new APIs? This is a very manual process, but when you can just introduce a list of URLs, and look for APIs.json--the API discovery game will improve significantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When any service like API Changelog, or even API Science, or APIMATIC finds a new APIs.json file, they are immediately made aware of vital metadata about API operations like the name, description, tags, and contact info, but also are given access to other machine readable building blocks like Swagger, API Blueprint, Postman Collections, which give us even deeper insight into API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someday, I will just get a simple notification via my API design workspace (aka IDE), via email, Twitter, or maybe even Github, that a new API exists, for the companies I already track on, as well as any knew companies I may be interested in learning about--of course these new APIs will fit some definition of what I look for not just in API design, but also other aspects of operation like licensing, pricing, and what SDKs are available.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/04/what-do-i-mean-when-i-say-apis-are-just-the-next-step-in-the-evolution-of-the-web/">I wrote about the Global Change Information System (GCIS) API earlier this year, and how they what they are doing with their API design represent how APIs are the next step in the evolution of the web</a>. If you have the time, go look at what they have done, it is mind-blowing. I am on their email newsletter, and have had their latest update in my inbox for a few days, with some thoughts attached to it I wanted to blog about, before I archived the email.</p>
<p>I love that they provide updates like this via email, but ultimately this story is about how they are iterating on their API design, making it much more useful, and powerful along the way&mdash;with some elements I&rsquo;d like to see spread across other content and document based APIs. Maybe I should backup, and clarify what GCIS does. The platform <em>&ldquo;use identifiers and semantic information to provide points of reference and traceability&rdquo;</em> across the research from 13 US federal agencies, that researchers, citizen scientists, application developers or information theorists can put to work for them.</p>
<p>With their latest release, GCIS provide a very approach to the relationship between publications and its references, enabling some interesting ways of getting at the information contained within publications. First, with any publication you can append /reference to any publication in the API, and receive a list of any references for the publication. For me, where things start getting cool, is that you can then also apply the same to a specific chapter in the publication, or even down to a particular figure.</p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;m trying to establish in a coherent way in my own systems. I&rsquo;m looking to apply this line of thinking beyond just references, and also make it work for specific companies, tooling, and what I consider to be common building blocks for each area of the API space I track on. Keeping an eye on projects like GCIS make my research such a valuable are of my operations, allowing me to learn from the companies, organizations, and government agencies that I monitor, and apply best practices across them to my own projects.</p>
<p>In my opinion there are two parts to this story: 1) The API design lessons around what GCIS team is doing by providing publication level references via their API (in JSON and YAML), while also breaking it down to chapter and figure levels, and 2) the fact that they communicate the story to their community via the email newsletter--personally I&rsquo;d also like to see more blogging, and tweeting about it as well, but I&rsquo;m happy just to get what I get.</p>
<p>The more I learn from the API space, the more I realize how much my own API design abilities need to improve.</p>

<p>I am <a href="http://restlet.com/summer-of-apis/">partnering with the Restlet team to put on a Summer of APIs, a virtual API challenge</a>. The goal with this summer program isn't to build apps on top of APIs, but build APIs that anyone can use, by crunching some valuable information resource, and make it easier to use in web and mobile, as well as potentially in embeddable tools, and even in spreadsheets--using APIs.</p>
<p>I've gathered up some valuable sources of data, ranging from industry datasets from Data.gov in Washington DC to data sets that can help us with the water crisis out in California, which is included in detail about the program. I did a little homework for you, but dont' feel like you have to stop there, you can make any data, content, or other digital resource into an API during the Summer of APIs.</p>
<p>With the summer of APIs we want bring awareness to the API design, deployment, and management tools that <a href="http://restlet.com">Restlet</a> brings to the table, but we also want to increase the number of valuable APis out there, and potentially make a bigger impact. You'd be surprised how the right access to election data could shift an election, or the availability of health inspection data could save lives--so put some thought into the change you'd like to see.</p>
<p>The Summer of APIs is not just for developers. Using Restlets API Spark platform, just about anyone can design, deploy, and manage APIs--without knowing how to program. All you need is a healthy curiosity about how to work with data, and make the time to learn the API Spark interface which walks you through everything you'll need to import the data, develop the APIs, and manage them. It doesn't hurt to have some coding expertise, but not a requirement.</p>
<p><a href="http://restlet.com/summer-of-apis/">Head over to the Restlet Summer of Code website for all the details</a>. If you need ideas for projects, feel free to tweet at me (<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a>)--I have lots of ideas to share! I look forward to reviewing your projects this fall, and see the valuable APIs you bring to the table. Thanks for getting involved, and working to make change through APIs with Restlet and API Evangelist.</p>

<p>I am working hard to <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">establish a complete set of APIs for my own API stack</a> which includes establishing complete Swagger definitions for the 25 APIs that I personally operate. These Swagger definitions are then used to generate <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">Postman Collections</a>, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-apimatic-sdks-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">API Science monitors</a>. I am also <a href="http://theapistack.com/">working hard to establish complete Swagger definitions for the 1000 companies in my API Stack</a>, something I am partnering with <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this work, both teams are working hard to evolve our tooling for working with, and validating API definitions. I mentioned a couple weeks back, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/comparison-of-automatic-api-code-generation-tools-for-swagger/">when I shared client SDK research conducted by APIMATIC,</a> that quality SDK generation is kind of the high water mark for measuring API definition completion--meaning if your API definition isn't complete enough to generate a functional SDK, you need to spend more time in your API design editor, until it is more complete.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/15/my-minimum-viable-definition-for-a-complete-swagger-api-definition/">As I've been working to establish my own definition of what a complete Swagger definition is</a>, APIMATIC has been hard at work doing the same, but applying to&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, and Google Discovery. Also at the same time <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">I'm building my questions API to help me automate the validation of Swagger definitions</a>, <a href="http://docs.apimatic.apiary.io/#reference/api-description-validation">APIMATIC has been working on their own validation API, which they just added to their existing API client code generation API</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.apimatic.apiary.io">If you are generating machine readable API definitions in&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, or Google Discovery, then you should be validating your API designs using APIMATIC.</a> Once you know your API definitions are solid, then you should also generate all your SDKs with APIMATIC too--I am only about 20% the way through doing this for my API Stack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice work <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> team. I predict by the end of the year we will have a full stack of APIs, and tooling, that helps us through almost every step of the API definition driven, API lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">I create a lot of machine readable API definitions for the 1000 companies I monitor as part of my API Stack</a>. I am using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> to define all of my APIs, providing me with a simple, yet powerful way to profile each of the APIs I'm working to understand better. If you aren't familiar with Swagger, it provides a handful of fields you can use to fill out the metadata profile for APIs, like title, description, etc., but where it really gets powerful is when you put the paths collection to work, outline the details of each endpoint.</p>
<p>Most of the APIs I come across that are defined using Swagger, focuses on providing details on each path, including verbs, headers, parameters, and sometimes response status codes. When looking for the benefits of Swagger, many stop here. With basic metadata, and details about the paths, <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">you can launch interactive documentation using Swagger UI</a>--which is how about 80% of folks are using the API specification format.</p>
<p>When it comes to Swagger, my own motivations are all about <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>, so when crafting Swagger files for the APIs I track on, I can easily call it quits after defining the basic meta information, and path details, but all of this ignores some of the exremely valuable aspect of using Swagger--with the definitions collection.</p>
<p>Using the Swagger definitions collection you can quantify the underlying data model across API operations, providing a machine readable profile of the XML and JSON that will be part of each API request and response. Once you have the underlying data model defined, including each parameter, description, and type, you can then link to each path and / or parameter, where the data model is being put to use as part of the request or response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swagger definition collections are not a requirement for Swagger UI, or for API discovery currently, but if you want to generate high quality server side code, or client SDKs, you will need a complete set of definitions present. The problem is, this is a shitload of work, and <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/twitter/twitter-api-swagger.json">as I face the Swagger definition for Twitter</a>, I'm looking at many hours of work if I want to ensure that Twitter's Swagger file has all of its underlying data model present, understanding why many people stop short of a complete Swagger spec.</p>
<p>In the end, the Swagger definition collections is really the cherry on top of each API I am profiling, highlighting the maturity of a particular API definition, demonstrating that you can do more with a machine readable definition, than just discovery, and documentation.</p>

<p>Making sure the Swagger files I craft possess a complete definition for its underlying data model, one that is linked to each API path, and parameters where it is put to use, is important to me, but damn it is a lot of work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/21/the-swagger-definitions-collection-is-the-cherry-on-top-of-each-api-that-i-profile/">As I mentioned in my last piece</a> I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/twitter/twitter-api-swagger.json">the Twitter Swagger file</a>, and my head starts spinning thinking about how much work it will be to hand-define all of the data models that used across the almost 100 Twitter endpoints.</p>
<p>I quickly got to work finding a better solution--I landed on <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">I had downloaded and installed Charles Proxy to better understand how we could map out the dark layer of the API universe</a>, that the popular mobile applications we use depend on. When running, Charles proxies all the requests and responses my desktop apps, and browsers make on my local Macbook. I can also route my iPhone and iPad through the proxy, when I want to also record my mobile app usage. This is perfect for helping me map out the public APIs in my API Stack work!</p>
<p>When the Charles Proxy is running, it saves an XML summary export to my local Dropbox folder, which then gets synced to the cloud via the Dropbox API. I am now working on a script that will keep an eye on my Dropbox folder, and process any new Charles export files it finds. As I process each file, I'm cherry picking from the domains of specific companies that I'm tracking on, pulling out the request and response information I need to craft a Swagger definition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To generate the traffic I need, I just load up any API I'm looking to profile in <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, and started working my way through the list of endpoints, until I've covered the entire surface area of any API. I find it is easy to generate a beginning Swagger definition, which includes the host, base uRL, endpoints, and parameters, then load it into Postman, and let Charles proxy complete the rest of the Swagger definition collection, and link each one to any path or parameter it is referenced by. I will be running checks on request details, to make sure I haven't forgotten about any endpoints, and parameters, but my goal is primarily around polishing the definition collection, with an endpoint linkage.</p>
<p>I will not rely on these Swagger definitions generated from the Charles proxy. I will be queuing them up in a Github repo(s), and syncing them existing, often hand-crafted Swagger definitions I'm already evolving. Hopefully this process will help me automate the profiling of popular public APIs, and enable me to crank through more APIs this summer, as part of my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack research</a>.</p>
<p>All of this is working out well. My need to automate the defining of underlying data models, reminded me of the dark API work I was already doing with Charles Proxy--something I will spend more time on this summer. I am looking to generate a Swagger definition for each of the desktop apps I use on my MacBook, and the mobile apps I use on my iDevices--stay tuned!</p>

<p>I am playing around with making several stops along the API life cycle more accessible, and machine readable using APIs.json. To help me in my work, I am using&nbsp;<a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">my own API stack</a>&nbsp;as a proving ground, resulting in the&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">addition of Postman Collections</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-apimatic-sdks-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">API Science monitors</a> over the last couple weeks. As I'm working through the 25 APIs I have, and almost 350 endpoints, making sure the Swagger definitions are complete,&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/08/my-api-service-composition-tiers/">the latest evolution of my API management service composition is applied</a>, APIMATIC SDKs up to date, and API Science monitors are setup, I stumbled across another critical stop along the life cycle--the IDE.</p>
<p><a href="http://codenvy.com">I use Codenvy for my IDE</a>. It allows me to easily manage my numerous APIs, and applications that depend on my APIs, in a single cloud based development environment. The definitions for my API stack, both front and back-end lives on Github, but I use Codenvy work spaces to manage each repo, the runners to design, develop, and test out my APIs, and apps, at various stops along the life cycle. As I was doing my work, I saw how non-linear the life cycle ultimately could be, and how the IDE is a window for several stops I am concerned with along it.</p>
<p>While I am using Codenvy to design, develop, and deploy my own APIs, I am also using to evolve my own educational API integration projects. As part of this work,&nbsp;<a href="http://codenvy-api-101.apievangelist.com/">I am currently developing what I consider an API 101 stack of APIs, a common set of APIs, anyone who is just getting started with API integration would want to learn about</a>--I am starting with the classics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Twilio</li>
<li>Sendgrid&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I would consider these APIs to be messaging 101, and a good place to start for anyone looking to learn about APIs. While I am building this single <a href="http://codenvy-api-101.apievangelist.com/">general API 101 project</a>, I am looking to craft a number of these, and I don't want to have to do heavy lifting with each project,&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">so I'm standardizing how I define my projects using APIs.json</a>. Out of <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">my central API API (directory of APIs I track on)</a>, I am able to generate APIs.json files,&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com">which I use in my API Stack work</a>, something that allows me to also aggregate APIs together into collections, or as I prefer to call them, "API menus".</p>
<p>Each API menu is meant to provide an aggregate view of all the APIs I wish to present as part of a project, and Github along with Codenvy allows me to turn an aggregate "API menu" into an API integration starter project--one that is forkable and sharable. So, back to my API 101 project, I am using APIs.json to aggregate Twitter, Twilio, and Sendgrid into a single project, which I am using as a map to all aspects of API integration across these very separate APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am starting with the essential links, like to each portal, pricing, blog, Twitter, and Github pages. At this point, each project is just an aggregate API directory page, I want it to be more, so I am using APIs.json + Swagger to localize a handful of the important building blocks of any API integration process, such as:</p>
<p><a href="https://codenvy.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/codenvy/codenvy-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation -&nbsp;</strong>Provide aggregate API documentation using Swagger UI, allowing developers to explore all APIs as they learn about them. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/documentation/">I have done this across all 25 of my APIs, something that needs some performance tuning, but provides a worthwhile aggregate API documentation experience</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Software Development Kits -</strong>&nbsp;Using APIMATIC + SDKs.io I will be localizing relevant SDKs for each API, so if the project is a PHP project, I will include a copy of the PHP SDK.</li>
<li><strong>API Monitoring -</strong>&nbsp;Bring in monitoring data for APIs that I include in the project using API Science. I can setup monitors, and using their API I can regularly pull data, and publish to drive JavaScript visualizations that are part of each project--keeping developers up to date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually I'd like to bring in other essential elements of API integration, like load testing, security, and other things developers will need, but I needed to start somewhere. I think I will tackle more user friendly items like an API walk-through for developers, and adding in more APIs, before I branch out into actually offering different services. My goal is to have a set of 101 projects that anyone can fork, and use to learn how to get started with API integration, in PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js. If I can make sure the projects are APIs.json driven, I can use the open format to provide the&nbsp; backbone for each developers IDE project, in a way that keeps them connected, and in sync with any API changes.</p>
<p>I am sorry this post is so long, and a little rambling, but as I do with all of my work, I'm just trying to make sense of this, and bring some coherence to my work. I see the IDE playing several roles throughout the API lifecycle, from API discovery, to design, and development for the API provider, to potentially a starting point for API consumers to start their own projects, and as critical window throughout their own application development life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I am using Codenvy to manage the discovery, design, and development of my own internal APIs, but I also intend on using it as a sort of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">devops version of my API broker visions</a>, where I can easily assemble aggregate views of multiple APIs that can be used to develop a meaningful applications. Imagine assembling all the APIs that will be needed to develop a HIPAA compliant healthcare apps, or to bringing together the stack of valuable API resources a data journalist will need to be successful. My goal is to not just bring together the meta data for multiple APIs into one place, I want to localize documentation, SDKs, monitors, and other critical aspects of API operations as well.</p>
<p>Lots more thoughts to work through, thanks for reading.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dollar-sign.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">I am helping a client work through their monetization strategy for an API deployment service. To help me give me a starting point for the work, I wanted to take a look at a handful of existing service providers, that may not be a perfect match, but somewhat in the same realm--<a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">API deployment</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">For this phase of the work, I looked at six&nbsp;<a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API deployment providers</a>, who in my opinion have a pretty straightforward, modern approach to crafting, publishing, and sharing their pricing. It always amazes me how hard it can be to just find a companies pricing, let alone make sense of it...but I digress, that is another story.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the API deployment providers I reviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">API Spark</a></strong>, with 5 pricing tiers, broken down by concurrent connection (based upon IP address), number of APIs, the entity and file storage across APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.apitite.net/pricing">APItite</a></strong>, width 3 pricing tiers, broken down by number of APIs, API calls, data transfers, data storage (by row), whether the API is public / unlisted / private, and support</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.instantapi.co/#pricing">InstantAPI</a></strong>, with 1 pricing tier, with incremental add-ons to get more API call volume, broken down just by the number of API calls, with an option to pay for custom domain.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://sheetlabs.com/#/pricing">Sheetlabs</a></strong>, with 3 pricing tiers, broken down by storage, number of queries, spreadsheets, APIs, and users.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://orchestrate.io/#pricing">Orchestrate</a></strong>, with 3 pricing tiers, broken down by number of APIs calls and applications, with options for Service Level Agreement (SLA) and support as well.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://algorithmia.com/pricing">Algorithmia</a></strong>, with 2 pricing tiers, broken down by an equal ratio of credits to API calls. You get 10K credits for free, and can purchase more at 10K per $1.00.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I think these six provide a good test sample to kick of my research. Most of the other API deployment providers didn't have a straightforward pricing model, were open source, or just didn't seem like a good fit. &nbsp;As I looked through these companies approaches to monetization, I see two of the three hard costs of each provider covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Bandwidth</li>
</ul>
<p>The only one not present is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"compute"</span>, but in my experience this is usually applied across the other pricing variables, as it is harder to calculate. After the hard costs, some of the obvious elements of API monetization are present:</p>
<ul>
<li>APIs</li>
<li>API Calls</li>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Applications</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the most common elements of API service provider pricing, providing tangible things that users will understand. There were also two additional elements I found, that I would consider less than common, but interesting enough to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connections</li>
<li>Data Storage by Row</li>
</ul>
<p>The "connections "concept introduced by Restlet's APISpark platform is an interesting way to try and quantity the compute used by each API consumer. There were also three other I guess, kind of value-add aspects that were included in pricing packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support</li>
<li>SLA</li>
<li>Public / Private</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the number of APIs, API calls, users, apps, and connections are all just ways for carving up the third hard cost of "compute"--with some profit built in of course. It all gives me a great framework to think about what is important when it comes to crafting a monetization strategy, like the hard costs of compute, storage, and bandwidth, but also provides the tangible elements that potential customers will likely understand, such as the number of APIs, API calls, users, and apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, I am a fan of simple, tiered API pricing, providing a free, $9.99, 19.99, $49.99, $99.99, and onward--kind of like with Restlet's APISpark. Each package should be assembled from all the moving parts identified, both hard costs, and perceived costs that the end-users will get &nbsp;like storage, bandwidth, APIs, API cals, users, apps, etc. In my opinion, each tier should allow purchasing of additional units as needed, as well as being able to scale up and down the plan each month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the providers listed above had a "contact us" or "enterprise" option for pricing. This is an area I'd like to see more transparency around what partnership opportunities there are, as well as potential reseller possibilities--I see no reason why some developers can't achieve credits for bringing in other business. I see the partner and reseller layer of any API, as the key to platform success, in a way that can also become a external marketing vehicle for the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Alrighty. That gives me a good amount of information to the prime the pump around the conversation with my client, as well as help build a foundation for how I can approach future <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/index.html">API monetization</a> strategy discussions. I will incorporate this into my <a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com/">api-pricing strategy</a>, where i am trying to define a machine readable format that can be indexed as part of any APIs, <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json index</a>. I am happy with this as a start, to what I see as a continuing conversation about not just strategies for API monetization, but also API service provider monetization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> for publishing of my white papers, and I also keep an eye on what they are up to as part of my API monitoring--<a href="https://gumroad.com/api">they have a pretty useful publishing API</a>. During <a href="http://api.report/2015/06/15/weekly-apireport-for-june-15th-2015/">my weekly API.Report this last wee</a>k I came across their&nbsp;<a href="https://gumroad.com/smallproductlab">Gumroad Small Product Lab</a>, a cool idea that I'd like to see happen in more API ecosystems, or maybe even across them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Gumroad the the Small Product Lab is a <em>"mini course, community, launchpad, and contest to remove the unknowns and barriers to getting your work out in the world"</em>--Ten days, ten actionable lessons:</p>
<p><a href="https://gumroad.com/smallproductlab"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/gumroad/gumroad-small-product-labs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1: Mark your calendars</li>
<li>Day 2: What&rsquo;s your product?</li>
<li>Day 3: Plan it</li>
<li>Day 4: Create a style guide</li>
<li>Day 5: Ready, set, go!</li>
<li>Day 6: Share your process and progress</li>
<li>Day 7: Decoding the pricing puzzle</li>
<li>Day 8: Package it up</li>
<li>Day 9: Prep for launch</li>
<li>Day 10: The launch and onward</li>
</ul>
<p>Gumroad is focusing on their customer base (media publishing), but the format is something I'd love to see occur in API ecosystems, helping developers and API consumers put API resources to work for them. It seems like something API providers could do quarterly, monthly, or some other relevant schedule, that would really help API consumers be more successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of a Small Product Lab, also seems like something that be done across APIs, help API consumers put multiple APIs to work, in the name of a single objective. This kind of approach seems in line with a lot of the micro service, and micro app discussions I am seeing going on across the landscape--when you learn to tackle projects / products in smaller chunks, the chances for success go up (failure hurts less too). Lots of good lessons to be learned along the way!</p>
<p>Anyways, just shedding light on what is going on in the space, and putting the seeds for other ideas out there. I do not have the time to tackle such a project, but will definitely be here to support API providers who do small product labs within their ecosystems, as well as anyone who wanted to step up and do at a larger level. I am also going to consider adding it to <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">my master list of API management building blocks</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/status/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-science-monitors.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've long advocated that an <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/status/">API Status page</a>&nbsp;should be&nbsp;a required building block for any API operation. As I work on monitoring for my own <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master API stack</a>, and as I read stories like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/06/pingometer-keeps-your-uptime-in-the-9s-with-twilio-sms.html">Pingometer Keeps Your Uptime In The 9&rsquo;s With Twilio SMS</a>, I'm thinking we need more that just a simple status report for our APIs.</p>
<p>From an API provider standpoint, we should have a more nuanced view of our API availability, beyond just up or down--something popular API integration service providers like <a href="http://runscope.com">Runscope</a> and <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a> have been saying for a while. If our APIs are publicly available, I'm going to even suggest providers start actively sharing their API monitoring strategy, and resulting data with the ecosystem--something I'm going to also be <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">advocating for inclusion in the APIs.json index</a>.</p>
<p>From an API consumer standpoint, you are going to want a real-time awareness about the availability of all the APIs you depend on, and much like the provider standpoint, this view needs to be more nuanced than just whether a service is up or down. Developers need to be making tactical, run-time decisions based upon API monitoring, as well as be able to make longer term strategic decisions about which APIs they depend on, based upon API monitoring exhaust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like Twilio's style for showcasing <a href="https://pingometer.com/">Pingometer</a> as a solution. I'm thinking every API provider should cozy up with an API monitoring service provider for their own needs, while also establishing an approach they can also share with their API consumers, to meet their needs as well. I'm currently adding API Science and Runscope as default building blocks for my API Stack, something you will find indexed as part of each of my services APIs.json file.</p>
<p>I'm working to coherently separate out the benefits API service providers like API Science and Runscope bring to the table for both API providers, and API consumers, in a way that is also in alignment with a common set of building blocks, that everyone involved can benefit from, throughout the API life-cycle.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://sdks.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/sdks-io/sdks-io-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am partnering with <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> to help establish a common set of complete, and validated API definitions for the almost <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">1000 APIs I track on as part of my API Stack</a>. I am using my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/question/">Questions API</a> to identify what work is needed to be done, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/15/my-minimum-viable-definition-for-a-complete-swagger-api-definition/">by asking basic questions about companies, via their APIs.json definition, resulting in quick tasks I can accomplish that help us achieve our goals.</a></p>
<p>A portion of this work, involves making sure that the APIs in my stack are also linked to their <a href="https://sdks.io/">SDKs.io</a> profile. If an API in my stack doesn't have an SDKs.io icon, I know that I either need to search and find it in SDKs.io, or I need to publish a copy of the Swagger definitions I have to APIMATIC, and publish it to SDKs.io--then record the default SDKs.io page in my system, and republish. #hakunamatata</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/sdks-io/sdks-sio-api-stack-icon.png" alt="" align="middle" /></p>
<p>Right now you will only find a handful of SDKs.io on the main listing(AngelList, Google, Eventbrite). I am just declaring that I will be doing this as part of the process moving forward. So keep an eye out for the SDKs.io icon, because it means that SDKs.io is in sync with the API Stack (or shortly will be). <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">For all of my own internal APIs I will be actually generating SDKs using APIMATIC</a>--for the APIs I profile as part of my API Stack work, I'll just make sure things are in sync with SDKs.io.</p>
<p>Another problem you'll notice in this work, is the company vs. API aspect--meaning that some companies have the SDKs.io icon as one of its resource links, while some have it on the API itself. Look at AngelList and Google to see what I mean. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/13/you-gotta-keep-em-separated-breaking-down-apis-into-smaller-swagger-files/">This reflects the micro aspect to API definitions I've talked about before</a>. It is common to look at a single API for each company, but through this work, I am trying to distill it down to the smallest possible unit of valuable possible--maybe eventually separate SDKs for each API, plus one for entire company?? What do you think Adeel and Zeeshan?</p>
<p>I like having SDKs.io profile as a default building block for the APIs I track on. It provides me an incentive for ensuring there is as complete of a machine readable API definition for the API as I possibly can. The presence of an SDKs.io profile does not mean the Swagger definition is complete, I have other ways for certifying that, but when the SDKs.io icon is present I know that an API is further along in the process, and closer to being an API that anyone can quickly integrate with.</p>

<p>In theory, I can run this on any <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> file, and it will return answers for any API that has a valid Swagger file present. My goal is to provide me with a quick action todo list for <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">any API in my API Stac</a>k.</p>
<p>Now I want some sort of way to certify that all these questions were asked, import the Swagger into Postman, or some other tool and actually execute a real call against each endpoint. I'm still evaluating how to record this information somewhere, so it can be verified at any time, but anyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, I have about 50 APis targeted for completion, using my new Questions API. <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/swagger.html">I even created a simple little widget to ask the questions of each API, something I will automate as soon as possible, and build into my API stack</a>.</p>

<p>I have been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtualized API stacks</a> for a while now, slowly evolving my own view of whats next for the world of APIs, based upon what I'm seeing happen across the sector. I am working hard to convert my own <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master stack of APIs</a>, in 25+ separate container driven APIs, which I can then orchestrate into other collections for my own use, as well as the needs of my partners, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale API</a> clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The post&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.dreamfactory.com/running-dreamfactory-as-a-docker-container">Running DreamFactory as a Docker Containers</a> came across my monitors this weekend, which for me is a sign we are getting closer to a version of the API economy that I think will actually scale. The days where you launch one API platform, with one or many APIs, and you only sell that service via a single platform domain, have peaked. The technology, business, and politics of your API operations will have to be flexible enough to be deployed anywhere, by any partner you wish to give access, in a way that maximizes the same innovation we've seen popularize the API movement.</p>
<p>As John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) of <a href="https://www.runscope.com">Runscope</a> says: <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">Containers will do for APIs, what API have done for businesses over the last 15 years</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015 all your APIs need to be modular, and containerized using common approaches like Docker, alowing your API infrastructure to be deploy-able anywhere, anytime. H<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/making-my-3scale-api-management-portable-with-a-containerized-microservices/">opefully by now you have your API management and service composition house in order, and the business of your APIs can also scale to meet this new, containerized landscape</a>. If you are worried about discovery in all of this, you better start talking to me about <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and making sure you use a common API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>&nbsp;across all of your APIs.</p>
<p>Just like the early API providers like SalesForce, Amazon, and Twilio were able to out-innovate, and out-maneuver their business competitors using APIs in the last decade, <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/">companies who can containerize the approach to their API deployment and management like DreamFactory brings to the table</a>, will realize entirely new levels of agility, and flexibility--in a time when you really, really, really need any competitive advantage you can to stay relevant.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-puzzle-piece-two.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I work to chase an elusive answer to the question, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">what is a complete API Swagger definition</a>, I'm also faced with what I know John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>)&nbsp;would agree is the age old question, what exactly constitutes an API? Is it the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter API</a>, or is it the Twitter account, status, friends, media, etc. APIs? While this has been a tough question, facing anyone who considers API discovery, I think it is a question that is evolving as part of the current microservices conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One layer of the microservices onion is focused on breaking down services into their smallest possible unit of value (at least this is one of my takeaways). Doing this is an enabler all the other orchestration, devops, voodoo magic that represent the other architectural layers of the microservices onion. As I work to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">define Swagger definitions for the almost 1000+ companies in my API Stack</a>, I'm working to employ this line of thought, and actively breaking down each API I profile, into the smallest unit possible, using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild, is with the messaging API from <a href="http://www.tigertext.com/">TigerText</a>, which could easily be a single API Swagger definition called <a href="http://www.tigertext.com/tigerconnect/">TigerConnect API</a>, but after breaking things down I'm left with six separate Swagger files:</p>

<p>Ultimately this is more work for me, but from an API discovery perspective, I'm looking to identify the small, most unique unit of value possible, which allows me to discovery, and organize APIs into extremely precise, yet powerful <span style="text-decoration: underline;">API menus</span>. Right now this is a very manual process, but I'm developing tooling that will help me to "explode" existing Swagger definitions based upon unique API paths--we will see how that goes.</p>
<p>Now I can evaluate TigerText's approach to user APIs, or metadata APIs, without wading through the actual messaging side of the coin. I am not in the business of creating at database of APIs, where my metric is number of APIs--my objective is a database of high quality APIs, where my metric is number of companies, with complete API definitions for resources they provide, and as complete profile of overall API operations as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll see how I feel about this after doing another 500 APIs (I've done almost 500 so far) :-) My tune may change, but I'm hoping to have more tooling that helps me throughout the process. I will never be able to fully automate the creation, or fine tuning of API definitions, but I feel I can automate certain aspects--greasing the gears.</p>

<p>I am working through each of <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">my 25 APIs</a> right now, tackling a list of changes that include some adjustment for an&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/08/my-api-service-composition-tiers/">evolution in my service composition</a>, generating <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman collections</a>, <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and <a href="https://www.apiscience.com/">API Science monitors</a>--for each API. I was talking through the process of setting up my API monitors, and how I will be <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/status/">generating status pages for each API portal,</a>&nbsp;with John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), and he reminded me of the&nbsp;<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/HAR/Overview.html">HTTP Archive (HAR) format</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAR is all about providing an archival format for HTTP transactions that can be used by a web browser to export detailed performance data about web pages it loads, which got me thinking about how we can use the existing format to record and quantify the exhaust from our increasing API activity. There are some areas of the HAR specification that wouldn't apply to this, but for the most part, it provides an existing format for collecting, evaluating, and potentially understanding the value we generate (or not) via our APIs in real-time.</p>
<p>As I work through each of the stops along my API lifecycles (Postman Collections, SDKs, monitors, etc), I'm working to make sure the input and output from the stop is indexed as part of the APIs.json collection. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">In short, you will be able to find the Postman Collections, APIMATIC SDKs, and API Science monitors via the APIs.json index for each of my 25 APIs. </a>Right now APIMATIC SDKs and API Science monitors just link to HTML pages for getting at details, but eventually I am looking to make this detail machine readable as well--this is why John and I started discussing HAR.</p>
<p>To help me wrap my head around possiblities, I wanted to elevate myself and look at the the role HAR could play in the index of my APIs, and potentially the wider industries that I am building <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> collections for. As I look at the core of each of my APIs, Swagger very much represents the value that is possible with each of my APIs, while I see each Postman Collection as a unit of this value that is ready to be executed as a transaction, and HAR has the potential to be the evidence thta this value transaction actually occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The introduction of HAR into my APIs.json index provides an import linkage for me, in preparing each API for the API economy. Steve Willmott's and mines objective with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json is to index APIs</a>, preparing them for a more run-time engagement in the API economy, acknowledging we need a full machine readable picutre of what an API resource delivers, ranging from the what that API does, to the cost and licensing of that resources. API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a> provide an important way to quantify this value pre-transaction, Postman Collections provide the snapshot right at integration or client execution, and HAR could be used a record that this transaction occurred--think of this a trillion times over, in the context of a global API economy.</p>
<p>I will keep working through these thoughts, but I see API economy level potential here, and <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com">even opportunities for evolving the patent process for at least the digital side of the patent equation</a>. Meaning, when you file a patent, diagrams aren't enough in the API economy, you need an API definition showing what is possible, a Postman Colleciton demonstrating it can be run, and a HAR file from a certified provider like API Science, as a timestamp showing that this value was demonstrated on this date and time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, enough geeking out on that, back to preparing for&nbsp;<a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">my Internet of Things talk at API Days San Francisco this week.</a></p>

<p>As I work to create <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">Swagger API definitions for the almost 1000 companies in my API stack</a>, I'm chasing an elusive definition of a complete Swagger definition for any API. Only a small portion of APIs I am defining using Swagger will reach an 80-90% completions status, in reality most will never be complete for reasons that are totally out of my control.</p>
<p>When it comes to crafting API definitions for public APIs, I may be able to get the API definition complete in the sense that it has all the paths, parameters, responses, definitions, and security configurations, but if the API itself is missing pieces--the API definition will always be incomplete (in perpetuity).</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">As I work to automate the questions I ask of Swagger definitions</a>, helping me get to a more <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">coherent definition of what is a complete Swagger definition</a>, I can't help feel the need to offer API design tips to the API providers I am profiling. Honestly I have never considered myself a high quality API designer, I've been more business than tech, but I can't help pointing out the obvious stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still using my API definition tooling for my own goals around defining <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>, but because I'm building it all as APIs, I intend to open it up to others for analyzing their own API definitions, determining how complete they are, and potentially offering up tips on what could be done to improve them. A kind of self-service, API design tip API, that helps with some of the most common elements that are missing from API designs.</p>
<p>In 2015, API definitions are opening up a buffet of services that are courting API providers ranging from mocking and deployment, to monitoring and security. I don't see why API definitions couldn't also allow for professional API designers to help API providers evolve their APIs in a more constructive ways, from the outside-in. Using Swagger or API Blueprint, professional designers could easily provide suggestions for existing API providers and their designs, then give them potential suggestions that they could use in their API design road-map.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, food for thought!</p>

<p>When I started API Evangelist, I knew I didn't want to use WordPress or other common CMS, so I developed my own API, and page and blogging CMS. During the latest migration of my internal API infrastructure, I'm rebuilding everything as a <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">single stack of APIs</a> that I &nbsp;can use to operate API Evangelist. Part of this process is breaking down legacy systems, into the small possible unit of value, something I consider deeply as I rebuild each API.</p>
<p>It started with my link system, which I broke up into <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/link/">link</a>, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/curated/">curation</a>, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/keyword/">keyword</a>, and <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/linkrot/">linkrot</a> APIs. Now I'm eyeballing my legacy blog API, which historically I also use to publish news pieces to <a href="http://api.report">API.Report,</a> and sections that I syndicate to white papers I have published. My goal with my blogging API is to get it down to its simplest possible functionality--publishing posts to my blogs.</p>
<p>With this in mind I forked my newer <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/">blog API</a>, and labeled it my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/news/">news API</a>. Right now, my news API behaves very similar to my blog, but it already has new features like automated pulling of press releases, extraction of proper nouns, and a few other bells and whistles that make my news management workflow as painless as possible. Over time I may share some of the features with the blogging API, I think my news and analysis worlds will remain separate beasts, from here forward.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-internet-desktop.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was recently reading about&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/05/11/google-moves-its-corporate-applications-to-the-internet/">Google moving its corporate applications to the Internet</a>, and as my brain works, began applying this ine of thinking to the world APIs. I am big advocate for companies being more transparent, and acknowledging that more and more of our ever day business occurs on the open Internet, and we should start treating it like we are.</p>
<p>I think one statement in the Google paper says it well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The new model &mdash; called the BeyondCorp initiative &mdash; assumes that the internal network is as dangerous as the Internet.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As the Internet penetrates more of our personal and business lives, the concept of a private, localized, and secure network, is fading. Even if a system is only accessible via a local area network, if any node on that network has Internet access, and delivers resources to web, mobile, and increasingly devices via DNS--it is operating on the open Internet.</p>
<p>I am not saying that we need to put all our private information out on the open Internet, but I know too many organizations who feel pretty confident in their security through obscurity strategies, and that if things are kept hidden, and lightly secured, you are fine. Inversely they also claim that if you push directories of infrastructure out on the web, that you are just giving a map to the bad guys. This all just feels way out of balance to me.</p>
<p>Ultimately I feel like an API first approach for all digital resources is the way to go. Acknowledging that all of these resources will use the open Internet as a transport, and require all systems, web applications, mobile applications, and devices to use the same API--proving a single surface area that a company can secure. With it being publicly available, but secured properly using a sound identity and access management approach, companies can easily bring in external service providers to audit and help secure.</p>
<p>I am not selling this concept as a holy grail, but I wanted to point out that other large companies are thinking along the same lines, and I am looking to plant the seeds that maybe your current belief in the privacy and security of your internal networks isn't as solid as you think. We are seeing more security breaches in recent months, and I think in 2015 we need to start having a more honest conversations about how we operate our infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-mapper/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/cloud-elements-element-mapper.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have had <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a> under my <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API aggregation research</a> for some time now, keeping an eye on what they are up to via their <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/blog/">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudElements">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cloud-elements">Github</a> accounts. Cloud Elements takes a handful of top API driven platforms, which they organize into their <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/elements-catalog/">Elements Catalog</a>, aggregating them into a single API driven platform.</p>
<p>API aggregation is something I've been a big supporter of, and API reciprocity as with companies like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, is something I feel compliments how we operate on the open Internet. Today, <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-mapper/">Cloud Elements made an interesting move forward with the ability to map new elements</a>, <a href="https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/home.jsp#DocumentationElementsPanel">via an API</a>, which in my book moves them more into API reciprocity space, than it does aggregation--meaning you could in theory launch a specialized Zapier, using Cloud Elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One additional thing that Cloud Elements does that I think is significant, is they aggregate API driven platforms (elements) into meaningful buckets like documents, messaging, CRM, social, and finance. Things that actually mean something to end users. With the Element Mapper, you now map to any API driven resource you need, all via the API, to solve precise business solutions, for specific business groups.</p>
<p>Zapier has an API, but it focuses on the creation of new channels, and opening the potential for recipe development. What I like about Cloud Elements is they bring in the organizational aspect of it all as well, helping you establish some order. Establishing a stack of the APIs you depend on for your business, while organizing them in a meaningful and coherent way--all via an API. #Wining</p>
<p>It makes me happy to see a provider like Cloud Elements doing what they do. I've seen a lot of aggregation and interoperability API service providers come and go (Yahoo Pipes, cough cough!!) I like the approach Cloud Elements is taking. They are paying it forward in my opinion, meaning they are building value on top of existing APIs, using a wide variety of publicly available APIs, while also allowing API access to everything you can do with their Cloud Elements platform.</p>
<p>I will make time to play with Cloud Elements more, and compare it with some of my more manual approaches to API aggregation, and reciprocity. I actually can picture what Cloud Elements is doing becoming a very common model for how IT operates on the open Internet in the near future.</p>

<p>Much of this I could easily do with the JSON schema for Swagger, but I'm working on some more nuance to it, something eventually I'd like to evolve into an API design guide. Right now, I'm just trying to establish how complete any Swagger definition is programmatically, and queue up the API definitions that need work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've created a <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/">simple API for management of my API related questions</a>, then I created <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/ask/organization/?apisjson_url=https://kin-lane.github.io/api/apis.json&amp;questions=46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73">another API for asking these questions of specific Swagger files</a>. However if you want to use this API, you need an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> index for your APIs, which all of mine in the API stack do--then it will spider any indexed Swagger files, and do its best to answer the 25+ questions above, and return specific answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results are far from perfect, but it is a start. I will be making the questions more precise, and adding new questions. I hope to get more intelligent with things like status code recommendations, and linkage between the API paths and underlying data models. My goal is to have a real-time way of telling how complete my Swagger files are, and where the work is that needs to be done--as I am doing the work.</p>
<p>I'm sure the definition of exactly what is a complete Swagger definition is will continue to evolve, always resulting in a human having the final vote, but for now I will just keep defining, until I find the right balance between programmatic, and the human touch.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-composer.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am slowly getting my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">new API stack</a> in order, where I am close to opening it up for access to a wider audience. As part of this last round of work, I'm fine tuning my service composition strategy a little more. If you aren't familiar with API service composition, it is just about creating different levels of access to your APIs, and using my <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale API infrastructure</a> I can easily break this down.</p>
<p>The most common approach to API service composition you see out there is public and private, with maybe an additional partner tier. I'm taking a slightly different approach to defining my layers, and so far, her is what I have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong> - The completely open layer to my APIs that doesn't require any keys at all, like my website, but JSON.</li>
<li><strong>Retail</strong> - The retail storefront to my API operations that anyone can sign up for, and begin consuming my resources.</li>
<li><strong>Trusted</strong> - Same access to resources as my retail layer, but given higher rates of access to be able to make more calls.</li>
<li><strong>Wholesale</strong> - APIs from my stack, but running in someone elses infrastructure, alongside their own APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong> - Access to almost all of my APIs, giving higher levels of responsibility for my partners in crime.</li>
<li><strong>Platform</strong> - The highest level access, giving my systems and applications the ability to get the resources they need.</li>
<li><strong>Personal</strong> - A private access level, giving me a layer across all my systems that is only for me to access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all of my API consumers will begin as a retail user, and either stay there, or evolve into one of the other tiers. In the end I can custom tailor access to any of my users, and their applications, but I prefer establish specific layers for users to exist in--giving me clear security groups, that are also in alignment with my business goals.</p>
<p>My service composition approach will most likely stay staty static for a while now, as I play with a credit system that I can use for accessing different resourcs. Right now all APIs use the same unit of value for each API call, something I want to change. I am looking to develop a metering system that puts my 3Scale infrastructure to use, allowing me to maximize the value of each individual APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round-certified.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I go through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/comparison-of-automatic-api-code-generation-tools-for-swagger/">the research from APIMATIC regarding automatically generating client code using Swagger</a>, and I prepare to crank out Swagger definitions for almost <a href="http://theapistack.com/">1000 companies in the API Stack</a>, one big question I face is, what exactly is a complete Swagger definition?</p>
<p>An incomplete Swagger definition does you little good. I've gotten away with just mapping out some API endpoints, verbs, and parameters, to add another dimension to my API monitoring, but without authentication details, status codes, and the underlying data model, you can't do much else that is meaningful with them--as the APIMATIC research demonstrates. We need to start refining not just a definition about what is complete, but tooling and services that can help us get to complete as fast as we can, and automate the certification of any API, using Swagger.</p>
<p>I extracted version definition of what is a complete Swagger definition from APIMATIC's research that I recently wrote about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Valid JSON</li>
<li>Correct BaseURIs</li>
<li>Authentication Information</li>
<li>Endpoints</li>
<li>Verbs</li>
<li>Parameters</li>
<li>Schemas</li>
<li>Satus Codes</li>
<li>Data Models</li>
</ul>
<p>I would add that the basic elements of a Swagger specification, while maybe not critical to generating SDKs, are important to discovery, and other aspects of API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Tags</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I would say there is always the human element:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Designer Review </strong>- Sign-off from an API designer who compared the API definition to the actual API, while also rounding off any missing elements, and just giving the API design the love it needs.</li>
<li><strong>API Provider Review -</strong> Sign-off from the actual API provider. This will not be possible for all APIs, but having this is definitely a major score for the overall completion score.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I guess we also need some sort of code level validation an API is complete. I guess this can be done manually during the human API design review, but ideally it would be something a little automated, and potentially generating some output from an API monitoring service provider like <a href="http://runscope.com">Runscope</a> or <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a>--some sort of recent, timestamped output from an actual call that was made to each of the endpoints in a Swagger definition.</p>
<p>Next up, to actually create a walk though of each of the moving parts of a Swagger definition, and create 5-10 Swagger definition that I'd consider to be be 100% complete--something that I'm sure will evolve through the process. If you have additional thoughts on what is a complete Swagger definition, or an example of a Swagger definition, I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://apimatic.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apimatic/apimatic-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have met with the <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC team</a> several times over the last couple weeks to discuss the state of API definitions. If you aren't familiar with <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC, they are a API code as a service provider</a>, that generates high quality client code in several languages, if your APIs are defined using common API definition formats like Swagger (they are also the people behind <a href="http://sdks.io">SDKs.io</a>).&nbsp;APIMATIC is as passionate about high quality Swagger definitions as I am, and have shared some really valuable research to help push forward the API definition conversation.</p>
<p>In May, APIMATIC wanted to compare the quality of automatic code generation tools, using common Swagger specifications they found on Github. To set the bar for their research, APIMATIC established some basic operational parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code generator must support Swagger file format</li>
<li>Only client-side bindings are considered</li>
<li>Must create complete libraries rather than just code snippets</li>
<li>Only the following languages are considered: C#, Java / Android, Objective-C, PHP, Python Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p>While this research focuses on Swagger, I think the findings can be applied when thinking about other API definition formats like API Blueprint or RAML, but kicking things off with a focus on Swagger is wise.  With a basic framework defined, APIMATIC picked four of the leading code generation tools out there currently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://editor.swagger.io">Swagger CodeGen</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://restunited.com">REST United</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://studio.restlet.com">Restlet Studio</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the decision to look at Swagger CodeGen, REST United, Restlet Studio, and their own APIMATIC solution, they provide a little detail on the code generation engines behind each solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swagger.io is the official host for open source Swagger CodeGen project</li>
<li>REST United uses a customized version of Swagger CodeGen project and performs better than the official branch</li>
<li>Restlet Studio uses Swagger CodeGen for Objective-C, but has its own CodeGen engine for Android and Java</li>
<li>APIMATIC has its own CodeGen engine for all languages</li>
</ul>
<p>They took a sampling of Swagger specifications out of the thousands they found, and did a side by side comparison of how well each of the platforms did with the Swagger definitions, bringing us to the meat of this research, which as APIMATIC states &ldquo;successful compilation does not mean that the SDK will work out of the box!&rdquo;. In short, there are a lot of things to consider when generating code, and APIMATIC helps us see the problems with approaches to code generation, as well as the overall quality of Swagger definitions that are available out there.</p>
<p>Embarrassingly two of the Swagger definitions they used were mine, which I acknowledge are often very incomplete, but they did use others well, including the sample Petstore definition used as demo for Swagger. The message is pretty loud -- the quality of Swagger definitions right now is pretty poor, and while APIMATIC goes a long way to ensure a usable client SDK is generated, they can only do so much with crap Swagger definitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;APIMATIC looks at some of the tops reasons why the code generated is so bad, resulting in code that often times just will not work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing Authentication Info</li>
<li>Swagger.IO and Restlet Studio do not generate authentication code, even when auth info is available</li>
<li>APIMATIC and REST United support OAuth 1 &amp; 2, Basic Auth, and Custom Headers/Parameters</li>
<li>Missing Schemas/Model definitions</li>
<li>All except APIMATIC use &ldquo;void&rdquo; return type when schemas are missing, meaning all responses are ignored, and no data is returned</li>
</ul>
<p>As they put it, here is APIMATIC&rsquo;s struggle: <em>"SDK&rsquo;s should work out of the box!&nbsp;Generated code often does not work out of the box, AND to make matter even worse, its not even easy to fix by hand.&nbsp;APIMATIC has implemented fallbacks to handle missing schemas and model definitions, but missing auth info cannot be fixed by any fallback measure."</em></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>After you separate the differences in approaches by each code generation engine, it really comes down to a handful of reasons why the Swagger definitions are incomplete--something I see a lot of, as I look for Swagger definitions across the space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid JSON</li>
<li>Missing BaseURIs</li>
<li>Missing Authentication Information</li>
<li>Missing Endpoint OperationIds/NickNames</li>
<li>Missing Schemas/Models</li>
<li>Missing Error Codes/Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the common problems I suffer from with many of my own Swagger definitions, as well as many I discover across the Internet. In my opinion, a complete Swagger definition is more art than tech, and you need the human who really cares about an API to hand finish it. I have many Swagger definitions that are complete, well as complete as the API is, but many I have for public APIs in my API Stack directory, are a work in progress.</p>
<p>APIMATIC also provides three interesting proposal for enhancing Swagger definitions so we can automatically generate more robust code in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Streaming API</li>
<li>Support for WebHooks</li>
<li>Support for Error Models, not just Error Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is just good API design, the other two are more about additions to the Swagger specification. APIMATIC also provides us with a look at the future, if we get our collective Swagger together, we can realize some serious benefits that will help us throughout the API life cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naming conventions</li>
<li>Design patterns</li>
<li>Namespaces and packaging</li>
<li>High readability and general formatting</li>
<li>Code comments</li>
<li>Identify redundant and unreachable code</li>
<li>Generate IDE support (Visual Studio, XCode, Android Studio, Eclipse)</li>
<li>Enabled IDE type-hinting (ie. PyCharm, Ruby Mine, Netbeans)</li>
</ul>
<p>I see APIMATIC as just one of many emerging API service providers who live along a Swagger driven API life cycle, but I feel they are one of the most important barometers we have, that we can use to understand the overall health of the Swagger ecosystem. If you can&rsquo;t generate working client code from your Swagger, it is likely you won&rsquo;t be able to mock, test, monitor, or achieve other critical stops along the API life cycle.</p>
<p>Of course, I would be neglectful if I didn&rsquo;t mention that the&nbsp;APIMATIC team is obviously biased, as their motivation is to sell their services. This is true, but APIMATIC is the only player to emerge in the code generation game that I&rsquo;ve seen actually provide a high quality perspective and solution to the problem of client code generation. Look at what they offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Interface -</strong> Easy to use interface for managing code generation.</li>
<li><strong>API -</strong> APIMATIC&rsquo;s CGaaS is available as an API.</li>
<li><strong>Multi Definitions - </strong>Accepts API Description (Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IO Docs, Google Discovery)</li>
<li><strong>Widgets -</strong> Maintain your API description, and the widget provides fresh SDKs where you need.</li>
<li><strong>APIMATIC On-Prem - </strong>Available as a universal Linux binary - Provides simple locally hosted API.</li>
<li><strong>SmartBear Ready! API Plugin - </strong>Generates SDKs from inside Ready! API.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also known Adeel and Zeeshan, and know they truly care about the health and quality of the API ecosystem, as well as looking to sell the valuable services they bring to the table with APIMATIC and SDKs.io. There is a lot of valuable insights to work with in the research they have started, something I will be contributing to in the future. I will let you review the slide deck from their research below, but I also wanted to point out two addition slides that I thought were interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Statistics for Sources of API Descriptions (Where They Found Definitions)</strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apimatic-api-definition-research-location.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p><strong>Statistics for API Descriptions Located (What Format The Definitions Were)</strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apimatic-api-definition-research-type.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>There are two things interesting here, what formats are available, and where are people putting them. I&rsquo;m focused heavily on supporting Swagger and API Blueprint, and often find that discovery and indexing of these definitions is very difficult. I can find definitions on Github fairly easy, but finding them on the open Internet is proving to be more challenging, and resource intensive&mdash;something I will be working with the APIMATIC team on more as well.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is that the Swagger definitions we are creating need to be more complete, and I think it points to the fact that we need more services and tooling to help us validate the completeness of our definitions, something I will also be working with the APIMATIC team on. We need a community driven way to share these API definitions, and as a community to help validate and certify API definitions, and also help complete them when necessary.</p>
<p>I will work with APIMATIC to conduct this research on a regular basis, and is something we are both committed to improving on. In future posts, I&rsquo;ll talk about the work we are doing between APIMATIC, SDKs.io, and my API Stack research, which will provide opportunities for the community to get involved&mdash;so stay tuned.</p>

<p>I recently added a new tool to my hacker storytelling toolbox, that allows me to easily assemble walk through, that help me guide my readers through a scripted series of steps around any of my research areas. <a href="http://api-portal.apievangelist.com/">I first did it to walk through what I'd consider to be my minimum viable developer portal</a>, and now I decided to <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/">apply to my Swagger research</a>.</p>
<p>I am working on a set of APIs that help me quantify whether a Swagger definition is "complete" or not, to help me tackle my goals around <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack research</a>, and establish a rich set of complete, open API definitions that the community can put to use. What better way to quantify all the moving parts of Swagger, than to actually create a 101 walk through of its moving parts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/walk-through.html">I added the Swagger walk through to my Swagger research</a>, and will keep refining, and adding more information to it. I've managed to further evolve my definition of what constitutes a complete Swagger definition, allowing me to work towards a somewhat automated, API driven service that will help me understand how complete each Swagger definition in my API stack is, and where the work is that needs to be done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal here is to get <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">all the APIs for 900+ companies in my API Stack fully defined using APIs.json and Swagger</a>, while also establishing a pretty robust set of tools and services for certifying Swagger definitions. If you want to get involved, there is a lot of work to be done, just visit the API Stack, and get involved via the Github repo.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a> and I have been working hard to craft <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files for the top public APIs out there, including machine readable Swagger definitions, ever since <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">we launched the open source API search engine APIs.io</a>. We will keep working to define, and index the API space, but it is a lot of work ahead, and we could use some help.</p>
<p>Over the last couple months I've had several conversations with folks about the need for <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprints</a> for popular APIs, so that the community can build valuable tooling and services on top of commonly used APIs. Two companies who I've been talking to are&nbsp;<a href="http://apimatic.io">SDK generation service APIMATIC</a>, and <a href="http://blockspring.com">API spreadsheet integration provider BlockSpring</a>.</p>
<p>APIMATC wants see better quality Swagger definitions emerge, so they can build client SDKs that work, and make available via <a href="http://sdks.io">SKDs.io</a>. BlockSpring wants to be able to integrate popular API content, data, and functionality into Google Spreadsheets, using their slick plugin. These are just two examples of services that are emerging to deliver much needed functionality on top of APIs -- if we can establish a rich, open, machine readable repository of API definitions, it will open up the flood gates for even more API tooling and services. #win</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">I've added some new information to the API Stack to support this effort</a>. So far <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">I have&nbsp;917 companies, in 223 areas, with 882 APIs cataloged, and 407 Swagger definitions.</a> I want all 917 companies to have all their APIs fully defined using APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprint by the end of the summer, as well as any important companies that are not listed. It is a lofty goal, but I think with some help, we can do it.</p>
<p>As a working group, we have several challenges, that we are hoping to work out in real-time via the <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">API Stack Github repository</a>. First we have to actually do the heavy lifting of generating APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprints, but we also have to also define a process for what is considered a "complete API definition"--I'll be working through these thoughts separately.</p>
<p>Now that I am done traveling, I will be dedicating a considerable amount of time to this work in June. If you want to get involved, <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">please participate via the API Stack site and Github repository</a>, or feel free to ping me directly. We need all the help we can get, and are looking to have a robust repository of high quality API definitions for 1000+ of the top APIs available today.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://electron.atom.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/electron/electron-editor.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Darrel Miller(<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>) reminded me of the <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">desktop development platform Electron</a> the other day, with his story on <a href="http://blog.runscope.com/posts/moving-beyond-the-browser-with-javascript-and-hypermedia">Moving Beyond the Browser with JavaScript and Hypermedia</a>. I had been eyeballing Electron as a potential candidate for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">my perfect API design editor</a>, something I honestly don't have the bandwidth to build, but is something I enjoy pushing forward in thought.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, it is what powers popular desktop version of the apps that I use most--Github, and Slack. The open source desktop framework, developed and maintained Github, allows you to deliver simple, easy to maintain desktop experiences, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript--powered by Chromium and Node.js. Electron is appealing to me because it allows me to use the tech that I am most fluent in, to deliver high quality desktop apps, but also as Darrel mentions in his story, it has the potential to improve on the quality of JavaScript apps we build--giving us C grade JavaScript people a framework to live within. ;-)</p>
<p>I have a pretty clear vision in my head of the API design editor that I would like to see developed. I doubt this will be something I will have the time to develop personally, but I would like to encourage others to develop API design editors using Electron, and encourage a focus on it being extensible, allowing 3rd party, API driven API design features to be added--keeping the editor simple, with almost every feature living as an extension.</p>
<p>I think the API workflow and life-cycle will be different for each API provider, and we need to be able to have the features that we need most, right at our fingertips. <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">Through my profiling of 917 companies, in 223 business sectors, with 882 APIs cataloged, and 407 Swagger definitions so far, I intend to provide API design tips and dictionary functionality based upon popular / successful API designs</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, back the actual work at hand. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">I just wanted to revive these visions of my perfect API design editor</a>, so I can add to, and make sure it is connected with the potential for developing the next killer API design editor, using Electron.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/06/04/storytelling-and-the-future-of-hypermedia-apis/">Storytelling and the Future of Hypermedia APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.eater.com/a/one-night-kachka"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/one-night-at-kachka-eater.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Helping people understand the potential you see around a particular approach to API design, is hard stuff. Providing easy to follow stories, and implementations that the average person can follow is something I've dedicated myself to at API Evangelist, and something I'll keep working on when it comes to evolving API approaches like hypermedia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hypermedia has long suffered from an image problem, something I feel can be remedied through a little hacker storytelling on the part of hypermedia API media type owners, API providers who bake hypermedia into their practices, and the developers who are crafting meaningful hypermedia driven experiences. In 2015 I feel like we are getting closer to fixing this, but as I said, this stuff is hard, and takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>Until there are easy to follow stories, and examples of hypermedia in practice, only us in the know are going to care. I see a lot of potential ideas for hypermedia hacker storytelling in my head, but getting these out into stories, and into practice takes a lot of work, and massaging of ideas. One idea that was just moved forward for me, was derived from a post <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">Audrey</a> sent to me today,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eater.com/a/one-night-kachka">a story from Eater, called One Night Kachka</a>.</p>
<p>This approach to storytelling, provides me with a potential blueprint for evolving how I can tell stories using hypermedia APIs, and Single Page Apps (SPA). The Kachka story is full of rich structured data and content, providing a compelling timeline breakdown of a nights activity at a restaurant. There are so many interesting objects here that could be defined and woven together with a hypermedia core--then simply presented via a hypermedia client (aka Single Page App).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally you could generate an administrative SPA, allowing a user to be walked through the process of telling a story, adding the timeline elements, people, pictures, videos, and data around sales and activity--then point user towards the SPA client that allows them to explore the interactive story they just told. This represents an evolution in storytelling around hypermedia for me, where I move from talking about "clients" to talking about a more tangible storytelling SPA, that potentially a wider audience might be able to follow.</p>
<p>What is really beautiful about this model, is an API designer who was skilled in a hypermedia approach like&nbsp;<a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/">Collections+JSON</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>&nbsp;could craft a core that could drive this restaurant experience, but also be flexible enough to tell other similar stories like one night at the club, concert, or maybe just Christmas eve at home with the family. With the SPA client approach, you could easily provide some amazing CSS implementations, <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">using a CSS Zen Garden approach</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Food for thought!<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/a-good-example-of-hypermedia-api-using-the-siren-specification/"> I am just now playing with Siren, in redesigning how I tell the story around my API news curation</a>, but once I get my chops up with Siren, HAL, and Collecton+JSON, I may take a crack at assembling a hypermedia core for an API that could drive stories like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eater.com/a/one-night-kachka">One Night Kachka</a>.</p>
