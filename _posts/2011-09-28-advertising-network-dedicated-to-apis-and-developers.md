{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of the things I do here at API Evangelist is review APIs for their owners and provide suggestions for how they can improve the technology, ecosystem and better monetize their API.When it comes to monetization many of the API owners seem to have a good grasp of how they are covering the base costs of operating their API, but are looking for ways to expand their revenue, and actually make their API profit engine.Just like with web and mobile applications the first way people think about monetizing their API is using advertising.Though I donâ€™t always agree with employing advertising as part of an API ecosystem, it makes sense that many owners are considering it.Advertising has been a primary revenue generator for web sites and applications, and has become a staple for mobile applications, using mobile advertising platforms like AdMob.</p>
