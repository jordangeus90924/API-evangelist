<p>Thanks for connecting through APIWare. Someone will be in touch to help better understand your needs, and make sure they are looked at by the team, and someone follows up with you with some next steps.</p>

<p>So what is APIWare? Why can't I just talk to you Kin? APIWare is my API resultant partner. I do a lot of research, coding, writing, speaking, and other work that goes beyond individual companies, or clients, and looks to deliver value the entire industry can put to use. Along the way I have a lot of people who need help, and as a one person shop, there is only so much I can, so I established a partnership with APIWare to  help all of us get what we need.</p>

<p>You are still will welcome to contact me directly, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/contact/">via one of my channels</a>, and I'm open to taking calls on Thursdays to discuss the space, and how you fit in. However some days I'm not around to check email, and if you have ongoing needs, APIWare are the ones that can help you out. They'll look after the day to day details, and bring me into the conversation when it is relevant. So you will still be talking with me, it will just be in a more managed way, than I have done on my own.</p>

<p>I believe in each of my partners, <a href="http://3scale.net/">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com">Restlet</a>, <a href="http://wso2.com/">WSO2</a>, and <a href="http://apiware.io/">APIWare</a>--otherwise they wouldn't be my partners. I have an vested interest in their success, as well as my mission focused around the overall health of the API industry--which includes you! So, let me know how I can help, someone from APIWare will be following up with you, and we'll see how we can help.</p>

<p>Thanks -- Kin Lane, The API Evangelist.</p>
