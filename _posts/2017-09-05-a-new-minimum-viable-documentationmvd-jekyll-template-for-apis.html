<p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the static content management system (CMS). <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist">All of API Evangelist runs as hundreds of little Jekyll driven Github repositories</a>, in a sort of microservices concert, allowing me to orchestrate my research, data, and the stories I tell across all of my projects. I recommend that API providers launch their API portals using Jekyll, whether you choose to run on Github, or anywhere else using the light-weight portable solution. I have <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">several Jekyll templates I use to to fork and turn into new API portals</a>, providing me with a robust toolbox for making APIs more usable.

<p>My friend and collaborator James Higginbotham(<a href="https://twitter.com/launchany">@launchany</a>) has launched <a href="https://launchany.github.io/mvd-template/">a new minimum viable documentation (MVD) template for APIs</a>, providing API provides with everything they need out of the gate when it comes to a presence for their API. The MVD solution provides you with a place for your getting started, workflows, code samples, reference material, with OpenAPI as the heartbeat–providing you with everything you need when it comes to API documentation. <a href="https://github.com/launchany/mvd-template">It all is an open source package available on Github</a>, allowing any API provider to fork and quickly change the content and look and feel to match your needs. Which in my opinion, is the way ALL API documentation solutions should be. None of us should be re-inventing the wheel when it comes to our API portals, there are too many good examples out their to follow.

<p>I know that Jekyll is intimidating for many folks. I’m currently dealing with this on several fronts, but trust me when I say that Jekyll will become one of the most important tools in your API toolbox. It takes a bit to learn the structure of Jekyll, and get over some of the quirks of learning to program using Liquid, but once you do, it will open up a whole new world for you. It is much more than just a static content management system (CMS). For me, it’s most significant strength has become as a data management system (DMS)??, with OpenAPI as the heart. I use Jekyll (and Github) for managing all my OpenAPI definitions, JSON and YAML files, and increasingly publishing my data sets in this way instead of relying on server-side technology. If you are looking for an new solution when it comes to your API portal, <a href="https://launchany.github.io/mvd-template/">I recommend taking a look at what James is up to</a>.
