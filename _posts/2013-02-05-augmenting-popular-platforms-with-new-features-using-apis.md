{% include JB/setup %}<p>There is an interesting post on the Parse blog about instaDM, which is a service built using Parse, the BaaS platform, that provides private messaging in the Instagram ecosystem.This is a very interesting approach to externally developing features for another platform or service.I think Parse says it well: Even the hottest new apps, however, aren’t perfect and that’s where clever innovators can fill in the gaps with a great idea.Parse-powered instaDM is one such innovation.On one hand, this approach is a gamble.</p>
