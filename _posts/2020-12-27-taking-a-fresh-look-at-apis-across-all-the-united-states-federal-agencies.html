<p>It has been a while since I looked at the 250K view of what is going on with APIs across federal government agencies in the United States. Since working for the Obama administration in 2013 I am perpetually on a quest to map out what is happening across federal agencies, helping drive the conversation forward. I belieive APIs can make the most impact when our federal government helps lead the way, and I am looking to help push things forward in the following ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep mapping out the Federal Government API Landscape</strong> - I am determined to produce a map of the APIs that exist across federal agencies and keep the list alive and active.</li>
<li><strong>Establish Public API Workspaces for Federal Agencies -</strong> I am looking to establish public API workspaces for agencies who are implementing APIs--helping do some work from the outside-in.</li>
<li><strong>Refresh My Memory of What is Happening -</strong> I thrive on knowing what is going on across federal agencies, and doing these reviews pushes me to refresh my awarenss of APIs at this level.</li>
<li><strong>Fire Up new Conversations -</strong> These sotries always rise up in the SEO game and bring in new conversations with folks who are doing interesting things with APIs in government.</li>
</ul>
<p>I always learn a lot looking through the different government agencies. I learn even more wading through the different datasets, databases, and various incarnations of APIs. There is way too much work here than one person can handle, and much of what I come across labeled as an API really isn't an API, but could be with a little work. While doing these roundups I always reach a point where I feel like I am not doing enough, but ultimately I have to strike a balance between being comprehensive and just scratching the surface. Providing just enough information to allow me to plant seeds that might grow into new conversations down the road, while not spend all of my days sifting through the backwaters of federal government websites. This is my latest attempt to map out what is happenign with APIs across federal agencies in 2020, with some learnings and ongoing thought about what else can be done down below.</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a biomedical research facility primarily located in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. An agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, it is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and health-related research. The NIH both conducts its own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program. With 1,200 principal investigators and more than 4,000 postdoctoral fellows in basic, translational, and clinical research, the IRP is the largest biomedical research institution on Earth, while, as of 2003, the extramural arm provided 28% of biomedical research funding spent annually in the US, or about US$26.4 billion.</p>

<hr />
<p>This represents about two days worth of work, which is also upon some work I've done over the years. There are definitely more APIs out there that I couldn't easily catalog, but I've begun setting up workspaces to help me continue building on this work in an ongoing, community driven way. This sprint is just meant to get all of these federal agencies loaded up in my brain again, stir up thoughts about what is happening, and push me to propose some next steps for specific agencies, but also the overall API conversation. After doing this work here are a few of my thoughts about what is going on and what might come next.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth In APIs -</strong> There are definitely more APIs that when I last looked across agencies, and there are some agencies you can tell have embraced an API way of doing things.</li>
<li><strong>Lots of 404s -</strong> There are a lot of 404s when I look through legacy lists of APIs I was familiar with, and it can be tough to actually tell if there is anyone home behind some of the APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Templates Matter -</strong> The agencies who have provided portal templates, and open blueprints for publishing APIs makes a big difference, making their APIs much more consistent and usable.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger Usage Has Grown - </strong>There is a significant uptick in the usage of Swagger across agencies, including adoption of OpenAPI 3.0, demonstrating the value of the specifications across government APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Huge Data Opportunity (As Always) - </strong>I included a link to any agency's data landing page because some of them have APIs I may not have indexed yet, but also because they represent the API opportunity across data.</li>
<li><strong>Standardized API Management -</strong> The usage of API Umbrella by GSA and it's standardized usage across agencies has made an impact on working with APIs, and reduced friction when it comes to onboarding with APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I went into this work fairly depressed about what I might find at the close of the current administration, but I left fairly optimistic about the work that is going on across agencies. Don't get me wrong, the overall API conversation across federal government is still in a pretty sad state. There is a massive wealth of data resources available, but discovery and integration with these datasets are not at all standardized, and there are few of the affordances we often take for granted in the private sector. I always view federal government as being a minimum of 5-10 years beyond what is going on in the private sector, but we are going to need a huge amount of investment in APIs across federal agencies if they are going to play catch up, let alone begin to lead in the API conversation.</p>
<h3>Getting to Work on APIs Across Federal Agencies</h3>
<p>I could spend months profiling the APIs that exist across the agencies profiled above. I could spend 1000x that amount of time turning the data resources available across these federal agencies into APIs. I have begun setting up workspaces for the agencies who had Swagger and OpenAPI available, while also allowing me to begin reverse engineering some of the easier APIs using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo">Postman Interceptor</a> -- helping me create collections and OpenAPIs just by using an API. I will be spending time each week working within the public workspace fore each of the federal agencies and begin setting up new workspaces for some of the other agencies. I finally have the time, resources, and the platform to begin making a dent in this work. Historically I have been profiling APIs for federal agencies, but it was more just about bookmarking whatever I have found and organizing them into lists. Now, with Postman public workspaces I can conduct this work out in the open while also potentially sharing the load with the community, while getting more precise in how I define and map out each of the APIs using the Postman platform.</p>
<p>GitHub has made a massive impact on the federal government over the last decade and I am confident that Postman public workspaces are going to take the API conversation across federal agencies to similar levels. I can keep mapping out the APIs that exist, which is something I will keep doing, but I also want to provide resources to help the people doing the hard-work behind these APIs and datasets understand the benefits of publishing consistent, simple, and usable APIs by default. There is too much work out there for use to do after the fact, or from the outside-in. Ultimately we need the stewards of all of this valuable information to be API literate, understanding what is possible when we are publishing APIs in a consistent way, and help them get beyond talking about it, and actually doing it. It is extremely important that federal agencies not just do APIs across the board, but also be there to lead conversations. Similar to what we are seeing with the <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/workspace/fast-healthcare-interoperability-resources-fhir/overview">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</a>. While there is still a huge amount of work to be done here, the API specification is finally seeing the type of industry wide adoption needed to make an impact on the healthcare space. We need to begin doing this for every other industry, helping stabilize and standardize the API conversation across all of the top business sectors. The most important investment our federal government can make in the next administration is to invest in API education and training across the board, taking the lead when it comes to the valuable resources our economy need to stay ahead of the curve.&nbsp;</p>\n
