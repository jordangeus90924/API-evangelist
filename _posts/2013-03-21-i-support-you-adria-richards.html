<p>Way to go brogrammers. &nbsp;You made sure a bright light in evangelism was partially dimmed tday. &nbsp;Really? With all the shaming that goes on targeted at women, you don't have balls to take a little shaming when you arer being a sexist pig? &nbsp; C'mon...ummm have some balls?
<p>As I've <a href="http://kinlane.com/2012/12/30/sexism-in-the-tech-space/">said it before, us guys are going to have to eat shit with a side of humble pie for many years</a> to come to balance this whole sexism thing out. &nbsp;Let's own it.
<p>All it would have taken is a humble apology from those gentleman in response to the Tweet, then some healthy discussion about why what they said was wrong, and move on kids. &nbsp;
<p>I sure hope the hacker news crowd steps up and defends every woman that is shamed by guys now, as they seem to be a defender of this now. So if you Tweet out shaming a woman in a career changing way, know hacker news will be all over you...right? &nbsp;Right?
<p>I just want to make sure you know I support you Adria. You are not unemployed, you've been promoted to new levels of evangelism. Let me know how I can help.
