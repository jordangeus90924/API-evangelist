{% include JB/setup %}<p>Back in May, when the White House CIO has released a strategy, entitled Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People, which directs all federal agencies to publish HTML, JSON and XML versions of their digital strategy, I wrote a PHP script to monitor the progress.  To date, 25 federal agencies have successfully published their digital strategy, and I have been updating my script regularly to keep up.And while a few of the agencies still have querks with their HTTP Codes and with JSON formatting, the code is starting to stabilize. So I decided to start sharing it on Github, allowing others to put it to use.The first sample script Im publishing is a basic example of how to pull the JSON version of a single agencies digital strategy.</p>
