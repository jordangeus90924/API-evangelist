{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of the best ways to explain what APIs are to someone sitting next to me on the plane is to find something the user does every day, that is driven by an API, and explain how an API drives the functionality they take for granted.I tend to look for industry specific examples if they are an accountant or stock broker, but the most common example I use, is Facebook.Facebook is technology everyone I meet has exposure with.My story always starts with Facebook.com, and how the social networking website was built for people.</p>
