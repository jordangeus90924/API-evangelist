{% include JB/setup %}<p>At TechCrunch DISRUPT, this week in San Francisco, the Weather Underground launched a new Weather API platform that provides developers with real-time access to in-depth weather data.The Weather Underground Weather API provides access to data from more than 19,000 users contributing local observations from personal weather stations, providing up-to-the-minute weather conditions for the most finely targeted areas.The Weather API is RESTful with responses available in a JSON format, with access free for developers making 500 requests per day, and paid tiers for requests starting at 5K requests per month up to 1M requests per month.Weather Underground already distributes its weather data to many of the worldâ€™s leading media companies, weather applications and smaller web properties, said Alan Steremberg, President and co-Founder of Weather Underground.Our new self-service API platform will open up our data to thousands more developers working on web and mobile programs, big and small.</p>
