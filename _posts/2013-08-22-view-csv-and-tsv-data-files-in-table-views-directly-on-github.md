Github is really doing some cool stuff to help open data folks manage and share their data.

They just launched the ability to [render data from .csv (comma-separated) and .tsv (tab-separated) files as an interactive table][1], including headers and row numbering. They even let you link to a specific row for sharing specific data from the file.

As I'm working on opening up government data, I'm pushing for agencies to use Github when publishing and sharing CSV, TSV, XML and JSON files. These kind of features really go a long way in helping me achieve my goals.

Make sure and also check out what Github has done around [3D models][2] and [geographic data][3], pretty cool stuff.
