        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/twoodwar"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tom-woodward.jpeg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am regularly reminded of the wide spectrum of what API means to any single person. What is API, and what APIs enable, are all in the eye of the beholder, with only a handful of common aspects shared by any single group of people. This is one of the things that make it very difficult to answer the common newcomer question of where they should start with APIs. This is what makes it so difficult for APIs to ever rise to the expectations of leading architects, and API visionaries.</p>
<p>For me, APIs are about enabling API providers to open up access to their resources, and empower API consumes to get at the resources they need to be successful in their every day worlds. Some folks out there enjoy regularly reminding me that APIs are not for everyone, and they should only be used by a handful of sanctioned tech practitioners, to facilitate the technical, business, and political / ideological motivations of these per-ordained--my dreams of enablement and empowerment are nice, but they are just not reality.</p>
<p>I've heard this from day one of API Evangelist in 2010, and I'm sure I will hear it for some time to come. Some days these currents are strong, and get me down, but other days there are the small rays of light, that keep me hopeful (enough) to keep on, keep'n on. One of these rays of light in my world currently is watching my friend Tom Woodward (<a href="https://twitter.com/twoodwar">@twoodwar</a>) work through his world, after <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/university-api-workshop/">the university API workshop I did in North Carolna</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://bionicteaching.com/first-steps-in-the-personal-api/">Tom has been working through his own thoughts on what a personal API means to him, via his blog</a>. Something that has seriously turned him on to the potential of APIs:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/glassbeed">@glassbeed</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw">@dajbelshaw</a> which to me is a neat idea- the common &amp; structured is what allows for the unique/personal cc <a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a></p>
&mdash; Tom Woodward (@twoodwar) <a href="https://twitter.com/twoodwar/status/718098759511629824">April 7, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>To the folks I talk about above, who simply see APIs as a tool of the API architect, developers, and IT across startups and the enterprise, will not understand what I am talking about. One person using APIs? They see no opportunity. This will always be dismissed as an anomaly. This isn't how APIs are done, this isn't how technology happens. For me, this is API. This is how APIs will enable and empower, and help individuals be more successful in the companies they work at, the small businesses they run, and across their professional existence--what Tom is doing, is API in my book.</p>
<p>This post is just a reminder to me, to not dwell on the people who see APIs as the pipes in which all our digital resources flow, but are pipes that SHOULD NOT be visible to everyone, allowing only the sanctioned class of API elite, developers, startup and enterprise to understand. This vision of API, which is quickly spreading as one popular view, as Silicon Valley continues its shift in focus towards selling to the enterprise, is not a future of APIs that I will accept, anymore than Facebook being the future of the web (OMG, have you seen the amazing things they are doing in Africa, with those poor people -- ack).</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong here, I am just reminded that there are some very differing views of what APIs are, born out of some very different motivations which I do not share. There are many, many reasons why we need APIs, resulting is some very different concepts around what an API is, and what an API can do. I just need to regularly renew my faith in what APIs are all about, &nbsp;and Tom's journey is giving me one chance to do so.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-slack-platform-roadmap-34067b054177#.xjov5i5um"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/slack-platform-road-map.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Many of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">core areas of my API research</a>, and the common building blocks of the API life cycle that I talk about regularly, often seem trivial to the technically inclined, or the purely business focused segments of my audience. To many, having a road map might be a thing you have when developing and deploying an API, but really doesn't matter if you share publicly. I'd say, with technical folks they often don't even think of it, with the more business focused individuals often deliberately choose not to, seeing it as giving away too much information to your competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-slack-platform-roadmap-34067b054177#.xjov5i5um">I think Slack nails the reason why you want to open up and share your API road map</a>. I can talk about this kind of stuff until I'm blue in the face, but people just don't listen -- they need leadership like Slack brings to the table. In their post today, they open with:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We know that being a developer is hard, and building on a platform is not a decision to be made lightly. Many platforms have burned developers and we frequently see that risk highlighted. This is our response.</em></p>
<p>They nail the the (often elusive) promise of the API ecosystem:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>An ecosystem, a real platform, is shared. We are growing fast, but no one company alone could grow fast enough to meet the amount of potential in front of us. We are working hard, but no one team can work hard enough to meet the demand that lies before us all. Instead, we are building a platform where this potential, this demand, is shared. As we grow, developers are able to succeed with us; sharing our customers and joining us in changing the way people do work. In turn, our customers are delighted, new customers have even more reason to use Slack, and the cycle continues.</em></p>
<p>They nail the reality of the API ecosystem, and how it is a shared experience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>An ecosystem in its healthiest form creates a virtuous cycle. Platforms do fail. We&rsquo;ll make mistakes, but we&rsquo;re building for something much greater. We are building for a future where Slack is dwarfed by the aggregate value of the companies built on top of it. This is our success as a platformâ&mdash;âwhen the value of the businesses built on top of us is, in sum, larger than we can ever be.</span></p>
<p>They connect the reality of an ecosystem with <a href="http://road-map.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">having a public road map</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So, today we&rsquo;re sharing our&nbsp;<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow" href="https://trello.com/b/ZnTQyumQ/slack-platform-roadmap">platform product roadmap</a>. It is a small step in equipping you to claim this opportunity with us. There are three major platform product themes to highlight: app discovery, interactivity and developer experienceâ&mdash;âyou can&nbsp;<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow" href="https://trello.com/c/LqzgzTJq/20-welcome-to-the-slack-platform-roadmap-read-more-here">see more on this card.</a></em></p>
<p>Slack doesn't stop there, and throw in having a idea showcase to help as well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We&rsquo;re also sharing what we&rsquo;re calling an&nbsp;<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow" href="https://trello.com/b/HPpcIqd8/slack-app-ideaboard"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Ideaboard</em></a> &mdash;âa list of useful ideas that could be built into Slack apps per conversations we&rsquo;ve had with our customers. [...]&nbsp;The goal of the Ideaboard is to continue this momentum by creating a bridge between our developer community and our customers&rsquo; needs.</em></p>
<p>As Slack mentions, this won't be perfect. They don't have all the answers. A public road map and idea board &nbsp;might not ultimately make or break Slack as a platform, or ensure the community continues to evolve as a full blown ecosystem. Shit can go wrong at any point, but having a public road map, and active, truly contributing idea board, will go a long way to contributing to positive outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you aren't allowing input from your API community into your road map, truly considering this input as you craft your road map, and then share the resulting plan with your community, how can you ever expect them to stay in sync? It doesn't mean that Slack will listen to everything, and every developers opinion will be included in the road map. It will however, put Slack into a more open state of mind, and go a long way to set the right tone in the API ecosystem, building trust with the individuals and business who are building on their platform.</p>
<p>What tone has been set in the community around the APIs you provide? What is the tone in the communities you exist in as an API consumer?&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-manage-operations.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is pretty easy to design, define, and deploy APIs these days, and I get a number of folks who approach me with questions about how to get going with the operations and management side of things. While each company, and API provider, will have different needs, I have a general list of the common building blocks used by the leading API providers I track on across the API sector.</p>
<p>So that I have an up to date URL to share with a couple of my partners in crime, I wanted to organize some of the common building blocks across <a href="http://apievangelist.com">my almost 50 areas of API research</a>, into a single list, that can be considered when anyone is planning on deploying an API. For this guide, I wanted to touch on some of the building blocks you should consider as part of your central API developer portal, documentation, and other elements of the management and operations, what I feel should be a minimum viable presence for successful API providers.</p>
<p><strong>Taking API Inventory</strong><br />Taking inventory of what web services, and APIs may already exist, be in use, or are available within an organization, providing a master catalog of current resources, that can be put to use, and evolved.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal APIs -&nbsp;</strong>What existing APIs are in operation and use by internal groups?</li>
<li><strong>Public APIs -&nbsp;</strong>What public APIs are currently available for use?</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>On Boarding</strong></span><br />What is the process for on-boarding of new users? Walk through what a new user will experience, looking at each step from landing on home page, to having what I need to make my own API call. Reduce as much friction as I can, and making on-boarding as fast as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portal -&nbsp;</strong>Is the portal publicly available, or just a centrally portal on a private network?</li>
<li><strong>Getting Started -&nbsp;</strong>Does this API have a getting started guide applied to its operations?</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration &nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Is this API available for self-service registration?</li>
<li><strong>Sign Up Email -&nbsp;</strong>Do API consumers receive an email upon signup for an account?</li>
<li><strong>Best Practices -&nbsp;</strong>Does this API have a best practices page applied to its operations?</li>
<li><strong>FAQ -&nbsp;</strong>Does this API have a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page applied to its operations?</li>
<li><strong>Google Authentication -&nbsp;</strong>Is Google Authentication available for platform signup and login?</li>
<li><strong>Github Authentication -&nbsp;</strong>Is Github Authentication available for platform signup and login?</li>
<li><strong>Facebook Authentication -&nbsp;</strong>Is Facebook Authentication available for platform signup and login?</li>
</ul>
<p>The on-boarding experience has to have a little friction as possible, and feel like what API consumers are already used to when they are putting other leading API platforms to use. Do not re-invent the wheel, or introduce obstacles into the API on-boarding process.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation<br /></strong>What is provided when it comes to documentation for the platform? There are a number of proven building blocks available when it comes to API documentation, providing the technical details of what an API can do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List of Endpoints -&nbsp;</strong>Is there simple list of endpoints available?</li>
<li><strong>Static Documentation</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Is there documentation for the API?</li>
<li>Is Slate used for API documentation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Is there interactive documentation or a console available?</li>
<li>Is <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a> used for API documentation?</li>
<li>Is <a href="https://github.com/lucybot/lucy-console">Lucybot Console</a> used for API documentation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Error Response Codes -&nbsp;</strong>Are error response codes and detail documented anywhere?</li>
<li><strong>Crowd Sourced Updates -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform allow the community to edit, and submit changes to documentation using Github, or other mechanism?</li>
<li><strong>Notifications -&nbsp;</strong>Are there notifications that are sent out as part of any change that is made to documentation?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Language Samples</strong><br />Are there small, simple usable samples in a variety of programming languages, and potentially for a variety of platforms, demonstrating each API call available via a platform.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PHP -&nbsp;</strong>Is there PHP samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Python -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Python samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Ruby -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Ruby samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Node.js -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Node.js samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>C Sharp -&nbsp;</strong>Is there C Sharp samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Java -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Java samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Go -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Go samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Scala -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Scala samples for each endpoint?</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally samples will have minimal authentication elements, and reduce any external dependencies, focusing in on a specific API endpoint call, in a particular programming language.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Language SDKs</strong><br />What SDKs are available? These SDKs might be hand crafted, or auto generated, but should be available in a variety of languages, encouraging the jumpstarting of integrations by a wide as possible audience.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PHP -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a PHP SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Python -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Python SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Ruby -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Ruby SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Node.js -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Node.js SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>C Sharp -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a C Sharp SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Java -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Java SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Go -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Go SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Scala -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Scala SDK for the API?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is getting more common for API providers to use an SDK generation service, using the machine readable definitions of APIs as the contract to follow. Even with the overhead of SDK generation, development, and support, they are still widely used to help speed up application and system integration.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mobile Solutions</strong><br />There are many overlaps with mobile in the regular SDK portion of this research, but some providers are publishing more resources specifically dedicated to the support of mobile integrations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a page dedicated to the platforms mobile integration resources?</li>
<li><strong>iOS SDK -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an IOS SDK?</li>
<li><strong>Android SDK -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an Android SDK?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Not all platforms will need to support mobile integrations, but the growing number of APIs being deployed, are deploy to support mobile efforts. There are a number of other considerations, but these three areas represent the minimum viable considerations.</p>
<p><strong>Code Management</strong><br />What resources are available for managing code across the platform. This are focuses on just the services, tooling, and process associated with code management, not always the code itself.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Page -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a page in the portal dedicate to the code available for a platform?</li>
<li><strong>Github -&nbsp;</strong>Is Github used to manage code that is part of API operations?</li>
<li><strong>Application Gallery -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an application gallery available for applications that are built on top of the API?</li>
<li><strong>Open Source -&nbsp;</strong>Are there open source code, and applications available as part of API operations?</li>
<li><strong>Community Supported Libraries -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform accept and list community supported libraries?</li>
</ul>
<p>Github should play a central role in the code management of any modern API platform. Much like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn will play important role in your communication and support efforts, Github is key to the management of code resources at all levels of operations.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Service Support</strong><br />What support services are available 24/7, that developers can take advantage of without requiring the direct assistance of platform operators.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forum -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a forum available that provides self service support options?</li>
<li><strong>Forum RSS -&nbsp;</strong>Does the forum have an RSS feed?</li>
<li><strong>Stack Overflow -&nbsp;</strong>Is Stack Overflow used as part of the support strategy for the platform?</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge base</strong> - What sort of content directory and knowledge base is available to search and browse?</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-service support is always present in the successful API platforms. Like the web, APIs are a 24/7 operations, and if developers cannot get direct support 24/7, there should be a wealth of self-service items available.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Direct Support</strong><br />What support services are available that developers can take advantage of, that involves direct employee attention. Even though APIs should be self-service as makes sense, direct support will always play an important role in setting the tone for the community.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an email for API consumers to receive direct support?</li>
<li><strong>Contact Form -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an contact form for API consumers to receive direct support?</li>
<li><strong>Phone -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a phone number available for API consumers to receive direct support?</li>
<li><strong>Ticket System -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a ticketing system available for API consumers to receive direct support?</li>
<li><strong>Social -&nbsp;</strong>Is community support also offered via existing social network profiles and channels?</li>
<li><strong>Office Hours -&nbsp;</strong>Are office hours available, and posted for API consumers to take advantage of?</li>
<li><strong>Calendar -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a calendar of events for office hours, and other support related events?</li>
<li><strong>Paid Support Plans -&nbsp;</strong>Are there paid support plan options available for the platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are a business, and you have to provide support. Many savvy API consumers will browse the blog, Twitter account, and other support channels looking for the right amount of activity, and assistance present -- if its not there, they'll move on.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Road Map</strong>&nbsp;<br />How are we planning, and communicating updates to the platform? Providing a map of how things have changed across the platform, from versioning of the API itself, to even documentation, and other aspects of platform operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Road Map -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a road map shared with API consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Idea Submission -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers and partners submit ideas for inclusion in the road map?</li>
</ul>
<p>A road map plays a critical role as sort of value or joint where platform provider and platform consumer engage. It pushed the provider to consider ideas from the community, bringing the platform closer in alignment with consumers, and goes long way in building trust with the community.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Platform Status</strong><br />What is currently happening on an API platform, providing a real time heart beat of the current status of API resources. There are a handful of common elements platforms use to stay in tune with their platform operations, while also sharing with the community.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Status Dashboard -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a status dashboard available to API consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Status RSS -&nbsp;</strong>Does the status dashboard have an RSS feed?</li>
<li><strong>Status History -&nbsp;</strong>Is status history archived, and available for review alongside the current status?</li>
</ul>
<p>When done right, platform status shared with the community, can send the important signal on a regular basis, that all is well on a platform. Something that will be echoed across the platform, and social web, eventually reaching others who might eventually be new consumers.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change Log</strong><br />What has already happened with a platform, providing a single archive of all changes made to the platform, for consumers to review at any time, in an easy to find location.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change Log -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a change log available for API consumers to review, to better understand what changes have been made?</li>
<li><strong>RSS Feed -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an RSS feed for the platform change log, allowing users to subscribe to changes as they are made?</li>
<li><strong>Notifications -&nbsp;</strong>Notifications about changes to the road map, and status of overall operations that will impact API consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Emails -&nbsp;</strong>Are email notifications sent to API consumers where there is a change in the roadmap or status of API platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>An active change log is one of the clear signs that a platform is active, and something you can depend on. The record that exists across a platforms road map, status, and change log will help set the tone for an API community. A platform where these elements are missing, or has big gaps in information, or out of sync, are all signs of other wider illnesses that may exist across platform operations.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Communications</strong></span><br />What are the communication elements available as part of the overall feedback loop for an API platform. There should be at least a minimum viable communications present, otherwise it is unlikely anyone will learn that a platform exists.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a blog for API communications?</li>
<li><strong>Blog RSS Feed -&nbsp;</strong>Does the blog have an RSS feed?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Twitter account for API communications?</li>
<li><strong>Email -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a email account for API communications?</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a LinkedIn account for API communications?</li>
<li><strong>Slack -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Slack channel for API communications?</li>
<li><strong>Email Newsletter -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an email newsletter dedicated to API communications?</li>
</ul>
<p>Like support, road map, status, and change logs, an active and informative communication strategy will set the tone of an API community, and build trust amongst consumers. Also providing clear signals of when a platform is healthy, or one that should be avoided.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span><br />What other resources are available for API consumers to take advantage of? Common resources provide a wealth of usually self-service knowledge resources that API consumers can consume on demand, as part of their API integration journey.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Studies -&nbsp;</strong>Are there case studies available showcasing how APIs can be put to use?</li>
<li><strong>How-to Guides -&nbsp;</strong>Are there how to guides assisting consumers in understanding how to integrate with an API?</li>
<li><strong>Webinars -&nbsp;</strong>Are webinars conducted, introducing consumers to platform operations?</li>
<li><strong>Videos -&nbsp;</strong>Are there videos available to assist consumers in understanding what a platform does, and how to integrate with it?</li>
</ul>
<p>API consumers will learn in different ways. Not all will need how to guides, and videos, but many users will prefer. Make sure and provide a wealth of up to date, and informative resources.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Developer Account</strong></span><br />Consumers of an API platform always need an account where they can get access to API authentication, usage reports, and other common elements of API operations. What does the developer account, or area look like, and what resources are available for developers to take advantage of.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developer Dashboard -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a dashboard for API consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Account Settings -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers manage their account settings?</li>
<li><strong>Reset Password -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers reset their passwords to their account?</li>
<li><strong>Application Manager -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers manage the applications setup to integrate with API?</li>
<li><strong>Usage Logs &amp; Analytics -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers access logs and analytics for their API consumption?</li>
<li><strong>Billing History -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers see billing history for their accounts?</li>
<li><strong>Message Center -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a messaging center for API consumers to communicate with the platform, and receive notifications?</li>
<li><strong>Delete Account -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers delete their account?</li>
<li><strong>Service Tier Management -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers change / update the tier of service their account exists in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Like mentioned in on-boarding, make sure the developer account acts, and feels like other modern SaaS, and online accounts. Don't make it difficult for API consumers to manage their profile and account on an API platform. There are a wealth of healthy examples of how to do this right, across the API landscape.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Operations API</strong></span><br />It may seem silly, but what APIs are available for managing API management related elements? API consumers are increasingly needing programmatic control over all aspects of their API accounts, as the number of API used increases. There are a number of API platforms that provide API management APIs, something that is easy to do with modern API management infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Management -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an API for managing users who have access to any API?</li>
<li><strong>Account Management -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an API for managing account level information?</li>
<li><strong>Application Management -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an API for managing applications that have access to any API?</li>
<li><strong>Service Management &nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Is there an API for accessing service level details for available APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, you may be one of multiple APIs that API consumers are using to drive their web, mobile, and device applications, as well as systems integrations. Allow for the automation of all aspects of their accounts, user details, applications, and service management.</p>
<p><span><strong>Internationalization</strong></span><br />When it comes to API operations, what is needed to reach an international audience? There are number of building blocks emerge that are being used by leading platforms to make sure their properly internationalized for a global audience.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language -&nbsp;</strong>Are there multiple language versions of the portal available?</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are a global resources, and are increasingly being deployed to support multiple regions around the world. Even if internationalization is a down the road concern, take a moment to understand how far down the road it is.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;<br />Authentication is central to many other lines of the API life cycle. There are several common elements present in modern API solutions that address authentication.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an authentication overview available?</li>
<li><strong>Basic Auth -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform employ basic authentication for accessing API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Key Access -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform require API keys for accessing API resources?</li>
<li><strong>JSON Web Token -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform require JSON Web Tokens for accessing API resources?</li>
<li><strong>oAuth -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform require OAuth for accessing API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Tester -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an authentication tester available?</li>
<li><strong>Scopes -&nbsp;</strong>If OAuth is employed, is there a page dedicated to sharing OAuth scopes.</li>
<li><strong>Two Factor Authentication -&nbsp;</strong>Is two factor authentication available for the platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>While not the perfect identity and access management stack, there are plenty of proven approaches to handling API authentication. Carefully consider how much authentication is necessary, based upon what resources are made available, and the expectations around API integration. Do not over do authentication when not necessary, but also make sure and don't under invest in this area, as it will bit you in he ass down the road.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Platform Security</strong></span>&nbsp;<br />The details of security an API platform. Since web APIs often use the same infrastructure as websites and applications, some of the approaches to security can be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Practices Page -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a page dedicated to providing an overview, and some times detail of security practices?</li>
<li><strong>Security Contact -&nbsp;</strong>Is a security contact published as part of platform operations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Share as much detail as possible about what is being done to mitigate threats at all layers of your stack. This should be just as much an admission that you know what you are doing, as it is an important details for API consumers around security. When security details are missing from an API platform's presence, I find it is more because this area wasn't considered, more than anything else.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal Department<br /></strong>The lawyers are driving and guiding almost all value being generated, captured, and done via the growing number of online services depend on. &nbsp;Any savvy API consumer will be looking to understand the legal requirements that surround integration, so make sure there are a handful of building blocks present.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -</strong> A terms of service that guides platform operations, and developer integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Policy -</strong> The privacy policy set for how the privacy of all platform stakeholders will be addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing - </strong>What the licensing considerations are for all data, content, server &amp; client code, as well as APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Branding -</strong> The branding requirements, guides, and other assets to be considered as part of company branding.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best API providers have a legal department that is more human than lawyer, speaking plain english over legalize. A simple, comprehensive, and understandable legal department is a sign of a healthy platform, with nothing to hide from its consumers.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Direct Value</strong></span><br />What are the units of currency the platform uses. What are the individual value units applied to each API, and how are things calculated. Most like this is done in dollars, or euros, but other units are emerging as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value -&nbsp;</strong>What is the direct value associated with an API?</li>
<li><strong>Usage -&nbsp;</strong>What direct value does API usage deliver?</li>
<li><strong>Volume -&nbsp;</strong>How does volume usage of an API deliver value?</li>
<li><strong>Limits -&nbsp;</strong>How is value maintained by imposing limitations?</li>
<li><strong>Users -&nbsp;</strong>How does having more users generate value?</li>
<li><strong>Applications -&nbsp;</strong>How does having more application generate value?</li>
<li><strong>Integrations -&nbsp;</strong>How can more integrations with other systems generate value?</li>
</ul>
<p>You would be surprise how many existing API platforms I speak with who cannot answer many of these questions. They feel their APIs are valuable, but cannot articulate the value they bring to their consumers in a coherent way. Understanding the direct value an API generates is something that should be discussed as part of every API deployment, and shared with API consumers, and other key stakeholders in a coherent way.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Indirect Value</strong></span><br />Beyond the obvious, APIs are generating a lot of value for platform providers, and consumers. What are some of the common ways to look at indirect value generation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Vehicle -&nbsp;</strong>How are APIs used as a marketing vehicle for an organization, products or services?</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Generation -&nbsp;</strong>How is an API used for generating traffic to other websites, mobile applications, or devices?</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness -&nbsp;</strong>How is an API used for increasing brand awareness of an organizations, and its products or services?</li>
<li><strong>Data &amp; Content Acquisition -&nbsp;</strong>How does the acquisition of data or content via an API generate value?</li>
<li><strong>Syndication -&nbsp;</strong>How does the API generate value through the syndication of data, content, and other digital resources?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous APIs that restrict any indirect value from occurring through tightening down on other aspects of API operations. It takes a savvy API provider to be in tune with the indirect value generated via an API, and see the big picture of what is possible with an API presence.</p>
<p><span><strong>Planning Access</strong></span><br />These are the key elements of API plans that I have gathered from across hundreds of API providers. These elements can be associated with specific plans that are available, but they do not have to, and I often use them to generally describe the plans, or perceived plans behind API operations. These are the elements you should be considering as part of your own plans. You do not have to use all of them, but hopefully they will help you better understand the possibilities when it comes to API planning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a page dedicated to providing of all the plans available via the API platform?</li>
<li><strong>Private -&nbsp;</strong>Are there private APIs available via the platform?</li>
<li><strong>Internal -&nbsp;</strong>Are APIs available via the platform used internally?</li>
<li><strong>Partner -&nbsp;</strong>Are APIs available via the platform used by partners?</li>
<li><strong>Public -&nbsp;</strong>Are APIs available via the platform availably publicly?</li>
<li><strong>Free -&nbsp;</strong>Are there free API access via the platform?</li>
<li><strong>Commercial -&nbsp;</strong>Is there commercial usage of API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Non-Commercial -&nbsp;</strong>Is there non-commercial usage of API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Educational -&nbsp;</strong>Is there educational access to API resources?</li>
</ul>
<p>Using HTTP as the transport for your API does not mean it is a public API by default, but there are a number of technical, business, and political elements to be considered when planning the internal, partner, and public access to API resources. Have a plan, share the plan, and use it to guide platform discussions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Platform Metrics</strong></span><br />Beyond the overall access considerations, what are the specific metrics that are being applied to overall API operations, as well as individual plans and access tiers. Depending on the resource, there are a number of metrics being used across the API space, by leading API providers. This layer of the journey is meant to walk through the metrics you will want to consider in your API journey, allowing to cherry pick the ones that are most import to you. Not all metrics apply in all situations, but they are the building blocks of good API plans.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access -&nbsp;</strong>Is access (or not access) used as a metric in monetization, or can you buy access to some API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Calls -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans metered by individual API call?</li>
<li><strong>Transaction -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans measured by overall transactions completed?</li>
<li><strong>Message -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans measured by number of messages sent?</li>
<li><strong>Compute -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans metered by the amount of compute resources available?</li>
<li><strong>Storage -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans metered by the amount of storage used?</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans metered by the amount of bandwidth used?</li>
</ul>
<p>Metrics are often rooted in what the hard costs are with deploying, managing, and operating an API. Once they are well defined, and you get more in tune with platform operations, and what value is being generated, and what operational costs are, you will begin to see things in new ways. Think about what Amazon Web Services has done with APIs, pushing the concept of how we measure the access of valuable digital resources.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Platform Limitations</strong></span><br />What are limitations and constraints applied as part of the API planning operations. How are these crafted, applied, and reported upon. All APIs will have limitations. Even with wealth of scalable tooling we available today, there are still a handful of areas where limitations are being applied to keep platforms healthy and stable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a page dedicated to helping understand API limits in place?</li>
<li><strong>Range -&nbsp;</strong>Are API rate limits based upon limits of metrics applied to API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Resources -&nbsp;</strong>Are API rate limits applied to individual API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Unlimited -&nbsp;</strong>Are there places where there are no limits applied?</li>
<li><strong>Increased -&nbsp;</strong>Can rate limits be increased?</li>
<li><strong>Inline -&nbsp;</strong>Are API rate limits available inline for each API in the documentation?</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary reasons for setting limitations is to keep API resources available to the entire community, helping ensure stability, and keep operational costs within reasonable realms. However, limitations are also used for business, and political goals, going well beyond the common technical restrictions in place.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Timeframes</strong></span><br />The consumption of API resources is often measured within timeframes, in addition to the wide number of other metrics that can be applied. Having meaningful timeframes defined for evaluating how APIs are consumed, and using as part of overall planning, when it comes to all aspects, ranging from rate limits to billing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seconds -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered in seconds?</li>
<li><strong>Minutes -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered in minutes?</li>
<li><strong>Hourly -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered by the hour?</li>
<li><strong>Daily -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered daily?</li>
<li><strong>Monthly -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered monthly?</li>
<li><strong>Annually -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered annually?</li>
</ul>
<p>At first these seem like they shouldn't be included in the minimum viable presence for API operations, but in reality, these timeframes are core to everything we do. We limit API calls by the second, minute, and hour, and we often clear limitations each day or monthly, as we bill for usage or just allow the amount of consumption we can afford as platform providers.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Partner Program</strong></span><br />The communication around partner levels of access is critical to overall health and balance with other tiers of access. Providing as much detail for partners, but also potentially other levels of access is important. Here are a few of the building blocks employed to help manage partner details.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Landing Page -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a landing page dedicated to the partner program?</li>
<li><strong>Program Details -&nbsp;</strong>Are the program details available via a landing page, as well in a portable, shareable format(s).</li>
<li><strong>Program Requirements -&nbsp;</strong>What are the requirements to be part of the partner program?</li>
<li><strong>Program Levels -&nbsp;</strong>What are all the levels of the partner program, and what are the details?</li>
<li><strong>Application -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a partner program application available for prospects to fill out?</li>
<li><strong>List of Partners - </strong>Will there be a list of partners available for other partners and consumers to view?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Are APIs Found?</strong><br />How APIs are being discovered across the current API landscape. How are APIs being found by developers, and application architects at all stages of development.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Directory -&nbsp;</strong>What API directories are in use?</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json -&nbsp;</strong>Is APIs.json in use to provide meta data indexes for API discovery?</li>
</ul>
<p>This provides one possible base for the average API operations. Granted, not every element here should be implemented by all APIs, but it does provide a healthy checklist that can be considered as part of any APIs life cycle. I'm sharing this so that my partners may consider as part of their own operations, and to use as a draft for a future white paper, that any company can use as a guide in their own API journey.</p>
<p>My goal in assembling this information is to help shape what the portal, and potentially online API presence might be for an API. I also want to provide a nice checklist that anyone can just run down, making sure any important element was not considered. It is easy to miss things, while you are down in the weeds making an API happen. This is why I'm here, to help keep an eye on the bigger picture, and provide you with what you need to be as successful as you can in your own API efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it very tough to provide just enough information to people, without going into areas of the API life cycle that do not apply. This guide is meant to address what is needed as you prepare to launch a new API, but could also be used by API providers, with existing APIs and portal, but are looking to consider what might be next for a road map. <a href="http://apievangelist.com">You can find all of these elements as part of my overall research into the API space</a>, as well as additional areas, and building blocks that didn't quite fit into this particular perspective.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-outreach.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/07/i-have-an-api-now-i-need-some-help-to-identify-what-is-needed-to-manage-my-api-presence/">To augment my last post about when you have an API, but you need some help to identify what is needed to manage your presence</a>, I wanted to talk about some of what you can do once you've established your base API management, operations, and presence--now you need to get the word out, and get people using your APIs. Whether your APIs are intended for a public, partner, or internal group, there are many well established techniques, that are employed by successful API platforms, that you can employ.</p>
<p>When I first sat down to write this guide, I was going to label it simply as API evangelism, but after pulling together the building blocks that I needed from <a href="http://apievangelist.com">across my research</a>, to support a specific point, I shifted to make sure it was more of a week to week guide of things that should be considered. I wanted to share my own list which I use regularly, to help make sure I'm not forgetting any important things, and possibly re-evaluating existing practices to make sure they still relevant.</p>
<p>I wanted this API evangelism, outreach, and maintenance guide to speak to as wide of an audience as possible. To help do this, I wanted to focus on some simple goals, and building blocks that could be employed as part of the day to day, week to week, and month to month of the average API operations--here is what I have so far.</p>
<p><strong>What Are The Goals</strong><br />What are the core goals of the API operation? These need to be precise, measurable, and obtainable goals. While there may be unique ones to your situation, these are some of the common ones I see employed regularly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth in New Users -&nbsp;</strong>Is growth in the number of new users a goal?</li>
<li><strong>Growth in Existing User API Usage -&nbsp;</strong>Is growth in usage by existing users a goal?</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness -&nbsp;</strong>Is increase brand awareness a goal in evangelism?</li>
<li><strong>More Applications -&nbsp;</strong>Is a growth in the number of applications integrated with API a goal?</li>
<li><strong>New System Integrations -&nbsp;</strong>Is a growth in the number of system integrations a goal of evangelism?</li>
<li><strong>Other Goals -&nbsp;</strong>What other goals are there around evangelism of the API?</li>
</ul>
<p>These should be strategic goals established, as well as more short term tactical goals, something that should fluctuate from week to week. Some weeks, outreach at events might be a priority, while others may involve content creation, development of how-to guides, videos, or other resources. Avoid only focusing on the usual goals listed above, and try to set other simple, more relevant goals that you truly can achieve.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outreach &amp; Engagement</strong><br />Reaching out to API consumers is essential, not just to attract them as new users, but after they've registered, and as they are putting to the platform to work. Outreach will look different at various stages of the API life cycle, and may vary between your different groups of consumers, but here are a few areas to look at.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresh Engagement -&nbsp;</strong>How are new developers engaged after they sign up for API access?</li>
<li><strong>Active User Engagement -&nbsp;</strong>What does the process look like to engage existing users and get them more active?</li>
<li><strong>Historical Engagement -&nbsp;</strong>How are inactive users engaged, either to reactivate them, or verify for removal?</li>
<li><strong>Social Engagement -&nbsp;</strong>What is the establish tone of social engagement when it comes to outreach?</li>
</ul>
<p>I've experienced APIs where everything is automated and distant. You receive regular emails, and see the occasional tweet, but there really is nobody home, nobody reaching out and making sure things are good. I'm not talking about sales in this arena, I'm talking about genuine outreach, and engagement to see what API consumers are up to.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blogging &amp; Storytelling</strong><br />How does blogging occur via the platform? What approaches are being used to generate, produce, and syndicate stories, keeping a regular stream of information flowing from the platform. There are some common areas to consider when planning this portion of operations, that can be applied on a regular basis, establishing a regular drumbeat of valuable content coming from the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Projects -&nbsp;</strong>What projects are occurring that can be showcased as part of the API effort?</li>
<li><strong>Stories -&nbsp;</strong>Is storytelling a regular thing that occurs on blog(s)--with dedicated resources?</li>
<li><strong>Syndication -&nbsp;</strong>How will blog posts by syndicated out?</li>
</ul>
<p>Platform communication and support, should be done in a way that gives a personality to an API platform. Be genuine, don't market to consumers. Build things that highlight the value an API delivers, tell the stories of how and why you did it, and make sure and spread the word, doing the hard work to syndicate to the most relevant platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Storytelling Activities</strong><br />Your partners are always looking to get some special attention when it comes to blogging, storytelling, and outreach. &nbsp;What are some of the elements that can be considered when looping in partners into your outreach and engagement efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog Posts -&nbsp;</strong>Are there blog post activity opportunities available to partners?</li>
<li><strong>Press Release -&nbsp;</strong>Are there press release opportunities available to partners?</li>
<li><strong>Facebook Post -&nbsp;</strong>Are there Facebook post activity opportunities available to partners?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Post -&nbsp;</strong>Are there Twitter activity opportunities available to partners?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully you have the right partners on board, letting in the ones that will benefit your existing blogging, storytelling, and outreach efforts. It shouldn't be extra work to include partners in your regular operations, they should fit in nicely, or maybe you should be considering if they are the right fit--having the right partners will make all the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Content Acquisition</strong><br />What kind of content relationships can be established as part of partnership activities. Content generated from existing, successful relationships, can be a big driver in forming new partners, as well as keeping existing ones healthy and happy, feeling like they are getting value from the arrangement as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quotes -&nbsp;</strong>Are quotes from partners being gathered?</li>
<li><strong>Testimonials -&nbsp;</strong>Are testimonials from partners being gathered?</li>
<li><strong>Use of Logo -&nbsp;</strong>Are partners given different usage permissions around logos?</li>
</ul>
<p>Showcasing the right partners, in just the right way, can send the signals you need to potentially new customers, and partners. Make a regular habit of asking partners for quotes, testimonials, and to be able to use their logo. Maybe even make it a default requirement as part of the partner application process.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Landscape Awareness</strong><br />Every API operates within a specific space, and understanding the landscape of the space is very important to the health and effectiveness of evangelism efforts. Because APIs are very technical in nature, it can be easy to keep your head down, operate within a silo, and ignore the world at large. There are some common ways you can tune into the landscape in which you are operating, and better understand the role your API will play.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competition Monitoring -&nbsp;</strong>Who is the competition? What are they up to? How do we compare?</li>
<li><strong>Industry Monitoring -&nbsp;</strong>What industry organizations and resources are available?</li>
<li><strong>Keywords -&nbsp;</strong>What are the top key words and key phrases that apply to this effort?</li>
</ul>
<p>Landscape awareness isn't about the numbers, it is about awareness. It is about knowing what your industry is up to, what matters, and in tune with what the competition is up to. Most importantly, it is about picking up your head, and looking beyond your firewall, and seeing the bigger picture.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion Management</strong><br />Forums play a big role in the self-service, and ecosystem nature of API operations. Forums can be within a platform, as well as on existing public forums. Healthy API communities encourage, and engine in conversation across their platform, and within the communities of others. These are some of the considerations with forums when it comes to evangelism.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forum Conversations -&nbsp;</strong>Are the conversations that occur on forums considered as part of overall evangelism and storytelling?</li>
<li><strong>Forum Posting -&nbsp;</strong>Are stories, and conversations from other channels posted on the forum, to help stimulate conversations?</li>
<li><strong>Stories -&nbsp;</strong>What stories are being told, derived from forum activity, or monitoring?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all API platforms will have their own forum, with some not having one at all, leaning on their social presence, and relying on existing communities like Stack Exchange, and Quora. Even if you don't operate your own dedicated community, participating in other communities, and weaving these experiences into your own planning, storytelling, and outreach is important.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support</strong><br />What role does support play in the overall evangelism workflow. Evangelism and outreach is not just about marketing and sales, with much of the tone of evangelism being set by the overall approach to support (or no approach).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email Coordination -&nbsp;</strong>Are there resources dedicated to email coordination with the platform community, and the public?</li>
<li><strong>Email Needs Tracking -&nbsp;</strong>Are issues, and conversations that occur within email support considered as part of other activities like the roadmap, and blogging?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all individual support scenarios should be shared as part of communication, storytelling, and outreach, but the valuable ones should be generalized, and included in regular outreach materials. When possible, ask your consumers if it is ok to share their situation with others. You never know when it could impact how others will view the platform, and help improve their own situation.</p>
<p><strong>SDK Discovery</strong><br />How are SDKs discovered by developers during development? What are the considerations for making sure existing SDK efforts get found. Are there considerations for API discovery being more about someone looking for an SDK solutions, than someone looking for APIs--here are some common considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List SDK -&nbsp;</strong>A listing of available SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>Search SDK -&nbsp;</strong>A search tool for available SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>Browse SDK -&nbsp;</strong>All the browsing of available SDKs by category or tag.</li>
<li><strong>Rating -&nbsp;</strong>Providing a rating system for SDKs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making sure you tell stories, and provide rich content around API operations is more about SEO, and marketing, with most of the people looking for the solution your API provides, not ever being aware they are looking for an API. Many potential developers will be looking for an SDK that meets their needs, and the fact that it is an API might be a separate consideration--make sure code is discoverable.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>GitHub Management</strong><br />Github plays a central role in many areas of the API life cycle, but the social nature of Github lends itself well to evangelism efforts. When it comes to services I encourage API providers to use, Github is #1. The platform is much more than just code, and the social aspects can significantly benefit platform operations -- here are some of the common aspects of outreach on Github I am seeing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Github Repository -&nbsp;</strong>Are Github repositories used for code, support, content, and other parts of outreach?</li>
<li><strong>Github Relationship -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform engage with other users through issues, wikis, and other social channels available on Github and around repositories?</li>
<li><strong>Github Organization -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Github Organization dedicated to this API effort?</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any other platform you use, your profile should be up to date, but code, wikis, and issue management should be active, and included in all other aspects operations, and projects. Github should touch almost every aspect of API operations, and playing a central role in how you engage with API consumers.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Management<br /></strong>Social media plays a big role in business operations, and is something that is just as critical to API evangelism efforts. As with any other business in operation today, a healthy, active social presence needs to exist. Here are some of the common channels API providers are using social services to engage consumers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LinkedIn -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a LinkedIn user or page associated with API efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter -&nbsp;</strong>Is there one or more Twitter accounts associated with API efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Facebook -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Facebook user or page associated with API efforts?</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not push every social network, in every scenario. Sometimes Facebook makes sense, and sometimes it doesn't. You will know your audience better than I will, but either way it shakes out, make sure and have a healthy, active, and valuable presence on social media to stay connected with your audience.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Bookmarking</strong><br />Beyond just social networks, some social bookmarking sites can also be important to the API evangelism workflow. Here are some of the social bookmarking sites in use today, that you should be considering.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reddit</strong>&nbsp;- Is Reddit use for discovery, and sharing of news and stories?</li>
<li><strong>Hacker News -&nbsp;</strong>Is Hacker News used for discovery, and sharing of news and stories?</li>
<li><strong>Product Hunt -&nbsp;</strong>Is Reddit use for discovery, and sharing of new products, services, and tooling?</li>
</ul>
<p>Like other channels, these bookmarking sites are not just one way channels to share links out. The management of profiles, engagement with other users, and discovery of new sites, applications, APIs, and other interesting elements is a required part of the dance.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable Tools</strong><br />There are some embeddable tooling that are being employed by API providers making content, data, and other resources available across the web. Some embeddable solutions require a separate JavaScript API, but many leverage the fact that APIs use the web, providing some simple approaches to embedding the value APIs generate within websites, web, mobile, and device applications.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Widgets -&nbsp;</strong>Are there widgets available for consumers to embed on websites, that uses the API?</li>
<li><strong>Buttons -&nbsp;</strong>Are there buttons available for consumers to embed on websites, that uses the API?</li>
<li><strong>Badges -&nbsp;</strong>Are there badges available for consumers to embed on websites, that uses the API?</li>
<li><strong>Bookmarklet -&nbsp;</strong>Are there bookmarklets available for consumers to embed on websites, that uses the API?</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about what the Facebook Connect, and Twitter share buttons have done to bring new users, and awareness of these social platforms. Embeddable tooling should always considered as part of API outreach, providing simple, embeddable goodies that anyone can use, allowing the community share the load when it comes to outreach.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reporting</strong><br />How are evangelism activities being reported upon. Reporting isn't just for your bosses and management. Reporting helps everyone involved better understand the day to day, and month to month details, and helps keep efforts organized. What are some of the common approaches to reporting on API evangelism efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activity By Group -&nbsp;</strong>What are the activities going on around evangelism, broken down by group?</li>
<li><strong>New Registrations -&nbsp;</strong>What do new registrations look like?</li>
<li>Number of Applications -&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Volume of Calls -&nbsp;</strong>What does API activity look like in general, but the number of calls?</li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting should reflect your goals for outreach, and day to day operations. Why are we doing this? Are the goals and outcomes lining up? In addition to internal reporting, and sharing among key stakeholders like partners, consider what should also be shared with the API community, and the public at large.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Events &amp; Gatherings</strong><br />Events are the in-person, retail face of any API platform. While much work can be done in an online environment, also make sure you are available at events where API consumers will already be. There are a number of proven types events, that work for API evangelism.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conferences -&nbsp;</strong>What conferences are being attended, spoken at, and sponsored?</li>
<li><strong>Meetups -&nbsp;</strong>What local Meetups are being attended, spoken at, and sponsored?</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons -&nbsp;</strong>What hackathons are being attended, presented, sponsored, or put on?</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be easy to spend a lot of money in this area, in an effort to be everywhere. A successful, in-person API outreach strategy, is always in sync with a robust, active, online presence. &nbsp;Make sure you efforts here are genuine, and in alignment with the other virtual elements discussed here.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Internal Focus</strong><br />Evangelism is not just an external thing. How is the platform being evangelized internally, even for publicly available APIs. Internal evangelism is very important for maintaining trust, and the continuation of the funding necessary to operate. There are some common patterns I've seen to help stimulate internal involvement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong>&nbsp;- What sort of storytelling about platform gets told internally with leaders, and other stakeholders?</li>
<li><strong>Participation -&nbsp;</strong>What sort of participation internally occurs to get people involved in platform operations?</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons</strong> - Similar to the public hackathon movement, internal hackathons are increasingly a thing.</li>
<li><strong>Process Jams </strong>- Instead of gatherings to build applications, some folks are coming together to just improve on the process.</li>
<li><strong>Brown Bag Lunches -</strong> Gathering people together to just talk, can be a powerful thing, helping educate and spread the word.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting -&nbsp;</strong>What kind of reporting happens internally, keeping people in tune with what is going on with the platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the number one reasons I see APIs fail. From a lack of internal engagement. The most successful APIs I've seen enjoy wide support internally, and are owned beyond just a single group. A lack of internal buy-in, the necessary investment and resources that are required for success, will kill the even best planned API.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Are APIs Found?<br /></strong>How APIs are being discovered across the current API landscape. How are APIs being found by developers, and application architects at all stages of development. Are APIs being shared in a way that they will be found by developers, and the people who will need them most.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Directory -&nbsp;</strong>What API directories are in use?</li>
<li><strong>IDE Integration -</strong> Are APIs available in common IDE platforms?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether they are internal, or public, APIs shouldn't be hard to find. They should be browseable, searchable, and available where the consumers will exist. They should be woven into all other areas discussed in this guide, opening up the opportunity for engagement across all aspects of outreach and engagement.</p>
<p><strong>API Definition Formats</strong><br />A machine readable specification is designed to assist in the area of API discovery. This allows APIs, and their supporting operations to be described in a way that can ingested, and indexed by API search engines, and directories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs.json -&nbsp;</strong>Is APIs.json in use to provide meta data indexes for API discovery?</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Spec</strong> - Are API definitions available to understand what APIs do.</li>
</ul>
<p>These formats make APIs discoverable by other systems, and tools, but also open them up for sharing, collaboration, and syndication. Think of these API definitions like little machine readable business cards, that can be left anywhere for potential consumers to find.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Directories</strong><br />Next up, are some API directories that exist publicly, and provide directories that developers can browse, and search for APIs by keywords. There are a handful of examples of available when it comes to relevant API directories you should be considering today.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ProgrammableWeb -&nbsp;</strong>Are internal users aware of ProgrammableWeb, and do they put it to use?</li>
<li><strong>Mashape -&nbsp;</strong>Are internal users aware of Mashape, and do they put it to use?</li>
<li><strong>APIs.guru -&nbsp;</strong>Are the API definitions available in APIs.guru the Wikipedia for APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>This are is meant to serve the public APIs that are embarking on this journey. These are the leading API directories out there, that allow API platforms to list their APIs, and benefit from discovery, and other network effects these platforms bring to the table.</p>
<p><strong>API Search Engines</strong><br />Beyond just API directories, there are also a new breed of API search engines emerging, that allow for API discovery that goes beyond just static API browsing and search. Currently there is just one API search engine.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs.io -&nbsp;</strong>Are all public APIs registered with the APIs.io search engine?</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrasting API directories, API search engines allow you to maintain the control over the index for APIs that are included in their collections. Eventually open API directories will allow for new ways of API discovery, via fast growing channels like via IDE, spreadsheets, messaging, and other platforms where API consumers are already operating.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business Directories</strong><br />Business directories that allow for additional information related to APIs, as well as having APIs themselves, allowing for discovery of APIs from companies who list themselves in these directories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crunchbase -&nbsp;</strong>Is the business and its public APIs documented with Crunchbase?</li>
<li><strong>AngelList -&nbsp;</strong>Is the business and its public APIs documented with AngelList?</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are hot in the startup, and business arena. Many other companies pay attention to these business directories looking for interesting API implementations. A healthy, active presence in these space can help in the evangelism and outreach process, and help you be more aware of some of things going on in the space.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>I have compiled this list from the evangelism efforts I've helped craft in the past, from keeping an eye on the activities of other evangelists, as well as use as list to cherry pick tasks each day, and week, as part of my own API Evangelist network of sites and APIs. When I am looking for something to do, that will help engage my existing audience, as well as bring in new folks--I work from this list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, i'm opting to focus on more on a digital presence for my operations, but only after five years of heavy, on the road evangelism, as well as maintaining the projects, and storytelling that I do regularly. Consumption of my APIs isn't my #1 priority, as this isn't my main way of generating revenue, but in 2016 this will slowly be shifting--in addition to evangelizing the API efforts of others, I will be stepping up the evangelism of my own APIs, further expanding this evangelism, outreach, and maintenance strategy.</p>
<p>Hopefully this guide provides you with some ideas for how you can formalize your own approach to getting the word out about your API. Whether you are evangelizing them publicly, stimulating partner interest, or making them known within internal groups, you should be able to find something here you can get to work on. After five years of beating my own drum in these ways, I can say that some weeks you will have highs, other times you will experience lows, but if you keep doing consistently, in a genuine way, it will pay off.</p>

<p><a href="http://api.report/">I process many press releases to feed the of API.Report beast</a>. The primary reason I do this work each week, is to identify new APIs, being done in interesting business sectors. One common thing I see, is companies that reference their API in their press release, and when I head over to their website -- no API, or information to be found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, I only spend about 30-60 seconds looking for a link to a dedicated API area, but its pretty clear that people either haven't though making it accessible, or are holding their cards close to their chest. I'm sure there are a whole spectrum of reasons why people do this, but it just doesn't make sense for you to talk publicly about your API, while also making it so difficult to learn more--it is not very API-like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm all for companies intelligently approaching how they tailor API efforts, but if its something you are showcasing as a selling point in your PR, you should also be making it easy for us analysts, bloggers, and potential customers to get additional information, without asking for help. If I can't find a dedicated API portal, and easily discover information about what an API does, I won't add it to my queue of research, and stories -- I'm sure this is the case for other tech writers.</p>

<p>As I study the approach of bot, and messaging platform integrations like <a href="https://current.com/">Current</a>, I keep thinking about the potential for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/23/exploring-my-thoughts-around-api-injection-into-messaging-voice-and-other-online-experiences/">API injection</a> at this layer of messaging. In this scenario I am thinking about Slack, and how you <a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/formatting">craft messages</a>, approach <a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/unfurling">the unfurling of links</a>, and <a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments">customize attachments</a>.</p>
<p>I am envisioning a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview">Twitter Cards</a>, but a more open approach, that can help companies deliver nice looking, well designed, and media rich messages that deliver what messaging users are looking for. The service would be cross platform, allowing me to design for Twitter Cards, Slack Messages, or any other messaging platform that finds its 15 minutes of tech fame. With just a little bit of exploration of how to craft a good looking, and functional Slack message, I can see this being a full time job for someone.</p>
<p>When building my own messaging integration or bot solutions is to not vomit up any text, images, or functionality into people's message timeline. I would like to understand how to deliver exactly what they need, in a visually appealing way. Like every other channel I've developed a competency around, I want to understand the best approaches employed by the savviest of the channel operators, and if I can encourage them to offer their solutions as a service, I will. I don't have the time or patience to master every channel (ie. mobile), and will gladly pay for the right service that actually helps me do this right.</p>
<p>If you are working on any simple solutions that touch on helping inject API resources, and craft them into meaningful messages and experiences, via platforms like Slack, let me know. If you aren't, but want to do as startup, get going, send me a beta invite, and I'll make sure you have my address so you can send the royalty checks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has been acceptable for integration platform as a service providers (iPaaS) like IFTT and Zapier to focus on delivering the end-solutions that their consumers have needed, and requiring them to visit your domain to discover and then make the magic happen. While I have always been an advocate for more accessibility, I have to admin that the current "closed" approach <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has</span> brought a number of new people to the world of APIs, as people realize that IFTTT and Zapier are possible because of APIs!</p>
<p>However to me, it is a no-brainer that if you build a business on top of public APIs, you should pay it forward by providing an API, but I understand many of you startups follow a different philosophy than I do. One that is more about trapping, locking up, and owning these activities. You wouldn't want someone building on what you've done via an API, and potentially offering more value than you do!! Kind of like you did. No we wouldn't want to do that. Derp! #SelfishBusiness</p>
<p>As I see it, the altruistic reasons for offering an API if you are an API integration service providers are being pushed aside, for more business centric reasons, that these startups will have to take notice of. If you do not provide API access to your API driven recipes, they will not be available to discover, and execute for the growing number of bot enabled solutions we are seeing emerge. Your really useful iPaaS recipes will not play a role in this new bot driven phase of API consumption, and be left in the ditch of yesterdays tech.</p>
<p>If you are an iPaaS provider, please make your recipes discoverable, and executable via an API. I have long complained that if I can search for recipes via an API, I'm less likely to know it exists. I'm also less likely to embed your meaningful actions into my web site or application, if there is no API for me to drive embeddable tools. I just wanted to also take a moment and point out that your valuable iPaaS solutions will not be part of the bot evolution if you don't also have an API for my bots to discover and execute your valuable integration(s).</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://algorithmia.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/algorithmia-icon.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am spending time talking to more API providers, and API service providers, about the challenges they are facing, while reaching out to potential customers, thanks to the support of my partners <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a>. One of the conversation I had last week was with&nbsp;Diego Oppenheimer (<a href="https://twitter.com/doppenhe">@doppenhe</a>) of Algorithmia (<a href="https://twitter.com/algorithmia">@algorithmia</a>), who shared with me the challenges he faces in getting senior engineers to realize the potential of APIs, and the &nbsp;value API driven platforms like Algorithmia bring to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diego expressed that the biggest thing they face is convincing their engineer, senior dev, and other tech-focused consumers, that Algorithmia isn't just something new they need to add to their existing stack, and that it is more about enabling what is already in place. While some folks will benefit from discovering entirely new algorithmic approaches on Algorithmia's marketplace, the biggest impact will come from the platform's approach to defining, scaling, and stabilizing the algorithms developers and IT folks are already putting to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the content, data, and other resources you are already putting to work, the algorithms in your business life that already have relevance in your operations. I'm constantly working to focus on the fact that APIs are all about making these resources better defined, accessible and more discoverable, but when you also leverage what's being called "serverless" approaches like Algorithmia, you are also making them more scalable, more stable, and usable as well.</p>
<p>Diego said he's always trying to reassure senior tech folks of the fact that they aren't pointing out that they don't have the skills needed to define, deploy, and scale the bits of code (algorithms) that are making all of our worlds go around. It is about employing APIs, the cloud, and making your existing algorithms more agile, flexible, and scalable, augmenting your existing world with tangible benefits--ultimately making you better at what you are already doing.</p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.com/2015/12/03/if-i-cannot-scale-it-on-my-own-or-use-a-service-provider-i-do-not-scale-it">I've talked about this concept before within my own operations</a>. As the API Evangelist I will not scale what I do, unless I can find a service that augments what I already do, justifying an added costs only by truly achieving relevance in my daily operations. Little API driven algorithmic nuggets is how I do this. All you have to do as an APi service provider and enabler, is convince me of the tangible benefit you deliver in my operations, and your products, services, and tooling will naturally become more relevant.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/hello-pinboard-customers-from-linden-tibbets-the-ceo-of-ifttt/">During the latest IFTTT flareup</a>, I realized how much I haven't written about my feelings surrounding API integratio service providers, iPaas, or whatever else you call it. Something that always frustrates me in the future, as I am unable to reference my earlier thoughts with a specific URL. So while I am ranting about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/05/the-api-integration-providers-who-have-api-access-to-actions-will-be-successful-in-bot-environments/">the lack of APIs for these integration platform as a service (iPaaS) provider</a>, let me add to my list of critical elements I feel are missing from the space: Embeddability!</p>
<p>As a user of your service, provide me an API, so I can embed your API recipes into any website, web and mobile application. While the fact that Zapier does have a public API, where IFTTT does not have one at all, the Zapier API doesn't not provide me any access to what API integration recipes (Zaps) are available (ie, core business value). I cannot automatically search for all the Google Spreadsheet integrations. I cannot search for all the Twitter API integrations. Let alone embed the actions enabled by these recipes on any of my website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When preparing any list of meaningful actions you can take with APIs, <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/university-api-workshop/apis/">like I did for my university workshop a couple weeks ago</a>, I have to manually go to Zapier, search for actions, and then craft my own link to the detail page (which isn't public BTW). The response from Zapier to why there is no API for this, each time I ask, is that nobody has ever asked for that? Which is starting to smell more and more like business lock-in to me, in the wake of the IFTTT / Pinboard shitstorm.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/19/button-to-run-this-api-in-the-http-api-client-of-my-choice/">It isn't like the concept of an API driven, embeddable button is anything new</a>. Facebook Share, Twitter Tweet? I just can't buy the fact that nobody has asked for a Run Zapier Zap button? I'm just guessing that folks aren't seeing the embed opportunity, when they are down in the weeds, <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/button-to-run-this-api-in-the-http-api-client-of-m">like with the Run in Postman button</a>&nbsp;was. It just takes time for it to happen, a process I am always looking for ways to expedite. ;-)</p>
<p>Anyways. If you are running an API integration service provider, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay APIs forward by having an API for your platform.</li>
<li>Make all aspects of your service available via API.</li>
<li>Provide embeddable buttons, and linkable hooks at any point in the action.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do this, your service will become more than just a destination for discovering and enabling API driven recipes. With a complete API, your platform can become baked into the API enabled fabric of our web, and mobile world(s). As an API integration platform as a service (iPass) provider, it is your responsibility to pay the API concept forward (hear the laughter of my haterz), and not terminate, and capture all the value generated via APIs. The reasons for this are much more than the altruistic visions you may think I'm speaking of, and touch on real world business advantages that you are missing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ifttt-291.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">Here is the email I received from the CEO of IFTTT, in response to the whole <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/03/my_heroic_and_lazy_stand_against_ifttt/">Pinboard kerfuffle</a>, a few minutes ago. It looks like they've done a little soul searching, and wanted to apologize:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">Hello Pinboard Customers,</span><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">We've made mistakes over the past few days both in communication and judgment. I'd like to apologize for those mistakes and attempt to explain our intentions. I also pledge to do everything we can to keep Pinboard on IFTTT.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">IFTTT gives people confidence that the services they love will work together. There are more services in the world than IFTTT can possibly integrate and maintain alone. We are working on a developer platform that solves this by enabling service owners to build and maintain their integration for the benefit of their customers.</span><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">The vast majority of Channels on IFTTT are now built on that developer platform by the services themselves. We made a mistake in asking Pinboard to migrate without fully explaining the benefits of our developer platform. It's our responsibility to prove that value before asking Pinboard to take ownership of their Channel. We hope to share more on the value of our platform soon.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">I also want to address Pinboard&rsquo;s concerns with our Developer Terms of Service. These terms were specific to our platform while in private beta and were intended to give us the flexibility to evolve our platform in close partnership with early developers. We&rsquo;ve always planned to update and clarify those terms ahead of opening our platform and we are doing so now. We are specifically changing or removing areas around competing with IFTTT, patents, compatibility and content ownership. The language around content ownership is especially confusing, so I'd like to be very clear on this: as a user of IFTTT you own your content.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">I truly appreciate all of your feedback, concerns and patience. Helping services work together is what IFTTT does. We respect and appreciate the open web. This very openness has been instrumental in enabling us to build IFTTT and we fully intend to pay it forward.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">Linden Tibbets</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s2">CEO, IFTTT</span></p>
<p class="p3">I want to believe. I want to believe. However, when you build a company on top of public APIs, and you do not have a public API paying it forward, you do not have ANY transparency around your partner program, and there isn't even a pulic URL for me to reference as part of your apology --- I just can't believe. I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="p3">You have a great idea IFTTT. You ave captured the imagination of the average person when it came to what the API potential is. The problem is you don't have API in your DNA. You just don't understand how APIs can enable partnerships like you enjoyed with Pinboard at one point in time, and you took it for granted once you found success. I've seen many API driven companies make this same mistake.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">Without a public API, a transparent partner program, and a public communication strategy, you won't recover from this.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://openreferral.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/icarol-screenshot.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am working on several very rewarding API efforts lately, but one I'm particularly psyched about is <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a>. I'm working with them to help apply the open API format in a handful of implementations, but to also share some insight on what the platform could be in the future. I have been working to carve out the time for about it, and finally managed to do so this week, resulting in what I am hoping will be some rewarding API work.</p>
<p>As i do, I wanted to explore the project, work to understand all the moving parts, as well as what is needed for the future, using my blog. I am not recommending that Open Referral tackle of all this work right now, I am just trying to pull together a framework to think about some of the short, and long terms areas we can invest in together. I intend to continue working with Greg, and the Open Referral team to help spread the awareness of the open API specification, and help build the community.</p>
<p>Open Referral is all about being an open specification, dedicated to helping humans find services, and even more humans to help other humans to find the services they need--I can't think of a more worthy implementation of an API. In my opinion, this is what APIs are all about -- providing open access to information, while also allowing for commercial activity. To help prime the pump, let's take a look at the specification, and think more about where I can help, when it comes to the Open Referral organization and eventually, the Open Referral platform.</p>
<p><a name="human-services-data-specification"></a></p>
<p><strong>Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</strong></p>
<p>"The Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) defines content that provides the minimum set of data for Information and Referral (I&amp;R) applications as well as specialized service directory applications." &nbsp;Which represents a pretty huge opportunity to help deliver vital information around public services, to those who need them, where they need them, using an open API approach.</p>
<p>Currently there is an existing definition for HSDS available on Github, but I'd like to see the presence of HSDS elevated, showcasing it independently of any single implementation of the API, or the web, and mobile applications that are built on top of it. It is important that new people, who are just learning about HSDS understand that it is a format, and independent of any single instance. Here is a break down of the HSDS presence I'd like to see.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website</strong>&nbsp;- Establish a simple, dedicated website for just the specification.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>&nbsp;- Establish a dedicated Twitter account for the specification.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral">Github Repo</a>&nbsp;</strong>- Can repo be moved under Open Referral Github?           
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definition(s)</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Specification</a></strong>&nbsp;- Establish a representation for HSDS.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>&nbsp;</strong>- Establish a representation for HSDS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Definition(S)</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a></strong>&nbsp;- Establish a set of JSON Schema for HSDS</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/mson">MSON</a></strong>&nbsp;- Establish a set of MSON definitions for HSDS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Partners</strong>&nbsp;- Link to the Open Referral partner network.</li>
<li><strong>Road Map </strong>- What is the road map for the specification?</li>
<li><strong>Change Log </strong>- What is the change log for the specification?</li>
<li><strong>Licensed</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 License</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I want to help make sure HSDS is highly available as an OpenAPI Specification, as well as the API Blueprint format. Both of these formats will enable anyone looking to put HSDS to work, to use the definition as a central reference for their API implementation, that can drive API documentation, code samples, testing, and much more.</p>
<p>I do not know about you, but having an open standard for finding and managing open data about human services, that can be used across cities, regions, and countries, seems like a pretty vital API design pattern--one that could make a significant impact in people's lives. When you are talking about helping folks find food and health services, making sure the disparate systems all speak the language matters, and could be the difference between life and death, or at least just make your life suck a little less.</p>
<p>While Open Referral, and HSDS was born out of Code For America, there is an organization in place, to use as a base for evolving the format, and building a community of implementations around the important specification. I wanted to take some time and organize some of the existing moving parts of the Open Referral organization, while also exporting what elements that I feel be needed to help evolve it into a platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="the-open-referral-organization"></a></p>
<p><strong>The Open Referral Organization</strong><br />As I mentioned, there is an organization already setup to guide the effort, "the Open Referral initiative is developing common formats and open platforms for the sharing of community resource directory data &mdash; i.e., information about the health, human and social services that are available to people in need." -- You can count me in, helping with that. Right up my alley.</p>
<p>Right now Open Referral is a nice website, with some valuable information about where things are today. The "common formats" portion of that vision is in place, but how do help scale Open Referral toward being an open platform, while also enabling others to also deploy their own open platform, in support of their own human services project(s). Some of these projects will be open civic projects by government and non-governmental agencies, while some will be commercial efforts -- both approaches are acceptable when it comes to Open Referral, and HSDS.</p>
<p>Let's explore what is currently available for the Open Referral organization, and what is needed to help evolve it towards being a platform enabler. Here is what I have outlined so far:</p>
<p><strong>Organizational<br /></strong>There is already a basic web presence for the organization, it just needs a little help to look as modern as it possibly can, and assume the lead role in getting folks aware, and involved with Open Referral and HSDS as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openreferral.org/">Website</a>&nbsp;- Having a simple, modern web presence for the Open Referral organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenReferral.org is the tip of the platform, but if we want to increase the reach of the organization, and take the conversation to where people already exist, we'll need to think more multi-channel when it comes to the organizational presence.</p>
<p><strong>Communications<br /></strong>There is already a great presence in place, an active blog, Twitter, and Google Group. Based upon the approach of other open formats, and software efforts, there are a number of other platforms we should be looking to spread the Open Referral presence to.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Open_Referral">Twitter</a>&nbsp;- Managing an active, human presence on Twitter.</li>
<li>LinkedIn&nbsp;- Managing an active, human presence on LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Facebook&nbsp;- Managing an active, human presence on Facebook.</li>
<li><a href="https://openreferral.org/category/blog/">Blog</a>- Having an active, informative, blog available.</li>
<li><a href="https://openreferral.org/feed/">Blog RSS</a>&nbsp;- Providing a machine readable feed from blog.</li>
<li>Medium - Publishing regularly to Medium as well as blog.</li>
<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openreferral">Google Group</a>&nbsp;- Maintaining community and discussion on Google Groups.</li>
<li>Newsletter - Provide a dedicated partner newsletter.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far we are just talking about marketing, and social media basics for any organization. We will need to make sure the overall organizational presence for Open Referral dovetails seamlessly with the more technical side of things, establishing a very non-developer friendly, yet still a little more technical, developer, and IT focused audience.</p>
<p><a name="open-referral-developer-portal"></a></p>
<p><strong>Open Referral Developer Portal<br /></strong>I suggest following the lead of other successful open standard, and software efforts, and establish a dedicated portal for the platform at&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.openreferral.org">http://developer.openreferral.org</a>. This central portal will not provide access to a working implementation of the API, but focus instead on the community resources it will take to help ensure the widespread adoption of HSDS.</p>
<p>Right now, there is only the Ohana API, and supporting client tools that have been developer by Code for America. This is a great start, but Open Referral needs to evolve, making sure there are a wealth of language and platform formats available for supporting any implementation. I went to town thinking through what is possible with the Open Referral developer portal, based upon other open API, specification, and software platforms I have studied. Not everything here is required to get started, with a minimum viable developer portal, but provides some food for thought around what could be.</p>

<p>The Open Referral developer portal really is just a project website which organizes links, and meta information about any valuable code that is developed, that uses HSDS as its core. The ultimate goal is to provide a rich marketplace of server, client-side, platform, and language resources that can be applied anywhere. Some of it will be officially platform support, while other will be partner and Open Referral community supported. The central portal is purely to help organize all the valuable resources that are generated from the community, and easy to find by the community.</p>
<p><a href="/admin/blog/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ohana-api.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a name="open-referral-demo-portal"></a></p>
<p><strong>Open Referral Demo Portal<br /></strong>I'd like to see a dedicated demo portal for the platform available at&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.openreferral.org">http://demo.openreferral.org</a>, which can be forked and launched as a new project if necessary. Maybe there can be multiple demo portals available, meant for different languages and platforms? I'd like to see a forkable, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript version available, that can be used as a base, with some of the more dynamic aspects done in specific languages, or via specific platforms.</p>
<p>I have assembled this outline, based upon the portal presence of leading API platforms like Twitter, Twilio, and Stripe. As with every other area, not all these elements will be in the first iteration of the Open Referral demo portal, but we should consider what the essentials should be in a minimum viable definition for an Open Referral demo portal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This base portal design will act as a demo implementation, with an actual functional API operating behind it. It could also be potentially forked, and used in other Open Referral API implementations, as a forkable base, that can be customized, and built on for each individual deployment. Github, using Github Pages, along with Jekyll pages allows for the easy design, development, and then forkability of an open portal blueprint. I'd like to see all the project sites that support the Open Referral effort operate in this similar fashion, which isn't unique to Github, and can run on Amazon S3, Dropbox, and almost any other hosting environment.</p>
<p><a name="partner-program"></a></p>
<p><strong>Partner Program<br /></strong>One of the strengths of the Open Referral organization, and is essential to evolve into a platform is the availability of a formal partner program to help manage a variety of different partners who will be contributing in different ways. I suggest operating a site dedicated to the Open Referral partner program, located at the sub domain&nbsp;<a href="http://partner.openreferral.org">http://partner.openreferral.org</a>. This provides a clear location to visit to see who is helping building out the Open Referral platform, and get involved when it makes sense.</p>

<p>Formalizing the partner program for Open Referral will help in organizing for operation, but also provide a public face to the program, lending credibility to the platform, as well as to its trusted partners. Not all partnerships need to be publicized, but it will lend some potential exposure to those that want. Not every detail of Open Referral partnerships needs to be present, but operating in the open, being as transparent as possible will help build trust in a potentinally competitive environment.</p>
<p>There will be some HSDS API implementations, as well as potentially web or mobile applications that are developed by Open Referral, with some developed and operated by partners. Whenever possible, being transparent about this will help build trust, and reduce speculation around the organizational mission. Formalizing the approach to platform partnerships, that help set a positive tone for the community, and go from just site, to community, to a true platform.</p>
<p><a name="service-needs"></a></p>
<p><strong>Service Needs<br /></strong>I wanted to explore some of the services that will be needed in support of the Open Referral format specification, open source software development, as well as specific implementations. Not all of these services will be executed by Open Referral, with partners being leveraged at every turn, but it will also be important for Open Referral to develop internally capacity to support all areas, and as many types of implementations as possible. This internal capacity will be necessary to help move the specification forward in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Here are some of the main areas I identified that would be be needed to help support core API implementations, as well as some of the web and mobile applications implementations that will use HSDS.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server Side</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>&nbsp;- The deployment of existing or custom server implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting</strong>&nbsp;- Hosting and maintenance of server implementations for customers.</li>
<li><strong>Operation</strong>&nbsp;- The overseeing of day to day operations for any single implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Services</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong>&nbsp;- The coordination, access, and overall acquisition of data from existing systems.</li>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong>&nbsp;- The process of normalization of data as part of other data service.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>&nbsp;- The deployment of a database in support of implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting</strong>&nbsp;- The hosting of database, APIs, and applications in the support of implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Backup</strong>&nbsp;- The backing up of data, and API, or application as part of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Migration</strong>&nbsp;- The migration of an existing implementation to another location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Development</strong>&nbsp;- The development of an application that uses an Open Referral API implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting</strong>&nbsp;- The hosting of a web or mobile application that uses an Open Referral API implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- The management of an existing web or mobile application that&nbsp;uses an Open Referral API implementation.</li>
<li><strong>UI / UX -</strong>&nbsp;There will be the need to create graphics, user interface, and drive usability of end-user applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Developer Portal</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>&nbsp;- The demo portal can be used as base, and template for portal deployment services.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- Handling the day to day operations of a developer portal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DNS</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Registration</strong>&nbsp;- Registering for the domains used as part of implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- Running the day to day management of DNS for implementations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>App Monitoring</strong>&nbsp;- The monitoring of apps that are deployed.</li>
<li><strong>API Monitoring&nbsp;</strong>- The monitoring of APIs that are deployed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>API&nbsp;</strong>- Initial, and regular evaluation of the security of the API.</li>
<li><strong>Application&nbsp;</strong>- Initial, and regular evaluation of the security of applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In some of these areas I want to offer API Evangelist assistance as a partner, while in others I will be looking for partners to step up. I will also be looking at what cloud services, or open source software can assist in augmenting needs in these service areas. These are all areas that Open Referral will not be able to ignore, with many projects needing a variety of assistance in any number of these areas. Ideally Open Referral develops enough internal capacity to play a role in as many implementations as possible, even if it is just part of the platform storytelling, or support process.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers<br /></strong>What service providers will be used as part of operations? Throughout this project exploration I've mentioned the usage of Github, a potentially free, and paid solution to multiple service areas. I've listed some of the other common service providers I recommend as part of my API research, and would be using to help deliver some of my contributions to the platform, and specific projects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Github</strong>&nbsp;- Github is used for managing code, content, and project sites.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong>&nbsp;- AWS is used as part of database, hosting, and storage.</li>
<li><strong>CloudFlare</strong>&nbsp;- Used for DNS services, and DNS level security.</li>
<li><strong>Postman</strong>&nbsp;- Applied as part of on boarding, testing, and integrating with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>3Scale</strong>&nbsp;- A service that can be used as part of the API management.</li>
<li><strong>API Science&nbsp;</strong>- A service that can be used as part of API monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>APIMATIC</strong>&nbsp;- A service that can be used to generate SDKs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a well balanced approach I recommend that Open Referral strike a balance in the number of services it uses to operate the platform, and what it suggests for partners, and specific implementations. If possible, it would be nice to have one or more cloud services identified, as well as some potentially open source tooling that might be able to help deliver in the specific area.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Tooling<br /></strong>What tools will be used as part of operations? Complementing the services showcased above, let's explore some of the open source tooling that will be used as part of Open Referral platform operations. This should be a growing list, hopefully outweighing the number of cloud services listed above, providing low cost options to tackle much of what is needed to stand up, and operate an Open Referral, HSDS driven solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swagger UI</strong>&nbsp;- An open source, interactive JavaScript UI for OpenAPI Spec.</li>
<li><strong>Slate</strong>&nbsp;- A static, presentation friendly version of API documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Jekyll</strong>&nbsp;- An open source content management systems used for project sites.</li>
<li><strong>D3.js</strong>&nbsp;- An open visualization toolkit, to build interactive solutions using JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have only gotten started here. There are no doubt other open tools already in use, as well as some we should be targeting. What are these, what will they be used for, and do their licensing and support reflect the Open Referral mission. Each of these solutions should be forked, and maintained alongside other organizational developed or managed software.</p>
<p><strong>Open Definitions<br /></strong>HSDS is an open definition, built on the back of, and supporting other existing open definition formats. Let's showcase this heart of what Open Referral, and HSDS is, by providing an update to date list of all open definition formats, and standards in use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Spec -</strong>&nbsp;An open source, JSON API definition format for describing web APIs.</li>
<li><strong>APIBlueprint&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>An open source, Markdown API definition format for describing web APIs.</li>
<li><strong>MSON</strong>&nbsp;- An open source, markdown data schema format.</li>
<li><strong>JSON Schema&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>An open source, JSON data schema format.</li>
<li>The Alliance of Information and Referral Systems<a href="http://www.airs.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3363">&nbsp;XSD</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://www.airs.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3386">&nbsp;211 Taxonomy</a></li>
<li><strong>Schema.org</strong>&nbsp;- Civic Services Schema (<a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/CivicServices">at the W3C</a>)</li>
<li>The National Information Exchange Model - via<a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/initiatives-priorities/interoperability">&nbsp;the National Human Services Information Architecture</a>&nbsp;- logic model<a href="http://https//raw.github.com/hserv/open-human-services/master/doc/NHSIA_conceptual_data_model.jpeg">&nbsp;here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open source software, and open definitions are the core of Open Referral. The goal is to provide open formats, APIs, data, and tools that can be easily replicated by cash strapped municipalities, government agencies, and other organizations. However software development, and operation takes money, and resources, so there will be a monetization aspect to Open Referral, which will need to be explored, and planned for.</p>
<p><a name="platform-monetization"></a></p>
<p><strong>Platform Monetization<br /></strong>I wanted to take what I've learned in the API sector, and put towards the evolution of a monetization framework that can applied across the Open Referral platform, down to the individual project level. Most monetization planning will be at the project level, with some of these considerations when it comes to thinking of generating revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong>&nbsp;- What does it cost to get everything together for a project from first email, right before development starts.</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong>&nbsp;- What person hours, and other costs associated with development of a project.</li>
<li><strong>Operations</strong>&nbsp;- What goes into the operation of APIs, portals, and other applications developed as part of integration.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Value</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;- What revenue is generated as part of services.</li>
<li><strong>Grants</strong>&nbsp;- What grants have been received, and being applied to projects.</li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong>&nbsp;- What investments have been made for platform projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Value</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Branding</strong>&nbsp;- What branding opportunities are opened up as part of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Partners</strong>&nbsp;- What partnerships have been established as part of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic</strong>&nbsp;- What traffic to the website, project sites, and other properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>&nbsp;- What internal reporting is needed as part of platform monetization?</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- What reporting is needed to fulfill public needs?</li>
<li><strong>Partners</strong>&nbsp;- What partner reporting is needed as part of the program.</li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong>&nbsp;- What reporting is needed for investors?</li>
<li><strong>Grants</strong>&nbsp;- What grant reporting is required for grants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these areas will be applied to each project, but no doubt will need to be rolled up and reported, and understand across projects, as well as by other areas listed above. Open Referral will not be a profit driven platform, but will be looking to revenue generation to not just develop the open specification further, but also push for the development of open tooling, and other resources.</p>
<p>Monetization strategies applied to Open Referral will heavily drive the plans for API access that are applied to each individual implementation. While not everything will be standard across HSDS supporting implementations, there should be a base set of plans for how partners can operate, and generate their own revenue to support operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/open-referral/pricing-mapbox.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p><a name="platform-api-plans"></a></p>
<p><strong>Platform API Plans<br /></strong>What are the details of API engagement plans offered as part of operations? I wanted to explore the many ways that leading API platforms open up access to their resources, and hand pick the ones that made sense for a minimum set of plans that could be inherited by default, within each implementation. Of course, each potential implementation might be different, but these are some of the essential platform plan considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elements</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- What are the details of public access.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial</strong>- At what point does access become commercial.</li>
<li><strong>Sponsor</strong>&nbsp;- How much access is sponsored by partners?</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong>&nbsp;- Which plans are only available to partners?</li>
<li><strong>Education</strong>&nbsp;- Are there educational and research access?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time Frames</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Seconds</strong>&nbsp;- Resources are restricted by the second.</li>
<li><strong>Daily</strong>&nbsp;- Resources are restricted by the 24 hour period.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly</strong>&nbsp;- Resource access is reported on my monthly timeframe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Metrics</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Calls</strong>&nbsp;- Individual API calls are measured.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- Support time is measured.</li>
<li><strong>Writes</strong>&nbsp;- The ability to write data to platform is measured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Geo</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Country</strong>&nbsp;- In country deployment opportunities are available.</li>
<li><strong>On-Premise&nbsp;</strong>- On-premise options are available for deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Regions</strong>&nbsp;- The deployment in predefined regions are available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Limits</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Range</strong>&nbsp;- API access limitations are available in multiple ranges.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minutes</strong>&nbsp;- Support access is limited in hours</li>
<li><strong>Hours</strong>&nbsp;- Support access is limited in hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong>&nbsp;- There are access limitations applied to specific API paths.</li>
<li><strong>Verbs</strong>&nbsp;- There are access limitations applied to the method / verb level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is ideal that HSDS implementations provide public access to the vital resources being made available, it is not a requirement, and some implementations might severely lock down the public access elements of the platform. Regardless, all of the items listed should be considered, when one to five separate API access plans. The plans should cover hard infrastructure costs like compute, storage, and bandwidth, while also providing other commercialization opportunities that support revenue generation as well.</p>
<p><strong>Resources<br /></strong>These are mostly the resources that currently exist on the public website, but I wanted to also make sure and provide other details about the organization, the team behind the efforts. &nbsp; These are a few other resources that shouldn't be forgotten.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://openreferral.org/faq/">FAQ</a></strong>&nbsp;- Providing an organized list of the frequently asked questions for the platform.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://openreferral.org/about/history/">History</a></strong>&nbsp;- Provide the history necessary to understand the background of the project.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://openreferral.org/about/strategic-overview/">Strategic</a></strong>&nbsp;- What are the strategic objectives of the organization and specification.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://openreferral.org/about/technology-overview/">Technical</a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;- What are the technical details of the organization and specification.</li>
<li><strong>About</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Organization</strong>&nbsp;- Description of the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>&nbsp;- Description of the team involved.</li>
<li><strong>Specification</strong>&nbsp;- Description of the HSDS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can keep adding to this list, but I think this represents a pretty significant v2 presence for Open Referral, as well as the&nbsp;Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) format. This isn't just a suggested proposal. I needed to think about what was needed, and what is next to help support projects on table, and proposals that in the works for specific implementations. I couldn't think about any single project without exploring the big picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://ohanapi.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/icarol-screenshot.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Now I'm going to share this with Greg Bloom, the passionate champion behind Open Referral, and HSDS. I just needed to make sure everything was in my head, in support of our discussion in person tomorrow. We'll be looking to move the needle forward on this vision, in conjunction with the implementations on the table. Exploring the big picture on my blog, is how I put my experience on the table, working through all of its moving parts, and make sure I've covered all the ground I need to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>What Does The Road Map Look Like?</strong><br />Greg and crew are in charge of the road map. I just need to get more intimate with the specification. I have already created a v1 draft, scraped from the Slate documentation for the existing Ohana API implementation, using OpenAPISpec. I have the PDF documentation for an Open Referral partner to convert to a machine readable OpenAPI Spec as well. The process will help me further build awareness around the specification itself. This post has helped me see the 100K view, crafting the OpenAPI Spec will help me dive deep down into the weeds of how to deliver a human services API using the HSDS standard.</p>
<p>Since PHP is my primary language, I'll get to work on a PHP / Slim Framework implementation of HSDS, providing a working prototype. I'll use the Ohana API generated OpenAPI Spec as my guide for the server side API code, the documentation, as well as some client code in both PHP and JavaScript. I'll push forward with some of the aspects of the demo portal implementation above, as well as completing some of the PHP code needed for server, and client side in the process. After all of this, I should have a pretty solid view of the details of what is possible with a human services API.</p>
<p><strong>A Model For Human Services API And Hopefully Other Public API Services</strong><br />I'm pretty stoked with the potential for working on Open Referral, and honored Greg has invited me to participate. This is just a first draft, tailored for what I would like to see considered for Open Referral / HSDS API, and for a couple of immediate implementations. However the model is something I will keep evolving alongside this project, as well as a more generic blueprint for how public service APIs could possibly be implemented.</p>
<p>There are several other API implementations that have come across my desk, which I've felt a model like this should be applied. I was thinking about applying this to the&nbsp;<a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">FAFSA API</a>, to help develop a student aid API community. I also thought it could be applied around the deployment of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/the-next-steps-for-the-the-recreation-information-database-ridb-api/">RIDB API</a>, in support of our national park system. In both of these environments a centralized, common, open API definition, with supporting schema and dictionaries, and a healthy selection of of open source server, and client side web or mobile app implementations, would have gone a long ways.</p>
<p>Anyways, I have what I need in my head so that I can talk with Greg, and coherently discuss what could be next.</p>

<p>I'm engaging in another conversation with a higher education institution about where to start with APIs on campus. A new CIO has assumed a leadership position, and some very forward thinking folks on campus asked me to come visit, talk with IT about APIs, and try to understand where they can get to work with APIs on campus--a perfect opportunity to get to work developing an API culture at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.davidson.edu/">Davidson College</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidsonCollege">As their Twitter profile says</a>, <em>"</em><span><em>Davidson is a highly selective independent liberal arts college committed to access and equal opportunity.</em>" Sounds like a rich environment to get to work empowering students, teachers, and faculty using APIs. Which leaves at the familiar place of being asked by folks on campus, where do we start with APIs?</span></p>
<p>First we need a place to coordinate the getting started with APIs effort at Davidson with:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/low-hanging-fruit/davidson-college">Creating a Github Repo</a> - To help facilitate the discussion, as well as store any code, data, and content that is generated.</li>
<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/">Publish a Github Pages</a> - To help provide a web friendly destination to share content, information, and act as public face.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/low-hanging-fruit/davidson-college/issues">Leverage Issue Management</a> - To help establish an asynchronous communication stream around the initial API effort.</li>
</ol>
<p>Second, let's start mapping out all the moving parts, that will be meaningful to APIs on campus:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/who-are-the-key-stakeholders/">Who Are The Key Stakeholders?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/what-are-the-campus-run-systems-used/">What Are The Campus Run Systems Used?</a></li>

<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/what-is-the-low-hanging-fruit-on-the-public-website/">What Is This Low Hanging Fruit On The Public Website?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone involved, from IT, to students, including myself can use the Github repo, and the pages setup to support each of these areas, can be used to collectively establish a map of where to begin with APIs. Once a map of all these areas begins to come into focus, individual API opportunities will emerge, and become more clear. We are looking for the low hanging fruit when it comes to deploying APIs on campus.</p>
<p>We will use each page of this low hanging fruit project website as a workbench, and we'll use <a href="https://github.com/low-hanging-fruit/davidson-college/issues">the Github Issues management as a communication channel for the work</a>, providing an asynchronous, centrally located place to identify individual micro-projects that can be executed. Hopefully this work will spawn other Github repositories for each individual project, putting them into any Github Organization that makes sense -- <a href="https://github.com/low-hanging-fruit">this one lives in a low hanging fruit organization managed my API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<p>This project is not an official project by Davidson College. The goal is to involve several key individuals on campus to help identify the low hanging fruit, then deploy individual projects within the institutional domain that can be pushed forward by campus IT, faculty, and students.</p>

<p>I always dig it when API stories spin out of control, and I end up down story holes. I'm sure certain people waiting for other work from me do not appreciate it, but these are where some of the best stories in my world come from. As I was writing <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/30/best-buy-will-not-issue-api-keys-to-free-email-accounts-and-wants-to-get-to-know-your-company/">the story about Best Buy limiting access to their API when you have a free email account</a>, which resulted in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/30/i-am-seeing-more-api-platforms-manage-their-blog-presence-using-medium/">the story about Best Buy using Medium for their API platform blog presence</a>, which ended up pushing me to read Medium's terms of service.</p>
<p>Anyways, to help manage the evolution of the terms of service, privacy policy, Medum uses Github to establish a historical record of all the changes to all legal documents that impact platform, and API operations. Seems like a pretty sensible, and default approach to the legal department for any platform. Hosting your legal department on Github, making sure their is as much transparency, and logging across this area of operations will play a central role in establishing and maintaining trust with your partners and consumers.</p>
<p>Maintaining the legal side of your platform operations on Github, taking advantage of the version control build in makes a lot of sense. Something that also opens the door for using Github Issue Management, and the other more social aspects of Github for assisting in the communication of legal changes, as well as facilitate ongoing conversations around changes in real time. I can see eventually working this into some sort of rating system for API providers, a sort of open source regulatory consideration, that is totally opt in by API platforms -- if you give a shit you'll do it, if you don't, you won't.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that struck me as I wrote <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/30/best-buy-will-not-issue-api-keys-to-free-email-accounts-and-wants-to-get-to-know-your-company/">my post about Best Buy stopping issuing API keys to free email accounts</a>, was the fact that <a href="https://medium.com/best-buy-developers">Best Buy operates their developer blog on Medium</a>--something I am seeing more of. As I discover new API-centric companies via my blog, Twitter, Product Hunt, AngelList, and the many other ways I tune into the space, I'm seeing more companies operating the blog portion of their presence in this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of voices in my head points out that this just doesn't seem like a good idea. It reminds me of hosting our blogs on Posterous. Medium doesn't let you map your domain, or sub-domain to your blog (invite only), but I'm sure is something they'll do soon. They don't have RSS, and they don't have a read API either? <em>*warning bells*</em> &nbsp;While I get the Medium thing, it seems like one of those neatly tended gardens, where as many roads out are gated off with friendly hand-painted signs.</p>
<p>However some of the other voices in my head chimed in that <a href="https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f#.9x8qwapqq">Medium is just asking for non exclusive license to use your content</a>. They let you delete your account, and I know they are working hard on their API strategy. Also, I'm a big supporter of API providers being as scrappy as possible, as many of us have to do as much as we can with some often very non-existent budgets. <a href="https://github.com/BestBuyAPIs">Best Buy rocks it at leveraging Github</a>, Medium, Twitter, and all the channels I usually recommend. So in the end I really can't bitch about API platforms using Medium for their blog presence.</p>
<p>When you use Medium you get the network effect for your blog presence--something I'm working to understand better, and leverage more as part of my own work. I'll keep tracking on the APIs I find that use Medium for their blog presence. Right now my only complaint is simple -- THERE IS NO RSS!!! Beyond that, I'll just track on and see how it all plays out. My advice is to still to utilize a WordPress, Jekyll, Blogger, or other hosted service where you can map a subdomain to, keeping all the valuable exhaust within your domain. Then follow the <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a> principles when incorporating Medium into the communication strategy for your API platform.</p>

<p>Best Buy is one of the many of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/22/i-am-hearing-a-lot-more-talk-about-restricting-free-and-freemium-tiers-of-api-access/">recent responses I am seeing from public API providers</a>, as they work to strike a healthy balance within their API community. In an attempt to incentivize the behavior they desire within the Best Buy API community,<a href="https://medium.com/best-buy-developers/announcing-a-change-to-best-buy-s-api-access-b09afc4bc27a#.ww9g0ojhy"> the platform will not be issuing API keys to any email address that comes from the popular free email platforms (@google.com, @yahoo.com, etc.)</a>. While I hate seeing any public API access be tightened up, I can't help but sympathize with their move, and I have to support any API providers who works to set a healthy balance within their communities.</p>
<p>While I am not sure limiting access based upon email account may not be the solution they are looking, they hit all the right notes for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Develop Human Relationships &gt;&gt; </strong>If we want to have a better relationship with you, our active users, we need to make better connections between your alpha-numeric key and the services we provide to you</li>
<li><strong>Respect For What You Build &gt;&gt;</strong> If we disable a key because the email address is old, we may break an app. We don&rsquo;t like breaking things.</li>
<li><strong>Business With Companies &gt;&gt; </strong>Over the next couple of months we will transition to a new system that will associate API keys with a company and not an individual.</li>
<li><strong>Empowering Education usage &gt;&gt; </strong>We are developing a program that we intend to have up and running before the start of the next school year that will accommodate educational use.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Allow For Play &amp; Exploration &gt;&gt; </strong>Similarly, we have ideas for how to accommodate events, hackathons and developer sandboxes to allow folks to test the waters without needing to go through a formal key sign up process.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will always encourage companies, organizations, institutions, government agencies, and individuals to be as public as possible. More importantly i will always encourage them to do it in the safest, most meaningful way possible, and when they are just working to cultivate and get to know their community -- I can only lend my support. Looking beyond the tech, APIs are all hammering out how you discover, and maintain digital relationships and partnerships, via your website, web and mobile applications, as well as your API platform.</p>
<p>Not every comopany will be able to do API the way Best Buy is. Its just not in the DNA of every company. The ones that will be most successful with it, will be the ones that do the hard work of getting to know their community, establish sensible ground rules, but in my opinion the most critical part it all, is that you be as communicative and transparent about it as you possibly can. The Best Buy API does this well, by sharing their thoughts behind their difficult decision to lock down on API keys issued to users with free email accounts.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/twilio-tutorials.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am always trying to identify the common building blocks employed by leading API providers, and Twilio is one of the usual suspects I showcase. This time it is focusing <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials">their annotated code walk-throughs and tutorials</a>, which provides a pretty good model that other API providers can follow when planning their own tutorials.</p>
<p>Twilio offers up a tutorial for almost every API endpoint they offer. Some of the more popular tutorials have versions for almost every programming language, while some of the lesser traveled ones only have a single version. Once you click in to each tutorial, it delivers as the title implies, an annotated walk through, showing you how to get up and running, making the API call, in the language of choice.</p>
<p>Each tutorials provides you <a href="https://github.com/TwilioDevEd">a direct link to the code libaries, available on Twilio's Github account</a>. It can get pretty busy in the walk-through section for Twilio, but the value is clear. I could envision a more portable, embeddable, and machine readable tool, that would help API providers do this as well as Twilio, but maybe in a more cleaner, plug and play way.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">I've had tutorials as a common API management building block for some time</a>, maybe I'll take Twilio's model and expand on it, and provide a more detailed blueprint that API providers can follow when planning their own approach. Maybe someone could also turn it into a simple service, or open source solution that the API space could put to use.</p>

<p>I was disappointed to see the email in my inbox this morning from IFTTT about their Pinboard integration. I also helped amplify Pinboard when he was Tweet'n up a storm earlier, and I recommend you read his post:&nbsp;<a href="https://pinboard.in/tos/">My Heroic and Lazy Stand Against IFTTT</a>.</p>
<p>However I had work to get done on an essay about the API effort over at Brigham Young University, and prepare for some meetings I have this week around the <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a> API definition, to help people find government services--IFTTT bums me out, but priorities.</p>
<p>The loss of Pinboard integration in IFTTT sucks, but there is always <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>. ;-)&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/why-i-am-continuing-to-integrate-zapier-in-my-business-workflow/">I began moving away from my IFTTT support back in 2014</a>, after I began seeing their lack of an API, and the absence of a forward-facing business model, as an early warning sigs about the sustainability of IFTTT as an service provider.</p>
<p>I prefer having the option of paying for services in which I have a growing dependence on for my personal digital presence, and it is vital when it comes to my business presence. This was a deal breaker for me when it comes to IFTTT being a service I could support.</p>
<p>I also strongly believe, that if you are building a startup using the APIs of other companies, you should be offering an API for your own aggregation, automation, interoperability, and any other aspect of your tech--otherwise it isn't a service I want to support.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/organizations/">There are many other approaches to integrating your cloud services</a>, and the concept of iPaaS is a growing layer of the API space. Unfortunately there will also continue to be incentives for startups to not offer an API, be secretive and shady about their operations, not communicate honestly with their community, and have fucked up terms of services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All we can do to combat this, is to make sure and only use the services who have a sensible business model which is in alignment with their community, provide a truly open API, that possesses terms of service that are more human than lawyer, and know how to actually communicate with their community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is why I support API providers like <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, a service that&nbsp;plays a central role in the operation of API Evangelist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/johnsheehan/posts/10156769607460078">news out of Runscope</a>&nbsp;makes today&nbsp;a good day to kick off discussion around a project that I've been helping push forward&nbsp;with the <a href="http://apigarage.com">API Garage team</a>, assisting them find the healthiest path forward for their API client tooling. As Runscope demonstrates, it is a tough time for API startups, something that adds fuel to my personal mission to do what I can to help startups find success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, what is <a href="http://apigarage.com">API Garage</a>? It is one of the <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/organizations/">HTTP / Web API Client tools available today, including Postman, Paw, DHC, and Stoplight</a>. API Garage is <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">an Electron based solution</a>, you can download and put to work in helping you integrate with web APIs, allowing you to make calls, see the requests / response, all without having to write code. This approach to working with APIs has evolved beyond use by just API consumers, and is quickly becoming the tool of choice for API development teams, and being applied at almost every stop along the API life cycle.</p>
<p>The API Garage team approached me a couple months back to discuss the roadmap, and figure out how we can evolve it beyond just being a web API client, and help it emerge as an "garage environment" where individuals and teams can work on APIs, at any stage of the API life cycle. Inevitably this discussion led us to the talking about how the API Garage would be licensed, and generate revenue to sustain their vision. At this point, the API Garage team expressed interest in open sourcing the solution, and focusing on alternative approaches to generating the money they needed to sustain the solution, and keep them working on meaningful API projects.</p>
<p>After a number of conversation, they settled in on open sourcing the API Garage, and begain focusing on revenue being focused on several key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sponsorship</strong> - The API Garage website, and the open source download will have a handful of sponsorship spots, ranging from the default home page, to a well placed banner location, which they will be filling with quality, complementing services and tooling providers.</li>
<li><strong>Default APIs -</strong> When you download the API Garage, there will be a handful of default APIs available. The team will be carefully considering a small group of valuable, relevant, and usable API partners to fill these slots.</li>
<li><strong>API Services - </strong>The current solution provides API testing and mocking services, and the new open source solution will offer opportunities for a diverse range of API services, that serve almost every stop of the API life cycle. There will be a handful of default slots available for quality API services to sponsor.</li>
<li><strong>Private Label</strong> - With the focus on the API Garage being open source, the team is committed to helping deploy it as custom, and private label solutions for companies who would like to establish an API Garage within their local organizational environment.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Consulting</strong> - The team is also opening up to API consulting services, helping companies of all shapes and sizes with their API design, development, management, testing, strategy, and educational needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the approaches we've sketched out to help the team make ends meet. The team has a short runway to focus on transforming the current API Garage, into the open source version (until summer 2016 target), and will need to bring in additional revenue by the time they launch, if they are going to make all of this work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two things that attracted me to this project. 1) The opportunity for an open source API life cycle solution to help be a window for managing all stops. 2) The opportunity in helping cultivate alternative, collaborative approaches to funding this window to the API life cycle, as well as potentially the APIs, and API services that need to exist within any thriving API Garage. As demonstrated by Runscope's announcement, delivering the valuable API services we need is challenging, and we need to be pushing forward open source software, and open community revenue models, alongside the VC funded vision that is dominating the sector right now.</p>
<p>I have a notebook full of stories to publish, from weeks of conversations with the API Garage team, and lots of work to help flush out what exactly is an API Garage. Think about the tech startup myth stories of the HP garage, and imagine how we can create an API focused environment where API engineers can craft their solutions. If you would like to know more about what the API Garage team is up to, <a href="http://apigarage.com/">head over to their website and contact them directly</a>, or feel free to ping me directly, and I'll get you plugged in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm curious to see what the community can do with an open, collaborative API Garage, where we can share our API designs, and put to use the best of breed API services and tooling, in the service of a modern API life cycle.</p>

<p>I recently caught a glimpse of how APIs are going to deliver the change we need in this world. It began while I was attending a gathering of indie ed-tech folks on the campus of Davidson College in North Carolina. Where 20-30, mostly non-developers, discussed what is indie ed-tech, something which included many visions of what was dubbed "the personal API". While the gathering was very enlightening, it was what this gathering has set into motion, after we all parted ways, that I think has the most potential</p>
<p>Since the gathering occurred, a rolling wave of API driven awarenss has been picking up speed, with&nbsp;<a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2016/03/indie-ed-tech/">Indie Ed Tech, Colleagues/Friends, APIs, Unexpected Emergent Ideas, and dot dot do</a>t and <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2016/03/yoda-kin/">Can The JED-API Power a Certification</a> with a <a href="https://twitter.com/cogdog">fellow who barks about and plays with web tech</a>.

<p>This collective vision of Indie Ed-Tech, which includes some very personal views of a what an API is, is how APIs will deliver the change we need.</p>
<p>It will not be the e-commerce vision of SalesForce, eBay, Commerce, Paypal, and other API pioneers that will move the needle with APIs. It will not be the following wave of social API leaders like Twitter and Facebook who connect all of us together using APIs. It will not be the API as a product vision of startups like Twilio, SendGrid, and Stripe who shift the landscape with a complete API package.</p>
<p>A perfectly designed REST API, that follows all the hypermedia rules, and the linked data vision of API visionaries will not save us. No single API specification, schema or standard handed down from above will provide the framework we will need to make the change necessary. Our belief in the perfect API implementation will not ever unite, and connect humans in the ways we need, and bring the balance that is necessary.</p>
<p>The well oiled API platforms of the big five: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Microsoft will not bring the collective power needed to make web scale API change. Their API platforms, organizational-wide unity, design strategies, and CEO mandates, will never support the API power that is needed to achieve the global scale we will need.</p>
<p>The better late than never API implementations of last generation tech gorillas like Oracle, IBM, SAP, and AT&amp;T will not begin to power even 5% of the potential that APIs will deliver. These 1000 lb legacy tech giants like to talk API, and like to pretend they get what APIs can do, but they will never realize what is actually needed to be API, beyond their own selfish needs.</p>
<p>Even the mighty US, UK, and other top governments, with their all knowing, all seeing, all mighty NSA, military, and bureaucratic institutions will ever fully realize API, with all their open data efforts, and global surveillance networks. Their belief that they have all the data, intelligence, network, and mobile access that they will need, will only distract them from what is actually possible with APIs.</p>
<p>It won't even be the over eager API Evangelists, who spends all their time understanding everything that is API, that will change the world using APIs. These evangelist will only be the channel in which each individual receives the information and awareness about APIs each day, setting the stage for what will bring the change we need. Evangelists can spend the next 33 years watching, writing, speaking, and hacking on APIs, and still not move the needle in the same way, that the API literacy showcased above will set into motion.</p>
<p>It will be the API literate individual, who understands that they can get access to their own data, and information from any website, system, application, connected device, company, and institution, using APIs. It will be people who understand that they can make their education, career, and the web into what they want, using APIs. That the web is programmable. A digitally aware individual who assumes full control over their online self, taken it back from the tech giants, understanding that they own all the exhaust from their online (and increasingly offline) personal, and professional life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been excited about some of what I've seen while monitoring the API space over the last five years. Something that is getting harder and harder to find each year. However, nothing I have seen makes me more hopeful and optimistic about what APIs can do, than reading about each of these individuals, who have been turned on to what an API is. It is not my vision. It's not IT's vision. It's not Silicon Valley's vision. It is their own vision of what is API, an understanding that APIs are all around them, and developing their own interpretation of what APIs can do.</p>
<p>No single API implementation, tool, service, specification or standard will set into motion the change that is needed. The real API story is about empowering every single individual to take control over their own digital self using APIs--something I believe should begin in education at the K-12, as well as University level. This is the front-line of APIs. This is how we will push back on Silicon Valley, technology, digital exploitation, and the NSA's of the world.</p>
<p>This is how APIs will help to deliver the change we need. #IndieEdTech</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>History is everything. Understanding where we have come from is critical to knowing where we are going. While pushing forward with the latest technology, it is always healthy to pause and take a look at that past. Someone Tweeted the link to my history page, and I realize it has been three years since I refreshed my view of the overall history of the space, so I wanted to take some time and add a few other milestones that I feel were significant along the way.</p>
<p>When I talking about APIs, I'm focused one version that was born out of the enterprise, during the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) movement, which sometime around 2000, a portion of the SOA experiment left the enterprise and found a more fertile environment in the world of start-ups. In 2016, this version of API has re-captured the attention of the enterprise, as they see them being used in popular, public API driven services, and the startups they are acquiring and gobbling up.</p>
<p>Where we stand in 2016, there are some obvious technical reasons of why web APIs are finding success in companies of all shapes and sizes, and even within government; but not all the reasons for this success is technical. There are many other, less obvious aspects of web APis that have contributed to their success, things we can only learn by closely studying the past and looking at why some of the pioneers of web APIs were successful, and have continued to be successful over the years.</p>
<p>In 2016, it is critical that we emulate the best practices that have been established over the last 16 years, following the lead of early API providers like Amazon, Salesforce, eBay and Twitter--much of what is still being emulated by new API practitioners in 2016. As a startup, SMB, enterprise, institution, and government agency organization, you don't have to follow every example set in this 16 year history, but you should be aware of this history, and understand your place in the sector.</p>
<p>As I look back each year, I see to some clear patterns emerge that have defined the industry--patterns that need to be emulated, and some that should be avoided, as we plan our own API strategy and presence.</p>
<h2>Commerce</h2>
<p>As the first .COM bubble was bursting, platforms were looking for innovative ways to syndicate products across e-commerce web sites, and web APIs, built on the backs of existing HTTP infrastructure proved to be the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>With this in mind, a handful of tech pioneers stepped up to define the earliest uses of APIs as part of sales and commerce management, kicking-off a ten year evolution that I consider as the early history of web APIs, defining the sector we all enjoy today.</p>
<p>However, even with the early success of APIs, the sector would struggle to reach a mature point, without several other critical ingredients that would prove to be as important as essential commerce variables like social, payments, and messaging.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SalesForce</h2>
<p>February 7th, 2000&nbsp;<a href="http://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce.com</a>&nbsp;officially launched at the IDG Demo 2000 conference.</p>
<p>Salesforce.com launched its enterprise-class, web-based, sales force automation as a "Internet as a service".&nbsp;<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/salesforce/salesforce-original-web-site.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />XML&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a>&nbsp;were part of Salesforce.com from day one. Salesforce.com identified that customers needed to share data across their different business applications, and APIs were the way to do this.</p>
<p>Marc R. Benioff, chairman and founder of salesforce.com stated,&nbsp;<em>"Salesforce.com is the first solution that truly leverages the Internet to offer the functionality of enterprise-class software at a mere fraction of the cost."</em></p>
<p>Salesforce.com was the first cloud provider to take an enterprise class web application and API and deliver what we know today as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/software-as-a-service-saas/" target="_blank">Software-as-a-Service</a>.</p>
<p>Even with SalesForce being the first mover in the world of web APIs, they are still a powerhouse in 2016. SalesForce continues to lead when it comes to real-time APIs, testing, deployment and most recently taking a lead when it comes to mobile application development and backend as a service (BaaS).</p>
<h2>Ebay</h2>
<p>On November 20, 2000, eBay launched the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.ebay.com/common/api/" target="_blank">eBay Application Program Interface</a>&nbsp;(API) , along with the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.ebay.com/" target="_blank">eBay Developers Program</a>.</p>
<p>The eBay API was originally rolled out to only a select number of licensed eBay partners and developers.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/ebay/ebay-developer-program-history.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></p>
<p>As eBay stated:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Our new API has tremendous potential to revolutionize the way people do business on eBay and increase the amount of business transacted on the site, by openly providing the tools that developers need to create applications based on eBay technology, we believe eBay will eventually be tightly woven into many existing sites as well as future e-commerce ventures."</em></blockquote>
<p>The launch of the eBay API was a response to the growing number of applications that were already relying on its site either legitimately or illegitimately.</p>
<p>The API aimed to standardize how applications integrated with eBay, and make it easier for partners and developers to build a business around the eBay ecosystem.</p>
<p>eBay is considered the leading pioneer in the current era of web-based APIs and web services and still leads with one of the most successful developer ecosystem today.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Amazon</h2>
<p>On&nbsp;<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=503034&amp;highlight=" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/Amazon-Web-Services-News-Release.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></a>July 16, 2002,&nbsp;<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=503034&amp;highlight=" target="_blank">Amazon launched Amazon.com Web Services</a>&nbsp;allowing developers to incorporate Amazon.com content and features into their own web sites.</p>
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon.com Web Services (AWS)</a>&nbsp;allowed third party sites to search and display products from Amazon.com. Product data was made accessible using XML and SOAP.</p>
<p>From day one the API was integrated with the&nbsp;<a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon.com Affiliate Program</a>, allowing developers to monetize their sites through purchases made at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>&nbsp;via links from their web sites.</p>
<p>Internet visionary Tim O'Reilly was quoted in original Amazon Web Services press release saying, "This is a significant leap forward in the next-generation programmable internet."</p>
<p>APIs and Amazon both have roots in e-commerce, but APIs were quickly applied to other areas resulting in the social media, cloud computing, and almost every single component necessary to build the web, and mobile Internet that we all use every day.</p>
<h2>Social</h2>
<p>As API driven commerce platforms were still finding their footing, working to understand the best way to put APIs to work, a new breed of technology platforms emerged when it came to using content, media, and messaging on the web, in a way that was very user centric and socially empowering for individuals and businesses.</p>
<p>Publishing user generated content, and the sharing of web links, photos and other media via APIs emerged with this birth of new social platforms between 2003 and 2006.&nbsp; This was an entirely new era for APIs, one that wasn't about money, it was about connections.</p>
<p>These new API driven, social platforms would take technology to new global heights, and ensure that applications from here forward, would all always contain essential social features, that were defined via their platform APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social, was an essential ingredient the API industry was missing.</p>

<h2>del.icio.us</h2>
<p><a href="https://delicious.com/">del.icio.us</a>&nbsp;is a social bookmarking service for storing, sharing and discovering web bookmarks to web pages, that was founded by Jousha Schachter in 2003.</p>
<p>Del.icio.us implemented a very simple tagging system which allowed users to easily tag their web bookmarks in a meaningful way, but also established a kind of folksonomy across all users of the platform. Which proved to be a pretty powerful way for cataloging and sharing web links.</p>

</table>
<p>The innovative tagging methodology used by del.icio.us allowed you to pull a list of your tags, or public web bookmarks by using the URL http://del.icio.us/tag/[tag name]/. So if I was searching for bookmarks on airplanes, I could http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane and I would GET a list of all bookmarks that have been tagged airplane. &nbsp;It was simple</p>
<p>When it came to the programmatic del.icio.us interface, the API was built into the site, creating a seamless experience--if you wanted the airplane tags via HTML you entered http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane, if you wanted RSS of the tags you entered http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/airplane, and if you wanted XML returned you used http://del.icio.us/api/tag/airplane. This has changed with the modern version of Delicious API.</p>
<p>del.icio.us was the first, concrete example of how the web could deliver HTML content, alongside machine readable like RSS and XML, using a URL structure that was simple and human readable. This approach to sharing bookmarks would set the stage for future APIs, in making APIs easy to understand for developers and even non-developers alike. Any slightly technical user could easily parse the XML or RSS, and develop or reverse engineer widgets and apps around del.icio.us content.</p>
<p>del.icio.us has been sold twice since its early popularity, which included to Yahoo! in 2005 and AVOS Systems on April, 2011. However del.icio.us was one of the pillar platforms that ushered in the social era of the API movement, establishing sharing via APIs as critical to the API economy, but also showing that simple rules when it comes to API design.</p>
<h2>Flickr</h2>
<p>In February 2004 the popular photo sharing site&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>&nbsp;launched. Six months later they launched their now&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">infamous API</a>, and six months after that, they were acquired by&nbsp;<a class="zem_slink" title="Yahoo!" rel="homepage" href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr/flickr-beta.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Flickr was originally created as an online game, but quickly evolved into a social photo sharing sensation.</p>
<p>The launch of the RESTful API helped Flickr quickly become the image platform of choice for the early blogging and social media movement by allowing users to easily embed their Flickr photos into their blogs and social network streams.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/" target="_blank">Flickr API</a>&nbsp;is the driving inspiration behind the concept of&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/" target="_blank">BizDev 2.0</a>, a term coined by Flickr co-founder&nbsp;<a href="http://caterina.net/" target="_blank">Caterina Fake</a>.&nbsp; Flickr couldn't keep up with the demand for its services, and established the API as a self-service way to deal with business development.</p>
<p>The core concepts established by Flickr using its API would transcend the company and its acquisition by Yahoo.&nbsp; Business development using APIs is embedded in the philosophy of the business of APIs pushing APIs to something beyond technical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs became something that any company could use to actually conduct business with its partners and the public, but we still had a ways to go before APIs would grow up.</p>
<h2>Facebook</h2>
<p>On August 15th 2006,&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207512130" target="_blank">Facebook launched its long-awaited development platform</a>&nbsp;and API.<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Developer.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Version 1.0 of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook Development Platform</a>&nbsp;allowed developers access to Facebook friends, photos, events, and profile information for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>The API used REST, and responses were available in an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-xml.php">XML</a>&nbsp;format, following common approaches by other social API providers of the time.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, developers began to build social applications, games, and mashups with the new development tools.</p>
<p>The Facebook Development Platform gave Facebook an edge over then popular competitor<a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>, and established itself as the top social gaming platform with games like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.farmville.com/" target="_blank">Farmville</a>.</p>
<p>While the Facebook API and platform is considered by many developers to be unstable, it continues to play a significant role in the evolution of the entire platform with applications and partnerships that drive new features and experiences on Facebook.</p>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>On September 20, 2006&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2006/09/introducing-twitter-api.html" target="_blank">Twitter introduced the Twitter API to the world</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2006/09/introducing-twitter-api.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/Twitter-Introducing-The-Twitter-API.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Much like the&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/" target="_blank">release of the eBay API</a>, Twitter's API release was in response to the growing usage of Twitter by those scraping the site or creating rogue APIs.</p>
<p>Twitter exposed the Twitter API via a REST interface using JSON and XML.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Twitter used Basic Auth for API authentication, resulting the now infamous&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/SNFLabs/status/16426051477" target="_blank">Twitter OAuth Apocalypse</a>&nbsp;almost four years later, when Twitter forced all those using the API to switch to OAuth.</p>
<p>In four short years Twitters API had become the center of countless desktop clients, mobile applications, web apps, and businesses -- even by Twitter itself, in its iPhone, iPad, Android apps via its public website for much of its existence (no longer true).</p>
<p>Twitter is one of the most important API platforms available, showing what is possible when a dead simple platform does one thing well, then opens up access via an API and lets an open API ecosystem build the rest.</p>
<p>Twitter is also one of the most cautionary tales, of how your API ecosystem can also begin to work against you, unless you properly address the political considerations of an API ecosystem as it grows.</p>
<h2>Business and Marketing</h2>
<p>As APIs evolved from commerce, through social, it was clear that the industry was going to need some standardizing, by introducing some common business practices.&nbsp; The industry needed to standardize how APIs were deployed as well as provide marketing to help get the word out about the potential of APIs and common business practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The establishment of common business&nbsp; and marketing practices for the API space took a lot of grassroots outreach as well as storytelling of the behalf of APIs, companies and the industries they rose out of.&nbsp; There were two separate API pioneers that stepped up to help define the API industry we know today, between the years of 2005 and 2012.</p>
<h2>ProgrammableWeb</h2>
<p>While writing about the&nbsp;<a title="history of APIs" href="http://history.apievangelist.com/history/">history of APIs</a>, it is easy to be so focused on just APIs, that you overlook the single most important player in the entire history of the web API--ProgrammableWeb.</p>
<p>In July 2005, John Musser started ProgrammableWeb. According to his original about page:</p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/programmableweb/ProgrammableWeb-10-2005.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>ProgrammableWeb is a web-as-platform reference site and blog delivering news, information and resources for developing applications using the Web 2.0 APIs.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I started this site because I couldn't find what I was looking for: a technology focused&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2005/08/20/so-many-apis-so-little-time/">starting point for web platform development</a>. (For a bit more see my initial post.) Although no guarantees, the last time I started a reference site it somehow became Google's highest rated link on the topic. Given that this site will be a collaborative effort with community input as well, this can be what we make it.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I hope you find the site useful.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>John Musser - Seattle, August 2005</em></blockquote>
<p>John&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2005/08/20/so-many-apis-so-little-time/">original blog post</a>&nbsp;on why he started ProgrammableWeb, says it all:<strong><em>&nbsp;Why? Because going From Web Page to Web Platform is a big deal</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Web APIs are a big deal! Whether its social networking, government, healthcare or education--having a programmable platform to make data and resources available will be a critical part of how commerce and society operates from here on forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>John made a early decision to showcase open and RESTful approaches to deploying APIs vs. parallel attempts of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a>&nbsp;(SOA) and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">Web Services</a>, and focused on telling stories about open APIs--way before it was the thing to do in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>When I started API Evangelist in July 2010 (5 years after PW), and started talking about the business of APIs, the technology of web APIs was already widely accepted in Silicon Valley, because of the stories that have told on ProgrammableWeb.</p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/programmableweb/programmableweb-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As we progress through 2013, a year in which I think we can confidently say APIs are moving mainstream, and I feel we owe much of the success to ProgrammableWeb. The stories John, Adam and other writers have been telling on ProgrammableWeb have been crucial to quantifying and defining the API industry--allowing us all to build, iterate and move things forward.</p>
<p>Without stories around the technical, business and politics of APIs, these virtual interfaces would not have been able to find a place in our real life worlds.</p>
<p><a href="http://mashery.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mashery/mashery-old-logo.png" alt="" width="75" align="right" /></a></p>
<h2>Mashery</h2>
<p>In November 2006, API the first API service provider Mashery came out of "stealth mode" to offer documentation support, community management and access control for companies wishing to offer public or private APIs--from a blog post in TechCrunch titled&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/11/06/mashery-api-management-service-is-open-for-business/">API Management Service is Open for Business</a>.</p>
<p>At this point in time, in 2006, we were moving from the social period of APIs into the cloud computing phase with the introduction of Amazon Web Services. It was clear that the world of web APIs was getting real, and there was opportunity for companies to offer API management as a service.</p>

</table>
<p>While there were tools for deploying APIs, there was no standard approach to managing your API deployment. Mashery was the first to bring a standard set of services to API providers, that would help set the stage for the future growth of the API industry.</p>
<p>It would take almost six more years before the API industry would come of age, in which Mashery significantly helped contribute. The space we all know today was defined by early API commerce pioneers like&nbsp;<a title="Salesforce" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">SalesForce</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Amazon" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a>, social pioneers like&nbsp;<a title="Flickr" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/06/09/history-of-apis-del-icio-us/"></a>Delicious, and from Mashery who helped define what is now know as the business of APIs.</p>
<p>In 2013, Mashery was acquired by Intel, and again by Tibco in 2015, helping continue to validate that the API industry truly is coming of age.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mapping</h2>
<p>One early API pioneer saw the need for provider web developers with a simple JavaScript map that could assist uses in navigating online, localized content or even navigate in the real world.</p>
<p>Web developers quickly saw the potential of embeddable maps, and found ways to hack these mapping sources to innovate and build the web properties users desired, focused on solving the local problems we all face daily.</p>
<p>This early use of APIs in providing mapping tools and services for developers laid the groundwork for much of the early mobile developer talent that would drive the coming mobile API period.</p>
<h2>Google Maps</h2>
<p>On June 29th, 2006,&nbsp;<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/06/world-is-your-javascript-enabled_29.html" target="_blank">Google launched Google Maps API</a>&nbsp;allowing developers to put Google Maps on their own sites using JavaScript.</p>
<p>The API launch was just shy of 6 months after the&nbsp;<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/mapping-your-way.html" target="_blank">release of Google Maps as an application</a>, and was in direct response to the number of rogue applications developed that were hacking the application.&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-map-logo.gif" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a>Google Maps was immediately so popular that developers hacked the JavaScript interface and developed application such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.http//googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/mapping-your-way.html" target="_blank">housingmaps.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chicagocime.org/">chicagocime.org</a>. The demand was so great for information on hacking Google Maps it spawned books such as<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596007034" target="_blank">Mapping Hacks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596004477" target="_blank">Google Hacks</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a class="zem_slink" title="O'Reilly Media" rel="homepage" href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a>&nbsp;started a trend of API mashups with its valuable location based data, with over 2000 mashups to date.</p>
<p>The API demonstrates the incredible value of&nbsp;<span class="zem_slink">geographic data</span>&nbsp;and mapping APIs, as well as the power users can have in influencing the direction an application or API takes. Lars Rasmussen, the original developer of Google Maps commented how much he learned from the developer community by watching how they hacked the application in real-time, and they took what they learned and applied it to the API we know today.</p>
<p>Few other companies have the resources to tackle a problem like mapping the worlds resources and delivering a reusable, API driven resource, like Google did.&nbsp; Google has played many roles in moving forward the APi space, but Google Maps played a pivotal role in the history of APIs.</p>
<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>As APIs were generating social buzz across the Internet, Amazon saw the potential of a&nbsp;<a title="RESTful approach to business" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/restful-business-architecture/" target="_blank">RESTful approach to business</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/" target="_blank">internalized and saw APIs in a way that nobody had seen them before</a>--giving birth to an approach to using APIs that was much more than just e-commerce, it would re-invent the way we compute.</p>
<p>Amazon transformed the way we think about building applications on the web, delivering one of the essential ingredients we needed for APIs to work, by putting APIs to work.&nbsp; What we now know as cloud computing changed everything, and make the mobile, tablet, sensor and other API driven realms possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/amazon-s3-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<h2>Amazon S3</h2>
<p>In March, 2006&nbsp;<a title="Amazon Launched New Web Service" href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/03/13/announcing-amazon-s3---simple-storage-service/">Amazon launched a new web service</a>, something completely different from the&nbsp;<a title="Amazon Bookseller and E-Commerce" href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon bookseller and e-commerce</a>&nbsp;site we've come to know. This was a new endeavor for Amazon: a storage web service called&nbsp;<a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>&nbsp;provides a simple interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives developers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites.</p>
<p>Amazon S3 or Simple Storage Service was initially just an API. There was no Web interface or mobile app. It was just a RESTful API allowing PUT and GET requests with objects or files.</p>
<p>Developers using the Amazon S3 API were charged $0.15 a gigabyte per month for storing files in the cloud.</p>
<p>With this new type of API and billing model, Amazon ushered in a new type of computing we now know as cloud computing.</p>
<p>This also meant that APIs were no longer just for data or simple functionality. Now they could be used to deliver computing infrastructure.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/amazon-ec2-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<h2>Amazon EC2</h2>
<p>In August 2006, shortly after&nbsp;<a title="Amazon S3 Launch" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/12/history-of-apis-amazon-s3/">Amazon launched its new cloud storage service Amazon S3</a>, the company followed with a new cloud computing service dubbed&nbsp;<a title="Amazon EC2" href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/08/24/announcing-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2---beta/">Amazon EC2 or Elastic Compute Cloud</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Amazon EC2" href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>&nbsp;provides re-sizable compute capacity in the cloud, by allowing developers to launch different sizes of virtual servers within Amazon data centers.</p>
<p>Just like its predecessor Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 was just a RESTful API. Amazon wouldn't launch a web interface for another three years.</p>
<p>Using the Amazon EC2 API developers can launch small, large and extra large servers and pay for every hour that the server is running.</p>
<p>Amazon EC2, combined with Amazon S3 has provided the platform for the next generation of computing with APIs at the core.</p>
<p>Cloud computing, was an essential ingredient the API industry was missing, and would grow to become what was needed for almost every aspect of growth, during the next 10 years. The most significant part of this story is that Amazon's cloud APIs were not just making their companies digital resources available to other businesses, they were also driving much of the growth across every other sector of the API sector.</p>
<h2>A Mobile World</h2>
<p>With the introduction of iPhone and Android smart phones, APIs had evolved from powering e-commerce, social, and the cloud, to delivering valuable resources to the mobile phones in our pockets, that are quickly becoming commonplace around the globe.</p>
<p>APIs make valuable resources modular, portable and distributed, making them a perfect channel for developing mobile and table applications of all shapes and sizes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A small group of API driven technology platforms have helped defined the space and won over the hearts and minds of both developers and the end users of the applications they develop.</p>

<h2>Foursquare</h2>
<p>In March 2009&nbsp;<a title="Foursquare launched at the SXSW" href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/03/10/dodgeball-founder-pegs-google-in-the-face-with-foursquare/">Foursquare launched at the SXSW</a>&nbsp;interactive festival in Austin, TX.</p>
<p><a title="Foursquare" href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>&nbsp;is a location-based mobile platform that makes cities more interesting to explore, by checking in via a smartphone app or SMS, users share their location with friends while collecting points and virtual badges.</p>
<p>In November 2009 after a round of angel funding from several investors including&nbsp;<a title="Union Square Ventures" href="http://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures" href="http://oatv.com/">O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Foursquare Launches API" href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2009/11/16/246291833/">Foursquare launch their API</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of API launch, Foursquare had an impressive set of applications developed by a closed group of partners including an<a title="Foursquare Android Application" href="http://foursquare.com/devices/android">Android application</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Augmented Reality with Layar" href="http://www.layar.com/">augmented reality with Layar</a>.</p>
<p>Even with growing competition from early mover&nbsp;<a title="Gowalla" href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a>&nbsp;and major players like Facebook and Google, Foursquare has emerged as the dominant mobile location-sharing and check-in platforms.</p>

<h2>Instagram</h2>
<p>On October 6, 2010&nbsp;<a title="Instagram launched its photo-sharing IPhone application." href="http://instagr.am/blog/1/welcome-instagram">Instagram launched its photo-sharing iPhone application</a>.</p>
<p>Less than three months later, it had one million users.</p>
<p>Kevin Systrom the founder of&nbsp;<a title="Instagram" href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a>&nbsp;focused on delivering a powerful, but simple iPhone app that solved common problems with the quality of mobile photos and users' frustrations with sharing.</p>
<p>Immediately many users complained about the lack of central Instagram web site or an API, with Instagram remaining firm on focusing its energy on the core iPhone application.</p>
<p>In December a developer name Mislav Marohni? took it upon himself to reverse engineer how the iPhone app worked, and built his own&nbsp;<a title="Unofficial Instagram API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/">unofficial Instagram API.</a></p>
<p>By January&nbsp;<a title="Instagram shut down the rogue API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/12/instagram-shuts-down-third-party-developers-plans-official-api/">Instagram shut down the rogue API</a>&nbsp;and announced it was building one of its own.</p>
<p>Then in February of 2011,&nbsp;<a title="Instagram released the official API" href="http://instagr.am/blog/40/instagram-api">Instagram released the official API</a>&nbsp;for the photo platform.</p>
<p>Within days many&nbsp;<a title="Instagram Photo Applications" href="http://instagre.at/#/by/knorrstein/35938336">photo applications</a>, photo -sharing sites, and mashups built around the API started showing up.</p>
<p>Instagram became a viral iPhone app sensation, but quickly needed an API to realize its full potential.&nbsp; Asserting the platforms place in history as one of the defining players in the mobile period of APIs.</p>

<p>In 2007, a new API-as-a-product platform launched, called&nbsp;<a href="http://twilio.com/" target="_blank">Twilio</a>, which introduced a voice API allowing developers to make and receive phone calls via any cloud application. In recent years Twilio has also released a text messaging and SMS short code API, making itself a critical telephony resource in many developers toolbox.</p>
<p>Twilio is held up as a model platform to follow when evangelizing to developers. Twilio has helped define which technical and business building blocks are essential for a healthy API driven platform, set the bar for on the ground evangelism at events and hackathons, and worked hard to showcase, support and invest it its developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>Alongside&nbsp;<a title="Foursquare" href="http://history.apievangelist.com/2011/03/11/history-of-apis-foursquare-api/">Foursquare</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Instagram" href="http://history.apievangelist.com/2011/03/11/history-of-apis-instagram-api/">Instagram</a>, Twilio has come to define mobile application development, helping push APIs into the mainstream. While Twitter has sometime been held up as a cautionary tale when it comes to APIs,&nbsp; Twilio has demonstrated, that when done right, API driven ecosystems do work.</p>
<p>By 2011 the bar for delivering APIs, via HTTP, has been well established by early pioneers like&nbsp;<a title="Salesforce" href="http://history.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">SalesForce</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Amazon" href="http://history.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a>, but Twilio has shown how mature the business of APIs has become with its evolution into the mobile period.&nbsp; However, mobile development via APIs, owes its roots to the foundation laid by the&nbsp;<a title="commerce, social and cloud API pioneers" href="http://history.apievangelist.com/history/">commerce, social and cloud API pioneers</a>.</p>
<h2>JavaScript Object Notation</h2>
<p>In the years between 2005 and 2010, as the web API space matured, JSON or JavaScript Object Notation, an open-standard grew to be the dominate choice of API developers. It has taken a number of years, but JSON quickly out paced XML as the preferred format to send and receive data by API providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>JSON use evolved out of a need for&nbsp;stateful&nbsp;server-to-browser communication, without using browser plugins such as&nbsp;Flash&nbsp;or Java applets, which had been the dominant methods in the early 2000s.&nbsp;The JSON organizational website was officially launched in 2002, but it wasn't until Yahoo! began offering some of its Web services in JSON in 2005 and then Google used it for its GData protocol in 2006, that we started to see widespread adoption of the format by API providers, and consumers.</p>
<p>JSON is a language agnostic data format derived from JavaScript, but as of 2016, the code to generate and parse JSON-format data is available in many programming languages. While we are seeing some evolution in the space towards another machine readable format called YAML, which has shed the brackets that define JSON, making it more readable for some--JSON is still the clear winner when it comes to web APIs.</p>
<p>The switch from XML to JSON has marked the maturing of the web APIs space, going from hobby to an actual business solution that can be used to describe essential business resources--resulting in near complete adoption in 2016.</p>
<h2>The Ongoing Evolution of Online Commerce</h2>
<p>Over the first decade of the 21st century, online commerce APIs were still evolving, with the essential elements like product, sales, auctions, shopping carts, and payments play a central role. Many API providers would come and go, but there are only a handful that deliver a precise approach to APIs that would prove to elevate their offering, making an impact on how well approach commerce APIs, as well as almost any other digital resource.</p>
<h3>Stripe</h3>
<p>By September 2011, startups and investors had read the writing wall, and&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/30/sequoia-backed-stripe-launches-to-disrupt-the-online-payments-industry-with-a-developer-friendly-platform/">the proven "API as a product" model began being applied to disrupt the payment industry, with the launch of Stripe</a>. Like Twilio, Stripe was built for developers, and did everything right, when it came to API design, to documentation, support, and pricing that worked for web, and mobile application developers when it came to integrating payments into their business and consumer solutions.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/history/stripe-launch-hn.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Right along with compute, storage, location, and messaging, payments are an essential resource to any commercial web or mobile application, and having a simply priced, easy to get up and running payment APIs, proved an instant hit with developers. I considered adding Authorize.net, and Paypal to the history of APIs, but in my opinion it took 10 years for digital commerce to evolve via APIs, with providers like Amazon, and eBay, and API-as-a-product business models established by Twilio, before a standalone payment provider like Stripe could exist, an make the impact that they have.</p>
<p>Payments are a mission critical resource for developers, and will continue to be in the future. Stripe continues to set the bar for how you do payment APIs, as well as how you do APIs in general, and is held up by the entire API industry as how you do it. Stripe continues to do one thing (payments), and do it well, setting the tone for what APIs can do, to disrupt a well established industry like online payments.</p>
<h2>Hardening Security Practices</h2>
<p>As more companies looked to open up their digital assets via web APIs, the need to harden security practices emerged, but at the same time these practices needed to reflect the simple nature of the modern web API, that developers expected. Traditional enterprise approaches to identity and access management would not always fly within web API implementations, with the majority of providing opting to go with basic auth, or API keys, when securing their APIs, but there were two approaches to securing APIs that have evolved along the way.</p>
<h3>OAuth</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/oauth-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>In 2006 a movement was born out of Twitter, and the social bookmarking site Ma.gnolia, out of a frustration that there were no existing standards for platforms, developers, and users to manage API access and resource delegation. By 2007 a small group gathered to draft a proposal for a new proposal, resulting in what became the OAuth Core 1.0 draft, which then emerged as an OAuth working group within the&nbsp;Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p>
<p>By October 2012,&nbsp;OAuth 2.0 had emerged as the next evolution of the protocol, focusing on client developer simplicity while also providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, as well as devices. OAuth 2.0 has seen wide adoption by leading API providers, quickly establishing it as as one of the first major open standards, that the web API community would embraced.</p>
<p>While OAuth can be celebrated as a security standard for the API space, the evolution hasn't been without its problems.&nbsp;In July 2012, one of the original OAuth champions Eran Hammer resigned his role of lead author for the OAuth 2.0 project, withdrew from the IETF working group, removing his name from the specification, citing a conflict between the open web and enterprise cultures, stating that the IETF as a community is "all about enterprise use cases", and "not capable of simple." What is now offered is a blueprint for an authorization protocol, he says, and "that is the enterprise way", providing a "whole new frontier to sell consulting services and integration solutions."</p>
<p>While OAuth 2.0 is not the perfect solution the API space needs to delegate access to resources via APIs, it is the best we have at the moment. The approach to securing APIs, provides a viable solution that allows API platform providers to secure resources in a way that enables developers to easily access resources, with the involvement of end-users. Even if OAuth 2.0 has become a tool of the enterprise, it is providing some meaningful delegation, and enabling the space to safely and securely expand, and integrate at a steady pace for the last few years.</p>
<h3>Jason Web Tokens (JWT)</h3>
<p>At the same time OAutb has been maturing, another industry standard (RFC 7519) evolved, called JSON Web Tokens, providing an open way to&nbsp;securely&nbsp;represent online exchanges between two parties. The tokens are designed to be compact, URL-safe and usable in single sign-on (SSO) context via the web. JWT claims are typically used to pass identity of authenticated users between an identity provider and a service provider, or any other types of claims as part of regular business activity.</p>
<p>JWT began being worked on in September of 2010, with the first draft of JWT becoming available in July of 2011. A growing number of API providers are using JWT as a middle ground between simple API keys, and the sometimes overwhelming OAuth implementations, that can create friction for developers.</p>
<p>I think JWT has the potential to flourish outside of the challenges OAuth has faced from the enterprise, at least for a couple more of years, until it sees the same amount of adoption as OAuth.</p>
<p>Both OAuth, and JWT has helped round off the API security stack, where along with Basic Auth and API Keys, API providers now have a robust set of tools that allow them to secure the valuable resources that are being made available via web APIs.</p>
<h2>The Now Infamous Yegge Rant</h2>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/history/amazon-bezos-bet.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Echoing the API history Amazon has been putting down,&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">in March of 2011, there was an&nbsp;accidental post from a Google employee&nbsp;about Google+</a>. The internal rant was accidentally shared publicly and provides some insight into how Google has approached APIs for their new Google + platform, as well as insight how Amazon adopted an internal service oriented architecture (SOA).</p>
<p>The insight about how Google approached the API for Google+ is interesting, but what is far more interesting is the insight the Google engineer who posted the rant, Steve Yegge, provides about his time working at Amazon, before he was a engineer with Google.</p>
<p>During 6 years at Amazon he witnessed the transformation of the company from a bookseller to the almost $1B, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) API, cloud computing leader. &nbsp;As Yegge's recalls that one day Jeff Bezos issued a mandate, sometime back around 2002 (give or take a year):</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.</li>
<li>Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.</li>
<li>There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team's data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter what technology they use.</li>
<li>All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mandate closed with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Anyone who doesn't do this will be fired. &nbsp;Thank you; have a nice day!</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone got to work and over the next couple of years, Amazon transformed itself, internally into a service-oriented architecture (SOA), learning a tremendous amount along the way. While this story has been proven to be more myth than reality, I think the real impact of the story is in how this myth has been heard, and passed around the API sector, told and retold by IT, developer, and business people around the globe.</p>
<p>This story came at a time where many companies were struggling with the scary possibility of operating public APIs, and has allowed them to refocus much of the value that APIs bring to the table internally. The Yegge rant provides an important story that companies can tell themselves as the begin their API journey, keeping things internal in the beginning, but with hopes that someday they can go public, and find the success that Amazon has with their successful API platform.</p>
<h2>Open Source Software and Now APIs With Github</h2>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github-icon.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>In tandem with the evolution of the cloud, another company was being born who would make yet another monumental impact across the API space.&nbsp;<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/10/18/how-i-turned-down-300k.html">In late 2007, Thomas Preston Warner, and Christ Wanstrath would come together to improve on the open&nbsp;source distributed version control system, Git.</a>&nbsp;The pair were looking to improve on the existing Git experience, and develop a hub for coders, which by mid-January of 2008, after three months of nights and weekends, they would launch Github into private beta mode.</p>
<p>Along with simplification of using Git at the heart, and the social network that brought together coders, Github also has leveraged APIs all along the way. The Github API provides developers with access to all aspects of the Github platform, providing the ability to manage the software development life cycle, while also building community along the way.</p>
<p>As the potential of Github in software development was being realized, Github did another seemingly simple thing, which would further expand its use across the API sector, by launching Github Pages. The new solution would allow project websites to be deployed alongside Github master repos, something that would tweak the meaning of exactly what a repo could be used for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>API providers would begin using Github Pages to host their API developer portals, to host API SDKs and code samples, and even began pushing its use for publishing event presentations, and managing the publishing of open data. Github has emerged as the platform of choice in the API space, and is used at almost every stop along the API life cycle, leverage Git, and a robust API to orchestrate and automate the API driven backend of the latest wave of web, mobile, and device-based solutions.</p>
<h2>Changing The Way We Communicate Around Are APIs With Swagger And The Swagger UI</h2>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>In 2011, and 2010, a new way to approach the old SOA way of describing services emerged called Swagger. The new API definition format, was developed by Tony Tam (@feyguy), to meet their API needs at Wordnik, when it came to helping managing the evolution of their dictionary API. Swagger provides API providers a new way to describe the surface area of any web API, allowing for the generation of documentation, code libraries, and many other things developers need to understand what an API does, and how to put it to work.</p>
<p>Swagger is often known for its tooling for deploying a new type of API documentation, in a way that made it more interactive, allowing developers to make API requests, and see the details of the request, and the results, before they ever write any client code. However the interactive API documentation was just the beginning, and the API definition format would eventually be applied to almost every stop along the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>Swagger has matured to version 2.0, and has become the central contract that defines the arrangement between API provider and consumer. In 2015, Swagger was acquired by SmartBear Software, with the specification put into the Linux Foundation. In 2016, the specification has re-emerged as the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a>, and is now governed by the <a href="https://openapis.org/">Open API Initiative (OAI)</a>, the organization formed as part of the move to the Linux Foundation. Even amidst all the turmoil, the OpenAPI Spec is still rapidly expanding in use across the web, and providing a machine readable way for API providers, consumers, and even business stake holders to describe the valuable API resources being exchanged as part of the API economy.</p>
<h2>Apiary Teaches Us To Be API Design First</h2>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-blueprint-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Swagger gave us a way to describe our APIs, but many API providers still apply it after an API has been developed, until one company came along and helped us move the conversation earlier on in the API life cycle. The <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a> team used their own API definition format, call <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>, to not just to describe and document an API, but also allow designers mock it, before you ever got your hands dirty writing code. This API design first approach to API development has had a profound effect on how we look at the API life cycle, allowing us to make mistakes, and bring in key stakeholders before things ever get costly.</p>
<p>What Apiary brought to the table wasn't just about making it easier to design, mock, develop, and document our APIs, they pushed the space to open up the API conversation with consumers, and key business stakeholders much earlier on in the life cycle, before things went down a bad road, and were set in stone. This process allows everyone involved to get to know the resources being made available via APIs, and design a solution that better matches how the resources will be experienced, not just how the resource is stored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>API design first has become a mantra for many companies, and API service providers. While it isn't truly a reality for all who recite the phrase, it provides a healthy focus for API designers, architects, and business stakeholders, at varied stages in their API journey. Many companies will need this focus to get them through many of the challenges they face along the way, as they try to operate in this new online, API driven web, mobile, and device driven world.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Glimpse At The Internet of Things From Fitbit</h2>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/fitbit/fitbit-device.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>By 2009 and 2010, it was becoming clear that APIs could be used to deliver the resources we need for the increasing number of mobile phones that were becoming ubiquitous. Amidst this rapid growth of mobile, another company popped up that would see the potential of connecting devices to the Internet, with the birth of the <a href="http://fibit.com">Fitbit</a>. The new fitness and health tracking device would allow users to track their activity, health, and other key wellness indicators, which could then be connected to our mobile phones, helping plant the seeds for what we now call the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>In February 2011 Fitbit quietly launched their API, providing connectivity to the data that was uploaded to the Internet from the tracking device, via our mobile phones. Two months after Fitbit launched their API, they announced the first wave of partners who had integrated with the fitness and health device. This partner potential is why companies of all shapes and sizes were beginning to deploy APIs, allowing for 3rd party companies to tap into the growing number of valuable resources being made available online.</p>
<p>While Fitbit is not responsible for the Internet of Things, as devices being connected to the Internet via wifi and bluetooth is nothing new, they do provide a solid example of IoT in action, one that is publicly traded, and has seen both consumer, and commercial success. Whether you call it the quantified self, wearables, or Internet of Things, Fitbit has captured the imagination when it comes to Internet connected devices.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS)</h2>
<p>As developers are realizing the potential of web APIs, a wave of new companies were also emerging that saw the potential for non-developers to put APIs to work in everyday business and consumer world. In November 2011, <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> began publishing simple connectors between popular cloud platforms that would allow anyone to put APIs to work in managing their increasingly online world.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/yc-backed-zapier-the-ifttt-for-business-users-launches-developer-platform/">By June of 2015, Zapier launched its third-party developer platform</a>, which allowed API providers to build their own connectors. The connectivity that companies like Zapier offered, reflect older, more enterprise approaches like Extract, Transfer, and Load (ETL), which helped businesses move data and information around on their networks. This big difference with this new breed of provider is that that connectors employ simple icons, that represent popular API driven services, and focused on the API driven cloud, moving beyond the company network.</p>
<p>There are more than 50 providers that I track on who provide iPaaS services, of all shapes and sizes, continuing to to legitimize the concept, but not all pay it forward by providing an API as well--a significant part of the concept working. While iPaaS helps smooth over some of the more difficult aspects of API integration, they shouldn't hide it all together, and eliminate the possibility for API access by consumers.</p>
<p>iPaaS isn't just about move data and content from point A to B, it is about aggregating, syncing, and migrating valuable API driven resources. As the number of APIs grow, the number of iPaaS providers also increases, providing a wealth of API driven resources that any business user, or even developer can put to work for them.</p>
<h2>Obama Mandates Federal Government To Go Machine Readable By Default</h2>
<p>As a follow-up to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/pdf/2011-10732.pdf">Executive Order 13571</a>&nbsp;issued on April 27, 2011, requiring executive departments and agencies to identify ways to use innovative technologies to streamline their delivery of services to lower costs, decrease service delivery times, and improve the customer experience--<a title="Barack Obama is now directing federal agencies to deploy Web APIs" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/2012digital_mem_rel.pdf">Barack Obama has directed federal agencies to deploy Web APIs</a>.</p>
<p>The Whitehouse CIO has released a strategy, entitled "<a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a>", provided federal agencies with a 12-month plan that focuses on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Enabling more efficient and coordinated digital services delivery</li>
<li>Encouraging agencies to deliver information in new ways that fully utilize the power and potential of mobile and web-based technologies</li>
<li>Requiring agencies to establish central online resources for outside developers and to adopt new standards for making applicable Government information open and machine-readable by default</li>
<li>Requiring agencies to use web performance analytics and customer satisfaction measurement tools</li>
</ul>
<p>While the mandate itself didn't do much to move the open data and API needle in the federal government, it did mobile many people who were looking to make change in government. In addition to the mandate, a wave of open data, and API savvy CTOs and CIOs have led the charge at the White House, and groups like 18F have taken up the cause of open data and APIs across the federal government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time this change is happening at the federal government level, open data and APIs would also be making change on the ground in city, state, and county governments across the country. While not all early visions of open data have been realized, the Obama mandate marked a major milestone in how our government works, in part to the concept of the web API.</p><p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-voice/oraclevgoogle/oraclevgoogle.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<h2>Setting A Very Negative Precedent In The Oracle v Google API Copyright Case</h2>
<p>Even with all the gains the API industry has made in the last 15 years, it hasn't been without its major potholes, speed bumps, tool booths, detours, and disruptions. Just as the API space is seeing some amazing contributions, and growth, a chill was sent across the industry by a court case brought by Oracle against Google, which claimed that the Java API had been copied by Google,and were something that was protected under copyright.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2012, a jury in the case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable. However, by 2014, the Federal Circuit court partially reversed the district ruling, ruling in Oracle's favor that the APIs were indeed protected under copyright.&nbsp;A petition was submitted to the &nbsp;United States Supreme Court on June 29, 2015, but was denied, sending the remaining issue of fair use back down to the district court.</p>
<p>While the Java API is a different breed of API, than the web APIs that have gained momentum, and there remains the fair use discussion, the court case has sent shockwaves across the API sector. There is a lot of uncertainty involved with companies doing APIs, and the API copyright precedent adds yet another concern for both API providers, and consumers, adding unnecessary strain to the space. Web APIs flourish when they are used as an external R&amp;D lab between a company, its partners, and the public, and the dark cloud of API copyright threatens this balance.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Twitter Sends All The Wrong Signals To Its Community in 2012</h2>
<p>At the same time we were dealing with the fallout from the Oracle v Google case, one of poster children of the modern API movement sent a series of chilling messages, and veiled threats to its then fast growing API ecosystem. In June 20212 Twitter published a post explaining&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2012/delivering-a-consistent-twitter-experience">the need for delivering a consistent Twitter experience for users</a>, followed up by&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2012/changes-coming-to-twitter-api">a very ominous post in August of 2012 talking about changes coming down the line for the Twitter API</a>.</p>
<p>While Twitter was just tightening up its control over its brand, applications, and its community, something all API providers face, the way it approached the situation, sent such a negative vibe to its community, the developers revolted. Twitter made it clear, that it was clearly in competition with its API ecosystem, and was trying to take back control over some of the more successful areas of development that had been occurring within the ecosystem, and already being met by businesses being built by API developers.</p>
<p>Everything we know of as Twitter was built by its developer ecosystem, a relationship that was very public, and encouraged by Twitter, until the company did not did the free labor, and took on a significant amount of funding, requiring it to shift its course. Twitter was needing to generate revenue, and made it very clear that they were taking back the most successful areas of the platform, something that would have a very chilling effect on the API community, and is something that the company has never recovered from.</p>
<p>Even though Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey reassured developers that Twitter cares about its developers, as he retook the reigns of his stumbling company in 2015, the trust had already been broken. Proving that trust is one of the most important aspects of API platform operations, something that once it has been broken, will be almost impossible to recover from.</p>
<h2>Acquisitions</h2>
<p>As the momentum in the API space grew in 2011 and 2012, the traction API service providers were seeing caught the attention of some of the more established tech giants who have dominated the tech sector for decades. The well defined discipline of API management, set into motion by Mashery who is showcased above, had ripened to the point that made a very attractive acquisition targets by the enterprise, and we saw a handful of acquisitions that rung out across the space in 2013.</p>
<p>In late 2012 we saw the first acquisition of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/13/axway-acquires-api-management-service-provider-vordel/">Vordel by Axway</a>, which set off a series of high profile API management provider acquisitions in 2013, beginning with&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/04/18/from-cpu-to-api-for-inte">Mashery being purchased by Intel</a>, then&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ca.com/us/news/press-releases/na/2013/ca-technologies-to-acquire-privately-held-layer-7-technologies.aspx">Layer 7 by CA Software</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/23/microsoft-acquires-apiphany-an-api-management-service-to-integrate-with-windows-azure/">Apiphany by Microsoft later in the year</a>. The acquisitions would send the signal to markets that the API space had come of age, the space was maturing, and the big boys were taking notice.</p>
<p>In a little less tan a decade, API management had grown up to be a legitimate business, and prove to be one that would attract the attention of the biggest tech companies in the space. While the acquisitions have legitimized the value of API management solutions, it hasn't all been good, as the attention from the enterprise, has almost meant a shift in focus by the investors of popular API service providers, looking for the big pay-off, shifting away from many of the priorities that have made API successful, operating on the open Internet, as opposed behind a corporate firewall.</p>
<h2>Apigee IPO</h2>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apigee-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Even with all the acquisitions in 2013, the biggest milestone for the API management space was the IPO of one of the API pioneers, Apigee.&nbsp;<a href="http://apigee.com/about/press-release/apigee-files-registration-statement-proposed-initial-public-offering">In May of 2015, Apigee Corporate, the developer of API-based software platform, filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to a proposed initial public offering of shares of its common stock</a>.</p>
<p>The API management acquisitions were validating, but one of the leading companies was going public which was a significant milestone marking that the space was indeed a real thing (we hope), and potentially something that mainstream markets now acknowledged. In the tech sector we are all surrounded by like-minded folks who are usually believers by default, when out in the real world there are large sectors of business who are much more skeptical, and bullish on what is relevant.</p>
<p>While the Apigee IPO performance has been mild at best, it still legitimizes not just API management, but also brings a validation to the wider concept that the web, can be used as a driver of real world business, not just mashups, and online play. In 2015, after fifteen years of evolution, the web APIs now have a representative on wall street, setting the stage for wider growth in many established industries like banking, insurance, health care, and beyond.</p>
<h2>Slack</h2>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/slack/slack-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In early 2014,&nbsp;Stewart Butterfield, one of the original founders behind the pioneering photo sharing platform included in this history, launch a team messaging solution named Slack. After Butterfield left Yahoo, who acquired Flickr in 2008, he began building a game called&nbsp;<span>Glitch, which while enjoying a small cult following, was not a commercial success, and by 2012, had to shut the doors and lay off their staff.</span></p>
<p>One by product of the gaming platform, was a messaging core they had built, which after shutting down, they spun off into a separate product they continued to work on throughout 2013. Once released in 2014, the platform was an immediate hit with the VC, and Silicon Valley community, and quickly has become a huge messaging success, but equally as important, via its API the platform spawned a huge number of successful integrations, as well as a fast moving bot ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016 Slack has become the epicenter of a chat and messaging bot evolution, that originally focused no the Twitter ecosystem, but has become more about business productivity, and other business solutions, injected into the workplace team environment, via the popular messaging platform. This bot movement has spawned a whole new wave of interest from VC"s, and while the concept is nothing new, Slack, Twitter, and other API or messaging driven platforms are giving rise to this new bot as an API client environment.</p>
<h2>Amazon API Gateway</h2>
<p>In 2015, AWS continued to define the APIs space, and demonstrate their dominance, by releasing the AWS API Gateway, which allows any AWS customers to design, deploy, manage, and monitor their APIs via their existing AWS cloud infrastructure. While many cried this was a killer of many of the existing API management service providers, after time has passed, it seems to be a natural progression of the API space, as well as telling of Amazon's role in the space.</p>
<p>As the AWS API Gateway press release information states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;create an API that acts as a &ldquo;front door&rdquo; for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any Web application&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The new gateway will take all that existing infrastructure you have accumulated (in the cloud), and it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;..handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Distilling down the lessons from the last five years, and selling it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;With the proliferation of mobile devices and the rise in the Internet of Things (IoT), it is increasingly common to make backend systems and data accessible to applications through APIs.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>To me, the release of the AWS API Gateway is a pretty significant milestones in the evolution of what is API. By 2006 the web had matured, and the Internet was being used for much more than just consumption, the API community was realizing that we could deploy vital digital resources using the Internet as a vehicle. Almost 10 years later, Amazon understands the opportunity in enabling you to do this for yourself--helping you either embark on, or speed up your API journey, which they've been on for over 15 years.</p>
<p>Allowing you to manage any of your digital assets as an API, using AWS API Gateway, is just the beginning of the expertise that Amazon is packaging up for all of us in the latest release.</p>
<h2>Delivering On Promise Of Voice Enablement With The Alexa Voice Service &amp; Skills Kit</h2>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/amazon-echo/amazon-echo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Joining in on the wider conversation around the Internet of Things, Amazon has released several IoT focused solutions, but none have made an impact on the space, and potentially the future of APIs, more than the Alexa Voice Service. I hesitate to include this as a milestone in what I consider to be the history of APIs, but what Amazon is doing is already making significant waves when it comes to how APIs are consumed.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2015, Amazon introduced their voice enabled device the Amazon Echo, which was supported by a suite of APIs they bundled under the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), and now also the Alexa Voice Service (AVS). Much like the rest of IoT platforms, Amazon Echo still has to provide itself with real world usage, but the skills kit, and voice service has emerged at just the right time in the evolution of mobile, voice, as well as complimenting the number of API resources available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like messaging platforms like Slack are providing a potential new way to reach consumers, Alexa Voice Services is providing a new way to access valuable API driven resources. I feel more importantly the concept of the "Skills Kit" is providing an entirely new way for API providers to think about how they expose their valuable resources, making them available in ways that are more meaningful to home, and business users. <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa">Only time will tell if Alexa becomes part of the overall API consciousness</a>, but after less than a year of operation, I am seeing signs of the platform being a very important milestone in the evolution of the space.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Understanding History</h2>
<p>Understanding history is critical to understanding where we are going. Calling this document the "history" of web APIs seems kind of silly. We are actually talking about a span of 16 years. But there are so many important lessons to be learned from the approach of these API pioneers, and the marks they've left on the space, to the point we can't ignore this history. If the technologists had their way, APIs would have purely been successful in the period of commerce, but with the radical innovation of companies like Amazon, Twitter, Twilio, Slack, and others, we now understand that APIs needed several essential ingredients to succeed: commerce, social, cloud, messaging, voice, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this has to make money, but APIs need to be scalable, while also delivering the meaningful tools, services and resources that are important end users, otherwise none of this matters. As we stand solidly in the mobile period of API evolution, looking at the evolution to a period that will be more about devices and an internet of things (IOT), we need to understand our own history and how we've gotten here, to make sure we the right decisions for what is next.</p>
<p>Web APIs are about delivering valuable, meaningful, scalable and distributed resources across the World Wide Web. While Silicon Valley keep pushing forward with the next generation of technology solutions, we need to make sure that we know our past.</p>

Here is the abstract from this work of beauty:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Aspects of the disclosure relate to defining and/or specifying an application programming interface (API) between a client and a computing device (such as a server) in a manner that the client, the computing device, or both, can evolve independently while preserving inter-operability.</em></p>
<p><span>This is something that WE ALL should be building into our clients, and is fundamental to all this API shit even working at scale. This particular patent is owned by Comcast, so I'm assuming it will be wielded in the courtroom, and leveraged in back room net neutrality discussions among cable and telco giants. There really isn't a lot of unintended consequences involved when two or three 1000 lb gorillas battle it out. The little people always suffer in these battles, and there really isn't much I can do--I will leave this to my friends in the federal government to take on.</span></p>
<p>Where I feel like I should be speaking up more, is when it comes to the patents being filed by my startup friends, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/27/my-stance-on-apis-and-patents/">like the hypermedia patents I talked about a few months ago.</a> For weeks after I published that story, my friends came out of the woodwork to tell me this is what you have to do in this game, and they are well meaning, and would never ever use the patent for anything bad. Everyone I talked to I respect, and do believe they mean what they say, but its the unintended consequences that keep me up at night.</p>
<p><span>What happens after your startup is acquired, and you have cashed out, and long gone? Are you going to follow the company who acquired your startup and track on their litigation, and speak up? Maybe spending some of your fortune to protect the little guy or gal? What happens when your startup fails, and your investors parts out your company, and all of its assetts (cough cough patents), what recourse do you have here? Your VC's will assume your friendly stance on patent usage right? Right.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know many of you like to brush me off as being an optimistic hippie, and naive of how things work (all without actually looking at my background). My response to that, is you should probably look around a little, understand the beast you work for and the damage they do in the world. I think you should examine your decisions to make when getting into bed with certain money men, and realize the machine you've become a cog in the wheel of. Only then you'll realize that the stories you tell me, and yourself to help you sleep at night, are fairy tales handed to you by the machine that will consume you.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-obsess-data.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time gathering, creating, and organizing machine readable OpenAPI Specs, as part of my <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">API Stack</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/my-api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">personal API stack</a> work. I'm not insane enough to think I can create OpenAPI Specs for all of the public APIs out there, I'm just trying to tip the scales regarding how many API definitions that are out there, to increase the usage and value of open tooling, which in turn will increase the number of people who will create their own OpenAPI Specs. (just kind of sort of insane)</p>
<p>As I do this work, I realize how easily I can obsess over unnecessary, and meaningless metrics and goals in the tech space. Two things have stood out for me as I do this work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Number of API Specs -</strong> Much like our obsession over the completely meaningless and incorrect number of APIs that are in the ProgrammableWeb directory, the number of OpenAPI Specs means nothing. At some arbitrary point, things will change and people will get on board--it is already happening.</li>
<li><strong>The Complete OpenAPI Spec - </strong>Having a complete OpenAPI Spec that contains ALL endpoints, parameters, and underlying data schema is a myth, and really doesn't matter. You only need as much as you are going to use. Maybe to API providers this matters, but to consumers, you only need what you need. The trick is figuring out what this is, without dumping everything on a consumer.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't stop what I am doing. As an experienced technologists I know when I am simply a tool in a larger game, and I perform as the automatron that is expected of me. However I will not obsess over the completeness of the API specs, or ever showcase the overall number of OpenAPI Specs that I have--I'll just keep on working.</p>
<p>In this data driven world, it is easy to get caught up in focusing on mythical, meaningless, data points. I'm not saying we shouldn't be doing this, because I often use these data points to motivate and push my work forward, but I think the lesson for me, is to know when an obsession over some arbitrary number becomes unnecessary or unhealthy. Another important aspect of this realization for me, is separating out when I personally set these number, or they are handed down from the wider tech space, and I had no part in helping craft them--this is when I think the chance for moving into the unhealthy realm exists the most.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fullcontact-update.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I get these regular updates from <a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/">FullContact</a> when there is new information available about the contacts I have added to my contact list of people I care about. Anytime there is a new photo, social network, or other element of their contact information updated, I get notified, andI &nbsp;can choose to update it in my CRM.</p>
<p>Would someone go ahead and create this, but for OpenAPI Specifications? All you have to do is use Github, and build your own index of the websites of leading companies who are publishing APIs (common crawl is good start), and begin keeping track of ALL of the OpenAPI Specs, and API Blueprints that are increasingly spread across the web. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/04/diff-and-merging-of-api-definition-formats/">Then you will need to develop some sort of API definition diff solution (which I've talked about before)</a>, and then send me any changes or updates that I do not have in my directory of API definitions--which you know, because you have indexed already.</p>
<p>You can offer premium services, like private repositories, and pathways to the wealth of API definition driven tooling out there. Again, this is something I could very well do, except I am one person, and not really interested in doing anything beyond all the work I already do. Especially if it involves taking VC money, scaling, and being any closer to the machine than I already am. So if you could get to work on this for me, and help solve this growing need in the API space, that would be great! Yeah. Also make sure and cut me in for 10% of all the $$$ you are going to make.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>I play with a lot of services that are looking to provide solutions to the API industry, and I'm always looking to better understand what leading API services providers are using to deploy their warez. I was test driving the <a href="https://opsee.com/">testing and monitoring solutions from Opsee</a> this week, and separate from the solutions they provide (which I'll talk about later), I thought the deployment of their API testing and monitoring solutions was worthy of talking about all by itself.</p>
<p>Opsee deploys as a micro-instance within my AWS stack, and gets to work testing and monitoring the APIs that I direct it to, providing a very precise, and effective way of doing monitoring.</p>
<p><a href="https://opsee.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/opsee-1.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>I do not think this approach will work in all scenarios, for all API providers, but I think packaging up the services, so that API providers can deploy within their stack, and run within the cloud or on-premise environment they choose, is a potentially very powerful formula.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/09/is-your-api-ready-for-wholesale/">I have written before about offering up your APIs as wholesale or private label solutions before</a>, and I would categorize what Opsee is doing as offering up your API industry service provider as wholesale or private label solutions. Many companies will do just fine consuming your SaaS or publicly available API driven solution, but more sophisticated operations, and potentially regulated companies, are going to need a solution that will run within existing infrastructure, not outside the firewall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could see bandwidth and CPU intensive situations also benefiting from this approach. Opsee's way of doing things has gotten me thinking more about how we package up and deploy the services we are selling to API providers. Once Opsee was up and running in my stack, using a set of keys I setup and configured especially for it, it got to work monitoring the endpoints I tell it to. I could also see this approach also work as a locally available API, where I tell my systems to integrate and work with an API made available from the deployed instance as well--either permanently or on a more ephemeral time frame.</p>
<p>There is lots to consider but with the evolution in container tech, I could see this approach be applied in a lot of different ways, allowing companies to pick from exactly the API services they need (A la carte), and deploy exactly where they are needed, eliminating the need to depend on services outside the firewall.</p>

<p>As I'm working through my morning work monitoring the API space, I'm proccesing stories about the availability of valuable resources, like <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/03/23/house-rules-committee-to-release-data-in-xml-format/">the&nbsp;House Rules Committee data being released in XML formats</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.exomol.com">ExoMol, the molecular line lists DB used in simulation of atmospheric models of exoplanets, brown dwarfs &amp; cool stars</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel fortunate to live in a time where the world is opening up such valuable resources, making them available online--available for anyone to use, remix, improve, and make better. My faith in APIs doesn't come from any single API, it comes from the possibilities that will exist when individuals, companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies all publish valuable resources using APIs.</p>
<p>While there is still a lot of work ahead, I'm seeing the early signs of this reality emerging across my API monitoring in 2016. I'm coming across so many, extremely valuable, openly licensed, machine readable resources that can be used in some very interesting ways. The trick now, is how do we expose the most meaningful parts of these resources, and make sure they get found by the people who will actually put them to use. As the number of APIs increase, this is something that is going to get harder and harder, and the need for value even more critical.</p>
<p>Another dimension to this discussion is the growing number of channels we need to make our API resources available in. Web and mobile are still king when it comes to consuming APIs, but quickly devices, messaging, voice, bots, and other channels are growing in use. The next wave of API evangelism is going to require that the right people (domain experts) are available to help expose the most meaningful skills that our APIs posses, via these growing number of quick moving channels.</p>
<p>An example of this in action, using one of the valuable resources above, could involve making the Congressional activity that is most relevant and important to me, available in my Slack channel (or messaging app of choice), or even available via my Amazon Echo, using Alexa Voice Skills. How do we start carving out meaningful skills from government, and other open data, using simple APIs? How do we use these to educate individuals, either as an average citizen, or maybe in a professional or commercial scenario.</p>
<p>We have many, many years ahead of us, helping individuals, companies, institutions, and government understand why they need to be exposing valuable data, content, and other digital resources via simple web APIs. However, alongside these efforts, we are going to need armies of other individuals who have the ability to identify valuable resources, and help craft simple, usable, and meaningful endpoints, that can be added as skills within the web, mobile, device, messaging, bot, and voice apps of the future.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-human-power.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/on-apis-and-microservices/">I have self-censored stories about microservices</a>, because I have felt the topic is as charged as linked data, REST, and some parts of the hypermedia discussion. Meaning there are many champions of the approach, who insist on telling me, and other folks how WRONG they are in the approach, as opposed to helping us work through our understanding of exactly what is microservices, and how to do well.</p>
<p>For me, when I come across tech layers that feel like this, they are something that is very tech saturated, with the usual cadre of tech bros leading the charge, often on behalf of a specific vendor, or specific set of vendor solutions. Even with this reality, I've read a number of very smart posts, and white papers on microservices in the last year, outlining various approaches to designing, engineering, and orchestrating your business, using the "microservices diet".</p>
<p>Much of what I read nails much of the technology in some very logical, and sensible ways--crafted by some people with mad skills when it comes to making sense of very large companies, and software ecosystems. Even with all of this lofty thinking, I'm seeing one common element missing in most of the microservices approaches I have digest--the human element.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of discussion about technical approaches to unwinding the bits and bytes of technical debt, but very little guidance for anyone on how to unwind the human aspect of all of this, acknowledging the years of business and political decisions that contributed to the technical debt. Its one thing to start breaking apart your databases, and systems, but its another thing to start decoupling how leadership invests in technology, the purchasing decisions that have been made, and the politics that surrounds these existing legacy systems.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but every legacy system I've ever come across almost always has had a gatekeeper, an individual, or group of individuals who will fight you to the death to defend their budget, and what they know about tech (or do not know). I've encountered systems who have a dedicated budget, which only exists because the system is legacy, and with that gone, the money goes away too--sell me a microservices solution for this scenario!</p>
<p>Another dimension to this discussion, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/10/an-imbalance-in-investment-priorities-that-will-continue-to-slow-api-growth-and-adoption/">is that investors in microservice solutions are not interested in their money being used for this area</a>. It just isn't sexy to be spending money on dealing with corporate politics, and unwinding years of piss poor business decisions, and educating and training the average business user around Internet technology. If you do not unwind these very human led, politically charged, business environments, you will never unwind the systems that exist within their tractor beams. Never. I'd care how much YOU believe.</p>
<p>In the end, I'm not trying to make you feel like you are going to fail. My goal is to encourage more investment in this area by the microservice pundits, vendors providing solutions the space, and VC's who are pouring money into these solutions. Many of the young, energetic folks at the helm of startups do not fully grasp the human side of corporate operations, and the potential quagmire that exists on the ground in front of them.</p>
<p>I am hoping that a handful of service providers out there can lower the rhetoric around their services and tooling, so that expectations get set at more realistic levels. Otherwise the push-back against the first couple failed waves of microservice implementations will become impenetrable, and blow any chance of making it work.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/21/sucked-into-the-world-of-bots-and-apis/">I have looked at way more Bots than I should have in the last couple days</a>, and I'm beginning to see&nbsp; similar patterns emerging across bot implementations, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/07/minimum-viable-api-service-provider-blueprint/">in sync with what I shared as part of my advice to API service providers</a>. After you look at hundreds of APIs, and now a couple hundred bot implementations, you really begin to see what some of the common building blocks of the successful bot implementations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain</strong> - Having a domain dedicated to the bot, its operations, and the community around it.</li>
<li><strong>Website</strong>&nbsp;- Simple, modern, and informative website for your folks to discover, and put your bot to work.</li>
<li><strong>Logo -</strong> Having a simple, modern, and often clever logo and overall branding to your bots presence.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>&nbsp;- Have a genuine, active Twitter account that actually engages in conversations with community.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong>&nbsp;- Establish an active, and useful Github presence via a dedicated user account or organization.</li>
<li><strong>Blog</strong>&nbsp;- Provide a thoughtful, active, and informative blog that engages with a community,&nbsp; customers, and the public at large.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>&nbsp;- You are using open APIs, and messaging formats to make your bot work, pay it forward with APIs and Webhooks.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization</strong>&nbsp;- You gotta make some money, how are you going to keep the lights on, feed and cloth your bot. ;-)</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;-Every bot will need support, even if it is automated. Make sure have answer questions via Twitter, and Github.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/organizations/">The most interesting bots I came across, whether they are Twitter, Slack, or Telegram bot</a>, all had at least half of the items listed above. I'm guessing we are going to see a huge surge in the number of bots that are available, as well as the platforms in which bots can operate, and I am thinking that the bots that follow these patterns will be floating to the top of the churn.</p>
<p>I'm just getting started documenting the common building blocks in this recent surge in API driven bot activity. <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com">I'll keep adding the most interesting bot solutions to my research</a>, and keep track of what I feel the best parts of the sector are. I'm curious to see where all of this goes. Not everything bot is capturing my attention right now, but I am seeing enough interesting approaches to using APIs for bot delivery, as well as providing the resources bots will need, to keep my attention.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>I'm constantly working to hand-craft, scrape-craft, and auto-generate <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Specs</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> files for as many of the top APIs I can. It is something Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>), the CEO of <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> always flicks me shit about, saying I shouldn't have to do that--API providers should be doing this! While I agree, I feel like we haven't reached the point where all providers understand the importance of having an up to date OpenAPI Spec available for their API (some even have them, and work to hide them!)</p>
<p>This is something <a href="http://sendgrid.com">the savvy API providers like SendGrid</a> are doing, rolling around Github, making sure copies of their OpenAPI Specs are up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/pull/42"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Update_SendGrid_Swagger_File_by_thinkingserious_&middot;_Pull_Request__42_&middot;_api-stack_api-stack.png" alt="" width="80%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>Thank Elmer, you da man. Now I just need to convince another 2K other API providers of the importance of having up to date machine readable API definitions available, and actively maintain them. Having your definitions up to date, and easy to find increases the chance a developer will load up in the favorite <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/organizations/">HTTP client like Postman, Postman, PAW, or API Garage</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its going to happen Steve! I tell you! Some day, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all the good API providers</span> will maintain their own API definitions. You should always have an easy to find copy available as part of your API documentation, but you should also search for them on Github, and submit pull requests to keep them up to date. It is like have little machine readable business cards for your API, sitting on the desks of developers, except with this business card allows you to submit a pull request to update.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-closed.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm seeing a significant shift in the conversations around how SaaS, and API-first platforms are planning access to their APIs. I'm seeing a pretty significant back peddling around free, and freemium access levels. I'm trying to keep notes on what I'm hearing, so that I can better understand what is causing this, and see if I can identify where the balance might exist in providing self-service access to API our valuable resources.</p>
<p>Let' me explore some of the main reasons I'm hearing for reducing, restricting, or completely doing away with these lower level areas of access:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too Many API Freeloaders - </strong>There is a growing number of poorly behaved API consumers who are just looking for a free ride.</li>
<li><strong>At Odds With Sales Teams </strong>- Free layers of access cannibalize our sales cycle, and make it harder for sales teams to close the deal.</li>
<li><strong>These Layers Do Not Convert -</strong> The users coming in at these layers are just not converting, and becoming paid customers.</li>
<li><strong>We Built It And Nobody Came - </strong>Nobody seems to care about the API, and nobody signed up for acess, so we are shutting down.</li>
<li><strong>No More Money To Support Free - </strong>We just don't have the money to pay for the infrastructure and support it takes to support.</li>
<li><strong>VC's Told Us To Focus On Enterprise -</strong> Our investors told us to focus all our attention on selling to the enterprise, consumer focus is gone.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to providing and consuming APIs, I've seen it all. I sympathize with many of these reasons for shrinking of the free tiers of access to APIs. There will be many contributing factors to why things might be off in an API community. As my friend Ed Anuff (<a href="https://twitter.com/edanuff">@edanuff</a>) focused on in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/21/almost-everyone-is-doing-the-api-economy-wrong/">his latest post about how a large number of us are doing API wrong</a>, with many companies approach to APIs being fundamentally at odds with their ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately I think that API providers WILL need to tighten down their access levels, but this can't be done without properly thinking things through. You need to consider the bigger picture, around how have planned API access, communicated and engaged with your consumers, and be honest with yourself about what you've done right, and what you've done wrong. While it might be a lot of work to manage this free level of access, and do what it right, you want to make sure you still maintain an environment where serendipity can happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then again, maybe you weren't actually interested in this happening in the first place. You were just looking to get someone to build some things for free on your resources, looking to offload the hard work on an external community. I'm not saying everyone who has a self-service, publicly available API will find success, bu the ones that work hard to strike a balance here, are more likely to have invested in all the right areas--setting the stage for a healthier balance between API provider and consumer.</p>

<p>I am slowly getting sucked into the world of bots. I've been tagging stories related to Twitter bots for some time, but it was the growing buzz of Slack bots that has really grabbed my attention. It pushed me to light up a research area, so that I can begin to look at things closer, and work to understand the common building blocks, like I do for the other areas of the API space.</p>
<p>The world of bots intrigues me, from the perspective of how APIs can be used to execute bots, but also provide the valuable resources needed to deliver bot functionality. I feel like the <a href="https://slack.com/apps">list of categories of available Slack bots</a> are somewhat telling of the business potential for bots:</p>

<p>While I find Twitter bots creative and interesting, there are many I also found annoying as hell. I've had similar responses to some of the bots I've encountered on Slack. I tend to be pretty boring when it comes to goofy shit online, so my threshold for bot silliness is low. I don't care what others do, I just don't go there that often, so you'll see me highlighting more of the business productivity bots, or the more creative ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing I think is significant, is the growing number of platforms in which bots are becoming common practice, with many of the bots operating on multiple platforms.</p>
<table style="padding-left: 15px;" width="90%">

<p>Another interesting part of this, is that not all bots are executed via API. Some bots simply use the chosen protocol of popular messaging applications, and operate via an account setup on the platform. However, even with these implementations, APIs still come into play in providing the bot with its required skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think bots are significant to API providers, and they should be working to better understand how their APIs can be used to either drive bot behavior via popular messaging platforms, as well as how bots can operate on their platform, either using APIs, or a common messaging format. There is a lot of chatter around bots online to sort through, and will be something that takes me a while to produce some coherent research, but you can keep an eye on it, as I progress via <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/">my Github research project for bots</a>.</p>

<p>For some workshops preparation this week, I needed to isolate just the best of the API calls and documentation from handful of APIs I am trying to teach my intended audience about. <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/university-api-workshop/apis/">I have almost twenty separate companies targeted</a>, with a couple hundred individual endpoints across the API provided served up by these companies. I needed to a way to easily define, organize, and present a subset of API samples, intended for a specific purpose audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this workshop, I need the simplest, most intuitive samples possible across these popular APIs. For Twitter I need to be able to just send a tweet, or list friends, and on Facebook I need to post to my wall, and search for user. I need simple actions, that will be meaningful to my higher education audience--most likely students. I don't want to bury all of them with the endless API possibilities that surround the APIs I'm showcasing, I need the twenty use cases that they'll give a shit about, and result in them being interested in what an API is.</p>
<p>As I do with all my research, I organize my lists of APIs into APIs.json collections, and publish the results as a Github repository. This allows me to quickly assemble, relevant collections of APIs, designed for specific audiences, in a way that I can wrap with informative content and stories, helping them on-board with the importance of APIs, as well as the individual APIs. This got me thinking, because as part of an APIs.json index I have all the moving parts identified, I just need a way to simplify, and distill down into little API samples, so that I can offer up through the experience I am crafting.</p>
<p>To help me in my effort I started defining a new APIs.json API type schema, which allows me to define a sample subset of any API I have defined using OpenAPI Spec. Within each schema, I can map to a specific endpoint + method present in the OpenAPI Spec, select which parameters will be used, and what the default values and enum will be applied. I also provide a title, description, and now I have a machine readable schema for my API sample. Next, I just need to craft a simple API Samples JS library for rendering these samples into widgets and other embeddable goodies.</p>
<p>Each sample will use the security definition defined within the OpenAPI Spec to get the authentication details it needs, render it as a simple widget, which allows users to quickly make a relevant API request, and see the results immediately. This really is no different than API explorers and interactive docs like Swagger UI, but rather than providing a complete UI or docs, it provides just a sample, to help educate the API consumer around what is an API, as well as what any single API does.</p>
<p>While I think samples can live alongside the regular API docs, and explorers, within the portal of each API, I'm thinking they will become exponentially more valuable when used in a <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/">hacker storytelling</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a>, and evangelism setting. I have the base JSON schema defined for my API Samples, and once I get a working prototype for the JS client, I will publish a simple page, demonstrating a few use cases. At first I'll just be using to help people understand the value of APIs in general, as well as specific APIs, but I think future I will be able to get more sophisticated in how I tell stories around stacks of APIs, and how APIs can be assembled to accomplish bigger things than just any single API can accomplish on its own.</p>
<p>Hopefully in the near future, I will have a wealth of API Samples for the most important APIs I profile as part of my API Stack work, providing me with some valuable education and storytelling tooling to assist me in my evangelism work.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-square-star.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/university-api-workshop/">I am preparing a project for the conversations, and a workshop I have on my schedule this week at Davidson College</a>, called:&nbsp;<strong><em>Indie EdTech &amp; The Personal API.</em></strong>&nbsp;I'll be going on campus, talking to campus leadership, administrators, teachers, and students about APIs. To put myself into the right frame of mind, I wanted to explore what the concept of a personal API.</p>
<p><strong>The Concept Of Personal APIs Is Ridiculous</strong><br />First, I'll set the stage with what is a common reaction, when I mention the term "personal API" to other API folk in the space: "Its a nice idea, but it just isn't something the average person will ever need, let alone care about what an API is--it is a non problem." To me, that response sounds just like what you'd hear in early 2000's when asked if any single individual would ever need a web presence--something that blogging and the social media star has continued to&nbsp; evolve, while also proving the naysayers wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance, a personal API seems like it would be a stack of APIs that you would setup, and manage yourself. Again, something the average developer or IT person would dismiss as out of the realm of reason for the average person--there just isn't a need. I would probably agree here. While having a set of APIs that could help you manage your life bits sounds like a great idea, I just don't think the average Internet user is going to care about their digital life bits at this level--the average person will have to have a an actual problem to solve, before they will ever need and care about an API (secret is that this is true for business too)</p>
<p><strong>Everybody Already Has Personal APIs</strong><br />I prefer looking at this topic as something that has already been answered--everyone already has personal APIs! I manage all my public messages and social network using the Twitter API, my photos using the Flickr and Instagram APIs, my documents with the Google Drive and Dropbox APIs, and my email with the Gmail API. I already have a stack of personal APIs I depend on each day to drive the web and mobile applications I use for my personal and professional existence, they just are spread all over the Internet, and not owned and operated by yours truly.</p>
<p>OK, sure. These APIs aren't technically personal APIs, but they do provide API access to my personal information. For me, personal APIs are going to be just a very personal API focused journey--as well as a local destination. Even in the business API world,&nbsp;<span>where having an API is not a ridiculous notion</span>, what an API actually is, varies widely. Rarely is their a coherent stack of APIs within a company, and the reality providing and consuming APIs is actually spaghetti mess of services, open source tooling, and custom code. The API journey is always about pulling together this vision, organizing it, discovering new APIs, evolving and deprecating old ones, while also having a plan to actually conduct business in this volatile online enviornment &lt;&lt; the journey that will be no different for the individual.</p>
<p><strong>In My World There Are Two Lists Of My Personal APIs&nbsp;</strong><br />I am an API professional, and making my living with APIs, and I have two lists of what I would consider my "personal APIs". First,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">here is my master list of APIs I have hand developed</a>, then there are<a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html"> the public APIs I depend on</a>, that are developed by external people and organization. I'm guessing the first list comes closes to what someone would consider to be a stack of personal APIs. While I do prioritize the development of an API in my own stack, the reality of a modern business owner is that you depend on a whole suite of API driven services, that accomplish specific business objectives, something that is often done via integration using APIs. I also have to note, that the overlap betwen these two spheres is huge. (Bernie Sanders huge!)</p>
<p>In the end, my point is that the lines between personal and other APIs are very blurred, and will always be a mix. I have a bunch of personal and professional life bits I create, move around, and share as I need throughout any given day or week. My personal storage API is always Amazon S3, Dropbox, or Google Drive, no matter how you look at it. I make decision about which API I publish, storage, and manage files, documents, and other heavy objects, based upon where I need it, cost of storage, and any number of other factors. The leading storage API providers are my personal APIs any way you look at it, a theme that comes up again and again, blurring the concept of what a personal API is for me.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking Down The Core Personal API Stack</strong><br />To help think through this, I wanted to take a moment and break down what some of the core personal API stack might be. With my experience it is pretty easy to identify what might be the core personal API stack, <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">as one area my API research into the backend as a service (BaaS) spac</a>e, works hard to deliver many of these common objects that are used across mobile apps that developers are building today. These are just a handful of the common, end-user facing API resources that are available as part of the standard BaaS offering:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-circle-grouped.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>

<li><strong>Links</strong>&nbsp;- Bookmarks and links of where we've been and going.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously there are many other objects that represent our digital existence, but to help keep things focused, I will only highlight these very common life bits we generate, store, move around, and share online each day. Depending on what we do for a living, the bits and bytes we will be managing using APIs will vary widely, but for the most part all users will have something to put into one or more of these areas of one possible&nbsp;<span>personal API stack</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Where Our Personal APIs Operate and Store Information</strong><br />With a core stack defined, let's think about where this personal API stack will live. There is no way all of these resources could possibly live in a single location, and we will always need the help of a variety of companies, organizations, government agencies, and other individuals, to help realize even this core set of personal APIs. Let's spend a moment exploring where each of these life bits already exist, and considering what our motivations around storing, syncing, syndicating, and backing up might be.</p>

<p>The APIs of these platforms are your APIs, and much of this information is never going anywhere, unless you are simply looking to backup, or sync to other locations (which you should be doing). I try to look at this as a positive, by default, you have a rich stack of APIs available, to help you manage your digital information. Whether you are a company, or an individual, you will always have to make some trade offs about how you manage your information, and ultimately where things are stored, how important the resources are, and ultimately are seeking to strike some sort of balance.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-circle-star.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>OK, So What? Nobody Cares About Their Information</strong><br />Even if we look at APIs in this way, that our personal APIs will always be a mix of APIs across the services we use, the average individual doesn't know or care about APIs--this is a non-problem. #truth The average individual most likely will never care about the bits and bytes they generate online each day. The photos, videos, messages, and other exhaust from our daily lives can just be lost (and monetized and owned by some one lese), along with many of our memories in the physical world--not everything needs to saved.</p>
<p>Within this reality, there will always be some of the bits and bytes that we choose to look at differently. There will be situations where some videos, and some photos are more valuable than others. Maybe we are a professional speaker, and our photos and videos are used as part of our professional services. &nbsp;Maybe we are a writer, and we need to be paid for our words, either through advertisements, pay to download, and pay walls or subscriptions. There are many reasons why we will want to keep better track of our digital bits and bytes, and there will always be a need to educate new individuals around the opportunities to take control of our digital self, even with the majority of people never caring about their information.</p>
<p><strong>Personal APIs Will Always Require Regular Doses Of API Literacy</strong><br />Nobody will ever care about APIs, and put the proper thought into their existence, if they do not know about APIs. APIs are not a destination, they are a journey, and whether it is an individual, business, organization, or other entity, there has to be the proper education about what is an API, what are the APIs that are already in use. Throughout this journey, APIs will continue to evolve in their meaning, and as this understanding becomes more nuanced, so will the personal API stack.</p>
<p><strong>Personal APIs Will Evolve And Be Strengthened By Living POSSEE First</strong><br />API literacy will be exercised and strengthened through operating and managing your online domain, living a&nbsp;<a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere (POSSE)</a>&nbsp;existence. POSSE is less about your bits and bytes living within your domain, than it is about thinking critically about what your bits and bytes are, and where they do, and should live. Regular POSSE rituals help you understand the API possibilities, and experience the limitations of APIs, but also hopefully the potential of APIs, always guiding you down a path, toward your fuller awareness of what your personal API can be.</p>
<p><strong>Personal APis Will Be Defined By The Services We Use (or Don't Use!)</strong><br />Our personal APIs will always be defined by the services we use, or don't use. Having the control that we desire over our life bits amplifies the open (or the closed) nature of the services and platforms we are using. Once we are API literate, and have embarked on our a personal API journey, platforms that do not give us the control we are used to, make less sense to use. This experience will raise our expectations of the services we use, shaping our regular POSSE rituals, feeding our thoughts about what is a personal API, and driving our decisions around the online services we use, or do not use in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Personal APIs Are Validated By The Solutions They Deliver For Us</strong><br />Ultimately our personal APIs will always be defined by the solutions that they deliver. If we cannot use an API as part of our regular rituals, sync, share, and publish as we desire, an API will either never exist in the first place, or whither on the vine, and end up orphaned, and in disrepair. This reality will continue to define what is a personal API, and it will be a driving force for anyone to learn about what is an API, how to live POSSE, and making decisions around which services we use. Personal APIs will continually be validated, or invalidated, by the solutions they enable, or do not enable.</p>
<p><strong>The Need For Personal APIs Will Grow As We Take Control</strong><br />As API literacy matures, we take more control of our world through our POSSEE rituals, which are strengthened by the services and tools we use, the concept of personal APIs will grow, evolve, and take deeper root. Something that brings me back to all of the root concerns I hear from folks, about people not caring, and there is no problem or need for personal APIs. This is all true, in the average employee who subscribes to current IT norms. This is all true, in the average online digital citizen, who subscribes to current Silicon Valley, tech industry norms. I see the naysayers of the concept of the personal API, as the gatekeepers of traditional power structures, with the handful of us who strike out our our personal API journeys, simply demanding to live a somewhat safer, saner, and healthier life in the cracks of this digital circus.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-skills.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm evaluating the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa">Alexa Voice Service ecosystems</a> alongside leading API messaging platforms like Telegram, and Slack, who are changing the way users engage and communicate, but also are evolving how we are putting our API driven resources to work. As I do this research, I keep finding myself coming <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit">back to Amazon's concept of an Alexa Skill</a>, and thinking about how it applies to average everyday APIs like mine.</p>
<p>Do my APIs have the skills they need to compete in this new voice and bot enabled world? It is bad enough that I don't always have the skills necessary to compete as a programmer, but now my APIs have to have the right skills? WTF ;-) Seriously though, I feel the Amazon's concept of the "skill" reflects a wider experiental shift in the API space, where APIs need to deliver information and other digital resources in the context of how they will be experienced by users, and not just how they are stored and maintained by developers and IT operations.</p>
<p>Since there is such a diverse amount of APIs out there, what exactly consitutes as a "skill" could vary widely. If you are person or business directory, the skill might be returning the website address or phone number for an individual or business. If you are an email or SMS service it might be simply send a message to an individual. The concept of a skill further come into focus when you think in context of Alexa Voice Service, or as Amazon puts it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Alexa, the voice service that powers Amazon Echo, provides capabilities, or skills, that enable customers to interact with devices in a more intuitive way using voice. Examples of skills include the ability to play music, answer general questions, set an alarm or timer, and more.</em></p>
<p>How does this same way of thinking apply when we are communicating in Slack? Does my API have the same skills to identify that someone just asked a question, or possible executed a keyboard shortcut, and can respond intelligently, in real-time, with the expected behavior the user is anticipating? In addition to having the right skills, <a href="https://api.slack.com/bot-users">Slack is also asking if our APIs can enable Bot Users</a> to be <em><a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/when-it-comes-to-bots-the-beer-test-might-be-more-important-than-the-turing-test-596af0032e09#.6z31hop40">"</a></em><span><em><a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/when-it-comes-to-bots-the-beer-test-might-be-more-important-than-the-turing-test-596af0032e09#.6z31hop40">delightful, interesting, and fun"</a>-</em>-significantly raising the bar for what is expected.</span></p>
<p>As with the evolution of our own personal and professional skills, it will take some practice to develop the new skills that our APIs will need to be successful in this evolving landscape. Something that cannot even begin, unless we have already embarked our own API journey, exposing valuable data, content, and other resources as APIs, while also having in place an efficient way to add, and evolve our API resources. Only then can we start really polishing and honing our API skills, to operate via voice enabled platforms like Alexa, and the next generation of messaging platforms like like <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>
<p>All of a sudden I feel like my APIs are just a teenager who is typing up their first resume, headed out to find their first job interview, so they can afford a car, and go out on their first date.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>I was experimenting with breaking apart <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> over the weekend, and exploring different ways of assembling the moving parts into different types of tools, visualizations, and other goodies. I do not have any particular objective with this work, other than just pushing the boundaries of we dynamically tell the story of our APIs, and hopefully assist in moving forward the current available API documentation toolbox we have for API providers, and consumers.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/13/api-definition-driven-visualizations-verb-tag-clouds/">Yesterday I published a short piece on API definition driven tag clouds</a>,&nbsp;and this morning I have an API definition driven autocomplete text box, providing access to the paths, verbs, or tags present in any single, or multiple OpenAPI Specs that are indexed using APIs.json.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/autocomplete/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/sms-apisjson-autocomplete.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>This particular edition of the <a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/autocomplete/">API.json and OpenAPI Spec autocomplete</a> pulls across the <a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/">SMS API providers included in my SMS API research</a>, but is something that will be available for any of my research areas, as part of my ever evolving set of APIs.json tooling. I will be building these into my own custom API design tooling, allowing me to quickly recall <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">the hundreds of endpoints available in my API stack</a>, as well as learn about <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">additional API endpoints available in the 3rd party APIs I already depend on</a>.</p>
<p>I am going to also play with how I can use across the documentation of the APIs that I include in my research. Ultimately I would like to see these types of solutions available as a suite of UI, and UX tools in my overal API driven, hacker storytelling toolbox, allowing me to better tell stories around what APIs can do.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/08/playing-with-concepts-around-simplifying-the-api-docs-that-are-generated-using-api-definitions/">I am playing with different ways of exploring APIs</a>, building on documentation solutions like <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lucybot/lucy-console">Lucybot Console</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate</a>. I want to push the boundaries of how we document, tell stories, and understand our APIs. I'm playing with two different formats, one is driven using Jekyll + Liquid, and the other are more embeddable JavaScript editions. I haven't hit on anything groundbreaking, but I am having fun breaking up the API definitions of common APIs, and organizing them for different experiences.</p>
<p>This weekend I took <a href="http://theapistack.com/tags.html">my API Stack tag cloud</a>, and made it driven by API collections defined using APIs.json and OpenAPI Spec. Instead of driving it from a simple tag JSON file, I wired it up to the APIs.json for each of my research projects, and it loops through each API that is indexed, finds their OpenAPI Spec, and uses various elements to publish as tags.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/verb-tag-cloud/">First I applied to my SMS research, to help me understand the verb usage across the APIs</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/verb-tag-cloud/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tag-cloud-verb-sms.png" alt="" width="50%" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>Then I wanted to scale it, and <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/apisjson/verb-tag-cloud/">see what the tag cloud would look like when applied to a larger collection:</a></p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/apisjson/verb-tag-cloud/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tag-cloud-verb-indie-collection.png" alt="" width="50%" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>I'm not sure if these visualizations offer me any value, but it gets me thinking about APIs at the macro level, considering different ways to slice and dice the information available as part of any of the API's indexed. The verb tag cloud is extracted from an API I have that returns the verb count for any APIs.json collection, which gives me one possible data point to consider when quantifying how open, or closed an API is. Its not always constant, due to the wide variety of ways people design their APIs, but when you see an API that is all GET, there is good chance they are pretty tight with their resources.</p>
<p>As a quick next step, <a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/tag-cloud/">I also connected it up to the tags applied across all the OpenAPI Specs indexed, looking a different slice of the surface area of APIs</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/tag-cloud/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tag-cloud-sms.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>I'm just iterating through the possibilities, and along the way creating an API, Liquid, and JavaScript version to each approach. We'll see where I go with all of this. I am hoping eventually I hit on a killer approach, or at the very least, a whole toolbox of API definition driven visual API elements, that can be used across documentation, and storytelling around what is possible with an API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-replenishment-service" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/brita-infinity-pitcher.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/09/amazons-new-smart-pitcher-is-a-piece-of-a-larger-p.aspx">I was reading a post on Amazon's new SMART(Surveillance Marketed As Revolution Techonology) water pitcher</a>, which is more about Amazon's new connected device partner commerce strategy, than it is about this individual connected device example. The quote from the story explains the strategy pretty well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Last week, Amazon.com curiously devoted an entire press release to a water pitcher. But not just any water pitcher. Rather, Amazon detailed a new partnership with Brita to bring consumers the $45 smart Brita Infinity Pitcher. Just connect it to your Wi-Fi, and the Brita Infinity Pitcher will automatically track how much water passes through its filter. Then, using Amazon Dash Replenishment, it'll automatically order a new filter when a replacement is needed.</em></p>
<p>So now, your pitchers orders its replacement filters, your lights will order new bulbs, your printer will order more of those wonderfully expensive print cartridges for you. At a consumer level, most of this seems pretty lazy to me, and unnecessary, but then again, I do not represent mainstream society in any way. Having your common devices in your life, order up their replacement parts, or even servicing, seems pretty attractive, but is something I'm sure we won't consider the downside until its way to late.</p>
<p>Ok, let's stop for a second. There is your new startup idea Jane / Joe entrepreneur, "the Angie's List + Dash Replenishment == service scheduling API platform". My cable modem calls for a service provider when the modem needs replaced with newer model, my refrigerator and dishwasher call repair(wo)man when they are not running at optimal levels. When you get your funding, make sure and cut me in for a point or two. ;-)</p>
<p>Well, as with 96% of this API circus, I'm not highlighting this because I think it is a good idea, I am talking about because it is happening, and will begin impacting the rest of us. As more of our everyday objects are being connected to the Internet, I want to understand the technical, business, and politics aspects of what is happening behind the scenes. Honestly the consumer vision of this doesn't really get me fully interested, but I could see it being used in some pretty interesting ways in a commercial, and industrial environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-replenishment-service">Amazon Dash Replenishment</a> is an interesting layer of any home, or small business, and as an API driven vehicle for commerce. I'm sure Amazon is going to do very well with it. I will keep an eye on what they are doing, as well as in any other implementations in a commercial and industrial settings, and keep thinking about what is possible, both the good, and the bad.</p>

<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Datensparsamkeit.html">I am borrowing from the very prescient post from Martin Fowler</a>, an older post, but is a topic that should be revisited regularly. Google translate tells me Datensparsamkeit means "data minimization". I prefer Fowler's translation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>It's an attitude to how we capture and store data, saying that we should only handle data that we really need.</em></p>
<p>My partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) sent me the link, and expressing that it was very telling that we (United States) do not have a word that applies for this concept. I think data minimization gets the point across, but I think Fowler elevates it from being just a data process, to something that should be rooted in company culture.</p>
<p>I am adding&nbsp;Datensparsamkeit as a building block to any area of the API life cycle that will potentially store data. The goal is to help API platforms consider &nbsp;how they capture and store data at the strategy level, as well as tactically at every stop along the API life cycle, and only capture and store exactly what you need, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Just because cloud storage is cheap doesn't mean we should capture and store everything we can--just because we can, doesn't mean we sould. <a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/09/11/data-is-a-liability-not-an-as.html">Data can just as easily be a liability as it can be an asset</a>, and your machinations around there being an all knowing, all seeing big data future are pure fantasy. The real trouble becomes clear when you realize that the majority of the tech sector, and the NSA, kind of enjoy living in this fantasy world.</p>

<p>One topic that has been present in numerous discussions lately is just how much work goes into designing, deploying, and managing APIs, as well as around the integration between the growing number of APIs. It keeps coming up in conversations with existing API service providers, as well as internal actors within small business, enterprise, and government API efforts.</p>
<p>When you live and breathe API, it all just makes sense in your head, but as API architects, designers, and believers trying to shepherd forward your API within existing organizations, it will come up against many unanticipated challenges.&nbsp;I have discussed this before with my stories about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/07/75-of-your-api-efforts-in-the-enterprise-will-be-cultural-and-political-not-technical/">75% of your API efforts in the enterprise being cultural and political, not technical</a>, and with a short one <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/14/your-api-strategy-provide-a-glimpse-into-your-company-culture/">on your API strategy providing a glimpse into your company culture</a>. In any API journey, there will always be numerous business, political, and ultimately human obstacles between you and the API success you see in your head, something that takes investment, and access to the right expertise and resources.</p>
<p>In conversations with API tooling and service providers lately, the need to focus more resources in training, development, and integration services has come up several times. It is good that companies in the space are recognizing the need, and investing in what is needed. Where the imbalance in all of this begins to show up, is that it isn't something these companies are willing to highlight as a core competency on their site, or in my storytelling, because it is viewed as a potential negative with investors. I am guessing that investment in training, development and integration services just isn't trendy enough for VCs.</p>
<p>I get it. Investors want to put their money into the coolest tools, the ones that match all the stories they are hearing. However I can't help but feel this positioning is creating an imbalance that is preventing some very interesting tools, and API driven solutions from getting the traction they need in some very real world use cases, because they can't properly invest in these areas. If I'm seeing this behavioral adjustment from just a handful of startups, who have valuable API services, and resources, but are still seeking funding and adoption, I'm guessing there is a wider imbalance that I may not be seeing, at companies who haven't opened up to me.</p>
<p>I guess, ultimately I am just asking companies who are embarking on their API journey to invest more in company-wide API literacy training, development, and integration services. I'm also asking API service providers who are selling the valuable tools and services, to make sure and invest in these areas as well (publicly if you can). Then finally I am asking VC's to loosen up your views on how you see these areas, and understand the potentially negative impact on the API focused companies in your portfolio, even if they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> the next big thing. Personally, I'm betting this whole investment game ends up being like Bitcoin, with each additional block in the chain being a little harder and harder to mine, something that takes incrementally more and more resources, and the companies who have the on-demand training, development, and integration services ready to go, will do well.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/kimono-labs-goodbye.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>When a startup goes away, either through acquisition, or any other reason, and I find the site dormant, with a friendly goodbye message, or just gone, I usually just remove the tag from them in my primary system, and they are gone from my research with the next publishing of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Parse announced they are turning off the lights, and Kimono Labs said they were going away after an "acquisition" by Palantir, I started putting more thought into what I was going to do at the time of deprecation. I want to be able to capture more of these stories. I actually have a lot of data, content, notes, and analysis on these companies that are going away, and I need to do a better job making it all accessible.</p>
<p>To support this effort <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/organization-deadpool/">I am beginning to add a dead pool page to each of my research areas</a>, where I will simply re-tag any company or organization that is present in my research, when the shut off the lights--providing a single place where we can see our recent history.</p>
<p><a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/organization-deadpool/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/baas-dead-pool.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I find it valuable to have this recent history, right at my fingertips, when I am trying to understand where each of my research areas are headed. Without the actual companies to reference I am reliant on my own memory, which isn't always the best. In the tech space, I feel like we are good at focusing on the future, and we easily forget the past, even what just happened last month.</p>
<p>I am always amazed at which startups just go away, without any notice. Many of them do not have customers, but some of them do, and many of them have aksed me for my thoughts on the space, and on their road maps. Part of having a deprecation page is also to inform newcomers that the road is littered with corpses of those who came before them, but to also provide me with a constant reminder that when I am having these conversations with new players, that I put pressure on them to have a better strategy for when things go wrong--not everyone wins in this game.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>It definitely sucks that Parse went away like they did, but you have to commend them on the <a href="https://www.parse.com/">page they left behind</a>. Facebook put up the download link to an open source version of Parse Server, and a link to the migration guide. I like that they also left up the blog, which I think is almost just as important as the code, telling the story of what happened, right up to the end.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.parse.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/parse-page.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I come across newly deprecated API providers, and API service providers all the time. Most of the time they are just dormant, nothing going on but the site is up, and other times the website is just gone, with no message at all. I rarely ever come across anyone who puts up an open source version of their platform, with instructions on what to do next, and leave the blog up.</p>
<p>If you are running an API, or a service that caters to the API space, and you are facing shutting everything down, feel free to reach out, and I'm happy to put up a splash page, help organize a Github repo of any server, and client code, as well as your API definitions. I'm happy to pay for the domain, so that the work you did doesn't go away, and people can learn from, and in some cases build off of what you did.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>I am building on my conversation with&nbsp;<span>Abhinav Asthana (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/a85">@a85</a><span>), the&nbsp;Co-founder and CEO&nbsp;of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, around <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/07/it-would-be-nice-to-have-some-simpler-interactive-api-documentation-in-addition-to-what-we-have-now/">how we can simplify the API documentation we are providing to our API consumers</a>. As part of my work to profile the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">50+ stacks of APIs I list on my home page</a>, I am playing with different ways of listing APIs, sharing the valuable endpoints available within, and other key aspects with users. All this work is being driven by <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">Open API Spec</a> listings.</p>
<p>First I've rewritten <a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/">my main API listing page using Liquid, running in Jekyll</a>, which uses a _data folder full of APIs.json, and OpenAPI Specs published as part of each of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">my API life cycle, or API stack research</a>. To operate, this listing just mounts the _data folder, and loops through all APIs.json files it contains, then parses each property present, giving special attention to OpenAPI Spec, and API plan formats.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/sms-api-organization-listing.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> + <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, running on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> gives me a simple, static way of representing the machine readable indexes I generate for any of my research areas using APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and my new API plan format. Jekyll gives me the entire contents of the API definitions I'm storing in my _data folder, as a single Liquid object which I can loop through, to generate the static HTML for my listing of APIs. Using this approach gives me a machine readable index of all the moving parts of any single, or multiple API collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/">The list of SMS APIs in this research is pretty verbose</a>. I'm not even listing out the parameters, headers, and other details of each API, and the listings are pretty involved--further backing up&nbsp;Abhinav thoughts around simplifying the API documentation that we are generating. To help me push forward my Liquid skills, and the possibilities around breaking up the properties of each API defined using APIs.json, I took the same code and generated a separate, <a href="http://sms.stack.network/plans/">trimmed down version which only shows the APIs overview, and the details of their API plans, leaving out the details of each API endpoint</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/plans/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/nexmo-api-plans.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>While the static approach to generating HTML, using Liquid, Jekyll, and APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and API plan, has given me a lot of control, and I will keep pushing forward a toolbox of Liquid, Jekyll + JSON modules, I wanted to also push forward a JavaScript solution as well. Using Jquery, I basically recreated what I was doing with Liquid, giving me JavaScript array containing the APIs.json index of APIs. Now I know I can loop through, and share all the API details just as I listed above, but using JS I wanted to go beyond the Liquid representation, and make smaller, more embeddable API documentation solutions, that wouldn't be bound to a Jekyll site, if you didn't want them to be.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/bycollection/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/sms-apis-by-collection.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/">In my SMS research, I am profiling nine separate APIs</a>, which each have its own APIs.json indexing each of the APIs, there is also a root APIs.json for the SMS research, which includes each of the sub API collections. I wanted to start here, and share a simple list of the API endpoints contained within each collection.</p>
<p>This gives me a nice, potentially human readable,&nbsp; list of the API endpoints available within any single API collection. I wanted to see what else I could do, and instead of using each APIs.json collection as the anchor point, I focused on the tags that were being applied to each API, within its Open API Spec, grouping all the endpoints by tag.</p>
<p>This gives me to quick, alternate vantage points of my API collections. While I like browsing the entire collection in detail via the main page, I can see the potential in understanding these resources on a new level, when I break them down by provider, or tags applied. One thing this brought to the surface for me, is how poorly, and inconsistently some of the API definitions are, but once I clean up the summaries and tags across these APIs, I'm thinking it could be some pretty powerful JuJu.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/bytag/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/sms-api-by-tag.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Ok, so WTF am I doing here? Why does it matter? I am decoupling the benefits that API definition driven, interactive documentation like Swagger UI, Apiary, and Lucybot Console have brought us. None of this is functional like Swagger UI is, I am just focusing on the decoupling of the surface area of any API, or collections of API, next I will play around with making things minimally interactive, like being able to make a simple GET call for an API, or maybe a POST as well--it will come with time.</p>
<p>I want to see some simple, embeddable, and easy to read and use API documentation, which could potentially have ALL the moving parts of an API, or a collection of APIs, but might also give you a sub, or cross section of the details of the API(s), and the value that is contained within. Not sure where all of this is going, I just wanted to play with Liquid and JavaScript driven APIs.json tooling, while also thinking further about what&nbsp;Abhinav and I talked about. Eventually I'd love to see a wealth of open, API definition driven modules, that API providers can use across their portals, but also API service providers like&nbsp;Abhinav can use in their API tooling, like Postman.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>If you follow my blog at all you know <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">I love Noun Project icons</a>. I started using them with my last minimal website design, and is something I've carried over with the latest edition. I've been using some images for so long I even started reworking, remixing, and making my own images, to help me tell my API stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it difficult to conjure up just the right image, or images, to represent many very abstract API concepts, so it is something I am constantly working on alongside my research, as well as writing. As I was working on <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/">the content for a workshop I am doing at Davidson College this month</a>, I wanted to have a simple, icon-based way for expressing just how open an API is (or isn't). &nbsp;My first crack at coming up with an icon set, breaks things down into three distinct groups.</p>
<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="33%" align="center">
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>API (Flowing)</strong></p>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>My objective here is to provide a quick and easy way to help articulate how open an API is or isn't. Right now, these icons are set manually by me, based upon my overall feeling of the platform, the access they offer (or don't), terms of service, and overall business model. This will evolve in the future, as I have a lot of data that could also influence these ratings, but for now, it is all me. (Mwahahahaaaa)</p>
<p>In this particular use case, <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/">I want to help university students better understand the many types of APIs</a>, but in the future I'd like to evolve the ranking, and the icon set to be more meaningful, and apply across all of my research, anywhere you come across an API. I also just like playing with icons, and using my mad graphic design skills (not).&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was being interviewed by an IBM group the other day, and I scribbled some thoughts on a piece of paper as I was rambling, which I just picked up trying to make sense of what was going through my mind, before I archive the chicken scratches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It look like during the call I was talking about how I see the world of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a>, based upon how I am currently organizing providers, services, and tooling that I find. I was discussing with them how I am moving towards breaking things down into four buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gateway</strong> - The more enterprise focused, IT department led API efforts, usually conducted at larger enterprises, and institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Artisan</strong> - A more farm to table, hand crafted approach that employs organic open source REST frameworks in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - Leverage the latest breed of cloud API service providers that allow you to deploy APIs from common resources online.</li>
<li><strong>Serverless</strong> - Outdoing the artisan hipster approach, all the cool kids are doing it without servers, piece by piece using Iron.io and Lambda.</li>
</ul>
<p>My <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment research</a> has just been a single list of service providers, and open source tooling for the last couple of years. Its time I started breaking things down a little more, and helping my readers find solutions based upon a more realistic approach to how APis are being deployed in the wild, or at least within their organizations.</p>
<p>I almost added database as layer here, but I want to keep these API deployment buckets more about the middle layer in between the backend infrastructure, and the clients that wll be consuming API resources. API deployment touches on API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a> and <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, and stops short of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management</a>, with some overlap with <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com">containers</a>, and <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">API virtualization</a>.</p>
<p>This post also reveals the fact that I write most of these stories to help me think through the world of APis, get my thoughts in order, and help formalize them a little bit further, as I try to articulate to myself, (and you) via the this blog.</p>

        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/06/numerous-challenges-when-it-comes-to-comparing-even-similar-api-plans/">As I made my way through nine of the leading SMS providers, profiling the details of their API plans</a>, trying to bring it all together into a single, machine readable definition, <a href="https://messente.com/documentation/pricing">Messente's pricing API stood out for me</a>. Alongside their SMS API, and their number lookup API, they have a pricing API. As I take a moment to look at the simplicity of the endpoint, I am also thinking about the potential, and the details of their API docs really stand out for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://messente.com/documentation/pricing"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/messente-prices-api.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to a pricing API being a valuable utility for any API consumer, I can't help but think the process of constructing a pricing API would force API providers to think another layer deeper in their API plan(s). Similar to how you have to think through the details of any resource you make available via an API, considering how it will be put to use, crafting a pricing API would force you to do the same for one of the most valuable, and overlooked resources you offer, that is core to all of your API operations.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">I've talked about the importance of API providers having management level APIs before</a>, and I think they should also follow <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/12/apis-in-the-most-mature-sectors-have-pricing-apis/">the lead of API providers like Messente who exist in a pretty mature sector, and have a handle on their API pricing</a>. I've said it before, and will keeping harping on this issue...<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/easier-to-offer-ops-apis-to-your-devs-if-your-api-service-provider-has-apis/">that all API providers and their service providers should have pricing APIs</a>, as well as APIs for the other essential building blocks of their API operations.</p>
<p>Another thing to note here, that I will be writing about more in the future, is the presence of two-letter country code as a parameter for an API. While not all APIs will have country specific pricing like SMS providers do, the API providers who are looking to truly operate globally, you will need to continue the automation of your operations, making pricing available on demand, in any currency that consumers will need.</p>

<p>I try to spend time each week evaluating what types of companies are looking for API / developer evangelist / advocates, to help keep my awareness in sync with what mainstream companies are needing (or not), when it comes to API outreach. In a little under an hour last night, I found almost 70 companies who had job postings for an evangelist or advocate for their platform.</p>
<p>Google, Brightcove, Pubnub, Atlassian, Yahoo, Uber, Esri, Indix, Couchbase, edX, Amazon, Verifone, IBM Strongloop, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, Impinj, Twilio, Cybersource, Shopify, Jibo Inc., Vidyo, UrtheCast, Talend, Stormpath, Square, Mailjet, Cylance In., Bandwidth, MediaMath, Nuxeo, Clarifai, NodePrime, Visa, UrtheCast, Stream.io, mLab, FullContact, Sumo Logic , Twitch, Auth0, Iron.io, Wercker, ANS Affiliates Solutions, Okta, Button, Lever, PlayFab, DreamFactory, Nitrous, Firebase, IBM, Accurate Background, Inc., PagerDuty, Coda Search, Aerospike, SGF Global , Bodymedia, DataBricks, Dropbox, Heroku, Gitlab, New RElic, Crate.io, Asana, Vaadin, Ionic, Neura, and Algolia.</p>
<p>I gathered these company names, after looking around LinkedIn, Indeed, and a couple of Google searches, over the course of an hour. I'm sure I would find even more if I kept on looking. As the API Evangelist, I have had a handful of these companies reach out, asking if I'm interested in the job, or possibly know someone that would be. Another seasoned evangelist, Keith Casey (<a href="https://twitter.com/CaseySoftware">@CaseySoftware</a>), Twilio Alum, and Director of Product at <a href="https://twitter.com/clarifyio">@ClarifyIO</a>, who also lives with a similar amount of attention from recruiters, responded like this when I shared the list with him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/CaseySoftware"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/keith-casey.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><em>I&rsquo;ve been contacted by at least 6 on that list in the last week or so.. I end up shutting down most conversations with three questions:</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>#1 What group do you evangelists report to?<br /></em><em>#2 What metrics are your evangelists measured on?<br /></em><em>#3 What current marketing channels are working for you?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>Sometimes but if they can&rsquo;t answer question #2, then it&rsquo;s all made up anyway, and question #3 may answer that too. if they&rsquo;re seeing traction from events, blog posts, Github/lab, that will shape the priorities -- the worst groups are people who can â*only*â answer #1.</em></p>
<p>Some pretty sound advice for folks who are looking to screen which API providers have their shit together, and which ones do not. I guess inversely, it is also some pretty good advice for you platforms who are seeking evangelists to think about, before you embark on your search. In my experience, if a brand new role is being created at an organization for an evangelist / advocate, and that individual is brand new to that organization, you probably won't be working there more that 14-18 months--have a plan B.</p>
<p>This is an area of the API sector I will work to keep an eye on, as APIs continue their slow shift into the mainstream business consciousness, and the demand grows. I am working with both&nbsp;<a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a>, and <a href="http://api.network/">API.Network</a> to better understand what the demand is around API evangelism and developer advocacy, what companies are needing, as well as how to better match folks looking to developer their career in the area of evangelism. As I spend time working on this subject, I also notice other seasoned evangelism veterans, offering their experience up as well:</p>

<p>It all has the smell of another period of growth for the discipline of API evangelism and developer advocacy, which I'm hoping we'll see some evolution of the craft, but honestly I'm just hoping the new players, both evangelist and provider, just take time to listen to the wisdom of pioneers like Keith Casey and Brandon West, and thoughtfully assemble your outreach programs, and teams, before you consider pushing the conversation forward--meaning join in the existing conversation first.</p>

<p>As I finish writing a piece on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/07/the-70-platforms-with-job-postings-for-a-developer-evangelist-or-advocate-currently/">the 70 platforms who are looking for an API evangelist or developer advocate currently</a>, sharing the wisdom of leading evangelist I follow in the space, I am also working to gather up my own wisdom so that I can share. While i am not an evangelist for a single API, I was at one point in my career, and I also practice many of the same techniques in my own work, evangelizing for all APis.</p>
<p>Out of my lists of advice for existing, and new API evangelists, one stands out: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">take care of yourself.</span>&nbsp;Make sure and find balance in what you do, or you will burn out. You can ask anyone who has been in the scene for a while, and they'll tell you the same thing. However my message is ringing my ears right now, because I hit a wall last year with evangelism, and part of it was due to a fairly scary health concern.</p>
<p>In 2015, I finally settled down long enough to get health insurance (thanks Obama, jeez ;-), and made it to the doctor, who told me my liver wasn't functioning as expected, was fatty, overloaded, and sending out some pretty bad signals to the rest of my body. When you look through my timeline on Twitter or Facebook, it is pretty easy to understand why this is---no surprise here.</p>
<p>Anyways, luckily the liver is (hopefully) a pretty resilient part of the body, something that will recover now that I'm NOT drinking, not traveling, and getting more exercise. Anyways, I just wanted to take the opportunity to caution other evangelist out there to be careful, and make sure that finding balance is a priority, or you may find yourself in a situation where you might not be able to recover. I hate being the old dude of the bunch, but please take care of yourself, the work we do is important.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While I think we have come along ways with the introduction of <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>, making learning about APIs much more interactive, and hands on, I think its time to look at how we can further refine how we deploy API documentation for our users.</p>
<p>There is a lot going on with an API sometimes, and listing out all your endpoints, parameters, example requests, responses, and other elements can be overwhelming for new users who are just looking to learn the basics of an API, or possibly just get at s single resource, completing a specific action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swagger UI, and similar API definition driven documentation like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/25/a-new-open-source-interactive-api-documentation-from-folks-over-at-lucybot/">Lucybot API Console</a>, do well in providing a comprehensive set of documentation for a potentially wide variety of API docs, but we need to keep scratching. I'm not exactly sure what the answer here is, but I'd love to see much more simpler, embeddable, API documentation emerge. Solutions that allow API providers to display a small set of precise APIs, or possibly come up with some sort of slick user interface (UI), that delivers a simpler, more meaningful user experience (UX) that speaks to what a specific group of users is needing.</p>
<p>This is not a well-formed idea of mine, but is something I want to get out early. I'm seeing an increase in the number of new API documentation resources lately, and hopefully I can influence at least one or two of their road maps with my ideas. <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com/">This is one reason I've broke out my API documentation research out of my API management research</a>.&nbsp;I have numerous ideas for new types of smaller, more bite-size API docs, as well as more embeddable, and visual API docs as well--having a research project setup gives me a single repo to think about, and publish these ideas.</p>

<p>I was pushing forward my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan research</a> this weekend, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">building on some of the tooling I developed during the last round</a>, and the <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-a-json-representation-for-the-plans-for-many-of-the-leading-apis/">machine readable API plan format I hammered out late last year to help me define API plans</a>. This time I'm applying it <a href="http://sms.stack.network/">to nine of the SMS API providers I'm currently profiling</a>, trying to get a new view of the plans of SMS APIs like Twilio and Plivo, but also working &nbsp;to continue polishing my 100K view on the SMS API industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Documenting The API Plans Of Nine SMS APIs</strong><br /><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/">This last friday I got to work profiling the pricing, plans, rate limits, and access tiers for nine of the leading SMS API providers that I keep an eye on</a>. From their pricing pages I gathered the common metrics, limitations, geographic considerations, pricing, and other element offered by each provider, putting them into separate buckets, standardizing how I record these valuable aspects of each API providers resource. This is a process I'd say 1/3 of the time falls right into place, 1/3 of the time it takes some translation and massaging to make it fit, and the other 1/3 things just don't fit into any common way of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying The Common Metrics&nbsp;</strong><br />I found it pretty easy to identify the common metrics applied to SMS APIs, as most everything revolving around the concept of the message and a number. There are nuances to these resources that are being metered, like the separation between SMS and MMS, and a local phone number, toll free phone number, and a short codes, but for now I'm just trying to put pricing into common buckets, by loosely grouping the metrics that are applied via API plans.</p>
<p><strong>List of Pricing Across SMS APIs</strong><br />Along with identifying the common metrics being applied to SMS APIs, I was able to establish a list of the pricing that is being leveraged across these providers. I have machine readable entries for sending and receiving SMS or MMS, setup and rental fees associated with purchasing numbers, and short codes. I have ways of separating out fixed costs, such as fees, or per unit calls, as well as being able to handle ranges, and different rates and limitation being applied to different packages. It is far from perfect, but I am feeling pretty good about it as v1 of the API plan format.</p>
<p><strong>Linking Plan Metrics To Resources</strong><br />One big disconnect for me currently is being able to fully understand how metrics, limits, and pricing applies to API consumption, such as a linkage between a specific API plan element, and an individual API endpoint, and method. Another dimension of this is that most API plan elements represent a small portion of all the API endpoints available--meaning you only pay for sending message, procuring a short code number, and not for doing configuration, logging, and other more utility endpoints. I have a way to link each plan element to a specific path or verb, but I won't be implementing until I apply this to more API providers. I am not going to worry about this one right now, as I know it will happen in one of the next sprints for this work.</p>
<p><strong>The Unclear World of Limitations</strong><br />Another big gray area that I am not sure how I will deal with completely, is the murkiness of how rate limits that are applied. Only in some cases are limits actually broken down in detail, including where the ceilings are. Most of the time, the pricing is used as a governor for rate limits, meaning if you can afford it, there are no limits. For now, I will just state "unclear" if I don't know where the limits are, and most likely just leave as an individual transaction, as opposed to when labeling it as "range", or "unlimited", as I do in other cases. While I think API limits will come into focus as I profile more APIs, I also know this will continue to be a murky area for some providers, either because of a lack of vision when it comes business strategy, or in some cases provides will be trying to obfuscate the limitations so they don't scare consumers off. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>More API Plan Profiling Before I Iterate Further</strong><br />There are many challenges present within as I work to compare these similar API plans, but as a first crack, I'm pretty stoked with what I have been able to accomplish, and make machine readable. In addition to i<a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/">ncluding this data in the API listing for my API plan research</a>, I also <a href="http://sms.stack.network/plans/">broke it out separately into a view that showcases the API plan details across all nine SMS API providers</a>. I find it valuable to look at the plan elements alongside all of the API endpoints, but I also find it extremely valuable to see how the APIs plans size up against each other, without the technical details of the APIs distracting me--I like APIs, more than I like money. :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next. I'm going to move my research into some of the other more mature API stacks like email, compute, storage, and other essential building blocks for websites, mobile, and device based apps. Too establish the draft format for my API plans format, I looked at 60+ diverse APIs, but for this sprint i wanted to target a handful of APIs, present within common business verticals. Before I iterate on the API plan format any further, I want to make sure it works for defining the details of individual API plans, but also does it in a way that makes it easy to compare the plans for similar APIs, in a specific business vertical as well. This SMS research provided me with a first implementation of API plans applied across nine separate, but similar APIs, but it is also available as <a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis.json">a machine readable index for the business of these APIs, within the APIs.json files for each API, as well as the APIs.json for the overall SMS API collection</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-scraping.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was looking to create an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> plus <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec(s)</a> for the <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/">WordPress.org API</a>, and the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html">Instructure Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) API</a>. I am pulling together a toolkit to support a workshop at Davidson College in North Carolina this month, and I&nbsp;<a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/">wanted a handful of APIs that would be relevant to students, and faculty on campus</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my experience, when it comes to documenting large APIs using OpenAPI Spec, you don't want to be hand rolling things, making auto generation essential. There are two options for accomplishing this, 1) I can use a proxy like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/05/automated-mapping-of-the-api-universe-with-charles-proxy-dropbox-openapi-spec-and-some-custom-apis/">Charles</a> or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/16/automagically-defining-your-api-infrastructure-as-you-work-using-stoplightio/">Stoplight.io</a>, or 2) I can write a script to scrape the publicly available HTML documentation for each API. While I do enjoy playing with mapping out APIs in Stoplight.io, allowing it do the heavy lifting of crafting each API definition, sometimes there is more relevant meta data for the API available in the API documentation.</p>
<p>The OpenAPI Spec, plus APIs.json files for both the <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/data/wordpress/apis.json">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam//data/instructure-canvas/apis.json">Instructure Canvas</a> APIs took me about an hour a each, to write the script, and round off the OpenAPI Spec, making sure it was as complete as possible. Through scraping, I get description for endpoints, parameters, and sometimes I also get other detail including sample responses, enum, and response codes.</p>
<p>One downside of obtaining an API definition by scraping, is that I only get the surface area of an API, not the responses, and underlying data model. Sometimes this is included in documentation, but I do not always harvest this--waiting until I can get a often more correct schema, when I map out using a proxy or via HAR file. This is OK. I find the trade-off worth it. I'd rather have the more human-centered descriptions, and names of each endpoints, than the response definitions--that will come with time, and more usage of the actual APIs.</p>
<p>In the end, it really depends to the size of an API, and the quality of the API documentation. If it is a big API, and the documentation is well crafted, it is preferable to scrape and auto generate the definition. Once I have this, I can load it into Postman or Stoplight.io, start making API calls, and use either Stoplight's proxy, or my own solution that uses Charles Proxy, to provide the remaining schema of the responses, as well as the resulting HTTP status code(s).</p>
<p>I think the human touch on all APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and API Blueprint files will prove to be essential in streamlining interactions at every stop along the API life cycle. If you can't easily understand what an API does, and what the moving parts are, the rest won't matter, so having simple, well written titles, and descriptions for APIs that are described in each machine readable definition is well worth any extra work. Even with auto generation via scraping, or Stoplight.io, I find I still have have to give each API definitions a little extra love to make sure they are as polished as possible.</p>
<p>I'm thinking I will start keeping a journal of the work goes into crafting each API's definition(s). It might be something I can use down the road to further streamline the creation, and maintenance of my API definitions, and the API services I develop to support all of this.</p>
<p>Here is the APIs.json for the Wordpress.org API by the way:</p>

<p>Here is the APIs.json for the Instructure Canvas API as well:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/ede7a42b29b4214eefb2.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/">You can see these, and some other API definitions for my workshop over at the Github repo for the project</a>. I created a new Liquid template, that allows me to display APIs.json and OpenAPI Specs within the Jekyll site for this project. Something that I will be using to better deliver API driven content, visualizations, and other resources that help us learn about, and put APIs to work.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/1000-lb-gorilla-with-startup-jewelry.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I'm thinking about the bigger picture of how startup acquisitions are impacting the world of APIs, I am also having several conversations with folks about their brand spank'n new API focused startup, I can't help but feel that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">things are never as they seem</span>, when it comes to the 1000 lb gorillas acquisitions within each wave of API driven startups. Of course there are many reasons why big companies gobble up the little startups, one that has a wide range of positive, and negative impacts on the overall health of the API economy, but from my vantage point rarely do the public stories ever size up with the real motivations behind the acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do big companies buy well performing API startups? Leading technology? User adoption? Integrations? Talent acquisition? Revenue? Relevance? Look cool? I'm sure it "could" be a mix of any of those elements, but after seeing many acquisition's get shut down, users flee, and talent jump ship from these soon to be irrelevant, investment saturated startups--I'm always looking for the other motivations beyond why these corporate giants are trying to look alll pretty in their startup jewelry.</p>
<p>To me, the motivations behind startup acquisitions are more about what isn't said, than it is ever what is said (jewelry is a distraction). Its about posturing in the space where you dominate (or want to). It is about steering the conversation where you want it to go, and if you don't want things to change, the conversation will go nowhere. It is about sending the right signals to your competition, and the market--all while prancing around wearing your pretty startup jewelry.</p>
<p>Ok, so why do I give a shit? Well, when the majority of companies I profile, track on, have conversations, take money from, and in some cases, advocate their products, services, and tooling, are playing in this game, and I have to consider the bigger picture of how shit flows upstream. I understand that as a company, you are hyper-focused with your agile, lean startup, kung fu, A/B tested, paleo diet startup process, and you are looking to find the biggest opportunity, then deliver the best product and service that you can. You are here to disrupt all that was! However, in my opinion if your real strategy is focused on an exit, and your real customer is the enterprise, individual API consumers, their end-users, API SLAs, deprecation policies, and everything else means absolutely jack-shit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand this is the song and dance "that everyone has to perform", but you see, my motivations, and view of all of this might be just a little different than yours. My motivations are around bringing awareness to the masses around how APIs are being used (both good &amp; bad), and ensuring there are as many open definitions, tooling, and other resources available to the community as possible. I am not&nbsp; focused on getting as rich as possible, at all costs--it just isn't on my radar, I'm sorry. I'm not interested in generating value, so that it can be sold off to the highest bidder. Don't get me wrong, all y'all are welcome to play your game, and will actually to it ethically, I'm just trying to mitigate the damage each cycle have on the rest of us who really trying to make change, and deliver valuable resources to where they need using APIs (healthcare, education, water, environment, etc. etc.)</p>
<p>I know that many of my startup friends will tell me, like they do when I talk about API patents, coprying, and other business and political areas--this is how the game is played. If you want to play in it you do what you have to, if you don't, you don't have to play. Ok, fair enough, except for the fact that many of you are coming to me for information about the space, what is out there, what is getting traction, and weaving this into your road maps. I'm openly sharing my knowledge, and in some cases actively showcasing your company, products, services, and tooling to my readers--turning them into your customers, so tht you can sell any value generated to the highest bidder. Then in the end you have no responsibility regarding what the acquiring company does with the technology, products, services, or data, content, and exhaust that was generated around operations--this damage, and imbalance with what I am hearing in the early days from startup is my concern.</p>
<p>All I'm doing in this exercise is continuing hone my ability to identify who the companies are that are purely on a startup exit journey, and those who may also be on the same journey, but along the way will also give back enough open content, data, resources, tooling, and definitions, that the community can benefit from. Now that the API space is moving more towards being a mainstream thing, maybe this will be the shift in my own mission. Rather than just educating new folks about APIs, and how to do "API", I will also be working to incentivize the waves of soon to be failed, exited, and deprecated API startups to give back open content, data, resources, tooling, and definitions along the way. Then maybe the rest of us who aren't playing the startup game, and are being negatively impacted by 1000 lb gorillas selfishly buying up, and wearing all the startup jewelry, will still be able to operate, innovate, do business, and deliver vital services using APIs--if only in the cracks.</p>
