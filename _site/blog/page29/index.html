        <span class="post-date">25 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-obsess-data.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time gathering, creating, and organizing machine readable OpenAPI Specs, as part of my <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">API Stack</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/my-api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">personal API stack</a> work. I'm not insane enough to think I can create OpenAPI Specs for all of the public APIs out there, I'm just trying to tip the scales regarding how many API definitions that are out there, to increase the usage and value of open tooling, which in turn will increase the number of people who will create their own OpenAPI Specs. (just kind of sort of insane)</p>
<p>As I do this work, I realize how easily I can obsess over unnecessary, and meaningless metrics and goals in the tech space. Two things have stood out for me as I do this work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Number of API Specs -</strong> Much like our obsession over the completely meaningless and incorrect number of APIs that are in the ProgrammableWeb directory, the number of OpenAPI Specs means nothing. At some arbitrary point, things will change and people will get on board--it is already happening.</li>
<li><strong>The Complete OpenAPI Spec - </strong>Having a complete OpenAPI Spec that contains ALL endpoints, parameters, and underlying data schema is a myth, and really doesn't matter. You only need as much as you are going to use. Maybe to API providers this matters, but to consumers, you only need what you need. The trick is figuring out what this is, without dumping everything on a consumer.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't stop what I am doing. As an experienced technologists I know when I am simply a tool in a larger game, and I perform as the automatron that is expected of me. However I will not obsess over the completeness of the API specs, or ever showcase the overall number of OpenAPI Specs that I have--I'll just keep on working.</p>
<p>In this data driven world, it is easy to get caught up in focusing on mythical, meaningless, data points. I'm not saying we shouldn't be doing this, because I often use these data points to motivate and push my work forward, but I think the lesson for me, is to know when an obsession over some arbitrary number becomes unnecessary or unhealthy. Another important aspect of this realization for me, is separating out when I personally set these number, or they are handed down from the wider tech space, and I had no part in helping craft them--this is when I think the chance for moving into the unhealthy realm exists the most.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fullcontact-update.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I get these regular updates from <a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/">FullContact</a> when there is new information available about the contacts I have added to my contact list of people I care about. Anytime there is a new photo, social network, or other element of their contact information updated, I get notified, andI &nbsp;can choose to update it in my CRM.</p>
<p>Would someone go ahead and create this, but for OpenAPI Specifications? All you have to do is use Github, and build your own index of the websites of leading companies who are publishing APIs (common crawl is good start), and begin keeping track of ALL of the OpenAPI Specs, and API Blueprints that are increasingly spread across the web. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/04/diff-and-merging-of-api-definition-formats/">Then you will need to develop some sort of API definition diff solution (which I've talked about before)</a>, and then send me any changes or updates that I do not have in my directory of API definitions--which you know, because you have indexed already.</p>
<p>You can offer premium services, like private repositories, and pathways to the wealth of API definition driven tooling out there. Again, this is something I could very well do, except I am one person, and not really interested in doing anything beyond all the work I already do. Especially if it involves taking VC money, scaling, and being any closer to the machine than I already am. So if you could get to work on this for me, and help solve this growing need in the API space, that would be great! Yeah. Also make sure and cut me in for 10% of all the $$$ you are going to make.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>I play with a lot of services that are looking to provide solutions to the API industry, and I'm always looking to better understand what leading API services providers are using to deploy their warez. I was test driving the <a href="https://opsee.com/">testing and monitoring solutions from Opsee</a> this week, and separate from the solutions they provide (which I'll talk about later), I thought the deployment of their API testing and monitoring solutions was worthy of talking about all by itself.</p>
<p>Opsee deploys as a micro-instance within my AWS stack, and gets to work testing and monitoring the APIs that I direct it to, providing a very precise, and effective way of doing monitoring.</p>
<p><a href="https://opsee.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/opsee-1.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>I do not think this approach will work in all scenarios, for all API providers, but I think packaging up the services, so that API providers can deploy within their stack, and run within the cloud or on-premise environment they choose, is a potentially very powerful formula.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/09/is-your-api-ready-for-wholesale/">I have written before about offering up your APIs as wholesale or private label solutions before</a>, and I would categorize what Opsee is doing as offering up your API industry service provider as wholesale or private label solutions. Many companies will do just fine consuming your SaaS or publicly available API driven solution, but more sophisticated operations, and potentially regulated companies, are going to need a solution that will run within existing infrastructure, not outside the firewall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could see bandwidth and CPU intensive situations also benefiting from this approach. Opsee's way of doing things has gotten me thinking more about how we package up and deploy the services we are selling to API providers. Once Opsee was up and running in my stack, using a set of keys I setup and configured especially for it, it got to work monitoring the endpoints I tell it to. I could also see this approach also work as a locally available API, where I tell my systems to integrate and work with an API made available from the deployed instance as well--either permanently or on a more ephemeral time frame.</p>
<p>There is lots to consider but with the evolution in container tech, I could see this approach be applied in a lot of different ways, allowing companies to pick from exactly the API services they need (A la carte), and deploy exactly where they are needed, eliminating the need to depend on services outside the firewall.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-noise-wave.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I'm working through my morning work monitoring the API space, I'm proccesing stories about the availability of valuable resources, like <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/03/23/house-rules-committee-to-release-data-in-xml-format/">the&nbsp;House Rules Committee data being released in XML formats</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.exomol.com">ExoMol, the molecular line lists DB used in simulation of atmospheric models of exoplanets, brown dwarfs &amp; cool stars</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel fortunate to live in a time where the world is opening up such valuable resources, making them available online--available for anyone to use, remix, improve, and make better. My faith in APIs doesn't come from any single API, it comes from the possibilities that will exist when individuals, companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies all publish valuable resources using APIs.</p>
<p>While there is still a lot of work ahead, I'm seeing the early signs of this reality emerging across my API monitoring in 2016. I'm coming across so many, extremely valuable, openly licensed, machine readable resources that can be used in some very interesting ways. The trick now, is how do we expose the most meaningful parts of these resources, and make sure they get found by the people who will actually put them to use. As the number of APIs increase, this is something that is going to get harder and harder, and the need for value even more critical.</p>
<p>Another dimension to this discussion is the growing number of channels we need to make our API resources available in. Web and mobile are still king when it comes to consuming APIs, but quickly devices, messaging, voice, bots, and other channels are growing in use. The next wave of API evangelism is going to require that the right people (domain experts) are available to help expose the most meaningful skills that our APIs posses, via these growing number of quick moving channels.</p>
<p>An example of this in action, using one of the valuable resources above, could involve making the Congressional activity that is most relevant and important to me, available in my Slack channel (or messaging app of choice), or even available via my Amazon Echo, using Alexa Voice Skills. How do we start carving out meaningful skills from government, and other open data, using simple APIs? How do we use these to educate individuals, either as an average citizen, or maybe in a professional or commercial scenario.</p>
<p>We have many, many years ahead of us, helping individuals, companies, institutions, and government understand why they need to be exposing valuable data, content, and other digital resources via simple web APIs. However, alongside these efforts, we are going to need armies of other individuals who have the ability to identify valuable resources, and help craft simple, usable, and meaningful endpoints, that can be added as skills within the web, mobile, device, messaging, bot, and voice apps of the future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-human-power.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/on-apis-and-microservices/">I have self-censored stories about microservices</a>, because I have felt the topic is as charged as linked data, REST, and some parts of the hypermedia discussion. Meaning there are many champions of the approach, who insist on telling me, and other folks how WRONG they are in the approach, as opposed to helping us work through our understanding of exactly what is microservices, and how to do well.</p>
<p>For me, when I come across tech layers that feel like this, they are something that is very tech saturated, with the usual cadre of tech bros leading the charge, often on behalf of a specific vendor, or specific set of vendor solutions. Even with this reality, I've read a number of very smart posts, and white papers on microservices in the last year, outlining various approaches to designing, engineering, and orchestrating your business, using the "microservices diet".</p>
<p>Much of what I read nails much of the technology in some very logical, and sensible ways--crafted by some people with mad skills when it comes to making sense of very large companies, and software ecosystems. Even with all of this lofty thinking, I'm seeing one common element missing in most of the microservices approaches I have digest--the human element.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of discussion about technical approaches to unwinding the bits and bytes of technical debt, but very little guidance for anyone on how to unwind the human aspect of all of this, acknowledging the years of business and political decisions that contributed to the technical debt. Its one thing to start breaking apart your databases, and systems, but its another thing to start decoupling how leadership invests in technology, the purchasing decisions that have been made, and the politics that surrounds these existing legacy systems.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but every legacy system I've ever come across almost always has had a gatekeeper, an individual, or group of individuals who will fight you to the death to defend their budget, and what they know about tech (or do not know). I've encountered systems who have a dedicated budget, which only exists because the system is legacy, and with that gone, the money goes away too--sell me a microservices solution for this scenario!</p>
<p>Another dimension to this discussion, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/10/an-imbalance-in-investment-priorities-that-will-continue-to-slow-api-growth-and-adoption/">is that investors in microservice solutions are not interested in their money being used for this area</a>. It just isn't sexy to be spending money on dealing with corporate politics, and unwinding years of piss poor business decisions, and educating and training the average business user around Internet technology. If you do not unwind these very human led, politically charged, business environments, you will never unwind the systems that exist within their tractor beams. Never. I'd care how much YOU believe.</p>
<p>In the end, I'm not trying to make you feel like you are going to fail. My goal is to encourage more investment in this area by the microservice pundits, vendors providing solutions the space, and VC's who are pouring money into these solutions. Many of the young, energetic folks at the helm of startups do not fully grasp the human side of corporate operations, and the potential quagmire that exists on the ground in front of them.</p>
<p>I am hoping that a handful of service providers out there can lower the rhetoric around their services and tooling, so that expectations get set at more realistic levels. Otherwise the push-back against the first couple failed waves of microservice implementations will become impenetrable, and blow any chance of making it work.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/21/sucked-into-the-world-of-bots-and-apis/">I have looked at way more Bots than I should have in the last couple days</a>, and I'm beginning to see&nbsp; similar patterns emerging across bot implementations, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/07/minimum-viable-api-service-provider-blueprint/">in sync with what I shared as part of my advice to API service providers</a>. After you look at hundreds of APIs, and now a couple hundred bot implementations, you really begin to see what some of the common building blocks of the successful bot implementations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain</strong> - Having a domain dedicated to the bot, its operations, and the community around it.</li>
<li><strong>Website</strong>&nbsp;- Simple, modern, and informative website for your folks to discover, and put your bot to work.</li>
<li><strong>Logo -</strong> Having a simple, modern, and often clever logo and overall branding to your bots presence.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>&nbsp;- Have a genuine, active Twitter account that actually engages in conversations with community.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong>&nbsp;- Establish an active, and useful Github presence via a dedicated user account or organization.</li>
<li><strong>Blog</strong>&nbsp;- Provide a thoughtful, active, and informative blog that engages with a community,&nbsp; customers, and the public at large.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>&nbsp;- You are using open APIs, and messaging formats to make your bot work, pay it forward with APIs and Webhooks.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization</strong>&nbsp;- You gotta make some money, how are you going to keep the lights on, feed and cloth your bot. ;-)</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;-Every bot will need support, even if it is automated. Make sure have answer questions via Twitter, and Github.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/organizations/">The most interesting bots I came across, whether they are Twitter, Slack, or Telegram bot</a>, all had at least half of the items listed above. I'm guessing we are going to see a huge surge in the number of bots that are available, as well as the platforms in which bots can operate, and I am thinking that the bots that follow these patterns will be floating to the top of the churn.</p>
<p>I'm just getting started documenting the common building blocks in this recent surge in API driven bot activity. <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com">I'll keep adding the most interesting bot solutions to my research</a>, and keep track of what I feel the best parts of the sector are. I'm curious to see where all of this goes. Not everything bot is capturing my attention right now, but I am seeing enough interesting approaches to using APIs for bot delivery, as well as providing the resources bots will need, to keep my attention.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>I'm constantly working to hand-craft, scrape-craft, and auto-generate <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Specs</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> files for as many of the top APIs I can. It is something Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>), the CEO of <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> always flicks me shit about, saying I shouldn't have to do that--API providers should be doing this! While I agree, I feel like we haven't reached the point where all providers understand the importance of having an up to date OpenAPI Spec available for their API (some even have them, and work to hide them!)</p>
<p>This is something <a href="http://sendgrid.com">the savvy API providers like SendGrid</a> are doing, rolling around Github, making sure copies of their OpenAPI Specs are up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/pull/42"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Update_SendGrid_Swagger_File_by_thinkingserious_&middot;_Pull_Request__42_&middot;_api-stack_api-stack.png" alt="" width="80%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>Thank Elmer, you da man. Now I just need to convince another 2K other API providers of the importance of having up to date machine readable API definitions available, and actively maintain them. Having your definitions up to date, and easy to find increases the chance a developer will load up in the favorite <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/organizations/">HTTP client like Postman, Postman, PAW, or API Garage</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its going to happen Steve! I tell you! Some day, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all the good API providers</span> will maintain their own API definitions. You should always have an easy to find copy available as part of your API documentation, but you should also search for them on Github, and submit pull requests to keep them up to date. It is like have little machine readable business cards for your API, sitting on the desks of developers, except with this business card allows you to submit a pull request to update.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-closed.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm seeing a significant shift in the conversations around how SaaS, and API-first platforms are planning access to their APIs. I'm seeing a pretty significant back peddling around free, and freemium access levels. I'm trying to keep notes on what I'm hearing, so that I can better understand what is causing this, and see if I can identify where the balance might exist in providing self-service access to API our valuable resources.</p>
<p>Let' me explore some of the main reasons I'm hearing for reducing, restricting, or completely doing away with these lower level areas of access:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too Many API Freeloaders - </strong>There is a growing number of poorly behaved API consumers who are just looking for a free ride.</li>
<li><strong>At Odds With Sales Teams </strong>- Free layers of access cannibalize our sales cycle, and make it harder for sales teams to close the deal.</li>
<li><strong>These Layers Do Not Convert -</strong> The users coming in at these layers are just not converting, and becoming paid customers.</li>
<li><strong>We Built It And Nobody Came - </strong>Nobody seems to care about the API, and nobody signed up for acess, so we are shutting down.</li>
<li><strong>No More Money To Support Free - </strong>We just don't have the money to pay for the infrastructure and support it takes to support.</li>
<li><strong>VC's Told Us To Focus On Enterprise -</strong> Our investors told us to focus all our attention on selling to the enterprise, consumer focus is gone.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to providing and consuming APIs, I've seen it all. I sympathize with many of these reasons for shrinking of the free tiers of access to APIs. There will be many contributing factors to why things might be off in an API community. As my friend Ed Anuff (<a href="https://twitter.com/edanuff">@edanuff</a>) focused on in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/21/almost-everyone-is-doing-the-api-economy-wrong/">his latest post about how a large number of us are doing API wrong</a>, with many companies approach to APIs being fundamentally at odds with their ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately I think that API providers WILL need to tighten down their access levels, but this can't be done without properly thinking things through. You need to consider the bigger picture, around how have planned API access, communicated and engaged with your consumers, and be honest with yourself about what you've done right, and what you've done wrong. While it might be a lot of work to manage this free level of access, and do what it right, you want to make sure you still maintain an environment where serendipity can happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then again, maybe you weren't actually interested in this happening in the first place. You were just looking to get someone to build some things for free on your resources, looking to offload the hard work on an external community. I'm not saying everyone who has a self-service, publicly available API will find success, bu the ones that work hard to strike a balance here, are more likely to have invested in all the right areas--setting the stage for a healthier balance between API provider and consumer.</p>

<p>I am slowly getting sucked into the world of bots. I've been tagging stories related to Twitter bots for some time, but it was the growing buzz of Slack bots that has really grabbed my attention. It pushed me to light up a research area, so that I can begin to look at things closer, and work to understand the common building blocks, like I do for the other areas of the API space.</p>
<p>The world of bots intrigues me, from the perspective of how APIs can be used to execute bots, but also provide the valuable resources needed to deliver bot functionality. I feel like the <a href="https://slack.com/apps">list of categories of available Slack bots</a> are somewhat telling of the business potential for bots:</p>

<p>While I find Twitter bots creative and interesting, there are many I also found annoying as hell. I've had similar responses to some of the bots I've encountered on Slack. I tend to be pretty boring when it comes to goofy shit online, so my threshold for bot silliness is low. I don't care what others do, I just don't go there that often, so you'll see me highlighting more of the business productivity bots, or the more creative ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing I think is significant, is the growing number of platforms in which bots are becoming common practice, with many of the bots operating on multiple platforms.</p>
<table style="padding-left: 15px;" width="90%">

</table>
<p>Another interesting part of this, is that not all bots are executed via API. Some bots simply use the chosen protocol of popular messaging applications, and operate via an account setup on the platform. However, even with these implementations, APIs still come into play in providing the bot with its required skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think bots are significant to API providers, and they should be working to better understand how their APIs can be used to either drive bot behavior via popular messaging platforms, as well as how bots can operate on their platform, either using APIs, or a common messaging format. There is a lot of chatter around bots online to sort through, and will be something that takes me a while to produce some coherent research, but you can keep an eye on it, as I progress via <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/">my Github research project for bots</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-samples.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>For some workshops preparation this week, I needed to isolate just the best of the API calls and documentation from handful of APIs I am trying to teach my intended audience about. <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/university-api-workshop/apis/">I have almost twenty separate companies targeted</a>, with a couple hundred individual endpoints across the API provided served up by these companies. I needed to a way to easily define, organize, and present a subset of API samples, intended for a specific purpose audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this workshop, I need the simplest, most intuitive samples possible across these popular APIs. For Twitter I need to be able to just send a tweet, or list friends, and on Facebook I need to post to my wall, and search for user. I need simple actions, that will be meaningful to my higher education audience--most likely students. I don't want to bury all of them with the endless API possibilities that surround the APIs I'm showcasing, I need the twenty use cases that they'll give a shit about, and result in them being interested in what an API is.</p>
<p>As I do with all my research, I organize my lists of APIs into APIs.json collections, and publish the results as a Github repository. This allows me to quickly assemble, relevant collections of APIs, designed for specific audiences, in a way that I can wrap with informative content and stories, helping them on-board with the importance of APIs, as well as the individual APIs. This got me thinking, because as part of an APIs.json index I have all the moving parts identified, I just need a way to simplify, and distill down into little API samples, so that I can offer up through the experience I am crafting.</p>
<p>To help me in my effort I started defining a new APIs.json API type schema, which allows me to define a sample subset of any API I have defined using OpenAPI Spec. Within each schema, I can map to a specific endpoint + method present in the OpenAPI Spec, select which parameters will be used, and what the default values and enum will be applied. I also provide a title, description, and now I have a machine readable schema for my API sample. Next, I just need to craft a simple API Samples JS library for rendering these samples into widgets and other embeddable goodies.</p>
<p>Each sample will use the security definition defined within the OpenAPI Spec to get the authentication details it needs, render it as a simple widget, which allows users to quickly make a relevant API request, and see the results immediately. This really is no different than API explorers and interactive docs like Swagger UI, but rather than providing a complete UI or docs, it provides just a sample, to help educate the API consumer around what is an API, as well as what any single API does.</p>
<p>While I think samples can live alongside the regular API docs, and explorers, within the portal of each API, I'm thinking they will become exponentially more valuable when used in a <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/">hacker storytelling</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a>, and evangelism setting. I have the base JSON schema defined for my API Samples, and once I get a working prototype for the JS client, I will publish a simple page, demonstrating a few use cases. At first I'll just be using to help people understand the value of APIs in general, as well as specific APIs, but I think future I will be able to get more sophisticated in how I tell stories around stacks of APIs, and how APIs can be assembled to accomplish bigger things than just any single API can accomplish on its own.</p>
<p>Hopefully in the near future, I will have a wealth of API Samples for the most important APIs I profile as part of my API Stack work, providing me with some valuable education and storytelling tooling to assist me in my evangelism work.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-square-star.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/university-api-workshop/">I am preparing a project for the conversations, and a workshop I have on my schedule this week at Davidson College</a>, called:&nbsp;<strong><em>Indie EdTech &amp; The Personal API.</em></strong>&nbsp;I'll be going on campus, talking to campus leadership, administrators, teachers, and students about APIs. To put myself into the right frame of mind, I wanted to explore what the concept of a personal API.</p>
<p><strong>The Concept Of Personal APIs Is Ridiculous</strong><br />First, I'll set the stage with what is a common reaction, when I mention the term "personal API" to other API folk in the space: "Its a nice idea, but it just isn't something the average person will ever need, let alone care about what an API is--it is a non problem." To me, that response sounds just like what you'd hear in early 2000's when asked if any single individual would ever need a web presence--something that blogging and the social media star has continued to&nbsp; evolve, while also proving the naysayers wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance, a personal API seems like it would be a stack of APIs that you would setup, and manage yourself. Again, something the average developer or IT person would dismiss as out of the realm of reason for the average person--there just isn't a need. I would probably agree here. While having a set of APIs that could help you manage your life bits sounds like a great idea, I just don't think the average Internet user is going to care about their digital life bits at this level--the average person will have to have a an actual problem to solve, before they will ever need and care about an API (secret is that this is true for business too)</p>
<p><strong>Everybody Already Has Personal APIs</strong><br />I prefer looking at this topic as something that has already been answered--everyone already has personal APIs! I manage all my public messages and social network using the Twitter API, my photos using the Flickr and Instagram APIs, my documents with the Google Drive and Dropbox APIs, and my email with the Gmail API. I already have a stack of personal APIs I depend on each day to drive the web and mobile applications I use for my personal and professional existence, they just are spread all over the Internet, and not owned and operated by yours truly.</p>
<p>OK, sure. These APIs aren't technically personal APIs, but they do provide API access to my personal information. For me, personal APIs are going to be just a very personal API focused journey--as well as a local destination. Even in the business API world,&nbsp;<span>where having an API is not a ridiculous notion</span>, what an API actually is, varies widely. Rarely is their a coherent stack of APIs within a company, and the reality providing and consuming APIs is actually spaghetti mess of services, open source tooling, and custom code. The API journey is always about pulling together this vision, organizing it, discovering new APIs, evolving and deprecating old ones, while also having a plan to actually conduct business in this volatile online enviornment &lt;&lt; the journey that will be no different for the individual.</p>
<p><strong>In My World There Are Two Lists Of My Personal APIs&nbsp;</strong><br />I am an API professional, and making my living with APIs, and I have two lists of what I would consider my "personal APIs". First,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">here is my master list of APIs I have hand developed</a>, then there are<a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html"> the public APIs I depend on</a>, that are developed by external people and organization. I'm guessing the first list comes closes to what someone would consider to be a stack of personal APIs. While I do prioritize the development of an API in my own stack, the reality of a modern business owner is that you depend on a whole suite of API driven services, that accomplish specific business objectives, something that is often done via integration using APIs. I also have to note, that the overlap betwen these two spheres is huge. (Bernie Sanders huge!)</p>
<p>In the end, my point is that the lines between personal and other APIs are very blurred, and will always be a mix. I have a bunch of personal and professional life bits I create, move around, and share as I need throughout any given day or week. My personal storage API is always Amazon S3, Dropbox, or Google Drive, no matter how you look at it. I make decision about which API I publish, storage, and manage files, documents, and other heavy objects, based upon where I need it, cost of storage, and any number of other factors. The leading storage API providers are my personal APIs any way you look at it, a theme that comes up again and again, blurring the concept of what a personal API is for me.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking Down The Core Personal API Stack</strong><br />To help think through this, I wanted to take a moment and break down what some of the core personal API stack might be. With my experience it is pretty easy to identify what might be the core personal API stack, <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">as one area my API research into the backend as a service (BaaS) spac</a>e, works hard to deliver many of these common objects that are used across mobile apps that developers are building today. These are just a handful of the common, end-user facing API resources that are available as part of the standard BaaS offering:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-circle-grouped.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profiles</strong>&nbsp;- The account and profile data for users.</li>
<li><strong>People</strong>&nbsp;- The individual friends and acquaintances.</li>
<li><strong>Companies</strong>&nbsp;- Organizational contacts, and relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Photos</strong>&nbsp;- Images, photos, and other media objects.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>&nbsp;- Local, and online video objects.</li>
<li><strong>Music</strong>&nbsp;- Purchased, and subscription music.</li>
<li><strong>Documents</strong>&nbsp;- PDFs, Word, and other documents.</li>
<li><strong>Status</strong>&nbsp;- Quick, short, updates on current situation or thoughts.</li>
<li><strong>Posts</strong>&nbsp;- Wall, blog, forum, and other types of posts.</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong>&nbsp;- Email, SMS, chat, and other messages.</li>
<li><strong>Payments</strong>&nbsp;- Credit card, banking, and other payments.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong>&nbsp;- Calendar, and other types of events.</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong>&nbsp;- Places we are, have been, and want to go.</li>
<li><strong>Links</strong>&nbsp;- Bookmarks and links of where we've been and going.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously there are many other objects that represent our digital existence, but to help keep things focused, I will only highlight these very common life bits we generate, store, move around, and share online each day. Depending on what we do for a living, the bits and bytes we will be managing using APIs will vary widely, but for the most part all users will have something to put into one or more of these areas of one possible&nbsp;<span>personal API stack</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Where Our Personal APIs Operate and Store Information</strong><br />With a core stack defined, let's think about where this personal API stack will live. There is no way all of these resources could possibly live in a single location, and we will always need the help of a variety of companies, organizations, government agencies, and other individuals, to help realize even this core set of personal APIs. Let's spend a moment exploring where each of these life bits already exist, and considering what our motivations around storing, syncing, syndicating, and backing up might be.</p>

<p>The APIs of these platforms are your APIs, and much of this information is never going anywhere, unless you are simply looking to backup, or sync to other locations (which you should be doing). I try to look at this as a positive, by default, you have a rich stack of APIs available, to help you manage your digital information. Whether you are a company, or an individual, you will always have to make some trade offs about how you manage your information, and ultimately where things are stored, how important the resources are, and ultimately are seeking to strike some sort of balance.</p>

<p><strong>OK, So What? Nobody Cares About Their Information</strong><br />Even if we look at APIs in this way, that our personal APIs will always be a mix of APIs across the services we use, the average individual doesn't know or care about APIs--this is a non-problem. #truth The average individual most likely will never care about the bits and bytes they generate online each day. The photos, videos, messages, and other exhaust from our daily lives can just be lost (and monetized and owned by some one lese), along with many of our memories in the physical world--not everything needs to saved.</p>
<p>Within this reality, there will always be some of the bits and bytes that we choose to look at differently. There will be situations where some videos, and some photos are more valuable than others. Maybe we are a professional speaker, and our photos and videos are used as part of our professional services. &nbsp;Maybe we are a writer, and we need to be paid for our words, either through advertisements, pay to download, and pay walls or subscriptions. There are many reasons why we will want to keep better track of our digital bits and bytes, and there will always be a need to educate new individuals around the opportunities to take control of our digital self, even with the majority of people never caring about their information.</p>
<p><strong>Personal APIs Will Always Require Regular Doses Of API Literacy</strong><br />Nobody will ever care about APIs, and put the proper thought into their existence, if they do not know about APIs. APIs are not a destination, they are a journey, and whether it is an individual, business, organization, or other entity, there has to be the proper education about what is an API, what are the APIs that are already in use. Throughout this journey, APIs will continue to evolve in their meaning, and as this understanding becomes more nuanced, so will the personal API stack.</p>
<p><strong>Personal APIs Will Evolve And Be Strengthened By Living POSSEE First</strong><br />API literacy will be exercised and strengthened through operating and managing your online domain, living a&nbsp;<a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere (POSSE)</a>&nbsp;existence. POSSE is less about your bits and bytes living within your domain, than it is about thinking critically about what your bits and bytes are, and where they do, and should live. Regular POSSE rituals help you understand the API possibilities, and experience the limitations of APIs, but also hopefully the potential of APIs, always guiding you down a path, toward your fuller awareness of what your personal API can be.</p>
<p><strong>Personal APis Will Be Defined By The Services We Use (or Don't Use!)</strong><br />Our personal APIs will always be defined by the services we use, or don't use. Having the control that we desire over our life bits amplifies the open (or the closed) nature of the services and platforms we are using. Once we are API literate, and have embarked on our a personal API journey, platforms that do not give us the control we are used to, make less sense to use. This experience will raise our expectations of the services we use, shaping our regular POSSE rituals, feeding our thoughts about what is a personal API, and driving our decisions around the online services we use, or do not use in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Personal APIs Are Validated By The Solutions They Deliver For Us</strong><br />Ultimately our personal APIs will always be defined by the solutions that they deliver. If we cannot use an API as part of our regular rituals, sync, share, and publish as we desire, an API will either never exist in the first place, or whither on the vine, and end up orphaned, and in disrepair. This reality will continue to define what is a personal API, and it will be a driving force for anyone to learn about what is an API, how to live POSSE, and making decisions around which services we use. Personal APIs will continually be validated, or invalidated, by the solutions they enable, or do not enable.</p>
<p><strong>The Need For Personal APIs Will Grow As We Take Control</strong><br />As API literacy matures, we take more control of our world through our POSSEE rituals, which are strengthened by the services and tools we use, the concept of personal APIs will grow, evolve, and take deeper root. Something that brings me back to all of the root concerns I hear from folks, about people not caring, and there is no problem or need for personal APIs. This is all true, in the average employee who subscribes to current IT norms. This is all true, in the average online digital citizen, who subscribes to current Silicon Valley, tech industry norms. I see the naysayers of the concept of the personal API, as the gatekeepers of traditional power structures, with the handful of us who strike out our our personal API journeys, simply demanding to live a somewhat safer, saner, and healthier life in the cracks of this digital circus.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-skills.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm evaluating the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa">Alexa Voice Service ecosystems</a> alongside leading API messaging platforms like Telegram, and Slack, who are changing the way users engage and communicate, but also are evolving how we are putting our API driven resources to work. As I do this research, I keep finding myself coming <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit">back to Amazon's concept of an Alexa Skill</a>, and thinking about how it applies to average everyday APIs like mine.</p>
<p>Do my APIs have the skills they need to compete in this new voice and bot enabled world? It is bad enough that I don't always have the skills necessary to compete as a programmer, but now my APIs have to have the right skills? WTF ;-) Seriously though, I feel the Amazon's concept of the "skill" reflects a wider experiental shift in the API space, where APIs need to deliver information and other digital resources in the context of how they will be experienced by users, and not just how they are stored and maintained by developers and IT operations.</p>
<p>Since there is such a diverse amount of APIs out there, what exactly consitutes as a "skill" could vary widely. If you are person or business directory, the skill might be returning the website address or phone number for an individual or business. If you are an email or SMS service it might be simply send a message to an individual. The concept of a skill further come into focus when you think in context of Alexa Voice Service, or as Amazon puts it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Alexa, the voice service that powers Amazon Echo, provides capabilities, or skills, that enable customers to interact with devices in a more intuitive way using voice. Examples of skills include the ability to play music, answer general questions, set an alarm or timer, and more.</em></p>
<p>How does this same way of thinking apply when we are communicating in Slack? Does my API have the same skills to identify that someone just asked a question, or possible executed a keyboard shortcut, and can respond intelligently, in real-time, with the expected behavior the user is anticipating? In addition to having the right skills, <a href="https://api.slack.com/bot-users">Slack is also asking if our APIs can enable Bot Users</a> to be <em><a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/when-it-comes-to-bots-the-beer-test-might-be-more-important-than-the-turing-test-596af0032e09#.6z31hop40">"</a></em><span><em><a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/when-it-comes-to-bots-the-beer-test-might-be-more-important-than-the-turing-test-596af0032e09#.6z31hop40">delightful, interesting, and fun"</a>-</em>-significantly raising the bar for what is expected.</span></p>
<p>As with the evolution of our own personal and professional skills, it will take some practice to develop the new skills that our APIs will need to be successful in this evolving landscape. Something that cannot even begin, unless we have already embarked our own API journey, exposing valuable data, content, and other resources as APIs, while also having in place an efficient way to add, and evolve our API resources. Only then can we start really polishing and honing our API skills, to operate via voice enabled platforms like Alexa, and the next generation of messaging platforms like like <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>
<p>All of a sudden I feel like my APIs are just a teenager who is typing up their first resume, headed out to find their first job interview, so they can afford a car, and go out on their first date.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>I was experimenting with breaking apart <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> over the weekend, and exploring different ways of assembling the moving parts into different types of tools, visualizations, and other goodies. I do not have any particular objective with this work, other than just pushing the boundaries of we dynamically tell the story of our APIs, and hopefully assist in moving forward the current available API documentation toolbox we have for API providers, and consumers.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/13/api-definition-driven-visualizations-verb-tag-clouds/">Yesterday I published a short piece on API definition driven tag clouds</a>,&nbsp;and this morning I have an API definition driven autocomplete text box, providing access to the paths, verbs, or tags present in any single, or multiple OpenAPI Specs that are indexed using APIs.json.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/autocomplete/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/sms-apisjson-autocomplete.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>This particular edition of the <a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/autocomplete/">API.json and OpenAPI Spec autocomplete</a> pulls across the <a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/">SMS API providers included in my SMS API research</a>, but is something that will be available for any of my research areas, as part of my ever evolving set of APIs.json tooling. I will be building these into my own custom API design tooling, allowing me to quickly recall <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">the hundreds of endpoints available in my API stack</a>, as well as learn about <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">additional API endpoints available in the 3rd party APIs I already depend on</a>.</p>
<p>I am going to also play with how I can use across the documentation of the APIs that I include in my research. Ultimately I would like to see these types of solutions available as a suite of UI, and UX tools in my overal API driven, hacker storytelling toolbox, allowing me to better tell stories around what APIs can do.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/08/playing-with-concepts-around-simplifying-the-api-docs-that-are-generated-using-api-definitions/">I am playing with different ways of exploring APIs</a>, building on documentation solutions like <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lucybot/lucy-console">Lucybot Console</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate</a>. I want to push the boundaries of how we document, tell stories, and understand our APIs. I'm playing with two different formats, one is driven using Jekyll + Liquid, and the other are more embeddable JavaScript editions. I haven't hit on anything groundbreaking, but I am having fun breaking up the API definitions of common APIs, and organizing them for different experiences.</p>
<p>This weekend I took <a href="http://theapistack.com/tags.html">my API Stack tag cloud</a>, and made it driven by API collections defined using APIs.json and OpenAPI Spec. Instead of driving it from a simple tag JSON file, I wired it up to the APIs.json for each of my research projects, and it loops through each API that is indexed, finds their OpenAPI Spec, and uses various elements to publish as tags.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/verb-tag-cloud/">First I applied to my SMS research, to help me understand the verb usage across the APIs</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/verb-tag-cloud/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tag-cloud-verb-sms.png" alt="" width="50%" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>Then I wanted to scale it, and <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/apisjson/verb-tag-cloud/">see what the tag cloud would look like when applied to a larger collection:</a></p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/apisjson/verb-tag-cloud/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tag-cloud-verb-indie-collection.png" alt="" width="50%" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>I'm not sure if these visualizations offer me any value, but it gets me thinking about APIs at the macro level, considering different ways to slice and dice the information available as part of any of the API's indexed. The verb tag cloud is extracted from an API I have that returns the verb count for any APIs.json collection, which gives me one possible data point to consider when quantifying how open, or closed an API is. Its not always constant, due to the wide variety of ways people design their APIs, but when you see an API that is all GET, there is good chance they are pretty tight with their resources.</p>
<p>As a quick next step, <a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/tag-cloud/">I also connected it up to the tags applied across all the OpenAPI Specs indexed, looking a different slice of the surface area of APIs</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/tag-cloud/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tag-cloud-sms.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>I'm just iterating through the possibilities, and along the way creating an API, Liquid, and JavaScript version to each approach. We'll see where I go with all of this. I am hoping eventually I hit on a killer approach, or at the very least, a whole toolbox of API definition driven visual API elements, that can be used across documentation, and storytelling around what is possible with an API.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/09/amazons-new-smart-pitcher-is-a-piece-of-a-larger-p.aspx">I was reading a post on Amazon's new SMART(Surveillance Marketed As Revolution Techonology) water pitcher</a>, which is more about Amazon's new connected device partner commerce strategy, than it is about this individual connected device example. The quote from the story explains the strategy pretty well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Last week, Amazon.com curiously devoted an entire press release to a water pitcher. But not just any water pitcher. Rather, Amazon detailed a new partnership with Brita to bring consumers the $45 smart Brita Infinity Pitcher. Just connect it to your Wi-Fi, and the Brita Infinity Pitcher will automatically track how much water passes through its filter. Then, using Amazon Dash Replenishment, it'll automatically order a new filter when a replacement is needed.</em></p>
<p>So now, your pitchers orders its replacement filters, your lights will order new bulbs, your printer will order more of those wonderfully expensive print cartridges for you. At a consumer level, most of this seems pretty lazy to me, and unnecessary, but then again, I do not represent mainstream society in any way. Having your common devices in your life, order up their replacement parts, or even servicing, seems pretty attractive, but is something I'm sure we won't consider the downside until its way to late.</p>
<p>Ok, let's stop for a second. There is your new startup idea Jane / Joe entrepreneur, "the Angie's List + Dash Replenishment == service scheduling API platform". My cable modem calls for a service provider when the modem needs replaced with newer model, my refrigerator and dishwasher call repair(wo)man when they are not running at optimal levels. When you get your funding, make sure and cut me in for a point or two. ;-)</p>
<p>Well, as with 96% of this API circus, I'm not highlighting this because I think it is a good idea, I am talking about because it is happening, and will begin impacting the rest of us. As more of our everyday objects are being connected to the Internet, I want to understand the technical, business, and politics aspects of what is happening behind the scenes. Honestly the consumer vision of this doesn't really get me fully interested, but I could see it being used in some pretty interesting ways in a commercial, and industrial environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-replenishment-service">Amazon Dash Replenishment</a> is an interesting layer of any home, or small business, and as an API driven vehicle for commerce. I'm sure Amazon is going to do very well with it. I will keep an eye on what they are doing, as well as in any other implementations in a commercial and industrial settings, and keep thinking about what is possible, both the good, and the bad.</p>

<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Datensparsamkeit.html">I am borrowing from the very prescient post from Martin Fowler</a>, an older post, but is a topic that should be revisited regularly. Google translate tells me Datensparsamkeit means "data minimization". I prefer Fowler's translation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>It's an attitude to how we capture and store data, saying that we should only handle data that we really need.</em></p>
<p>My partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) sent me the link, and expressing that it was very telling that we (United States) do not have a word that applies for this concept. I think data minimization gets the point across, but I think Fowler elevates it from being just a data process, to something that should be rooted in company culture.</p>
<p>I am adding&nbsp;Datensparsamkeit as a building block to any area of the API life cycle that will potentially store data. The goal is to help API platforms consider &nbsp;how they capture and store data at the strategy level, as well as tactically at every stop along the API life cycle, and only capture and store exactly what you need, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Just because cloud storage is cheap doesn't mean we should capture and store everything we can--just because we can, doesn't mean we sould. <a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/09/11/data-is-a-liability-not-an-as.html">Data can just as easily be a liability as it can be an asset</a>, and your machinations around there being an all knowing, all seeing big data future are pure fantasy. The real trouble becomes clear when you realize that the majority of the tech sector, and the NSA, kind of enjoy living in this fantasy world.</p>

<p>One topic that has been present in numerous discussions lately is just how much work goes into designing, deploying, and managing APIs, as well as around the integration between the growing number of APIs. It keeps coming up in conversations with existing API service providers, as well as internal actors within small business, enterprise, and government API efforts.</p>
<p>When you live and breathe API, it all just makes sense in your head, but as API architects, designers, and believers trying to shepherd forward your API within existing organizations, it will come up against many unanticipated challenges.&nbsp;I have discussed this before with my stories about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/07/75-of-your-api-efforts-in-the-enterprise-will-be-cultural-and-political-not-technical/">75% of your API efforts in the enterprise being cultural and political, not technical</a>, and with a short one <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/14/your-api-strategy-provide-a-glimpse-into-your-company-culture/">on your API strategy providing a glimpse into your company culture</a>. In any API journey, there will always be numerous business, political, and ultimately human obstacles between you and the API success you see in your head, something that takes investment, and access to the right expertise and resources.</p>
<p>In conversations with API tooling and service providers lately, the need to focus more resources in training, development, and integration services has come up several times. It is good that companies in the space are recognizing the need, and investing in what is needed. Where the imbalance in all of this begins to show up, is that it isn't something these companies are willing to highlight as a core competency on their site, or in my storytelling, because it is viewed as a potential negative with investors. I am guessing that investment in training, development and integration services just isn't trendy enough for VCs.</p>
<p>I get it. Investors want to put their money into the coolest tools, the ones that match all the stories they are hearing. However I can't help but feel this positioning is creating an imbalance that is preventing some very interesting tools, and API driven solutions from getting the traction they need in some very real world use cases, because they can't properly invest in these areas. If I'm seeing this behavioral adjustment from just a handful of startups, who have valuable API services, and resources, but are still seeking funding and adoption, I'm guessing there is a wider imbalance that I may not be seeing, at companies who haven't opened up to me.</p>
<p>I guess, ultimately I am just asking companies who are embarking on their API journey to invest more in company-wide API literacy training, development, and integration services. I'm also asking API service providers who are selling the valuable tools and services, to make sure and invest in these areas as well (publicly if you can). Then finally I am asking VC's to loosen up your views on how you see these areas, and understand the potentially negative impact on the API focused companies in your portfolio, even if they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> the next big thing. Personally, I'm betting this whole investment game ends up being like Bitcoin, with each additional block in the chain being a little harder and harder to mine, something that takes incrementally more and more resources, and the companies who have the on-demand training, development, and integration services ready to go, will do well.</p>

<p>When a startup goes away, either through acquisition, or any other reason, and I find the site dormant, with a friendly goodbye message, or just gone, I usually just remove the tag from them in my primary system, and they are gone from my research with the next publishing of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Parse announced they are turning off the lights, and Kimono Labs said they were going away after an "acquisition" by Palantir, I started putting more thought into what I was going to do at the time of deprecation. I want to be able to capture more of these stories. I actually have a lot of data, content, notes, and analysis on these companies that are going away, and I need to do a better job making it all accessible.</p>
<p>To support this effort <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/organization-deadpool/">I am beginning to add a dead pool page to each of my research areas</a>, where I will simply re-tag any company or organization that is present in my research, when the shut off the lights--providing a single place where we can see our recent history.</p>

<p>I find it valuable to have this recent history, right at my fingertips, when I am trying to understand where each of my research areas are headed. Without the actual companies to reference I am reliant on my own memory, which isn't always the best. In the tech space, I feel like we are good at focusing on the future, and we easily forget the past, even what just happened last month.</p>
<p>I am always amazed at which startups just go away, without any notice. Many of them do not have customers, but some of them do, and many of them have aksed me for my thoughts on the space, and on their road maps. Part of having a deprecation page is also to inform newcomers that the road is littered with corpses of those who came before them, but to also provide me with a constant reminder that when I am having these conversations with new players, that I put pressure on them to have a better strategy for when things go wrong--not everyone wins in this game.</p>

        <p>It definitely sucks that Parse went away like they did, but you have to commend them on the <a href="https://www.parse.com/">page they left behind</a>. Facebook put up the download link to an open source version of Parse Server, and a link to the migration guide. I like that they also left up the blog, which I think is almost just as important as the code, telling the story of what happened, right up to the end.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.parse.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/parse-page.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I come across newly deprecated API providers, and API service providers all the time. Most of the time they are just dormant, nothing going on but the site is up, and other times the website is just gone, with no message at all. I rarely ever come across anyone who puts up an open source version of their platform, with instructions on what to do next, and leave the blog up.</p>
<p>If you are running an API, or a service that caters to the API space, and you are facing shutting everything down, feel free to reach out, and I'm happy to put up a splash page, help organize a Github repo of any server, and client code, as well as your API definitions. I'm happy to pay for the domain, so that the work you did doesn't go away, and people can learn from, and in some cases build off of what you did.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>I am building on my conversation with&nbsp;<span>Abhinav Asthana (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/a85">@a85</a><span>), the&nbsp;Co-founder and CEO&nbsp;of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, around <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/07/it-would-be-nice-to-have-some-simpler-interactive-api-documentation-in-addition-to-what-we-have-now/">how we can simplify the API documentation we are providing to our API consumers</a>. As part of my work to profile the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">50+ stacks of APIs I list on my home page</a>, I am playing with different ways of listing APIs, sharing the valuable endpoints available within, and other key aspects with users. All this work is being driven by <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">Open API Spec</a> listings.</p>
<p>First I've rewritten <a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/">my main API listing page using Liquid, running in Jekyll</a>, which uses a _data folder full of APIs.json, and OpenAPI Specs published as part of each of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">my API life cycle, or API stack research</a>. To operate, this listing just mounts the _data folder, and loops through all APIs.json files it contains, then parses each property present, giving special attention to OpenAPI Spec, and API plan formats.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/sms-api-organization-listing.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> + <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, running on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> gives me a simple, static way of representing the machine readable indexes I generate for any of my research areas using APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and my new API plan format. Jekyll gives me the entire contents of the API definitions I'm storing in my _data folder, as a single Liquid object which I can loop through, to generate the static HTML for my listing of APIs. Using this approach gives me a machine readable index of all the moving parts of any single, or multiple API collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/">The list of SMS APIs in this research is pretty verbose</a>. I'm not even listing out the parameters, headers, and other details of each API, and the listings are pretty involved--further backing up&nbsp;Abhinav thoughts around simplifying the API documentation that we are generating. To help me push forward my Liquid skills, and the possibilities around breaking up the properties of each API defined using APIs.json, I took the same code and generated a separate, <a href="http://sms.stack.network/plans/">trimmed down version which only shows the APIs overview, and the details of their API plans, leaving out the details of each API endpoint</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/plans/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/nexmo-api-plans.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>While the static approach to generating HTML, using Liquid, Jekyll, and APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and API plan, has given me a lot of control, and I will keep pushing forward a toolbox of Liquid, Jekyll + JSON modules, I wanted to also push forward a JavaScript solution as well. Using Jquery, I basically recreated what I was doing with Liquid, giving me JavaScript array containing the APIs.json index of APIs. Now I know I can loop through, and share all the API details just as I listed above, but using JS I wanted to go beyond the Liquid representation, and make smaller, more embeddable API documentation solutions, that wouldn't be bound to a Jekyll site, if you didn't want them to be.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/bycollection/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/sms-apis-by-collection.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/">In my SMS research, I am profiling nine separate APIs</a>, which each have its own APIs.json indexing each of the APIs, there is also a root APIs.json for the SMS research, which includes each of the sub API collections. I wanted to start here, and share a simple list of the API endpoints contained within each collection.</p>
<p>This gives me a nice, potentially human readable,&nbsp; list of the API endpoints available within any single API collection. I wanted to see what else I could do, and instead of using each APIs.json collection as the anchor point, I focused on the tags that were being applied to each API, within its Open API Spec, grouping all the endpoints by tag.</p>
<p>This gives me to quick, alternate vantage points of my API collections. While I like browsing the entire collection in detail via the main page, I can see the potential in understanding these resources on a new level, when I break them down by provider, or tags applied. One thing this brought to the surface for me, is how poorly, and inconsistently some of the API definitions are, but once I clean up the summaries and tags across these APIs, I'm thinking it could be some pretty powerful JuJu.</p>
<p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apisjson/bytag/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/sms-api-by-tag.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Ok, so WTF am I doing here? Why does it matter? I am decoupling the benefits that API definition driven, interactive documentation like Swagger UI, Apiary, and Lucybot Console have brought us. None of this is functional like Swagger UI is, I am just focusing on the decoupling of the surface area of any API, or collections of API, next I will play around with making things minimally interactive, like being able to make a simple GET call for an API, or maybe a POST as well--it will come with time.</p>
<p>I want to see some simple, embeddable, and easy to read and use API documentation, which could potentially have ALL the moving parts of an API, or a collection of APIs, but might also give you a sub, or cross section of the details of the API(s), and the value that is contained within. Not sure where all of this is going, I just wanted to play with Liquid and JavaScript driven APIs.json tooling, while also thinking further about what&nbsp;Abhinav and I talked about. Eventually I'd love to see a wealth of open, API definition driven modules, that API providers can use across their portals, but also API service providers like&nbsp;Abhinav can use in their API tooling, like Postman.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>If you follow my blog at all you know <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">I love Noun Project icons</a>. I started using them with my last minimal website design, and is something I've carried over with the latest edition. I've been using some images for so long I even started reworking, remixing, and making my own images, to help me tell my API stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it difficult to conjure up just the right image, or images, to represent many very abstract API concepts, so it is something I am constantly working on alongside my research, as well as writing. As I was working on <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/">the content for a workshop I am doing at Davidson College this month</a>, I wanted to have a simple, icon-based way for expressing just how open an API is (or isn't). &nbsp;My first crack at coming up with an icon set, breaks things down into three distinct groups.</p>
<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="33%" align="center">
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>API (Flowing)</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-rating-1.png" alt="" width="200" align="middle" /></p>
</td>
<td width="33%" align="center">
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>API (Just Is)</strong></p>

<td width="33%" align="center">
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>API (Not Flowing)</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-rating-3.png" alt="" width="200" align="middle" /></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>My objective here is to provide a quick and easy way to help articulate how open an API is or isn't. Right now, these icons are set manually by me, based upon my overall feeling of the platform, the access they offer (or don't), terms of service, and overall business model. This will evolve in the future, as I have a lot of data that could also influence these ratings, but for now, it is all me. (Mwahahahaaaa)</p>
<p>In this particular use case, <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/">I want to help university students better understand the many types of APIs</a>, but in the future I'd like to evolve the ranking, and the icon set to be more meaningful, and apply across all of my research, anywhere you come across an API. I also just like playing with icons, and using my mad graphic design skills (not).&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Full Disclosure:</strong> The faucet idea was Audrey's idea, but she doesn't like the faucets I ended up using--maybe I'll switch them out with another set in future.</em></p>

<p>I was being interviewed by an IBM group the other day, and I scribbled some thoughts on a piece of paper as I was rambling, which I just picked up trying to make sense of what was going through my mind, before I archive the chicken scratches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It look like during the call I was talking about how I see the world of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a>, based upon how I am currently organizing providers, services, and tooling that I find. I was discussing with them how I am moving towards breaking things down into four buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gateway</strong> - The more enterprise focused, IT department led API efforts, usually conducted at larger enterprises, and institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Artisan</strong> - A more farm to table, hand crafted approach that employs organic open source REST frameworks in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - Leverage the latest breed of cloud API service providers that allow you to deploy APIs from common resources online.</li>
<li><strong>Serverless</strong> - Outdoing the artisan hipster approach, all the cool kids are doing it without servers, piece by piece using Iron.io and Lambda.</li>
</ul>
<p>My <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment research</a> has just been a single list of service providers, and open source tooling for the last couple of years. Its time I started breaking things down a little more, and helping my readers find solutions based upon a more realistic approach to how APis are being deployed in the wild, or at least within their organizations.</p>
<p>I almost added database as layer here, but I want to keep these API deployment buckets more about the middle layer in between the backend infrastructure, and the clients that wll be consuming API resources. API deployment touches on API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a> and <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, and stops short of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management</a>, with some overlap with <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com">containers</a>, and <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">API virtualization</a>.</p>
<p>This post also reveals the fact that I write most of these stories to help me think through the world of APis, get my thoughts in order, and help formalize them a little bit further, as I try to articulate to myself, (and you) via the this blog.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/06/numerous-challenges-when-it-comes-to-comparing-even-similar-api-plans/">As I made my way through nine of the leading SMS providers, profiling the details of their API plans</a>, trying to bring it all together into a single, machine readable definition, <a href="https://messente.com/documentation/pricing">Messente's pricing API stood out for me</a>. Alongside their SMS API, and their number lookup API, they have a pricing API. As I take a moment to look at the simplicity of the endpoint, I am also thinking about the potential, and the details of their API docs really stand out for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://messente.com/documentation/pricing"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/messente-prices-api.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to a pricing API being a valuable utility for any API consumer, I can't help but think the process of constructing a pricing API would force API providers to think another layer deeper in their API plan(s). Similar to how you have to think through the details of any resource you make available via an API, considering how it will be put to use, crafting a pricing API would force you to do the same for one of the most valuable, and overlooked resources you offer, that is core to all of your API operations.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">I've talked about the importance of API providers having management level APIs before</a>, and I think they should also follow <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/12/apis-in-the-most-mature-sectors-have-pricing-apis/">the lead of API providers like Messente who exist in a pretty mature sector, and have a handle on their API pricing</a>. I've said it before, and will keeping harping on this issue...<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/easier-to-offer-ops-apis-to-your-devs-if-your-api-service-provider-has-apis/">that all API providers and their service providers should have pricing APIs</a>, as well as APIs for the other essential building blocks of their API operations.</p>
<p>Another thing to note here, that I will be writing about more in the future, is the presence of two-letter country code as a parameter for an API. While not all APIs will have country specific pricing like SMS providers do, the API providers who are looking to truly operate globally, you will need to continue the automation of your operations, making pricing available on demand, in any currency that consumers will need.</p>

<p>I try to spend time each week evaluating what types of companies are looking for API / developer evangelist / advocates, to help keep my awareness in sync with what mainstream companies are needing (or not), when it comes to API outreach. In a little under an hour last night, I found almost 70 companies who had job postings for an evangelist or advocate for their platform.</p>
<p>Google, Brightcove, Pubnub, Atlassian, Yahoo, Uber, Esri, Indix, Couchbase, edX, Amazon, Verifone, IBM Strongloop, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, Impinj, Twilio, Cybersource, Shopify, Jibo Inc., Vidyo, UrtheCast, Talend, Stormpath, Square, Mailjet, Cylance In., Bandwidth, MediaMath, Nuxeo, Clarifai, NodePrime, Visa, UrtheCast, Stream.io, mLab, FullContact, Sumo Logic , Twitch, Auth0, Iron.io, Wercker, ANS Affiliates Solutions, Okta, Button, Lever, PlayFab, DreamFactory, Nitrous, Firebase, IBM, Accurate Background, Inc., PagerDuty, Coda Search, Aerospike, SGF Global , Bodymedia, DataBricks, Dropbox, Heroku, Gitlab, New RElic, Crate.io, Asana, Vaadin, Ionic, Neura, and Algolia.</p>
<p>I gathered these company names, after looking around LinkedIn, Indeed, and a couple of Google searches, over the course of an hour. I'm sure I would find even more if I kept on looking. As the API Evangelist, I have had a handful of these companies reach out, asking if I'm interested in the job, or possibly know someone that would be. Another seasoned evangelist, Keith Casey (<a href="https://twitter.com/CaseySoftware">@CaseySoftware</a>), Twilio Alum, and Director of Product at <a href="https://twitter.com/clarifyio">@ClarifyIO</a>, who also lives with a similar amount of attention from recruiters, responded like this when I shared the list with him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/CaseySoftware"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/keith-casey.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><em>I&rsquo;ve been contacted by at least 6 on that list in the last week or so.. I end up shutting down most conversations with three questions:</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>#1 What group do you evangelists report to?<br /></em><em>#2 What metrics are your evangelists measured on?<br /></em><em>#3 What current marketing channels are working for you?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>Sometimes but if they can&rsquo;t answer question #2, then it&rsquo;s all made up anyway, and question #3 may answer that too. if they&rsquo;re seeing traction from events, blog posts, Github/lab, that will shape the priorities -- the worst groups are people who can â*only*â answer #1.</em></p>
<p>Some pretty sound advice for folks who are looking to screen which API providers have their shit together, and which ones do not. I guess inversely, it is also some pretty good advice for you platforms who are seeking evangelists to think about, before you embark on your search. In my experience, if a brand new role is being created at an organization for an evangelist / advocate, and that individual is brand new to that organization, you probably won't be working there more that 14-18 months--have a plan B.</p>
<p>This is an area of the API sector I will work to keep an eye on, as APIs continue their slow shift into the mainstream business consciousness, and the demand grows. I am working with both&nbsp;<a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a>, and <a href="http://api.network/">API.Network</a> to better understand what the demand is around API evangelism and developer advocacy, what companies are needing, as well as how to better match folks looking to developer their career in the area of evangelism. As I spend time working on this subject, I also notice other seasoned evangelism veterans, offering their experience up as well:</p>

<p>It all has the smell of another period of growth for the discipline of API evangelism and developer advocacy, which I'm hoping we'll see some evolution of the craft, but honestly I'm just hoping the new players, both evangelist and provider, just take time to listen to the wisdom of pioneers like Keith Casey and Brandon West, and thoughtfully assemble your outreach programs, and teams, before you consider pushing the conversation forward--meaning join in the existing conversation first.</p>

<p>As I finish writing a piece on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/07/the-70-platforms-with-job-postings-for-a-developer-evangelist-or-advocate-currently/">the 70 platforms who are looking for an API evangelist or developer advocate currently</a>, sharing the wisdom of leading evangelist I follow in the space, I am also working to gather up my own wisdom so that I can share. While i am not an evangelist for a single API, I was at one point in my career, and I also practice many of the same techniques in my own work, evangelizing for all APis.</p>
<p>Out of my lists of advice for existing, and new API evangelists, one stands out: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">take care of yourself.</span>&nbsp;Make sure and find balance in what you do, or you will burn out. You can ask anyone who has been in the scene for a while, and they'll tell you the same thing. However my message is ringing my ears right now, because I hit a wall last year with evangelism, and part of it was due to a fairly scary health concern.</p>
<p>In 2015, I finally settled down long enough to get health insurance (thanks Obama, jeez ;-), and made it to the doctor, who told me my liver wasn't functioning as expected, was fatty, overloaded, and sending out some pretty bad signals to the rest of my body. When you look through my timeline on Twitter or Facebook, it is pretty easy to understand why this is---no surprise here.</p>
<p>Anyways, luckily the liver is (hopefully) a pretty resilient part of the body, something that will recover now that I'm NOT drinking, not traveling, and getting more exercise. Anyways, I just wanted to take the opportunity to caution other evangelist out there to be careful, and make sure that finding balance is a priority, or you may find yourself in a situation where you might not be able to recover. I hate being the old dude of the bunch, but please take care of yourself, the work we do is important.&nbsp;</p>

He was tweeting about API documentation, and I chimed in with my support, about how we need to keep evolving our approach to delivering API documentation so that they speak to a diverse audience.</p>

<p>While I think we have come along ways with the introduction of <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>, making learning about APIs much more interactive, and hands on, I think its time to look at how we can further refine how we deploy API documentation for our users.</p>
<p>There is a lot going on with an API sometimes, and listing out all your endpoints, parameters, example requests, responses, and other elements can be overwhelming for new users who are just looking to learn the basics of an API, or possibly just get at s single resource, completing a specific action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swagger UI, and similar API definition driven documentation like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/25/a-new-open-source-interactive-api-documentation-from-folks-over-at-lucybot/">Lucybot API Console</a>, do well in providing a comprehensive set of documentation for a potentially wide variety of API docs, but we need to keep scratching. I'm not exactly sure what the answer here is, but I'd love to see much more simpler, embeddable, API documentation emerge. Solutions that allow API providers to display a small set of precise APIs, or possibly come up with some sort of slick user interface (UI), that delivers a simpler, more meaningful user experience (UX) that speaks to what a specific group of users is needing.</p>
<p>This is not a well-formed idea of mine, but is something I want to get out early. I'm seeing an increase in the number of new API documentation resources lately, and hopefully I can influence at least one or two of their road maps with my ideas. <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com/">This is one reason I've broke out my API documentation research out of my API management research</a>.&nbsp;I have numerous ideas for new types of smaller, more bite-size API docs, as well as more embeddable, and visual API docs as well--having a research project setup gives me a single repo to think about, and publish these ideas.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://sms.stack.network/plans/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/twilio-api-plan.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was pushing forward my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan research</a> this weekend, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">building on some of the tooling I developed during the last round</a>, and the <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-a-json-representation-for-the-plans-for-many-of-the-leading-apis/">machine readable API plan format I hammered out late last year to help me define API plans</a>. This time I'm applying it <a href="http://sms.stack.network/">to nine of the SMS API providers I'm currently profiling</a>, trying to get a new view of the plans of SMS APIs like Twilio and Plivo, but also working &nbsp;to continue polishing my 100K view on the SMS API industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Documenting The API Plans Of Nine SMS APIs</strong><br /><a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/">This last friday I got to work profiling the pricing, plans, rate limits, and access tiers for nine of the leading SMS API providers that I keep an eye on</a>. From their pricing pages I gathered the common metrics, limitations, geographic considerations, pricing, and other element offered by each provider, putting them into separate buckets, standardizing how I record these valuable aspects of each API providers resource. This is a process I'd say 1/3 of the time falls right into place, 1/3 of the time it takes some translation and massaging to make it fit, and the other 1/3 things just don't fit into any common way of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying The Common Metrics&nbsp;</strong><br />I found it pretty easy to identify the common metrics applied to SMS APIs, as most everything revolving around the concept of the message and a number. There are nuances to these resources that are being metered, like the separation between SMS and MMS, and a local phone number, toll free phone number, and a short codes, but for now I'm just trying to put pricing into common buckets, by loosely grouping the metrics that are applied via API plans.</p>
<p><strong>List of Pricing Across SMS APIs</strong><br />Along with identifying the common metrics being applied to SMS APIs, I was able to establish a list of the pricing that is being leveraged across these providers. I have machine readable entries for sending and receiving SMS or MMS, setup and rental fees associated with purchasing numbers, and short codes. I have ways of separating out fixed costs, such as fees, or per unit calls, as well as being able to handle ranges, and different rates and limitation being applied to different packages. It is far from perfect, but I am feeling pretty good about it as v1 of the API plan format.</p>
<p><strong>Linking Plan Metrics To Resources</strong><br />One big disconnect for me currently is being able to fully understand how metrics, limits, and pricing applies to API consumption, such as a linkage between a specific API plan element, and an individual API endpoint, and method. Another dimension of this is that most API plan elements represent a small portion of all the API endpoints available--meaning you only pay for sending message, procuring a short code number, and not for doing configuration, logging, and other more utility endpoints. I have a way to link each plan element to a specific path or verb, but I won't be implementing until I apply this to more API providers. I am not going to worry about this one right now, as I know it will happen in one of the next sprints for this work.</p>
<p><strong>The Unclear World of Limitations</strong><br />Another big gray area that I am not sure how I will deal with completely, is the murkiness of how rate limits that are applied. Only in some cases are limits actually broken down in detail, including where the ceilings are. Most of the time, the pricing is used as a governor for rate limits, meaning if you can afford it, there are no limits. For now, I will just state "unclear" if I don't know where the limits are, and most likely just leave as an individual transaction, as opposed to when labeling it as "range", or "unlimited", as I do in other cases. While I think API limits will come into focus as I profile more APIs, I also know this will continue to be a murky area for some providers, either because of a lack of vision when it comes business strategy, or in some cases provides will be trying to obfuscate the limitations so they don't scare consumers off. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>More API Plan Profiling Before I Iterate Further</strong><br />There are many challenges present within as I work to compare these similar API plans, but as a first crack, I'm pretty stoked with what I have been able to accomplish, and make machine readable. In addition to i<a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis/">ncluding this data in the API listing for my API plan research</a>, I also <a href="http://sms.stack.network/plans/">broke it out separately into a view that showcases the API plan details across all nine SMS API providers</a>. I find it valuable to look at the plan elements alongside all of the API endpoints, but I also find it extremely valuable to see how the APIs plans size up against each other, without the technical details of the APIs distracting me--I like APIs, more than I like money. :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next. I'm going to move my research into some of the other more mature API stacks like email, compute, storage, and other essential building blocks for websites, mobile, and device based apps. Too establish the draft format for my API plans format, I looked at 60+ diverse APIs, but for this sprint i wanted to target a handful of APIs, present within common business verticals. Before I iterate on the API plan format any further, I want to make sure it works for defining the details of individual API plans, but also does it in a way that makes it easy to compare the plans for similar APIs, in a specific business vertical as well. This SMS research provided me with a first implementation of API plans applied across nine separate, but similar APIs, but it is also available as <a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis.json">a machine readable index for the business of these APIs, within the APIs.json files for each API, as well as the APIs.json for the overall SMS API collection</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-scraping.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was looking to create an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> plus <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec(s)</a> for the <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/">WordPress.org API</a>, and the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html">Instructure Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) API</a>. I am pulling together a toolkit to support a workshop at Davidson College in North Carolina this month, and I&nbsp;<a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/">wanted a handful of APIs that would be relevant to students, and faculty on campus</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my experience, when it comes to documenting large APIs using OpenAPI Spec, you don't want to be hand rolling things, making auto generation essential. There are two options for accomplishing this, 1) I can use a proxy like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/05/automated-mapping-of-the-api-universe-with-charles-proxy-dropbox-openapi-spec-and-some-custom-apis/">Charles</a> or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/16/automagically-defining-your-api-infrastructure-as-you-work-using-stoplightio/">Stoplight.io</a>, or 2) I can write a script to scrape the publicly available HTML documentation for each API. While I do enjoy playing with mapping out APIs in Stoplight.io, allowing it do the heavy lifting of crafting each API definition, sometimes there is more relevant meta data for the API available in the API documentation.</p>
<p>The OpenAPI Spec, plus APIs.json files for both the <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/data/wordpress/apis.json">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam//data/instructure-canvas/apis.json">Instructure Canvas</a> APIs took me about an hour a each, to write the script, and round off the OpenAPI Spec, making sure it was as complete as possible. Through scraping, I get description for endpoints, parameters, and sometimes I also get other detail including sample responses, enum, and response codes.</p>
<p>One downside of obtaining an API definition by scraping, is that I only get the surface area of an API, not the responses, and underlying data model. Sometimes this is included in documentation, but I do not always harvest this--waiting until I can get a often more correct schema, when I map out using a proxy or via HAR file. This is OK. I find the trade-off worth it. I'd rather have the more human-centered descriptions, and names of each endpoints, than the response definitions--that will come with time, and more usage of the actual APIs.</p>
<p>In the end, it really depends to the size of an API, and the quality of the API documentation. If it is a big API, and the documentation is well crafted, it is preferable to scrape and auto generate the definition. Once I have this, I can load it into Postman or Stoplight.io, start making API calls, and use either Stoplight's proxy, or my own solution that uses Charles Proxy, to provide the remaining schema of the responses, as well as the resulting HTTP status code(s).</p>
<p>I think the human touch on all APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and API Blueprint files will prove to be essential in streamlining interactions at every stop along the API life cycle. If you can't easily understand what an API does, and what the moving parts are, the rest won't matter, so having simple, well written titles, and descriptions for APIs that are described in each machine readable definition is well worth any extra work. Even with auto generation via scraping, or Stoplight.io, I find I still have have to give each API definitions a little extra love to make sure they are as polished as possible.</p>
<p>I'm thinking I will start keeping a journal of the work goes into crafting each API's definition(s). It might be something I can use down the road to further streamline the creation, and maintenance of my API definitions, and the API services I develop to support all of this.</p>
<p>Here is the APIs.json for the Wordpress.org API by the way:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/03e0f6cce5ebddd46028.js"></script>
<p>Here is the APIs.json for the Instructure Canvas API as well:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/ede7a42b29b4214eefb2.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/">You can see these, and some other API definitions for my workshop over at the Github repo for the project</a>. I created a new Liquid template, that allows me to display APIs.json and OpenAPI Specs within the Jekyll site for this project. Something that I will be using to better deliver API driven content, visualizations, and other resources that help us learn about, and put APIs to work.</p>

<p>As I'm thinking about the bigger picture of how startup acquisitions are impacting the world of APIs, I am also having several conversations with folks about their brand spank'n new API focused startup, I can't help but feel that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">things are never as they seem</span>, when it comes to the 1000 lb gorillas acquisitions within each wave of API driven startups. Of course there are many reasons why big companies gobble up the little startups, one that has a wide range of positive, and negative impacts on the overall health of the API economy, but from my vantage point rarely do the public stories ever size up with the real motivations behind the acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do big companies buy well performing API startups? Leading technology? User adoption? Integrations? Talent acquisition? Revenue? Relevance? Look cool? I'm sure it "could" be a mix of any of those elements, but after seeing many acquisition's get shut down, users flee, and talent jump ship from these soon to be irrelevant, investment saturated startups--I'm always looking for the other motivations beyond why these corporate giants are trying to look alll pretty in their startup jewelry.</p>
<p>To me, the motivations behind startup acquisitions are more about what isn't said, than it is ever what is said (jewelry is a distraction). Its about posturing in the space where you dominate (or want to). It is about steering the conversation where you want it to go, and if you don't want things to change, the conversation will go nowhere. It is about sending the right signals to your competition, and the market--all while prancing around wearing your pretty startup jewelry.</p>
<p>Ok, so why do I give a shit? Well, when the majority of companies I profile, track on, have conversations, take money from, and in some cases, advocate their products, services, and tooling, are playing in this game, and I have to consider the bigger picture of how shit flows upstream. I understand that as a company, you are hyper-focused with your agile, lean startup, kung fu, A/B tested, paleo diet startup process, and you are looking to find the biggest opportunity, then deliver the best product and service that you can. You are here to disrupt all that was! However, in my opinion if your real strategy is focused on an exit, and your real customer is the enterprise, individual API consumers, their end-users, API SLAs, deprecation policies, and everything else means absolutely jack-shit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand this is the song and dance "that everyone has to perform", but you see, my motivations, and view of all of this might be just a little different than yours. My motivations are around bringing awareness to the masses around how APIs are being used (both good &amp; bad), and ensuring there are as many open definitions, tooling, and other resources available to the community as possible. I am not&nbsp; focused on getting as rich as possible, at all costs--it just isn't on my radar, I'm sorry. I'm not interested in generating value, so that it can be sold off to the highest bidder. Don't get me wrong, all y'all are welcome to play your game, and will actually to it ethically, I'm just trying to mitigate the damage each cycle have on the rest of us who really trying to make change, and deliver valuable resources to where they need using APIs (healthcare, education, water, environment, etc. etc.)</p>
<p>I know that many of my startup friends will tell me, like they do when I talk about API patents, coprying, and other business and political areas--this is how the game is played. If you want to play in it you do what you have to, if you don't, you don't have to play. Ok, fair enough, except for the fact that many of you are coming to me for information about the space, what is out there, what is getting traction, and weaving this into your road maps. I'm openly sharing my knowledge, and in some cases actively showcasing your company, products, services, and tooling to my readers--turning them into your customers, so tht you can sell any value generated to the highest bidder. Then in the end you have no responsibility regarding what the acquiring company does with the technology, products, services, or data, content, and exhaust that was generated around operations--this damage, and imbalance with what I am hearing in the early days from startup is my concern.</p>
<p>All I'm doing in this exercise is continuing hone my ability to identify who the companies are that are purely on a startup exit journey, and those who may also be on the same journey, but along the way will also give back enough open content, data, resources, tooling, and definitions, that the community can benefit from. Now that the API space is moving more towards being a mainstream thing, maybe this will be the shift in my own mission. Rather than just educating new folks about APIs, and how to do "API", I will also be working to incentivize the waves of soon to be failed, exited, and deprecated API startups to give back open content, data, resources, tooling, and definitions along the way. Then maybe the rest of us who aren't playing the startup game, and are being negatively impacted by 1000 lb gorillas selfishly buying up, and wearing all the startup jewelry, will still be able to operate, innovate, do business, and deliver vital services using APIs--if only in the cracks.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>As I look through API portals, profiling the building blocks of successful API platform, I'm always looking for bite-size stories for my readers. I was working to complete my Instagram API definition, as part of <a href="http://photos.stack.network/">my photo API research</a>, and their getting started graphic caught my attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/">This three step getting started visual for Instagram is prominently available on the home page</a>, providing a very distilled down version of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">what I recommend API providers usually accomplish with a dedicated getting started page</a>.</p>

<p>The featured getting started area provides you with the link to register your application, and overview on authentication and authorization, and a link to all the endpoints, so you can start making requests. I am a big fan of there always being a dedicated getting started page for APIs that I am on-boarding with, but I am always a bigger fan when someone distills these building blocks into something that is way easier to understand, and execute--without all the blah blah blah.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">I'm going to consider adding a feature getting started building block, in addition to having the dedicated page</a>.

While their APIs have brought in many new conversations, and supported some interesting integration, they haven't been the business driver that they had hoped when they kicked off their API efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many reasons why API efforts may not live up to the hype, mostly its because I think we raise the bar too high in Silicon Valley. We raise up the Amazon's and Twilio's up in our mind as models we want follow, and talk about API success in terms of number of users, and in billions of API calls--as just a couple of examples. I will be the first to admit that many of us pundits have over hyped, and is something I've been working to filter out of my storytelling over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>The people I am having conversations with admit that an API is necessary, and wouldn't dream of getting rid of their API effort, but are just wrestling with the fact that the API just didn't end up be the business driver like they expected. In most of these conversations, APIs are just having to play second fiddle to traditional business elements like sales, marketing, education, support, and many of the other more mundane, fundamental aspects of business operations.</p>
<p>While I can talk through these companies API strategy, to see where I can make suggestions, but in the end, an API is just one of the tools in your business toolbox. Your next customer most likely will not be making their way through your sales funnel simply because you have an API. It may be one important consideration, and almost certainly will come up down the road, but most likely will not be the conversation starter everyone hopes it will be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not want to throw a wet blanket on your API enthusiasm. You need to keep up the hard work of making sure your API is available, evolving, and community driven, but make sure you set your expectations properly, regarding how long of a road you actually have. Like a website, an API will be an essential tool in your business toolbox. You simply will not be able to do some business without an API in the future, but it does not trump many other more tangible aspects of your business like value, sales, marketing, and support.</p>
<p>If you are feeling the same way with your program, feel free to let reach out. While I feel we all may have set our expectations a little higher than was logical, I also think feeling like this is an important part of the API journey itself. It is a long, long, long road. I know I lose faith in API Evangelist on a regular basis, and after five years I have to come up with creative ways to keep engaging in new conversations, and telling stories of what is working, and what is not--sometimes it just helps to talk with folks about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/03/01/google-has-redesigned-its-developer-policies-with-clearer-language-and-visual-examples/">The NextWeb had a great story today that&nbsp;Google has redesigned its developer policies with clearer language and visual examples</a>, and normally I don't jsut parrot what the tech blogosphere publishes, but it's an important enough API message, I think it warrants repeating. In my experience, API providers just emulate what they hear in the space, and stories like this need amplifcation.</p>
<p>What Google did isn't rocket surgery, they just <a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">simplified the legalize around what they expect of developers</a>. What better way to actually help ensure these best practices around the platform actual happen, then by actually providing simple titles, summary description, images, and other relevant links, on a developer policy page. In most scenarios developers aren't malicious, they are just usually ignorant of the best practices that often exist in the platforms legalize we agree to, but seldom ever read.</p>
<p>My friend Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>)&nbsp;stated that, <em>"the organization here for policy is fun, mostly clear, and interactive. A company the size of Google distilling the deep TOS policy into such a user and developer friendly front end is pretty astounding.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;-- I agree. Simple like this, when you operate at Google scale can be pretty hard, and is somthing I'd love see standardized across Google offerings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be adding any of the elements from <a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">the simplified Google Play developer policy</a> that are missing in my API <a href="http://terms-of-service.apievangelist.com/">terms of service</a>, <a href="http://privacy.apievangelist.com/">privacy</a>, <a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com/">licensing</a>, and <a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com/">branding</a> research. I will also add the concept of having visuals for each area, or building block, and add the common them of "keep it simple", helping API providers remember that they actually want developers reading and understanding this stuff, not having it buried in the legaleze that nobody will give shit about.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://small-business-api-strategy.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-business-of-apis.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/15/all-this-information-is-great-but-where-do-i-start-with-my-api-strategy/">I've been moving forward with my efforts to better on-board folks with the sometimes overwhelming amounts of research available via API Evangelist</a>. I have several groups looking for guidance on where to start with their strategy, as well as develop some lower level tactical approaches to propelling themselves forward in their API journey. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/18/taking-a-snapshot-of-just-the-essential-api-building-blocks-across-my-research/">I recently posted a master list of my essential building blocks across, 20+ areas of my research</a>, and now I'm <a href="http://small-business-api-strategy.apievangelist.com/">distilling these into a single project to help me move forward as one potential operational API strategy for a small businesses</a>.</p>
<p>First i took the almost <a href="http://apievangelist.com">1000 building blocks I've organized across my areas of API research</a>, and added a question for each, which simply asks where things are with each of these potential considerations along the API life cycle. For this particular small business API strategy, I've opted to include discovery, definitions, design, hypermedia, DNS, deployment, virtualization, containers, management, documentation, SDK, embeddable, real time, webhooks, support, monitoring, testing, road map, authentication, security, terms of service, privacy, licensing, branding, monetization, plans, partners, and evangelism, covering 28 areas of the API life cycle that would be relevant to a small business.</p>
<p>The result is a pretty comprehensive API strategy that might help a small business adopt a more coherent framework for their own efforts--the problem is this can still be very high level thinking, and difficult to know where to get going on day one, what to do when you launch a new API, and other more tactical aspects of API operations. &nbsp;To help me bring such a large, lofty API strategy down into the tactical weeds, I'm going to be applying it to my own, existing operations, and deriving a handful of tactical implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day One -</strong> Where do we begin, even with a legacy mess of systems, services, web services, and APIs?</li>
<li><strong>New Portal -</strong> We need to launch our first portal, or possibly a new product, service, or group portal to support API operations.</li>
<li><strong>New API -</strong> Wanting to kick off a new API, what should we be considering, and including in overall approach from design to management?</li>
<li><strong>API Launch - </strong>Week of, day, off the launch for the new API, what should we be considering, from making sure monitors are up, to publishing a blog post.</li>
<li><strong>Evangelism -</strong> What should be done regarding evangelism and outreach, across all areas of platform operations, giving me a single list of what I should be doing.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly -</strong> What are my weekly considerations to help me course correct what I'm doing on the ground with my overall API strategy?</li>
<li><strong>Monthly&nbsp;- </strong>What are my monthly considerations to help me course correct what I'm doing on the ground with my overall API strategy?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://small-business-api-strategy.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-strategy.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>These are just six of the tactical areas I could use help with in my own operations, and are the key areas some of the organizations I'm talking with are looking for guidance as well. My objective is to establish a high level API strategy that a small business could apply to the 100K level, but also have lower level plans that can help small businesses get started on day one, launch their developer portals, establish a design first process that can be applied to any new APIs, and successfully launch new API efforts. I also threw in a general weekly, and monthly version as well, just to deal with the mundane aspects of API operations that we all kind of suck at--I know I do!</p>
<p>In this API strategy, building block, and question blueprint I've crafted, no tactical element can exist without being rooted in an overall strategic objective. My strategy goes well beyond being just an API design guide--it is meant to be my API operations guide, with tactical plays that are all in sync with my overall goals. As with everything on my API workbench, this <a href="http://small-business-api-strategy.apievangelist.com/index.html">small business APi strategy</a> is ever evolving. I'm adding in more building blocks, and asking more questions as I actually apply to my own API operations, and those of folks I'm talking to, so check back often.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with adding more building blocks, and questions to my strategy, I'm also planning on making it interactive, so you can actually answer the questions posed, and save within a public or private Github repository. This will allow anyone to come back often, and add to, or refine an API strategy. My API strategy tooling will possess a tactical plan manager, allowing for the creation of collections in these area, which can provide a framework for designing and deploying new APIs, surges in my API evangelism, or any of the other fast moving, ever changing aspects of API operations--all while keeping everything anchored in a big picture API strategy.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Feb 2016</span>

<p>I need some help with APIs! Ok, where can I help you? Well, I have multiple systems, that we use to operate our business on a daily basis, and when we do things in one system, we need the other system to know about it, and when certain events occur we need to trigger pushes or pulls between all systems--this is how many conversations begin as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>While many people think they are looking for an API solution, they are really looking for an API journey, with a little assistance from me along the way. Sure they want an API to make their world more integrated, inter-operable, automated, and real time, but in reality, they are needing to get to work unwinding a mess of legacy technical, business, and political business decisions that have been over years--this takes a journey.</p>
<p>Ok, so where do we get started (another common theme lately) in helping quantify the problem set, and what a journey will look like to get us closer to a solution? This post is designed to help you self assess, answer a handful of key questions, and put yourself on a path forward.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Systems Inventory</strong><br />What systems are involved? If this is a company-wide effort, this might be a more involved task, but if it is a single project, or objective, it will hopefully be much smaller. Regardless of scope, having a well defined inventory of the internal systems that you depend on, is pretty important stuff. Let's get to list making a list of what systems are involved in the API driven solution we are looking for.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each System-------------</em></li>
<li>What is the system name?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What is the public URL of the website for the system?</li>
<li>Are there API opportunities surrounding this system?</li>
<li>Who is the internal owner and contact for the system?</li>
<li>What is the systems used for?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each System-------------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For this exercise we are going to limit this grouping to internal or on-premise systems that we are running, because it is likely they'll reflect an earlier, non HTTP-centric way of doing business (not always, but usually). Ideally there is an API already in place, or there are web services, file imports and exports, or other means information portability, but these systems will usually have to be evaluated separately from the newer, more cloud-based services, which more often have a more coherent API approach.</p>
<p><strong>External Cloud Services Inventory</strong><br />Similar to the internal assessment above, what external services are involved in this solution. Try to think of all the existing services that are used, need information pushed to it, or even possibly new services that could be put to work, if this newer process was in place. Let's make a list of what cloud services are involved in the API driven solution we are looking for.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each Service-------------</em></li>
<li>What is the service name?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What is the public URL of the website for the system?</li>
<li>Are there API opportunities surrounding this system?</li>
<li>Who is the internal owner and contact for the system?</li>
<li>What is the systems used for?</li>
<li>Is the system a paid or free service?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each Service-------------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It is likely that these services will have some sort of API opportunity, but if not, there are often APIs right below the surface if you just ask, and in some cases, it will set into motion and API journey for the service provider as well (#winning). Knowing the services you depend on is just good for business, and having them in an organized list should be part of your regular operations.</p>
<p><strong>Tools In The Toolbox</strong><br />Let's do what we just did for internal systems, and cloud services, but this time for the open tooling put to work. Like internal systems don't always resemble newer cloud services, open source tooling also have different considerations, and varying ways in which they can be applied.&nbsp;Let's make a list of what open source tooling is involved in delivering on the API driven solution we are manifesting here:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each Tool-------</em></li>
<li>What is the tool name?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What is the public website or repository for the tool?</li>
<li>Are there API opportunities surrounding this tool?</li>
<li>Who is the internal owner and contact for the tool?</li>
<li>What is the tool used for?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each&nbsp;Tool-------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Also consider including open source tooling that you'd like to see added to the mix. Maybe you are just looking to replace an existing internal system, or possibly a 3rd party service you are depending on, with an open source solution. Let's get to work putting together a master list of all the open tooling at play in this project.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying the Objects That Are In Play</strong><br />Database folks will simply focus on the schema aspect of this, but as a database administrator with over 25 years of experience, this is more about the human side of the object vs the database resource dimension of it. When it comes to identifying the ojbects that are in play, I'm looking for the meaningful nouns that are part of this personal, business, or other scenario being tackled as part of this project. What are all the parts and pieces being moved around like contact record, images, documents, and even down to the micro level with tags and categories?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each Object-------</em></li>
<li>What is the object name?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How many of the objects are in play?</li>
<li>What are other characteristics of this object?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each&nbsp;Object-------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These objects are the digital assets of any company, organization, institution, and individual. These are the bits &amp; bytes you want kept in sync, so you can make decision, sell products &amp; services, and just operate on a daily basis. A well defined dictionary of these objects should exist, so that their storage, transmission, syndication, sharing and other aspects can be tracked in detail.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who Are The Key Actors Involved With The Process?</strong><br />Now we are getting to the very import human aspect of this assessment. Who are the people involved in this process? I am not just talking about the developers or system administrators who will be involved, I am talking about business, and partner stakeholders, system users, and even the operators of 3rd party API providers. Let's compile a list of who will be touched by any part of this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each Actor--------</em></li>
<li>What is the individual or group name?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Provide a description of each individual, or group, and their relationship and needs?</li>
<li>How large are the groups of actors?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each&nbsp;Actor-------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These actors are the central focus of this effort, with the systems, services, tooling, and objects always playing second fiddle. Ultimately this is all about alleviating the frustrations of actors, deliver better products, services, provide support, and improve web, mobile, and other API driven applications that they are using.</p>
<p><strong>What Actions Are Being Taken?</strong><br />The last piece of this assessment, is what actions will be taken? What are the specific actions that are needed to satisfy this effort, that is keeping systems in sync, putting internal or 3rd party APIs to use in an existing system, or possibly what is satisfied by a new API or piece of open source software. We need a list of meaningful actions you are looking for, including which of the key actors involved, putting the systems, tools, and services broken out above to work. Feel free to break them down by any logical grouping, and be sure to be as details as you feel necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each Action-------</em></li>
<li>Short title for the action</li>
<li>Provide a concise description of the action</li>
<li>What systems, tools, or services are touched?</li>
<li>Which objects will be play a role in the action?</li>
<li>Which actors will be triggering or impacted by action?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each&nbsp;Action-------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These actions should be n plain English--no translation need. This isn't an IT project, this is a human led process, trying to satisfy a specific need you (they) have. You may not full understand which system, service, or tool that will apply, so focus on describing the specific goal, and need--the rest will come later. Realization of these actions is why we are doing this, and having them well documented helps ensure we can push them forward in future iterations, and integration.</p>
<p><strong>This Should Provide A Basic Assessment To Get Started On The Journey</strong><br />These are all the moving parts involved. Hopefully this outline provides you a little taste of what the actual API journey may look like. API is more about understanding the systems you depend on, the resources at play, and the consumers involved, than it really ever is about the API. An API is just the enabler, allowing us to talk through the systems, services, tooling, processes, and establish a better understanding of the transactions that need to occur, both synchronous, and asynchronously, to meet the needs of everyone involved.</p>
<p>Whats next? Well that depends on the completeness of this assessment, and the API opportunity that exists with the systems, services, and tools being used--not all will be conducive to integration, interoperability, and automation, for a variety of technical, business, and politics reasons. However, before we can make this assessment, we need to take a snapshot all the moving parts, and better understand what the end play might be. This should get things going, and with the detail you provide here, you (we) should be able to better communicate these needs to any 3rd party, that might be helping move things forward.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-extraction.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" />I often <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/29/parse-shutting-down-maybe-we-should-lower-our-expectations-of-tech-just-a-little-bit/">push back against API consumers</a> when they complain about the deprecation of API platform, focusing on the fact that we cannot depend on APIs to be around forever. I also push back against API providers when they express concern around having to support developers forever, for fear of revolt in the community. I think the rational folks in the space understand that a balance is needed in these situations, but alas, there are always new incidents that make us go WTF?? <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/26/how-not-to-run-a-platform/">I was reading about Venmo halting new developer access to its API from Techcrunch today</a>, which left me shaking my head, saying damn, damn, damn.</p>
<p>I know a lot of you are invested in the startup game, and in all honesty, I am too. A lot of my income comes from startsup, who have taken VC money. I want to believe there can be an ethical path forward in all of this, and it is not all just gambling by a bunch rich white dudes who don't give a shit, but it is getting harder and harder to do. Venmo gained a lot of traction with the support of its API and its developer community, and to just turn off the spigot after riding on the backs of its API and community is just exploitation. I'm not saying they can't shut down their program--I am saying the are obligated to communicate better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In several conversations with folks today, the topic of a ranking system for API providers came up again, with some sort of rating for good and providers, as well as some sort of warning system to alert developers ahead of time, that an API is stumbling. This is something I've been working on for a while, and will keeping working on, with my partners. While I think such a system could help us identify some bad actors early, and incentivize others to think through their approach to API operations, and how they communicate with their community--it won't be a complete solution for this type of exploitation.</p>
<p>Many more waves of startups will come in the future, beginning with lots of passion and excitement, opening up APIs and encouraging developers to build, build, build! The momentum will build, traction will occur, and investment will come. Soon, the startup leaders will not need the API community. They have seen the traction they desired, acquisitions was made, and any blame can be transferred to acquiring organizations, and VCS who are very skilled at shielding themselves from any liability. Maximum value was achieved with the help of the community, it was properly extracted, with the lionshare of value going to acquirers and startup founders, and the majority of the risk left with the developer community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it gets harder nd harder for some of us to showcase new companies with the same passion and trust that they'll do right. There will always be future waves of new startup worshipers, and <a href="http://blog.venmo.com/venmo-api-hackathon">developers to show up at hackathons</a>, building prototypes, engineering applications, and businesses on top of available APIs. New waves of startup founders will be ignorant of what possible future lies ahead, with the other more senior players caring less about the impact this behavior has on the overall health of the API ecosystem--this is how business is conducted, fuck APIs.</p>
<p>In the end it just sucks. APIs when done right, can make a significant impact, and there are ways to invest in, and reward the best developers in an API ecosystem. However APIs can just as easily be used for exploitation, building sharecropping communities, where developers come and work for free, and building value on top of APIs. API consumers are just looking for a stable vendor to deliver the resources they need, and many API startups promise the moon and stars to keep them believing in them. Many even believe what they say, and are willing to do whatever it takes to win in the startup game--at any cost.</p>
<p>While I feel pretty confident that I can tell when an API platform is going to go away because some of the usual signals, like blog, Twitter, and Github go silent. There is one set of signals I think can help us start identifying the bad actors earlier on. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">I've been working on a machine readable approach to map out the pricing, rate limits, tiers, and plans for many API platforms</a>, I'm simply calling <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">API plans</a>. There are key data signals available in a platforms communication strategy, but I think there are also many telltale signs available in their monetization and business strategies, that we aren't seeing.</p>
<p>In one conversation I had today, I jokingly said I should just email API providers regularly, asking them if they were planning on screwing over their developers anytime soon. While I was joking, I may actually start emailing some providers as part of the rating system I'm ever-evolving. I doubt anyone will ever answer truthfully, but maybe their response time to my question can be used a signal, and if nothing else it just sends a regular reminder to API providers to not fuck over their developers, and give as much lead time as possible before they decide to go away.</p>
<p>I understand that Venmo is keeping the service up for their existing developers (please don't tell me this), and changed their tune about it only being about new developers, but my point is more about communication and the sharing of the road map, holding API providers to a higher bar, and in this situation Venmo, and Paypal should have been a little more transparent in this process, and shared their plans more publicly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As part of a renewed focus on the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png">API discovery definition format APIs.json</a>, I wanted to revisit the propsed machine readable API discovery specification, and see what is going on. First, what is APIs.json? It is a machine readable JSON specification, that anyone can use to define their API operations. APIs.json does not describe your APIs like <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> do, it describes your surrounding API operations, with entries that can reference your Open API Spec, API Blueprint, or any other format that you desire.</p>
<p><strong>APIs.json Is An Index For API Operations</strong><br />APIs.json provides a machine readable approach that API providers can put work in describing their API operations, similar to how web site providers describe their websites using <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/">sitemap.xml</a>. Here are the APIs, who are describing their APIs using APIs.json:</p>

<p><strong>APIs.json Indexes Can Be Created By 3rd Parties</strong><br />One important thing to add, is that these APIs.json files can also be crafted, and published by external parties. An example of this is with the Trade.gov APIs. <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">I originally created that APIs.json file</a>, and coordinated with them to eventually it get published under their own domain, making it an authoritative APIs.json file. Many APIs.json files will be born outside of the API operations they describe, something you can see in my API stack project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">The API Stack</a> - Provides almost 1000 APIs.json files, that describe the API operations of many leading public API platforms. There is also around 300 OpenAPI specifications, for some of the platforms described</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>APIs.json Can Be Used To Describe API Collections</strong><br />Beyond describing a single API, within a single domain, APIs.json can also be used to describe entire collections of APIs, providing a machine readable way to organize, and share valuable collections of API resources. Here are a few examples of projects that are producing APIs.json driven collections.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/apis.json">Defining APIs that you depend on for organizational operation.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apis.json">Defining a specific category of API operations, using the format.</a></li>
<li>SMS - <a href="http://sms.stack.network/">http://sms.stack.network/</a></li>
<li>MMS - <a href="http://mms.stack.network/">http://mms.stack.network/</a></li>
<li>Email - <a href="http://email.stack.network/">http://email.stack.network/</a></li>
<li>News - <a href="http://news.stack.network/">http://news.stack.network/</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>APIs.json Can Be Used To Describe Collections of Collections</strong><br />Then taking things up another rung up the chain, APIs.json can also provide a collection of collections, something I do with my own APIs. Each Github organization on my network has a master APIs.json, providing include links to all other APIs.json within the organization. In this scenario I have over 30 other APIs.json indexed, which can all operate independently of each other, but can also be considered a collection of API collections.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/apis.json">Master</a> - A master collection of API collections I maintain as part of the API Evangelist network operations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The First Open Source Tooling For APIs.json</strong><br />Up until now, this post is all about APIs.json, where in reality the format is useless without their being any tooling built on top of the specification, bringing value to the table. This is why the 3Scale team got to work building an open source APIs.json driven search engine:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> as an open source tool dedicated to APIs.json</li>
<li><a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> as a public API search engine, with APIs.json as index.</li>
<li><a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;private API search engine, with APIs.json as index.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>APIs.json Driving Other Open Tooling</strong><br />APIs.io is just the beginning. It won't be enough to convince all API providers that they should be producing APIs.json index of their site operations, just for the API discovery boost. We are going to need APIs.json driven tooling that will service every other stop along the life cycle, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTTP Client / Hub / Workbenches</strong></li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong></li>
<li><strong>Virtualization</strong></li>
<li><strong>Visualization</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>APIs.json Integrated Into Existing Platforms</strong><br />What areas would you like to see served? Personally, I would like to have the ability to load / unload my APIs.json collections into any service that I use. Allowing me to organize my internal, public, and 3rd party APIs I depend within any platform out there that is servicing the API space. Here are a handful of those types of integrations that are already happening:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://warewolf.io/ESB-blog/swagger-apisjson-support/">WarewolfESB</a> </strong>- ESB integration and API discovery.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io/integrating-with-the-swaggerhub-api/">SwaggerHub</a> </strong>- Public and private API hub discovery.</li>
<li><strong>API Management</strong> - In Progress w/ <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>...</li>
<li><strong>API Monitoring</strong> - In Progress with <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a>...</li>
<li><strong>API Change Log </strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;In Progress with <a href="http://apichangelog.com">API ChangeLog</a>...</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smartbear.com/plugins/apis-io-import-export/">SmartBear</a> -</strong> API discovery for monitoring, testing, virtualization, and security.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a></strong> - API analyst operations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">Kin Lane</a> </strong>- API factory operations (not organic)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a></strong> - Government open data publishing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>APIs.json Linking To The Human Aspects Of API Operations</strong><br />APIs.json is just the scaffolding to hang links to essential aspects of your operations, it doesn't care what you link to. You can start by referencing essential links for your API operations like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Signup</strong> - How to signup for a service.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> - Where to get support.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service </strong>- Where are the terms of service.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - Where to find the pricing for a service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>APIs.json Linking to Machine Readable Aspects of API Operations</strong><br />These do not have to be machine readable links, they can reference important things the humans will need first. However, ultimately the goal is to make as much of the APIs.json index as machine readable as possible, using a variety of existing API definition formats, available for a variety of purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenApI Spec</a>, for API description.</li>
<li><a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, for API description.</li>
<li><a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Common</a>, for API licensing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman</a>, for run-time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Defining New, Machine Readable Property Elements For APIs.json</strong><br />While the APIs.json spec will evolve, something I talk about below, its real strength lies in its ability to incentivize the development of entirely new, machine readable API definitions, bringing even more value to the API discovery process. Here are a few of the additional specs being crafted independent of, but inspired by APIs.json:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">API Plans</a>, for pricing, plans &amp; rate limits.</li>
<li>API Monitoring, for monitoring &amp; testing.</li>
<li>API Changelog, for operational monitoring.</li>
<li>API SDK, for SDK reference.</li>
<li>API Conversations - for the stream around API operations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roadmap for Version 0.16 of APIs.json</strong><br />That is the 100K view of what is APIs.json now, and the short term plan for the future. Most of the change within the universe APIs.json is mapping will occur add the individual API, and within the machine readable specs that describe them like OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and Postman. Secondarily, there will be additional, machine readable, API types being defined and added into the spec.</p>
<p>Even with this reality, we do have a handful of changes planned for the 0.16 version of APIs.json:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>commons</strong> - Establish a top level collection of common property elements that apply to ALL APIs being referenced in an APIs.json</li>
<li><strong>country</strong> - Adding a top level country reference using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes">ISO 3166</a>.</li>
<li>New Proper Elements - Suggesting a handful of new property elements to reference common API operation building blocks      
<ul>
<li>Registration</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I doubt we will see many new additions like commons and country. In the future most of the structural changes to APis.json will be derived from first class property elements (ie. adding documentation or Github), making this the proving ground for defining what are truly the most important aspects of API operations, and what should be machine readable vs human readable.</p>
<p><strong>The Hard Work That Lies Ahead for APIs.json</strong><br />That concludes defining what is APIs.json, and what is next for APIs.json. Now we really have to get to work, doing the heavy lifting around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting more API providers to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">describe their API operations </span>using APIs.json, and publish in the root of the domain for their API ecosystem.</li>
<li>Encourage more API evangelists, brokers &amp; analysts using to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">describe their collections</span>, using APIs.json, building more meaningful indexes and directories of high value APIs.</li>
<li>Encourage platforms to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">build APIs.json into their operations</span>, as a storage and organization schema, but also as import / export format.</li>
<li>Incentivize the development of more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">meaningful tooling that employs APIs.json</span>, and uses it to better serve the API life cycle.</li>
<li>Continue to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">add new API property elements</span>, making sure as many of them as possible evolve to be machine readable, as well as first class citizens in the APIs.json specification.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can stay involved with what we are up to via <a href="http://apisjson.org/">the APIs.json website</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/apis-json/api-json">the APIs.json Github repository</a>. You can also stay in tune with what is going on with <a href="http://apis.io/">APis.io via the website</a>, and its Github repository. If you are doing something with APIs.json, ranging from using it as an index for your API operations, to platform integrations, please let me know. Also, if you envision some interesting tooling you'd like to see happen, <a href="https://github.com/apis-json/api-json/issues/new">make sure and submit a Github issue letting us know</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we still have huge amounts of work to do, when it comes to delivering meaningful API discovery solutions that the industry can put to work, I am pretty stoked with what we have managed to do over the last two years of work on the APIs.json specification, and supporting tooling--momentum that I feel picking up in 2016.</p>

<p>In the last six months I was fortunate enough to be able to push forward one of my side projects, with the help of a <a href="http://knightfoundation.org/grants/201551217/">prototype grant from the Knight Foundation</a>. The mission of the project, is to help move forward existing open federal government data projects, by adopting them, and helping clean up the data, publish simple APIs, generate more meta data, while also telling stories around the project. Something <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/01/18/adopt-a-federal-government-dataset/">I originally called&nbsp;Federal Agency Dataset Adoption</a>, but then shortened to simply <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a>.</p>
<p>When I was doing my final presentation in Pittsburgh last month, for the Knight Foundation, someone from the University of Miami was present, and when they got home, contacted me about helping move forward the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">database available at ClinicalTrials.gov</a>. I do not know much about the data present in the collection, but immediately recognized it as a viable Adopta.Agency project.</p>
<p>To summarize their request, it went something like this :-)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I am working on a project that uses data from https://clinicaltrials.gov/ . Their API is crap to say the least. I was wondering if you could help me out. Is there a tool I could use to get better access to the data? If we download the entire thing is an 850MB zipped file in XML. I only need a fraction of the trials in the db. I guess I am looking for advice on how to proceed.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I get questions like this a lot, something that contributed to me pushing forward my <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a> work. The Knight Foundation prototype grant was just that, the prototype funding, something I intend to keep pushing forward, targeting new data sets, and looking for more open data activists to assist in doing the heavy lifting. The ClinicalTrials.gov database seemed like an excellent candidate because it is a high value data sets, and is something that is pretty poorly presented <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/download">via the download and API (?) page available at&nbsp;ClinicalTrials.gov</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>I now have 40+ separate clinical trials data files, available as JSON or CSV, and a complete API that allows for reading and writing, plus a communication and issue management system that will help me engage with others around the project. This entire process is Github driven, with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> as its machine readable core, which indexes everything that is going on--as it happens.</p>
<p>I think that the ClinicalTrials.gov project represents the Adopta.Agency mission well. There is a wealth of amazing open data sets available on the government perimeter. Much of it isn't well defined, lacking necessary descriptions, tagging, and other meta to make it discoverable, let alone using machine readable, open data formats like APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and JSON Schema. I do not blame the folks in government, I understand that they are working with limited resources, and something awareness of modern open data and API approaches. This is why they need our help!</p>
<p>If you'd like to get involved with <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/clinical-trials">the clinical trials open data and API project, head over the project site</a>, and drop me a line using <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/clinical-trials/issues">the project's Github Issue management</a>. I am not sure what is next. I will be looking for feedback from the folks who tuned me into the data set, as well as from my own network--then I can spend some more time on the road map, and see what we can make happen.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2016</span>
        <p>I had the pleasure of hanging out with Wade Foster (<a href="https://twitter.com/wadefoster">@wadefoster</a>), co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> (<span>How do you pronounce Zapier? It rhymes with happier :-</span>) recently. As I travel less, I'm looking at doing more of these Google Hangouts, to fill my need for hanging out with super smart people, doing really cool things with APIs.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of what Wade, and the Zapier team are up to. His perspective on helping us define "the process", is extremely empowering for EVERYONE and ANYONE, especially non-developers.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/czgRiLT2Y_s" width="560" height="315" align="middle"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>What Zapier enables, is very much aligned with how I would like the API economy end up operating. Where system to system, website, mobile, and device based API integration is important, but platform interoperability for the masses I feel is much more critical. Zapier is how the average person will take control over their digital self, and move the growing amount of data and content we are generating, across across the growing number of service we depend on daily.</p>
<p>Thanks to Wade, and the <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> team for hanging out with the API Evangelist, and doing such important, and cool work with APIs.</p>

At the same time I'm thinking about how APIs are being used to inject valuable data, content, and other valuable API driven resources to the stream of existing applications we use every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of this thinking is derived from my bot research, where they impersonate Twitter users, or respond to specific key words, phrases, or keyboard shortcuts in Slack. Some of this thinking comes from learning more about the ability to inject "code steps" into multi-step workflows with Zapier. Then as I continue doing my curation of news I read about Uber allowing developers to create <a href="https://developer.uber.com/docs/tutorial-trip-experiences">trip experiences</a>, opening up another window for potential API driven injection into the Uber "experience".&nbsp;</p>
<p>It got me thinking, where else is this happening? I would say <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview">Twitter Cards</a> is a form of this, but is an example that is more media focused, rather than bots (although it could be bot driven behavior). Then I started looking across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">50 areas of the API life cycle I'm monitoring</a>, and <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a> stood out, as another area of potential overlap. Amazon is allowing developers to inject API driven content, data, and other resources into the conversational stream occurring Alexa users. I don't see this being much different that bots injecting responses into the messaging stream of Slack and Twitter users.</p>
<p>I'm just getting going with these thoughts. Something I'm thinking <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com">containers</a>, and serverless approaches to API deployment are going to impact this line of thought as well. I'm considering pulling together a research project around this overlap, something I will call API injection. Essentially, how are people injecting API driven data, content, and other resources, into the streams of other applications, using APIs. I could see a whole new breed of API provider emerge, just to satisfy the appetite of bots, and other API injection tooling, in engaging with users via the streams they are already existing daily, whether messaging, voice, or any other online experience.</p>
<p>I do not think this is limited to consumer level injections. I could see the B2B approaches to API injection, opening up some pretty interesting <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a> opportunities. Hock'n your bot warez within other people's business streams. ;-) We'll see where this line of thought goes...regardless it is fun to think about.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-transparency.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I talk about companies using APIs to be more transparent, one of the immediate comments I receive from folks is that "not everyone can be public by default". I agree with this situation, but I always counter with an introduction to the concept that transparency can be applied in strictly internal or partner situations as well--public is not the only type of transparency out there.</p>
<p>I am a big proponent of the public version of API driven transparency, but I also feel it can be applied within the firewall, as well as on the open web. Simple developer portals, with a quality selection of valuable APIs, up to date interactive documentation, and other resources, available at a known, yet secured location, can go a long way to stimulate integration--both human (team) and system. Self-service access to API design, definitions, deployment, management, testing, and other life cycle strategies, as well as the API resources can go a long way to establish a rich environment for collaboration, reuse, and consistency in API strategy across an organization.</p>
<p>The benefits of internal and partner layers approaches to transparency, as well as public transparency helps break down silos. Think about the separations between some of the other groups in your organization, and possibly with your leadership up the ladder. Would it help if the road map for your team was out in the open for anyone within your company to follow? Would conversations around outages and system stability be more productive if they included a wider group--maybe preventing some of the micro aggression that occur behind closed doors?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many, many ways API can bring transparency to your organization, way before you ever consider doing it publicly. When I say API, this starts with the technical endpoints, but a modern API conversation ALWAYS involves documentation, code, communications, and feedback loops. The Amazon Web Services family of APIs isn't just purely about the compute and storage endpoints. It is also about the self-service documentation, videos, tutorials, case studies, the 24/7 community forums, and paid tiers of premium support, that makes it all go round.</p>
<p>How could API driven transparency break down the silos in your organization, and help things operate a little more efficiently?</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/t-shirts/KL_InApiWeTrust-1000.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have been working for a month or so on what some of the common tasks that developer advocates and evangelists would like to see occur around their API operations. These are small little tasks that evangelists should be doing themselves, but if they can encourage their own API community, or the wider developer and tech community to help out, they might achieve a greater reach.</p>
<p>Getting your community to help out with tasks on your platform is nothing new. This is a core premise of modern web API operations, something that can work well in some ecosystems, but has historically been abused by other ecosystems. Some API providers enjoy vibrant communities where developers are more than happy to step up and build things for free, generate a buzz, and show up to events. The reality for most is that it can be very hard to stimulate developers to help in any way, and resort to the exploration of other ways they can stimulate this activity.</p>
<p>As I was exploring these concepts with fellow evangelist, soliciting ideas for what some of the common tasks evangelist might need, someone brought up how sleezy this sounds. Are you going to give away swag, gift cards, or money for these tasks? Are you going to do it for points? I agree, on the surface, when you describe it like that, it does sound cheezy, if not sleezy. Then I got thinking about the micro transactions and tasks people ask of me on a regular basis--things like:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-task-list.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>

<li>Participate In Discussion</li>
<li>Write a White Paper</li>
<li>Provide a Quote</li>
<li>Talk To Reporter</li>
<li>Talk To Analyst</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of the common requests I get. Sometimes the requests are paid, sometimes they are not. There is not clear line to follow for any of this. It comes down to what I'm willing to do, and what I'm not. I know plenty of people who write blog posts for companies, and get paid per post--I choose not to do this. I do write white papers for money sometimes, but I would never tweet or upvote something for money. I would prioritize consideration for an upvote or retweet, when someone is a paid partner--I tweet things for my paid partners all the time, but not if it isn't relevant.</p>
<p>I am just trying to explore where exactly this line is for one of my API research areas--<a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>. Like I do in all of my other areas. I am working &nbsp;with <a href="http://apis.how/hzp7kypxdw">my partner Cloud Elements</a> to explore these concepts, so in a sense I am getting paid for this work, although indirectly. That is not my goal though, I want to help define a simple list of micro transactions that could occur within API ecosystems, and across the web, that benefit both API provider and consumer--equally. I think it can be done ethically, and transparently, and avoid the cheezy and sleezy, however I think many will win in these areas as well.</p>
<p>In the end, I think it is about making the tasks meaningful, and be as transparent about what is going on. I don't see any problem giving developers in your ecosystem gift cards, API credits, or other form of incentive, if they are willing and not being exploited. I know I would do more work for some of the API providers I use, if I got free API credits! (wink wink) I will keep exploring these micro API evangelism activities, and how to do them right. If there are tasks you think should be on the list, or have opinions on where you think the ethical line is, and have examples you'd like to share--feel free to ping me!</p>

I cannot speak to whether their pricing is good, fair, or otherwise, but the layout, and the way they explain it, is very simple straightforward and easy to make sense of.</p>
<p>In addition to having the pricing for their email API broke down into six coherent plan tiers, they also have a compare plan details table which shows all six plans, side by side, with each core feature, and other elements of API access available to browse. As an API analyst, it make the data entry for my API tracking much easier, but as an API consumer it make it much easier for me to budget for the API driven resources I will need as part of my API operations.</p>

<p>The state of your pricing page tells a lot about how baked your overall API strategy. I will be the first to admit <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/pricing/">my own API plans and pricing</a> are half-baked at best. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to be, the value of my resources, and what the market will bear--my pricing page reflects and amplifies this dilemma.

<p>I like my API service providers like I like my APIs, doing one thing and doing it well. Sure services can work together (using APIs), and companies can launch multiple services, but I prefer selecting the services that I use as part of my API operations, as small, modular pieces of API infrastructure. In my opinion, API service providers are just another class of API provider, they just happen to be selling services to businesses that are operating APIs.</p>
<p>You can see this in action <a href="http://api-docs.io/">with API Docs</a>, part of <a href="http://stoplight.io/">the StopLight.io platform</a>. API Docs does one thing well--API documentation! Although for me, it touches on two important areas of the API lifecycle, both <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">documentation</a> and <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, but also illustrates the maturation of these stops along the API life cycle, since Tony first launched Swagger UI. The StopLight team is taking API definitions to the next level, but they are also helping us better deliver the documentation portion of our API life cycle(s)--all driven by API definitions. (meta)</p>
<p>If you are looking for another example of this in action, take a look at <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API transformer</a>, from the <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC team</a>. APIMATIC alone fits my definition of a modular API service provider, doing SDKs, and doing the well, but then you factor in their API translation tooling. #winning Again, APIMATIC is focusing on modular services, that are API definition driven--very similar to what StopLight is up to with their strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016 you will hear me hammer on three key concepts when it comes to delivering services in the API space, and selling to indivivdual API providers. 1) do one thing and do it well, 2) speak in API definition formats, and 3) do it with APIs!! It isn't rocket surgery that API service providers should be practicng what they preach, but in 2016 I am finding that these three characteristics are proving to be a reliable way for me to differentiate the API service providers who will be here for the long haul, and those that won't.</p>

<p>When you download the Stoplight API designer for Mac (available on the account dashboard), you get the Prism API Proxy, which allows you to easily route all the traffic from your Macbook, as well as iPhone and IPad, through the platform. Once you create a new API, add the base URL for the API you are profiling, StoplLight does the rest, automatically generating an OpenAPI Spec, and attractive API documentation in the application, in real time as you watch--it is pretty cool to watch once you have turned on.</p>
<p>Why do I want to do this? Well first of all, I am someone who has spent five years traveling around the world wearing the same t-shirt evangelizing APIs to everyone who will listen--obviously I have a number of problems. Beyond that, I'm fascinated by the API design practices of the leading "dark APIs" I use everyday, but rather than doing so via a public API program, it is via a mobile device. I'm fascinated by this layer of the API sector, one that is fueling all of the API growth we are seeing, but getting a much smaller portion of the conversation that is dominated by leading public APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help me learn about what is possible with StopLight, I profiled the APIs that <a href="http://linkedin.api-docs.io/v1.0/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://instagram.api-docs.io/1.0/search">Instagram</a> mobile applications used. It took me about 15 minutes to go through each application, and hit publish on the documentation you see published to <a href="http://api-docs.io/">API Docs</a>. I feel that there are many lessons to be extracted by the API designs behind these leading applications, and continue providing lessons when you compare these API design strategies with the public API design strategies for the same companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure where all of this will lead. I know that profiling the APIs behind mobile applications is something many feel we shouldn't be doing, something I will write about separately, but I can't help but feel the opposite. In my opinion you should be proud of any APIs you make publicly available to drive any web, mobile, or device applications, and we should be having serious conversations around security, privacy, monetization, and other critical things that are increasingly happening in this shadowy layer of our digital lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-shadow-gear.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>After I've talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/05/automated-mapping-of-the-api-universe-with-charles-proxy-dropbox-openapi-spec-and-some-custom-apis/">my mapping of the public, and mobile APIs</a> with various folks over the last couple of months, I can usually put folks into one of three camps 1) they do not understand what the hell I am talking about and could care less, wishing the geek dude would shut up 2) thinks its a really interesting idea and worth exploring and discussing, or 3) they express concern, and liken it to scraping, and even hacking. I can understand folks not caring because they don't grasp it technically, but I do not fully yet grasp why people express concern, and think its wrong that I am mapping out, and wanting to discuss this layer of our digital world(s).</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/16/generating-openapi-specs-for-the-mobile-apps-you-depend-on-just-by-using-them/">As I was working with the new features in Stoplight.io last night</a>, profiling some of the applications on my mobile phone's desktop, I spent some more time thinking about this topic. I find it fascinating that companies do not consider the APIs they use to drive mobile applications as public infrastructure, when I can sit in my living room, and engage with them over the public Internet. i find it even more fascinating that some folks consider what I do as contributing to securing problems, when I map these APIs out, share and discuss them on the open Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not intercepting anyone's traffic, or hacking anyone's systems. I am simply using a publicly available mobile application I found in the app store, and I am interested in understanding how leading companies are designing their APIs. Next I'm interested in discussing how these APIs compare with the same companies public API infrastructure, or possibly why a company does not have a publicly available API program. After that, I am also looking for a better understanding around which of my life bits (and others) are being transported as part of my daily mobile app usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've heard many arguments on why this public infrastructure definition should remain private, like the data that is being transported over it. Ranging from security concerns, all the way to that users should just be thankful the service is available, and its the companies right to do what they think is right, and its the users right to not use the service--markets and all that stuff. While I think this may apply in some situations, there are many scenarios where users are uninformed, being straight up lied to, or do not have the agency to make a decision to leave a platform, or application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My focus in this discussion centers around consumer facing mobile, and device based apps. I'm not talking about business to business integrations, government services, and other digital infrastructure, I'm talking about the ubiquitous mobile apps that the average smart phone user is being pushed. This is the layer of the digital economy that is being built on the exhaust of the average mobile and Internet consumer. This is one reason why many folks do not want to disclose and discuss this shadowy layer of the application, IoT, and ultimately API economy--they hope they will get their piece of the action some day, and do not want to rub the money people wrong by rocking the boat.</p>
<p>While I think money motivates a lot of the thinking that occurs, but I can't help but feel that a narrow focus is also a part of it. In the mad rush to be the next big thing, a lot of things get kicked to the side. Things like security and privacy get overlooked, or compromised, and a security through obscurity strategy is installed by default, which works just fine until...well it doesn't. If the bad guys want to know your infrastructure, all they have to do is turn on Charles Proxy like I did, and route your computer, mobile and tablet devices through it. Hiding the blueprint for your APIs, that you are using over the open Internet, and being afraid to discuss them publicly is not good business, and doesn't address the security and privacy concerns everybody who operates on the open Internet will face at some point in the future.</p>
<p>I feel like having people in my world express concern to me about using Charles Proxy to map this world of APIs demonstrates there is an imbalance in the game. Wile I am looking to discuss the business thats going on in this layer, my priority is security and privacy around this very public infrastructure. I get that many of you have concerns about giving away your "not so" secret sauce, or that disclosing what goes on in this layer will hurt your bottom line, I'm thinking that discussing security and privacy should be prioritized, and not discussing them will eventually hurt your bottom line worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll end my rant there. I'm interested in gathering more of these concerns, as I continue to map out this layer of our digital world. Like the rest of my API research, I'm finding that I'm learning a lot about the API design strategy of leading mobile application providers, and better understanding of how APIs are fueling the mobile economy, which is something I am also looking to extend to the emerging device economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://stoplight.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/stoplight-io-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I stayed up way too late playing with some of the new features in <a href="http://stoplight.io/">Stoplight.io</a>. If you aren't familiar with what the Stoplight team has been cooking up--they have been hard at work crafting a pretty slick set of API modeling tools. I feel the platform provides me with a new way to look at the API life cycle--a perspective that spans multiple dimensions, including <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">definition</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">documentation</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">discovery</a>, orchestration, and <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">client</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stoplight.io gives me a pretty powerful platform for managing, interfacing, sharing, collaborating, publishing, understanding, and evolving my API designs and definitions. You can begin modeling your APIs by importing an existing OpenAPI Spec, RAML, or Postman collection, or get to work modeling a new or existing API via the Stoplight client interface, which is just one tool in the Stoplight modeling toolbox. Additionally, I am able to create separate work spaces and import the OpenAPI Spec <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">for all my own APIs</a>, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">APIs that I depend on in the API space</a>&nbsp;&lt; this organization is very important to me.</p>
<p>Stoplight.io provides me with a new way to approach the organization of my API design and definitions, but the biggest impact for me, is when it comes to modeling the existing APIs out there. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/05/automated-mapping-of-the-api-universe-with-charles-proxy-dropbox-openapi-spec-and-some-custom-apis/">I've been working on automating the generation of OpenAPI Spec definitons of the APIs I use, as I use them</a>--something that is two separate tasks at the moment. Stoplight.io does this, but does it waaaay better than what I have been doing, quietly crafting the OpenAPI Spec for any API I am using, in the background when you have Stoplight API discovery mode turned on, and the Prism API Proxy on.</p>
<p>I am enjoying the view of the API space that Stoplight.io is giving me. I got completely lost last night improving on my API designs, profiling other APIs in the space that were already in my work queue, and mapping out the dark APIs behind the mobile apps that I depend on (something I will write about separately). I am curious to see what API designers, and architects do with StopLight--I feel like it has the potential to shift the landscape pretty significantly, something I haven't seen any API service provider do in a while.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-definitions.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have had multiple conversations with folks in the space who are building services and tooling for the API sector lately, where I was asked whether or not they should only be using existing API definition formats, or create their own API definition format that better represents what they are delivering. The reasoning is usually that they feel their own format would offer a more comprehensive approach than any single, existing API definition could--yet they fully understand the potential for adoption when they use existing formats like <a href="http://apis.how/xmynjnqxwr">OpenAPI Spec</a> and <a href="http://apis.how/2zarzoqrhc">API Blueprint</a>.</p>
<p>My answer to them, is you deliver d) All The Above. I fully get that you will have your own unique view of the API space, and of what your tools and services will deliver, so you should be defining your own schema, but that you also can't ignore what is happening with OpenAPI Spec annd API Blueprint either. There is a groundswell of services, tooling, and savvy API architects and developers using these existing API definition formats, and you do not want to be an island in this very connected sea.</p>
<p>Some examples of this already in motion can be found with <a href="http://apis.how/kjtj5bbuxu">APIMATIC</a> and <a href="http://apis.how/v741olinqd">Runscope</a>. Both of these providers fluently speak multiple existing <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/organizations/">API definition formats</a>, but they also have their own, custom format for describing what their service(s) brings to the table. I'd say the one difference is that Runscope is more focused on their own format, emphasizing the import / export in the Runscope version, while APIMATIC is holding their version behind the scenes and emphasizing the use the existing API definition format of their own.</p>
<p>I think it is important that service providers flex both their own spec, as well as supporting existing formats like these providers do, even if it is just by using <a href="http://apis.how/okfoexmpcm">the API Transformer service</a>. However, there is also an opportunity at the intersection of these two worlds with the x- extension for OpenAPI Spec. I honestly am unsure if API Blueprint has similar features, but will find out shortly. This is where I see API service providers merging their own custom schema, with the existing OpenAPI Spec. You can do the same within the <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API dsicovery format APIs.json</a>, when it comes to defining your API indexes and collections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I talk OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and APIs.json with more providers, I am finding that the majority of them are understanding the importance of supporting the leading formats, but also see aspects of the space that don't get covered in these formats, and want to better contribute their own vision of the space. I support both these paths, as long as we do not ever find ourselves cornered in our dogma silos, only believing in a single API definition format, or only supporting our own proprietary format that nobody else speaks. #Balance #Interroperability</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://zapier.com"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/zapier-zaps-orchestration.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a>I'm spending some time going through <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/reference/">v2 docs for the Zapier API</a>, following the release of <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/workflow-automation/">multi steps work flow</a>s, and code steps for calculating, converting, and manipulating data and content, last week. While IFTTT gets a significant amount of the attention of the API reciprocity platforms I track on, I feel like Zapier is the most successful, and reflects most of what I'd lie to see in an API driven integration, and automation platform--specifically, the fact they have an API.</p>
<p>Along with keeping track of what Zapier is up to, I'm spending more time thinking about the increasing number of <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/">API driven bot platforms</a> I'm seeing emerge, and <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com">API enabled voice</a> platforms like <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service">Alexa Voice Service</a>. As I was reading Zapier's platform documentation, I couldn't help but see what I'd consider to be the essential building blocks for any integration, automation, and reciprocity platform emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - Providing the mechanisms for the most common approaches to API authentication, including basic auth, digest auth, session based, oAuth.</li>
<li><strong>Triggers</strong> - Provide the framework to use verbs and nouns, with help text, and webhook infrastructure to trigger anything users will desire.</li>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> - Provide the framework to use verbs and nouns, with help text, and webhook infrastructure to accomplish an action users will desire.</li>
<li><strong>Searches</strong> -Allowing for simple questions to be asked, and provide a framework to allow APIs to e employed in answering any question asked.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong> - Putting the automation in API integration, allowing for webhooks that can be triggered, and used as part of actions.</li>
<li><strong>Notification</strong> - Using notifications throughout the process to keep the platform, developers, and end-users informed about anything that is relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Scripting</strong> - Allowing for code integration for calculating, converting, and manipulating data as part of any step of the process.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-step</strong> - Going beyond just just triggers and actions, and allowing for multi-step workflows that put multiple APIs to use.</li>
<li><strong>Activation</strong> - Allowing developers and end-users of the integration, and automation to decide whether the process is invite only, private, or publicly available.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the scripting, multi-step, and activation pieces are pretty localized to Zapier, and other implementing platforms, the authentication, triggers, actions, searches, webhooks, and notifications are something that all API providers should be thinking about, as touch points with their own infrastructure. You should be supporting common approaches to API authentcation, using meaningful verbs and nouns in your API design, and have a robust webhooks workflow available for your platform.</p>
<p>As I do my research, I'm constantly looking for the common building blocks of any single area of my research--in this case API reciprocity. I'm adding these to the common building blocks in this research, but as you can see the webhooks portion also overlaps with my webhooks research. In addition to this overlap I am also looking for how these building blocks also overlap other existing research areas like bots, and real time, then even as part of some new areas I'm considering adding, like around serverless technology.</p>
<p>I am intrigued by these interesting overlaps in my core research right now, between reciprocity, bots, real time, voice, webhooks, and virtualizations. I'm also very interested in understanding more around how these areas are being applied in some of the areas I am research as part of my API stack work in messaging, social, and other sectors where APIs are making an impact.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-robot-voice.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just finished looking through the documentation for the <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/">Zapier API</a>, and for the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service">Alex Voice Service</a>, trying to understand the approach these platforms are taking to incorporate API driven resources into their services. How do you translate a single API call into a Zapier trigger or action? How do you build a rich index of resources for Alexa to search via voice commands? Learning how APIs are being consumed, or can be consume, is an infinitely fascinating journey for me, and something I enjoy researching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of my research into reciprocity, bots, and voice enablement via APIs, makes me think more about experience based API design, trumping much of the resource based dogma that has domnated much of the conversation. How will my APIs enable meaningful interoperability via Zapier, voice searches via Alexa, and stimulate interesting bot interactions? I am not just focusing on how my resources are defined, I am now also forced to think about how they will be searched, consumed, and put to use in these new client experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like mobile significantly shaped how we craft our APis, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">automation</a>, <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a>, <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/">bots</a>, and increasingly Internet connected devices will continue to define our API strategies. Users, and developers will increasingly small, meaningful resources that they can use to orchestrate their personal and business lives, that will respond to simple voice commands at home, in the car, and via our mobile devices. When we are designing our APIs, are we thinking about these bite-size resources that will be needed in this emerging bot and voice driven evolution in the API space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-start.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I shared a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/18/taking-a-snapshot-of-just-the-essential-api-building-blocks-across-my-research/">list of just the essential building blocks from across only 21 areas of my API areas of the API life cycle</a> with a company I'm helping craft an API strategy for, and I got some very common feedback--all this information is great, but where do I start with my API strategy? This is excellent feedback, as that particular overview is void of any specific 101, or on-boarding elements for each of the areas of the API life cycle that I cover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is on purpose for this particular document, providing me with a generic outline that I can use in many different scenarios, but the feedback rings loud in my ears, and is something I get constantly. I receive a constant barrage of emails, tweets, and voice mails asking me where they should get started with their API strategy, spanning both the provider, and consumer side of the API coin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem for me in all of this is that what "API" means, where someone is at in their journey, and what their overall goals are, can be radically different depending on who you talk to. What API design means to you, may not be what it means to the next. What API deployment might be about gateway solutions in your organizations, for others it means cloud based, or possibly specifically with a <a href="https://restlet.com/">Java API framework like Restlet</a>. My goal in my research is to to map out each area, distill down the common building blocks, then yes, build as many introductions (101), and on-boarding doorways as I can, targeting both API provider and consumers, across a wide variety of business sectors, and the public sphere.</p>
<p>To help illustrate my point, I get regular requests from folks around how do they pull all the data on Twitter via the API, and how do publish a video to all the leading video platforms via APIs. In the same day I will get requests on where do you start in defining a rating system that applies to all APIs, or start with APIs at a large higher educational institution where you have no contacts, with a very hostile IT department. The scope is wide, and varies dramatically, so creating a single document providing everyone with a getting started point is very, very difficult.</p>
<p>With that said, it is what I am working towards. 2015 was very much about mapping the scope of the entire space, and organize into specific areas (right or wrong). 2016 is very much about making sense of those areas, and each stop along the API life cycle, within the areas that I have mapped. I'm working on 101 pages for all 50 of the life cycle areas you find on my home page at the moment. I am already working with my partner 3Scale to take all the common building blocks I have, organize them into different areas, to craft what I'm calling "playbooks" for different verticals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are looking to deploy a content or data API, there will be a playbook. If you are looking to get started with APIs at your existing institution, government, or enterprise organizations, there will be a playbook for you. I plan on taking the overall map of the API life cycle I've drawn, and the common building blocks I've identified within these areas, and begin remixing and publishing them as specific scenarios, providing "playbooks" that hope to be relevant to more specific situations, helping organizations and individuals better understand where they should be starting with their API strategy.</p>
