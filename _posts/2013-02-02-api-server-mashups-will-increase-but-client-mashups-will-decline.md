{% include JB/setup %}<p>Master API architect at Layer7 Technologies Mike Amundsen (@mamund) has a great post this week on Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013.One of the predictions that caught my eye was that server mash-ups will increase but client mash-ups will decline--he clarifies it with: The increasing popularity of languages like Node.js, Erlang and Closure will make implementing server-side mash-ups more efficient and easier to maintain than doing the same work within a client application; especially for the mobile platform.This will reduce the “chattiness” of client-side applications and increase the security and flexibility of server-side implementations.The result will be a perceived increase in responsiveness and a reduced use of battery power on mobile apps.</p>
