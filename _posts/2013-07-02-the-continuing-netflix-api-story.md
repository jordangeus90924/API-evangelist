{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have written about the well publicized failure of the Netflix public APIÂ before, and how in the API space things are often not what they seem.By my measurement Netflix is a massive API success story, it is just not the classsic open API success story we all really want to be true.In the end the experiment that was the Netflix API didnt pan out, but that is ok.Netflix has found success with APIs internally, something I think will be the case with the majority of companies embarking on an API odyssey.And with Netflix continuing to tell the story of their successes and failures, everyone can learn from their hard work.</p>
