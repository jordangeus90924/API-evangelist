I’ve been tracking the [adoption of the White House CIO's digital strategy][2], trying understand each agency's mobile and API plans.

Today I noticed that NASA, in addition to publishing their digital strategy in [HTML][1], [XML][3] and [JSON][4], added a "recent commits" Github widget on their digital strategy homepage.

It’s a small, but very important addition. It shows that NASA sees the importance of not just using Github, but pushing code and interacting with developers via the social network.

[Github][6] is a service that is getting more traction within government, and I hope that more federal agencies don’t just put it to use, but make it part of the culture within their organization.

Github is more than a code repository, it will also help your agency be more "**collaborative and open by default**".
