One way to make sure your API has qualified and reputable developers from day one is to tap into an existing freelance developer community.<p>
Popular freelance sites like Elance provide existing communities of developers with the skills an API owner or partner is looking for.<p>
Elance provides access to their developer communities via a RESTful API.<p>
Using the Elance API, I have built a plug and play API developer community.<p>
My API Evangelist, <a title="Elance API Developer Community" href="http://elance.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">API Developer Community </a>prototype provides an example of what is possible when tapping into existing developer communities to satisfy the development needs of a new API community.<p>
My API developer community provides the following tools:<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/elance-api-developer-area-screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Browse Developers (by tag) </strong>- Allows users to browse developers by categories (tags) that are predefined.  Settings to allow API owner to only display the type of developers, skills and tags that are relevant.</li>
	<li><strong>All Developers Listing -</strong> Provides a paged results of all developers for an API area.</li>
	<li><strong>Search Developer (by Name, Details, Tag) -</strong> A single keyword search textbox that provides a search results of Elance Providers.</li>
	<li><strong>Developer Detail / Profile Page -</strong> Displays a single user profile page with selected fields by API owner.</li>
	<li><strong>Featured Developer (Single Widget) -</strong> Displays a single random and/or highest rated developer profile.</li>
</ul>
The goal of my <a title="Elance API Developer Community" href="http://elance.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">developer community powered by Elance</a> is to show what is possible when integrating an API community with other freelance developer communities like Elance.<p>
The plug and play API developer community is written in PHP, uses the <a title="Elance API" href="https://www.elance.com/p/api" target="_blank">Elance API</a> for all of its data, and will be available on Github shortly.
