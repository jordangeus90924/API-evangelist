The payment API provider Stripe [released a jQuery payment tool][1], a general purpose library for building credit card forms, validating input, and formatting numbers. The library was developed to support [Checkout][2], Stripe's embeddable checkout widget.

Simple, but extremely useful libraries like this can go a long way to introduce developers to your APIs and put valuable tools into their toolbox, that will help them be successful. Â Something that can go a long way in establishing a loyalty between you and your developer community.

You can find a [live demo][3] of the library, as well as the [source on GitHub][4].
