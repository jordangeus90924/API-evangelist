API governance begins with standardizing the design of your APIs, but continues with how you document, tesst, and deliver your APIs at scale, helping teams be more consistent in how they produce and iterate upon API resources, capabilities, and experiences. API governance is about establishing common standards, policies, and rules to help automate how APIs are designed and delivered, enabling developers to do the right thing along the way when it comes to producing APIs. API governance is about mapping out the enterprise API landscape between every piece of infrastructure, application, and integration, and make sure things are done as consistently, securely, and efficiently delivered to support business.

Remember, few on the enterprise API factory floow within your enterprise will care about governance, and governance needs to look more like enablement, providing teams with the standards, policies, and tooling to get their work done. Governance begins with discovery, but then is also about the reliability of your APIs, but then the consistency in design, deployment, observability, and distribution of your APIs at scale across any team or domain. API governance is the top area that enterprise organizations should be investing today. API governance is what will make the difference between the winners and losers in coming years.
