        <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/reciprocity-trends.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent time this week looking at 20, of what I&rsquo;m calling <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">API reciprocity providers</a>, who are providing a new generation of what is historically known as ETL in the enterprise, to connect, transfer, transform and push data and content between the cloud services we are increasingly growing dependent on.</p>
<p>With more and more of our lives existing in the cloud and via mobile devices, the need to migrate data and content between services will only grow more urgent.  While ETL has all the necessary tools to accomplish the job, the cloud democratized IT resources, and the same will occur to ETL, making these tools accessible by the masses.</p>
<p>There are quite a few ETL solutions, but I feel there are 3 solutions that are starting to make a migration towards an easier to understand and implement vision of ETL:</p>

<p>These providers are more robust, and provide much of the classic ETL tools the enterprise is used to, but also have the new emphasis on API driven services.  But there are 10 new service providers I&rsquo;m calling reciprocity platforms, that demonstrate the potential with offering very simple tasks, triggers and actions that can provide interaction between two or more API services:</p>

<p>I consider reciprocity an evolution of ETL, because of three significant approaches:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Simple, meaningful connections with transfer and tranformations that are meaningful to end users, not just a wide array of ETL building blocks an IT architect has to implement</li>
<li><strong>API</strong> - Reciprocity platforms expose meaningful connections users have the cloud services they depend on.  While you can still migrate from databases or file locations as with classic ETL, reciprocity platforms focus on APIs, while maintaining the value for end-users as well as the originating or target platforms</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong> - Reciprocity focus on not just transmitting data and content, but identifying the value of the payload itself and the relationships, and emotions in play between users and the platforms they depend on</li>
</ul>
<p>This new generation of ETL providers began the migration online with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="Yahoo Pipes" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a></span>.  Which resonated with the alpha developers looking to harvest, migrate, merge, mashup and push data from RSS, XML, JSON and other popular API sources--except Yahoo lacked the simplicity necessary for wider audience appeal.</p>
<p>While I feel the 10 reciprocity providers isted above represent this new wave, there are six others incumbents trying to solve the same problem:</p>

<p>While studying the approach of these 20 reciprocity providers, it can be tough to identify a set of common identifiers to refer to the value created. &nbsp;Each provider has their own approach and potentially identifying terminology.  For my understanding, I wanted to try and establish a common way to describe how reciprocity providers are redefining ETL. &nbsp;While imperfect, it will give me a common language to use, while also being a constant work in progress.</p>
<p>For most reciprocity providers, it starts with some ecompassing wrapper in the form of an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">assembly</span> which describes the overall recipe, formula or wrapper that contains all the moving ETL parts.</p>
<p>Within this assembly, you can execute on workflows, usually in a single flow, but with some of the providers you can daisy chain together multiple (or endless) workflows to create a complex series of processes.</p>
<p>Each workflow has a defining trigger which determines the criteria that will start the workflow such as new RSS post or new tweet, and with each trigger comes a resulting action which is the target of the workflow, publishing the RSS post to a syndicated blog or adds the tweet to a Google Spreadsheet or Evernote, or any other combination of trigger and action a user desires.</p>
<p>Triggers and actions represent the emotional connections that are the underpinnings of ETL&rsquo;s evolution into a more meaningful, reciprocation of value that is emerging in the clouds.  These new providers are connecting to the classic lineup of ETL interfaces to get things done:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Files</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Web Service</li>
</ul>
<p>While also providing the opportunity for development of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">open connectors</span> to connect to any custom database, file, messages and web services.  But these connectors are not described in boring IT terms, they are wrapped in the emotion and meaning derived from the cloud service--which could have different meanings for different users. This is where one part of the promise of reciprocity comes into play, by empowering average problem owners and every day users to define and execute against these types of API driven agreements.</p>
<p>All of these actions, tasks, formulas, jobs or other types of process require the ability to plan, execute and audit the processes, with providers offering:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Scheduling</li>
<li>History / Logging</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p>With data being the lifeblood of much of these efforts, of course we will see &ldquo;big data&rdquo; specific tools as well:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Synchronization </li>
<li>Data Quality</li>
<li>Big Data</li>
<li>Analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>While many reciprocity providers are offering interoperability between two specific services, moving data and resource from point a to b, others are bringing in classic ETL transformations:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Reformat</li>
<li>Aggregate</li>
<li>Sort</li>
<li>Dedupe</li>
<li>Filter</li>
<li>Partition</li>
<li>Merge</li>
<li>Join</li>
<li>Split</li>
<li>Convert</li>
</ul>
<p>After the trigger and before the action, there is also an opportunity for other things to happen, with providers offering:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Push</li>
<li>Events</li>
</ul>
<p>During trigger, action or transformation there are plenty of opportunities for custom scripting and transofrmations, with several approaches to custom programming:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Custom Scripts</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Command Line</li>
<li>API</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases the reciprocity provider also provides a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">key value store</span> allowing the storage of user specified data extracted from trigger or action connections or during the transformation process.  Introducing a kind of memory store during the reciprocal cycle.</p>
<p>With the migration of critical resources, many of the leading providers are offering tools for testing the process before live execution:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Test</li>
<li>Debugger</li>
<li>Sandbox</li>
<li>Production</li>
</ul>
<p>With any number of tasks or jobs in motion, users will need to understand whether the whole apparatus is working, with platforms offering tools for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are a couple providers offering completely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">open source</span> solutions, there are also several providing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OEM</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">white label solutions</span>, which allow you to deploy a reciprocity platform for your partners, clients or other situations that would require it to branded in a custom way.</p>
<p>One area that will continue to push ETL into this new category of reciprocity providers is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">security</span>.  Connectors will often use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OAuth</span>, respecting a users already established relationship with platform either on the trigger or action sides, ensureing their existing relationship is upheld.  Beyond this providers are offering <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SSL</span> to provide secure transmissions, but in the near future we will see other layers emerge to keep agreements in tact, private and maintain the value of not just the payload but the relationships between platforms, users and reciprocity providers.</p>
<p>Even though reciprocity providers focus on the migration of resources in this new API driven, cloud-based world, several of them still offer dual solutions for deploying solutions in both environments:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Cloud </li>
<li>On-Premise</li>
</ul>
<p>There is not one approach either in the cloud, or on premise that will work for everyone and all their needs.  Some data will be perfectly find moving around the cloud, while others will require a more sensitive on-premise approach.  It will be up to problem owners to decide.</p>
<p>Many of this new breed of providers are in beta and pricing &nbsp;isn&rsquo;t available.  A handful have begun to apply cloud based pricing models, but most are still trying to understand the value of this new service and what market will bear.  So far I&rsquo;m seeing pricing based upon:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Seat</li>
<li>Assembly</li>
<li>Tasks</li>
<li>Connections</li>
<li>Extension</li>
<li>Sync</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Training</li>
</ul>
<p>Much like IaaS, PaaS SaaS and now BaaS, reciprocity providers will have a lot of education and communication with end users before they&rsquo;ll fully understand what they can charge for their services--forcing them to continue to define and differentiate themselves in 2013.</p>
<p>One of the most important evolutionary areas, I&rsquo;m only seeing with one or two providers, is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">marketplace</span> where reciprocity platform users can browse and search for assemblies, connectors and tasks that are created by 3rd party providers for specific reciprocity approaches.  A marketplace will prove to be how reciprocity platforms serve the long tail and niches that will exist within the next generation of ETL.  Marketplaces will provide a way for developers to build solutions that meet specific needs, allowing them to monetize their skills and domain expertise, while also bringing in revenue to platform owners.</p>
<p>I understand this is all a lot of information.  If you are still ready this, you most likely either already understand this space, or like me, feel it is an important area to understand and help educate people about.   Just like with API service providers and BaaS, I will continue to write about my research here, while providing more refined materials as Github repos for each research area.</p>
<p>Let me know anything I'm missing or your opinions on the concept of API reciprocity.</p>

<p>Making onboarding with an API as frictionless as possible is one thing I like to study and educate my readers about. While I was studying what I call the <a title="API reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">API reciprocity</a> space currently, which is an evolution of what is known in the enterprise as ETL, I came across a company called FoxWeave.</p>
<p><a title="FoxWeave" href="http://www.foxweave.com/" target="_blank">FoxWeave</a> is a service that can migrate and synchronize data across all your cloud and on-premise apps and databases.  When I went to &ldquo;try it now&rdquo; at FoxWeave, I was told &ldquo;no signup needed&rdquo;.  But I didnt&rsquo; think much about it until I saw the temporary guest account popup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxweave.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/foxweave/foxweave-temporary-guest.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>What a powerful concept.  Evolving the freemium concept into the world of anonymity, allowing me to play with and understand your service before having to commit in any way.  One less piece of friction when I&rsquo;m trying to understad a new tool or service.</p>
<p>Nice work <a title="FoxWeave" href="http://www.foxweave.com/" target="_blank">FoxWeave</a>.  Way to make interoperability and automation using APIs as frictionless as possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2013</span>

<p>There is a great post by Lorinda Brandon (<a href="https://twitter.com/lindybrandon">@lindybrandon</a>) of <a title="SmartBear" href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> on ProgrammableWeb today called&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2013/02/27/governance-vs-innovation-do-they-have-to-be-enemies/">Governance vs Innovation: Do They Have to be Enemies?</a>. &nbsp;She continues a conversation, from <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> around the word "governance", and how in the API space, this is often considered a bad word. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was moderating the questions for <span>Alistair Farquharson (</span><span lang="EN"><a href="https://twitter.com/afarqu">@</a></span><span lang="EN"><a href="https://twitter.com/afarqu">afarqu</a>)</span><span>&nbsp;CTO of&nbsp;</span><a title="SOA Software" href="http://www.soa.com/">SOA Software</a>, when&nbsp;<span>Irakli Nadareishvili (</span><a href="http://twitter.com/inadarei/" target="_blank">@inadarei</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> actually agreed that it is a bad word and asked if we need to evolve beyond it and not embrace it. &nbsp;I totally agree with Lorinda's approach to walking the line between governance and innovation, and look forward to more discussion around how to analyze API vs SOA principles within the enterprise--striking a balance that works for each individual approach.</p>
<p>To help stimulate this conversation I wanted to break down the word, governance. &nbsp;In the context of IT, governance is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>a concept used for activities related to exercising control over services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). The definitions of SOA governance agree in its purpose of exercising control, but differ in the responsibilities it should have. Some narrow definitions focus on imposing policies and monitoring services, while other definitions use a broader business-oriented perspective</em></p>
<p>With general definitions being:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>the persons who make up a body for the purpose of administering something</li>
<li>the act of governing; exercising authority</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the illness around the word, when it is applied to APIs becomes clear when you start looking at the synonyms:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Governance</strong> - administration, authority, bureaucracy, command, control, direction, domination, dominion, empire, execution, executive, guidance, influence, jurisdiction, law, ministry, patronage, political practice, politics, polity, power, powers-that-be, predominanc</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong> - administration, care, charge, command, conduct, control, direction, governance , government, guidance, handling, intendance, manipulation, operation, oversight, rule, superintendence, superintendency, supervision</li>
<li><strong>Regulation</strong> - adjustment, administration, arrangement, classification, codification, control, coordination, direction, governance , governing, government, guidance, handling, management, moderation, modulation, reconciliation, regimentation, reorganization, settlement, standardization, superintendence, supervision, systematization, tuning</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's separate the potentially bad synonyms:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/governance-bad.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>administration</li>
<li>authority</li>
<li>bureaucracy</li>
<li>command</li>
<li>control</li>
<li>domination</li>
<li>dominion</li>
<li>empire</li>
<li>power</li>
<li>politics</li>
<li>control</li>
<li>government</li>
<li>manipulation</li>
<li>oversight</li>
<li>standardization</li>
</ul>
<p>And the good synonyms:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/governance-good.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>direction</li>
<li>execution</li>
<li>guidance</li>
<li>influence</li>
<li>care</li>
<li>operation</li>
<li>arrangement</li>
<li>coordination</li>
<li>standardization</li>
<li>tuning</li>
<li>modulation</li>
<li>power</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel both power and standardization could be both good or evil, so I put in both categories. &nbsp;But overall you can begin to understand how governance is viewed in negative light in the API approach. &nbsp;People see it more about power and control, rather than the healthy aspects introduced API innovation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, this word reflects on why API works in more scenarios than strict SOA. &nbsp;Too much control can stifle innovation, and if you are controlling for all the wrong reasons, it can be even worse. &nbsp;APIs require a certain amount of oxygen to grow and evolve before it can achieve a level of innovation, which is an aspect some business leaders have trouble grasping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Irakli and I both agreed that we need a new word, something that reflects the bottom up of API, not the top down control of SOA. &nbsp;Any ideas for a word that can keep be applied in a healthy way, but can institute many of the positive aspects of governance, without the potential innovation killing power and control?</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/reciprocity-trends.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m wading through dictionaries and thesauruses in an effort to find a <a href="/2013/02/27/what-is-better-word-for-governance-when-it-comes-to-apis/">more appropriate term &ldquo;governance&rdquo;, when looking at SOA governance through the API lense</a>--I figured I&rsquo;d flush out another area I&rsquo;m working to define a term that appropriately describes automation and interoperability using APIs.</p>
<p>Yesterday I took a look at <a href="/2013/02/26/75-features-from-across-31-baas-providers/">31 backend as a service (BaaS) providers</a>, in hopes of understanding more about what value they provide.  Today I'm diving into the automation section of my new <a href="/trends/">API trends area</a>. While reviewing, I noticed the exact same companies that were under automation were also in interoperability.  So I set out to find a new word to apply to this next generation of ETL providers that are building bridges between cloud platforms using APIs, as well as legacy data connections.</p>
<p>I have settled on the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reciprocity</span>.  The dictionary defines reciprocity as:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>the quality or state of being reciprocal : mutual dependence, action, or influence</li>
<li>a mutual exchange of privileges; specifically : a recognition by one of two countries or institutions of the validity of licenses or privileges granted by the other</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/social-reciprocity.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When you look in the thesaurus, reciprocity has a definition of "interchange" with synonyms of cooperation, exchange, mutuality and reciprocation.  Reciprocity is also a synonym of connection with a definition of &ldquo;person who aids another in achieving goal&rdquo;. With synonyms being acquaintance, agent, ally, associate, association, contact, friend, go-between, intermediary, kin, kindred, kinship, mentor, messenger, network, reciprocity, relation, relative and sponsor. &nbsp;(i love that "kin" is a synonym too)</p>
<p>All of these terms apply to what I&rsquo;m seeing unfold with this new generation of ETL providers.  ETL is moving into the clouds, and out from behind the firewall, using the open web, cloud platforms and APIs, and now we have to <a href="/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">rethink ETL, and make it accessible to the masses</a>. Put it within reach of the everday problem owners.</p>
<p>What I really like about reciprocity is it describes the mutual relationship between users and the platforms where their data and information resides.  Reciprocity describes the connection that has to occur between these valuable API platforms, and their users, in ways the ETL misses.  ETL stands for extract, transform and load, very technical and programmatic responses to moving my valuable resources, assets and personal information between the cloud platform I depend on daily.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/reciprocity-2.jpeg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the physical world we have reciprocity agreements between countries to ensure free trade and a healthy balance in world markets.  This next generation of reciprocity platform providers will not just be extracting, transforming and loading data--reciprocity platforms will be the nervous system of the global API economy, moving valuable resources around the world while respecting relationships between users, developers and the platforms in a way that preserves maximum value for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Now under the <a href="/trends/">trends section</a> you will just see one section for <a title="reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity</a>, that will house all 19 of this new breed of API service providers.  We&rsquo;ll see how things change, but for now I think reciprocity describes the value created by this new space, in a way that helps me communicate it to others.</p>

<p>We closed up the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apistrat&amp;src=typd">#APIstrat</a>) last friday with a panel called APIs, Platforms and Ecosystem, where I moderated a healthy discussion with Tyler Stalder (<a href="https://twitter.com/tylerstalder">@tylerstalder</a>)&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com/" target="_blank">Singly</a>,&nbsp;Seth Blank (<a href="https://twitter.com/AntiFreeze">@AntiFreeze</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="YourTrove" href="https://www.yourtrove.com/">YourTrove</a>,&nbsp;Asif Rahman (<a href="https://twitter.com/asifrahman">@asifrahman</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="NewsCred" href="http://newscred.com/">Newscred</a>, Orian Marx (<a href="http://alpha.app.net/orian">@orian</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a>,&nbsp;Travis Wallis (<a href="https://twitter.com/traviswallis" target="_blank">@traviswallis</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://peoplebrowsr.com/" target="_blank">PeopleBrowsr</a>&nbsp;around the very broad spectrum of APIs, platforms and the concept of ecosystems.</p>
<p>One of the questions I asked the group was, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which of the three OAuth Legs is the most important?</span> &nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide a quick primer for the portion of my audience that aren&rsquo;t OAuth geeks:</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth is an open standard for authorization that provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner</a></em></blockquote>
<p>Ok, what does that mean?  Think Twitter.  Twitter is server.  You are the owner of your tweet resources.  When you authenticate anywhere using your Twitter ID, that website or app uses OAuth to get access to your tweets, via the Twitter platform.  If you login to your Twitter account, click on settings and select apps from the left menu--these are apps and sites that have requested OAuth access <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> Twitter resources.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/oauth/OAuth2.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p>OAuth is a relationship between you, your platform provider and various sites and apps that want to access your data via the API.  Sometimes these apps and your platform provider are one and the same, but the beauty of OAuth&nbsp;is that anyone can request access from you--access that you can revoke when you choose.</p>
<p>Back to the panel at API Strategy &amp; Practice.  Every panelist, except for Asif Rahman of Newscred said that the most important leg of oAuth is the end user. This made me happy because it shows that, at least at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apistrat&amp;src=typd">#APIstrat</a>, people are concerned with the interest of the end user.  This is healthy.</p>
<p>In reality, I worry that when platform discussions do occur, the conversation leans too much in favor of platform, then the developer, with very little to no involvement of the end user.  Think of the Twitter ecosystem discussions since March of 2010.  Rarely do you hear discussion about API access and ecosystem viability in the context of the end-users.  Platforms and especially developers are very good at being very loud in these conversations.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/oauth/oauth-twitter-3-legs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my opinion all three legs of OAuth are equally important, with an emphasis on the end-user.  It is their resource right?  Or is it?  The only thing standing between healthy OAuth conversations and relationships is the platforms terms of use and privacy policies.</p>
<p>The entire panel at #APIStrat agreed that we need more education for end-users about OAuth.  Now that we have OAuth 2.0 settled (in some minds), we need to get down to business <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">educating all three legs</span></em>&nbsp;around the process of OAuth and its best practices, empowering all three parties to be aware, and participate in ongoing conversations about how we are producing, storing, sharing, selling, licensing and consuming resources via APIs.</p>
<p>We need to make sure API platform conversations have all three legs represented.  The success of any platform will depend on a healthy balance between a platform, developers and the end-users--with oAuth 2.0 being the best model we have to make this happen to date.</p>
<p>Lets get to work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the power of the freemium model when it comes to APIs.  Nothing is as it seems when you are deploying managing or consuming APIs.  You have to have room to innovate and iterate without signing contracts or paying too much, before you find exactly the right integration or deployment that works.</p>
<p>This freemium approach to APIs is one of the biggest reasons I&rsquo;ve been supporting <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> since early days of API Evangelist.  3Scale was the original API service provider to offer a truly freemium tier for anyone wanting to deploy an API, and remains passionate about this to this day.</p>
<p>During the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC</a> last week, I had the pleasure of meeting the <a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> team, who share a similar perspective of the space, resulting in them launching a new suite of free tools that will help you develop, test and monitor while building API driven software.</p>

<p>The goal of the new freeware initiative is to put robust tools for quality software development into the hands of developers and testers immediately while allowing them to upgrade to the feature-rich paid versions when it makes practical sense.  I sat down with Lorinda Brandon, Director of Strategy, SmartBear Software while at #apistrat, where she said:</p>
<blockquote><em>The burgeoning API industry is a reflection of a new phase of innovation and collaboration in the software industry as a whole. Businesses and organizations are now sharing their data and functionality via APIs like never before, often for free. In fact, businesses are even inviting the developer community to come together in hackathons to build apps and mashups using their APIs. While we applaud the energy and pace, we also want to keep the focus on building high quality products. In 2013, SmartBear wants to empower this collaborative global community of developers to create high-quality, low-cost (or free) offerings of their own by making even more of our tools available for free through our Freeware Initiative.</em></blockquote>
<p>I agree 100%.  Freemium can be a critical marketing vehicle in the API industry, one that will bring attention to your tools and services, while also providing room for your customers to put tools to use in a meaningful way, that will truly add value to their world--without overcommitting.  Once a tool proves itself in someone&rsquo;s world, they can choose to upgrade and evolve to more premium offerings.</p>
<p>All six tools from SmartBear will be added to my <a href="/apitools/">tools section</a>, which is meant to provide a toolbox of free and downloaded software for API owners and developers to take advantage of.  SmartBear says this is just the beginning and they will be adding more tools in the future.  As they become available I will publish and keep track of via <a href="/apitools/">API Evangelist tools</a>.</p>

<p>The BaaS space is heating up with lots of discussion about whether you should charge developers by active user, features, storage or API call--with each provider being pretty vocal about where they stand.

<p>After reading about <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/transparency-report-what-it-takes-for.html">Google&rsquo;s release of their transparency report last month</a>, I decided I would be <a href="http://apivoice.com/2013/01/23/making-transparency-reports-standard-operating-procedure/">addding API transparency reports to my list of essential building blocks</a> for API owners. Since I wrote that, I&rsquo;ve had a great post from EFF also <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/its-time-transparency-reports-become-new-normal">stating that its time for transparency reports to become the new normal</a>. &nbsp;Where the EFF outlines the illness in our current approach:</p>
<blockquote><em>When you use the Internet, you entrust your thoughts, experiences, photos, and location data to intermediaries &mdash; companies like AT&amp;T, Google, and Facebook. But when the government requests that data, users are usually left in the dark.</em></blockquote>
<p>In the United States, companies are not required by law to alert their users when they receive a government request for their data, and in some circumstances, they are explicitly prohibited from doing so.   So it is up to us, the users to join organizations like the EFF and let all online service providers understand the importance of transparency reports becoming default operating procedure.</p>
<p>Currently, we are only seeing transparency reports from providers like Google, DropBox, LinkedIn, Twitter and a handful of other service providers.  While I feel that all companies that run on users data should provide transparency reports, I&rsquo;m going to focus on making sure it is standard operating procedures with companies that deliver APIs.</p>
<p>As a starting point for my API transparency report building block, I&rsquo;m using the <a href="http://www.skypeopenletter.com/">letter that was drafted by concerned privacy advocates who are calling for Microsoft to issue a transparency report on Skype</a>, which it purchased in 2011 for $8.5 billion.</p>
<p>This letter states that:</p>
<blockquote><em> Skype is a voice, video and chat communications platform with over 600 million users worldwide, effectively making it one of the world&rsquo;s largest telecommunications companies.   Many of its users rely on Skype for secure communications&mdash;whether they are activists operating in countries governed by authoritarian regimes, journalists communicating with sensitive sources, or users who wish to talk privately in confidence with business associates, family, or friends. </em></blockquote>
<p>The Skype effort provides a beginning list of items all transparency reports should provide:</p>

<ol class="mainlist">

<li>Documentation regarding the current operational relationship between the company with and other third-party licensed users of company technology, including the companies understanding of the surveillance and censorship capabilities that users may be subject to as a result of using these alternatives.</li>
<li>A company&rsquo;s interpretation of its responsibilities under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), its policies related to the disclosure of call metadata in response to subpoenas and National Security Letters (NSLs), and more generally, the policies and guidelines for employees followed when a company receives and responds to requests for user data from law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States and elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your company is going to provide a service that users depend on, one that retains their personal data in any way--you should have a transparency report that educates users about how and what any government is accessing and using information about them.</p>
<p>This applies to any data collected or transmitted via APIs from a platform via 3rd party platforms and services.  APIs owe it to end users to provide insight into how their data is being used by 3rd party application developers via oAuth, the same insight should be provided regarding how government organizations is accessing and using data as well.</p>

<p>My goal is to better understand what features are offered across these 31 BaaS providers.  To accomplish this, I spent no more than an hour per provider looking through their sites and playing with their products to get at least a basic understanding of their offerings.</p>
<p>When looking for features I tried to standardize the best I could, but it is difficult when there are different approaches to the deployment of resources on each platform.  I found about 75 distinct features being offered across the 31 BaaS providers.  I&rsquo;m sure there are other features, and vital details missing, but I wanted to start somewhere.  Here is what I found, organized as best I could:</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://kinlane.github.com/backend-as-a-service/">view all 75 features at the BaaS Github Repository</a> I setup.  Let me know any that you feel are missing, and I&rsquo;ll consider adding.</p>
<p>Next up, I will add the features into my BaaS tracking database and publish a breakdown of providers, with the features they offer.  Letting people search and filter, and also open up to each BaaS provider to comment and submit additional features they offer.</p>

<p>One of the lively discussions at the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC</a> last week was the backend as a service (BaaS) panel I moderated towards the end of the first day.</p>
<p>We brought together <span>Ilya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> to talk about the fast growing BaaS space.</p>
<p>I kicked things off with some pretty standard stuff, by having each person introduce themselves and explain what they do.   Next I asked them to explain what differentiates themselves from the other folks on the couch.</p>
<p>After that, things started heating up when I brought up a discussion about BaaS pricing, from an <a href="/2013/02/07/which-baas-pricing-model-is-better/">earlier online discussion about the mertits of user, feature or pricing base upon number of API calls</a>.  The common approach is user or api based pricing, with Stackmob focused on feature based BaaS pricing.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 50px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The conversation was definitely lead by Ty Amell of StackMob, with pointed rebuttals from Ilya Sukhar of Parse, with Miko Matasumura of Kii in between, being very diplomatic while also throwing some jabs of his own. Morgan Bickle of Kinvey, Marc Weil of Cloudmine and James Tamplin of Firebase held their own, but it things were definitely overshadowed by the discussion by Ty and Ilya.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 50px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="margin-left: 50px;">

<p>Next the panel moved the discussion to the future of Baas, with direct questions about what potential exit strategies are for each of the platforms.</p>
<p>At times the panel seemed like a reality show from the BaaS world or a daytime talk show featuring the leaders in the BaaS space.</p>
<p>The Backend as a Service panel really showed the personalities behind the leading companies in the space.  I was so engaged in the conversation, thinking about the next questions I can't recall everything that was said. &nbsp;I remember some pretty sharp comments from both Ty and Ilya. &nbsp;I look forward to watching again when the video is ready from #APIStrat.</p>

<p>I see a lot of dead simple, yet meaningful uses of APIs come across my desk (I don&rsquo;t have a desk, why do I keep saying this?) each day.  One I saw today is something every school, whether K-12, college or university should have.</p>
<p>Using the UC Berkeley API, you can get a list of all departments:</p>
<blockquote><em>_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/department?departmentCode=a&amp;app_id=309fe68e&amp;app_key=51b9d67dc4f0501eed763822a641b17b"_</em></blockquote>
<p>Then with the proper department code you can pull a list of classes:</p>
<blockquote><em>_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/classoffering?departmentCode=ARCH&amp;app_id=your-id&amp;app_key=your-key"_</em></blockquote>

<p>The <a title="UC Berkeley API Management" href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley API Management Portal</a> is brand new, I&rsquo;m still working on separate story regarding their approach, but I wanted to talk about how good it is to see such straightforward, valuable uses of an API at a leading university.</p>
<p>This simple example is something you should be able to do by default at all schools across the country.</p>
<p>The best part is that the API team is actively communicating these uses of the API on Google+, which is how I came across the story.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-practice-steve-kin-open.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>Its the Monday morning after the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>.  The conference went off without a hitch, and was exactly the conference I envisioned when 3Scale first contacted me seven months ago about the idea of putting on the event. &nbsp;In July of 2012 Steve Willmott the CEO and founder of 3Scale sent me an email stating:</p>
<blockquote><em>..we're thinking of finally getting round to organizing an API focused event (conference) which tries to help spread knowledge about API, promote good practice and broaden the API tent beyond what it is today. The aim would be an event which combined both "business and practice" - meaning one element which tackles critical topics such as business models, strategy, success stories etc. and another which is about "what can be done with APIs" and "how to make it happen technically".</em></blockquote>
<p>Closing with:</p>
<blockquote><em>The final important thing is we'd like it to be a very open event - with a range of supporters, speakers and attendees and - while vendors might sponsor - it wouldn't be a "vendor" event.</em></blockquote>
<p>To which I responded with:</p>
<blockquote><em>Sounds like a great idea to me.  I'm in, and willing to help in any way I can.</em></blockquote>
<p>Of course I would be in.  I&rsquo;ve wanted this type of conference to occur for a while now, and what better way to make sure it happens right, than doing it yourself!  It was an amazing opportunity for me--there was no ignoring it.</p>
<p>As many of you know the original conference was scheduled for November 1st and 2nd in New York, City.  But due to hurricane Sandy, we had to postpone the conference and we ended up rescheduling it for last Thursday and Friday, February 21st and 22nd at the same venue--the Westin Grand Central in NYC.</p>
<p>In the end, the conference ended up with about 350 registered (<strong>SOLD OUT</strong>),with about what appears to be about 275-325 floating around each day, coming and going listening to <a title="talks from over 70 companies in the API space" href="/2013/02/12/companies-that-are-speaking-at-api-strategy-practice/">talks from over 70 companies in the API space</a>.  It was exactly the mix of folks I had hoped to see--ranging from marketing, advertising, business and developers who were new to APIs, to the moderately skilled players who were looking to polish their skills as well as being a who&rsquo;s who of API experts across the industry.</p>
<p>I did not get to attend as many of the sessions as I wished, and due to event coordination I wasn&rsquo;t always present main stage to hear complete talks. But on Monday morning here is what&rsquo;s fresh in my mind:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Laura Merling</strong> - Its great to see Laura&rsquo;s approach to helping organize AT&amp;T&rsquo;s API strategy.  I look forward to closely following not just her strategy, but understand her tactical considerations for helping the telco giant successful navigate the API space.</li>
<li><strong>Jeff Lawson</strong> - Jeff never fails to deliver.  He always has informative talks that are entertaining, but also deliver vital overviews of the space. &nbsp;This time its all about software people!</li>
<li><strong>Payments Session</strong> - I heard from several folks this session was a very lively discussion between Paypal and the newer generation of payment providers like Stripe, Braintree and Dwolla.</li>
<li><strong>Security Session</strong> - Like the payment one I was not present, but I heard from several folks there was a pretty interesting exchange.  I look forward to the video.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Klabnik </strong>- Everyone needs to be exposed to Steve&rsquo;s extremely clear perspective of not just open APIs, but open software development.  His talks are never about product or companies, they are more a philosophical vision that is rooted in a healthy understanding of developers, development communities and how it dovetails into society, business and politics.</li>
<a href="http://3scale.net" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<li><strong>Backend as a Service Panel </strong>- I had so much fun on this panel.  I cannot wait to see the video.  The banter back and forth between <span>lya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> was priceless.  At times, it felt like reality TV show. There will definitely be more discussion about this panel.</li>
<li><strong>Jeff Meisel </strong>- I&rsquo;m captivated by the potential of National Instrument&rsquo;s Labview Tools API program.   His talk walked us through the potential from a platform that can provide any physically engineered object with an API.  Jeff&rsquo;s talk left my mind spinning with visions around the future of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>John Musser</strong> - John always delivers an education for anyone in the space, whether your novice, intermediate or expert.  And his 20 API Business Models in 20 Minutes continued this trend.  As someone who is immersed in the space as I am, I immediately recognize the amount of work and perspective that is needed to gather, organize and distill down a topic like this into a meaningful presentation.  Extremely valuable work.</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Jacobson </strong>- I thoroughly enjoy watching the evolution of not just Daniel&rsquo;s talks, but evolution of his and the Netflix perspective on APIs.  He talks about Netflix evolving beyond REST, and leaves it for you to decide if Netflix is just an edge case or signs what is to come in our every growing device driven, internet of things world.  I think we need to watch what Daniel and Netflix is doing very closely, and learn. </li>
<li><strong>John Sheehan</strong> - Dammit, I was running around during yours. I needed to watch this one--will wait for video.</li>
<li><strong>Albert Wenger</strong> - I&rsquo;m extremely fascinated with the VC perspective of all things API.  Especially one that is focused on the &ldquo;network effect&rdquo; like USV is.  I&rsquo;ve talked with USV and a couple of other groups in the last couple months regarding their portfolios and the overall APIs space, and I will definitely be talking to other firms in the coming months and writing more stories on this topic.  Extremely critical perspective of the space that I don&rsquo;t think is getting enough public discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Gray Brooks</strong> - APIs and the Federal Government is a piece of the API pie I&rsquo;m uber passionate about.  I thoroughly enjoy my regular discussions with the Senior API Strategist and the GSA and his talk delivered the mandate I feel is needed right now, not just for city, county, state and federal government to get on board with APIs, but also that us citizens become accountable for making this work as well!</li>
<li><strong>APIs, Platforms and Ecosystem </strong>- We closed up the conference with a panel made up of Tyler Stalder (<a href="https://twitter.com/tylerstalder">@tylerstalder</a>)&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com/" target="_blank">Singly</a>,&nbsp;Seth Blank (<a href="https://twitter.com/AntiFreeze">@AntiFreeze</a>) of<a title="YourTrove" href="https://www.yourtrove.com/">YourTrove</a>,&nbsp;Asif Rahman (<a href="https://twitter.com/asifrahman">@asifrahman</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="NewsCred" href="http://newscred.com/">Newscred</a>, Orian Marx (<a href="http://alpha.app.net/orian">@orian</a>) of<a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a>,&nbsp;Travis Wallis (<a href="https://twitter.com/traviswallis" target="_blank">@traviswallis</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://peoplebrowsr.com/" target="_blank">PeopleBrowsr</a>.  This panel closed up the event, leaving exactly the right tone with the audience I wanted.  Focusing at the heart of what makes APIs work, the relationship between platform, developers and users and what it takes to make it work in this new API driven world.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list doesn&rsquo;t even begin to sum up what happened at API Strategy &amp; Practice.  I will have to wait for the video to be produced from all keynotes, panels and sessions(which we will make sure and let you know when ready), to fully understand what happened across all four rooms of the amazing event.</p>
<p>Beyond the keynotes, panels and sessions and moving into the networking opportunity that was #APIStrat.  I met so many people that I know online, but have never met in person, my head is still swimming.   Every couple hours I had to walk outside and get some air, so I could keep up with the conversations.  It makes me remember how important these events are to re-enforcing our existing relationships.  Online will never fully replace offline relationships, just augment them in new ways...or maybe offline augments online? &nbsp;Who knows!</p>
<p>Next, I have to throw in a comment about the beer during the drinks reception.  Did you notice the IPA amongst the beer choices?  Nice work <a title="Ping Identity" href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping Identity</a> and the 3Scale team.  It is the little things that make these events successful.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/augusto-marietta-mashape-apistrat.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Ok. I know there was more, but I will be writing stories from now until the next API Strategy &amp; Practice in October or November (more to come), and this post is pretty long as it is.</p>
<p>Anyways, I want to thank all the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">sponsors of API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> for making the conversation possible, and make sure the 3Scale team knows how thankful I am for what they did.  They took all the risk, while putting up with me and my shit, to make exactly the event I envisioned when we started all of this. &nbsp;It wouldn't have been possible without <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to leave you with wise words from <span>Augusto Marietti&nbsp;(</span><a href="https://twitter.com/sinzone">@sinzone)</a><span>&nbsp;the CEO of&nbsp;</span><a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com/">Mashape</a>. &nbsp;I snapped this picture exactly at the moment Augusto said:<strong>&nbsp;DON'T FUCK THIS UP!!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree with Augusto. It is way too important. &nbsp;Let's make sure and keep these conversations going, so we do it right! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Salesforce has a pretty cool <a title="code share" href="http://developer.force.com/codeshare/apex/resultspage?l=mru&amp;title=All%20Projects">Code Share</a>&nbsp;area within the DeveloperForce ecosystem, which allows developers to share code snippets with the rest of the community.</p>
<p>Its a pretty cool way for anyone to share their techniques as code samples in a variety of languages, then letting the community vet the code, fork larger projects, and collaborate to improve the code for the greater good.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that they don't have the internal resources to fully support the process, <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/02/bringing-code-and-community-together.html">Salesforce has halted code samples submission, announcing plans to migrate the Code Sharing program to Github</a>.</p>
<p>Github is already the largest code sharing platform, providing social tools that developers are used to.  Salesforce's publiclackowledgement that they don't have the internal resources to operate, the fact they identify the importance of such a program, and the decision to migrate to Github are all very savvy moves by the <a title="API Pioneer" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">API pioneer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Github%20101">Github is one of the most important platforms you can use to support your API</a>.  Using Github to host all your API code samples and SDKs, whether they are generated internally or by your developers community is becoming more than a novelty, but an essential part of API operations.</p>

The new <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255">HTML Game Development course</a> (CS255), is the online classroom for the programming class, coupled with a series of study groups hosted at Google's San Francisco office and a contest providing developers an incentive to complete the class.</p>

<p>I was checking out the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/02/three-new-aws-reference-architectures-for-e-commerce.html">updates to the AWS Reference Architecture</a>, where they provide blueprints for how you can use AWS. In this version AWS provides an e-commerce architecture reference--providing a system overview, a detailed architectural diagram, and a list of the AWS services used in the architectural approach.</p>
<p>The AWS e-commerce architecture reference provides three separate areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web Frontend </strong>- This is a reference architecture for the web frontend of an e-commerce site. It makes use of Route 53, CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, ElastiCache, DynamoDB and CloudSearch</li>
<li><strong>Checkout Pipeline </strong>- This is a reference architecture for a secure and highly available checkout pipeline service for an e-commerce site. It uses the Virtual Private Cloud, the Simple Workflow Service, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, and the Simple Email Service</li>
<li><strong>Marketing &amp; Recommendations Service</strong> - This is a reference architecture for a marketing and recommendation service for an e-commerce site. It uses Elastic MapReduce, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, DynamoDB, and the Simple Email Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond providing the <a href="http://media.amazonwebservices.com/architecturecenter/AWS_ac_ra_ecommerce_webfrontend_14.pdf">detailed reference card</a>, AWS provides more information on a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/aws-training/architect/">three-day course in AWS Architecture Training</a> that will be held in numerous U.S. cities this spring.</p>
<p>I will add API architecture references as a <a href="/">building block for API owners</a> to consider when planning and managing an API.

<p>The number of requests we've received for sponsoring, speaking and attending has been overhelming. &nbsp;Resulting in a sold out conference, and an amazing lineup of speakers. &nbsp;I was spending some time tidying up the speakers page and sponsor page today, and was so impressed with the companies involved, I had to share.</p>
<p>There are 72 companies represented at API Strategy &amp; Practice:</p>

<p>It's exciting to see the buzz around APIs in 2013, and I look forward to seeing you at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>.</p>

<p>Palo Alto has opened up city data, including <a href="http://paloalto.opendata.junar.com/dashboards/8031/library/" target="_blank">operational data about the Palo Alto City Library</a>.  Using the Palo Alto City open data portal you can access machine-readable data sets about various aspects of library operations including visitor count, checkouts by type of materia, information and circulation services, programs attendance, website visitors count and how library funds are spent.</p>
<p>The Palo Alto open data portal provides widgets with data grids and charts derived from data.  But you can also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/it/open_data/suggest_a_dataset.asp">request data sets</a> and access data via the <a href="http://paloalto.opendata.junar.com/developers/">City of Palo Alto's API</a>.</p>
<p>The city hopes that it will increase community engagement by making data open and machine readable by default. The city is looking to throw hackathons that will develop solutions, and increase public engagement in city government, and ultimately save money and enhance city services.</p>
<p>The City of Palo Alto open data portal is provided by cloud-based <a href="http://www.junar.com/">Junar Open Data Platform</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/openi/openi-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space is picking up momentum in 2013.  I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 BaaS providers, in hopes of better understanding what is being offered in this space.  Today I came across an interesting new, open source BaaS platform, being developed in the European Union called <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank">OPENi</a>.</p>
<p>The project describes itself as:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi is a European Union ICT Framework Programme (FP7) Information and communications technology (ICT) Collaborative project. Over the 30 month project duration we aim to deliver an open-source, cloud based platform for integrating mobile services.</em></blockquote>
<p>With a mission to:</p>
<blockquote><em>Our mission is to inspire innovation in the European mobile applications industry, by radically improving the interoperability of cloud-based services and trust in personal cloud storage through the development of a consumer-centric, open source mobile cloud applications platform.</em></blockquote>
<p>With the following objective:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi&rsquo;s objective is to directly address the lack of interoperability between cloud based services and enable applications to access and use a broad spectrum of existing cloud based functionality and content, consistently across different devices and platforms, in a way that enables a user-centric application experience. Targeting the needs of Application Developers, Services Providers and Consumers, OPENi will realize its vision for user-centric, cloud-connected, mobile applications.</em></blockquote>
<p>OPENi is a 30 month project, we will have to wait and see what comes out of the iniative. With the EU approach to open data and data privacy, I think there is a lot of potential to deploy and consume APIs, as well as delivering API automation, interoperability and backend platforms that have a healthy, consumer-centric approach--which I believe will be good for business, because its good for ender users.</p>
<p>In early 2013 the OPENi team will release software for the BaaS platform as an open-source project on github.com.  When released I will evaluate it side by side with the other BaaS providers I&rdquo;m tracking on.</p>

<p>I'm adding a video channel to my list of <a title="API building blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a>.  I don't think you have to be a Facebook before you have your own channel.  Using Google Hangouts + Youtube is an easy way for any API owner to start their own video channel to support developers.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">Bringing ETL to the Masses with APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Automation.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately thinking about <a title="emerging trends in API usage" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">emerging trends in API usage</a>. One area I&rsquo;m tracking on, is around companies that are offering simple services that provide interoperability and automation between cloud platforms, using APIs.   The best known examples are from companies like <a title="IFTTT" href="http://ifttt.com">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, who provide end users with simple icon based tools for defining  tasks that move data between SaaS platforms.</p>
<p>Its tough to define this space, which in enterprise speak is really just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">Extract Transform Load (ETL)</a>, which is historically a process to migrate information between systems in an enterprise, using data sources and web services.  But with the popularity of web APIs, we need to rethink ETL in the context of the cloud and update how we approach interoperability between the growing number of API driven platforms.</p>
<p>Mike Reich of Seabourne, and I were discussing this last time I was in Washington D.C., and he currently has a great blog post on <a title="rethinking ETL in the API age" href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/">rethinking ETL for the API age</a>.  If you don&rsquo;t know <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a>, they are behind high profile government projects like <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a> and <a title="GovInfo" href="http://govinfo.io/">GovInfo</a>.  They have been doing a lot of thinking about how to acquire, process and publish content with APIs.</p>
<p>To better help <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>&nbsp;better understand the space, I&rsquo;m watching 12 service providers that I&rsquo;m putting in a bucket of what I consider the next generation of ETL providers:</p>

<p>I feel that this new group of ETL providers are focused sufficiently on the new world of API driven platforms, beyond just "data sources" and "web services".  There are more providers like <a href="http://apatar.com/">Apatar</a> and <a href="http://www.jitterbit.com/Solutions/etl-data-integration">Jitterbit</a>, but I feel these providers are more ETL than, than reflecting new breed of API interoperability providers (which I don&rsquo;t have proper name for yet).  One characteristic I&rsquo;m looking for is ease of use.  I think this new breed should be more for end-users, SaaS users and ultimately empowering the masses--not IT, which I feel ETL is designed for.</p>
<p>This new generation of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/interoperability.php">interoperability providers</a> should be about solving the problems average users face when operating online and in the cloud, and not just extracting, transforming and loading--making ETL something anyone can understand and put to use. &nbsp;Further democratizing IT resources, which is a common theme with SaaS, APIs, etc.</p>
<p>I think the new players like Zapier and IFTTT have to be concerned with getting too complex for everyday users, become more ETL, than being about solving end-user problems.  I think we will need very specialized, niche implementations--much like we are seeing with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/baas.php">BaaS</a> and the emergence of specialized versions like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">BaaS for gaming</a>.  Very niche versions of ETL like <a title="SortMyBox" href="http://www.sortmybox.com/">SortMyBox</a> and <a href="http://wappwolf.com/dropboxautomator/">WapWolf Dropbox Automator</a>, which focus only on solving file management problem users are facing, will be successful, because they are easy for users to understand and put to work.</p>
<p>I think there is an opportunity to quickly build the next generation ETL solutions that solve a set of automation, integration and interoperability problems for a niche audience using the simple icon based format we are seeing from providers like IFTT and <a title="Elastic.io" href="http://elastic.io/">Elastic.io</a>.  If you are considering building one of these new solutions, make sure and evaluate existing open source ETL solutions like:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel, by rolling out your own ETL framework if at all possible.  This will allow you to focus on the specific acquire, transform and publish needs of your niche audience.  Even some of the new breed of providers are providing open source tools, like the <a href="https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki">Geekier project</a> from <a href="https://rules.io/">Rules.io</a>, so do your homework. Also consider putting existing API aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> to use, providing faster acquire and publish API connections with popular APIs, while also standardizing the objects across all platforms.</p>
<p>I can envision video, photo, quantified-self and other niche services emerge that will empower any user to put APIs to use and acquire, transform and publish the valuable data, information and other content that are central to our increasingly fragmented online lives.  These new solutions will be framed in easy to understand terms that speak to specific audiences,  putting valuable API resources within reach of the masses.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/07/which-baas-pricing-model-is-better/">Which BaaS Pricing Model Is Better?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/baas-trends.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been processing a <a href="http://branch.com/b/apicalls-successtax">conversation over at Branch</a>, that was triggered by a story in TechCrunch by Sarah Perez(<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa">@sarahintampa</a>) called, &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/stackmob-ratchets-up-the-competition-makes-api-calls-free-launches-a-marketplace-for-third-party-mobile-services/">StackMob Ratchets Up The Competition: Makes API Calls Free, Launches A Marketplace For Third-Party Mobile Services</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are several layers to the convSteersation, the part I&rsquo;m focusing on is about how BaaS providers are structuring their pricing, in which Sarah Perez writes:</p>
<blockquote><em>StackMob is now making API calls free. This latter news will impact the competitive landscape, which includes startups like Parse, Kinvey and others, all of which have traditionally charged developers as API calls increase alongside an app&rsquo;s popularity.</em></blockquote>
<p>Making the argument that:</p>
<blockquote><em>Today, developers have to have an understanding of how many API calls they make, and if an app becomes really successful, developers are penalized for that with increased pricing.</em></blockquote>
<p>Sarah quotes StackMob CEO Ty Amell, saying that:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t really all that fair, explaining that it doesn&rsquo;t matter to StackMob how many API calls the app makes &ndash; the cost to them doesn&rsquo;t really go up. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to us whether someone&rsquo;s making a million API calls or 20 million API calls &ndash; the cost is fairly manageable on our parts. So we felt like this was a blocker to innovation on the developer&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;And we feel like API calls are starting to become a commodity, where it&rsquo;s really how can you provide value beyond that?&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The conversation immediately begins on Twitter, with:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Steve <span>Gershnik</span>(<a href="https://twitter.com/StackMobSteve">@StackMobSteve</a>) of Stackmob</strong> - @stackmob doesn't charge for 'active users' either. No success tax for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Joe Chernov (<a href="https://twitter.com/jchernov">@jchernov</a>) of Kinvey </strong>- but you charge for features. In the end, everyone charges for something. It's business!</blockquote>
<p>After this, the conversation moves to Branch.  I&rsquo;m not including full comments, because there is a lot of banter back and forth, discussing various claims BaaS providers make, that I feel are irrelevant to the more important, pricing story.</p>
<p>The conversation continues:</p>
<blockquote><strong><strong>Joe Chernov (<a href="https://twitter.com/jchernov">@jchernov</a>)&nbsp;of Kinvey</strong>:</strong><br /> If a developer prefers to pay by number of users, our model may work for them; if someone would rather buy features, then StackMob may make more sense. It's all good. Everyone has their own twist on pricing. Vendors should strive to highlight their own value without misrepresenting others'. Fair?  Steve Gershnik (StackMob):<br /> We don't charge per user. We don't charge per API call. We think those are outdated and archaic pricing models.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Miko Matsumura (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a>) of Kii:</strong><br /> I respect what @StackMob is doing but in looking at their pricing page, isn't it just segmenting everyone into a free tier and a "custom" Enterprise tier?</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>)&nbsp;of 3Scale:</strong><br /> Which model is best in our experience depends a lot on what type of market you're serving - individual developers tend to like by the drop because (start cheaply and scale). Large companies tend to like predictability so they can budget properly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Box.net is a storage company - yet, for all their enterprise accounts storage is unlimited. Variable scared their customers. Instead they charge by number of seats/users - something their enterprise customers CAN predict.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Thinking more abstractly: If a developer is successful, there will be some sort of increase in volume. Unless the PAAS service is truly magical that means extra cost for the PAAS provider.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can call this a success tax, but in my view what matters is not if there is more cost to the developer but if the unit cost goes down over time. I.e. As I succeed, I'm happy to pay you a bit more as long as you are not getting an increasing %age of the pie (and ideally if the %age is decreasing). If that %age increases I'll most likely ditch you for someone who offers me better terms at that point.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>QuickBlox(<a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBlox">@QuickBlox</a>): </strong><br /> Our pricing model is per API calls as well, we do it like that because it is clear for developers (and for our business model), also allows to create apps and prototypes that, in case they are not successful, the developers won't be charged. according to @jchernov</blockquote>
<p>Only Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii and Quickblox are represented in the <a href="http://branch.com/b/apicalls-successtax">conversation on Branch</a>.  So I wanted to see how each of the 20 BaaS providers I&rsquo;m tracking on, structure their pricing:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.apiomat.com/" target="_blank">APIOMAT</a> - Beta, can't find</li>

<li><a href="https://go.urbanairship.com/accounts/register/" target="_blank">Urban Airship</a> - Push Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find pricing for five of the BaaS providers, because they are in beta, but pricing by API call is definitely the preferred way for the rest of them, with 11 of the 15 using this approach.  The rest of them charge based upon a mix of number of users, number of apps, data and file storage, push messages, and email messages.  With Stackmob going with pricing based upon feature, add-on or premium services, which can also be from 3rd party services via the <a href="https://marketplace.stackmob.com/">StackMob marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t think there is one approach to API or BaaS pricing.  Seems to me, that different models will work for different industries, companies and even at the application level.  But I wanted to document this conversation for my <a href="/trends/baas.php">larger research project around the BaaS space</a>--maybe I will have more opinions after I dive in deeper.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think about BaaS pricing.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/05/white-house-announces-round-two-of-the-presidential-innovation-fellows/">White House Announces Round Two of the Presidential Innovation Fellows </a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/presidential-innovation-fellows.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program, launched last year, bringing in talented individuals from the private sector, to Washington DC for 6-12 month &ldquo;tours of duty&rdquo; in the Federal Government, to develop innovative solutions to our governments most difficult problems.</p>
<p>Today the United States CTO Todd Park and CIO Steve VanRoekel&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/05/throw-your-hat-ring-round-2-presidential-innovation-fellows-program">announced round two of the Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program</a>.  The first round of PIF projects included MyUSA (formerly known as MyGov), RFP-EZ, Blue Button, Better Than Cash, and Open Data Initiatives started in August 2012 with 18 inaugural Fellows.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure to be <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/10/13/heading-to-washington-dc-to-talk-apis-with-innovation-fellows/">invited in October to spend half a day talking to a group of the fellows</a>, and help make sure they had an awareness of the API space, empowering the group to make the biggest impact possible.  Last week when I was in DC, I also got to speak with a couple of the fellows as they were finishing up their tour of duty, and beginning to think about what is next.</p>
<p>The second round of the Presidential Innovation Fellows will tackle the following initiatives:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Disaster Response &amp; Recovery</strong> - Collaboratively building and &ldquo;pre-positioning" needed tech tools ahead of future emergencies or natural disasters in order to mitigate economic damage and save lives</li>

</ul>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows will also continue work on the <em><strong>Open Data Initiatives</strong></em>, which will accelerate and expand efforts to make government information resources more publicly accessible in &ldquo;computer-readable&rdquo; form and spurring the use of those data by entrepreneurs as fuel for the creation of new products, services, and jobs.  The Open Data Initiatives will continue work on existing projects including health, energy, education, finance and public safety and global development, while also tackling new data innovation efforts including Building Virtual Learning at National Scale, Digital Tools for the Smithsonian and  work on next iteration of Data.gov.</p>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows programs represents an agile new approach to government, mimicking the same partnership it took to build the Internet over the last 30 years, through a partnership between government and the private sector.  This approach is about tackling big problems, using open software and open data approaches to a government that is not just open, but machine readable by default.</p>
<p>Its great to see the White House not miss a beat, with kicking off the second round of PIF.  Iniatives within the program are addressing some of the most important areas of our society and economy like education and healthcare, while also paying attention to innovative areas like physical hardware systems, new approaches to financial systems and applying technology intelligently through disaster response and recovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to evaluate more of what was accomplished in round one, and closely track who is accepted into the program for round two.  I think the program has the potential to help fix some serious illnesses with open, transparency and lack of machine readable data from government agencies.  My only addition to the program would be another tier of volunteers called Presidential Innovation Corps, where talented individuals who did not make it as fellows could still be put to use for other smaller initiatives and crowdsourcing opportunities--this group represents a lot of excitement, passion and talent, and with the pool growing in round two it represents a large group of eager citizens not being put to use.</p>
<p>If you believe in APIs, and believe they can transform how our government operates, I encourage you to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/InnovationFellows">apply for the Presidential Innovation Fellows program</a>, and potentially participate in some serious change for our country.</p>

<p>There is an interesting <a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/02/01/instadm-brings-private-messaging-to-instagram/" target="_blank">post on the Parse blog</a> about <a href="http://insta.dm/" target="_blank">instaDM</a>, which is a service built using Parse, the <a href="/trends/baas.php" target="_blank">BaaS platform</a>, that provides private messaging in the Instagram ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting approach to externally developing features for another platform or service.  I think Parse says it well:</p>
<blockquote><em>Even the hottest new apps, however, aren&rsquo;t perfect and that&rsquo;s where clever innovators can fill in the gaps with a great idea. Parse-powered instaDM is one such innovation.</em></blockquote>
<p>On one hand, this approach is a gamble.  All Instagram has to do is copy what you've done, put it in the roadmap, and your done. &nbsp;Finished.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think this is a very realistic way of pushing a platform forward, by external developers, using APIs.  If an API provider is smart, when you have someone in your ecosystem roll out a valuable feature like this, you invest in their success.</p>
<p>Building features that augment web or mobile apps like this demonstrate that API ecosystems offer a lot potential for innovation, and I have to say it is even more interesting that this is being built on Parse--probably a whole other story in itself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think every idea that comes out of Silicon Valley should be VC size. APIs allow more lots of smaller, more sustainable features to emerge, that don't need large scale investment. instaDM is an example of this potential.</p>

<p>Salesforce talked a little bit about its <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/02/new-eclipse-plugin-available-february-15th.html">strategy around the development and release strategy around the Salesforce Eclipse plug-in</a>. &nbsp;Providing a little transparency into how they stagger its API releases as well as waiting to release their <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> plug-in, until API release is complete.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more interested in this story from an <a href="/buildingblocks/">API building block</a> perspective.  An eclipse plug-in seems like a building block for only the most mature APIs out there, and especially ones targeting the enterprise.  An eclipse plug-in is not for every API, but I think I will add it as a building block to consider.</p>
<p>It also seems like something a 3rd party provider could step up and find success with as well, by building a single or suite of Eclipse plug-ins that provide integrated API developer tools across popular or high value web APIs for Eclipse users.</p>
<p>I believe IDE plug-ins for APIs will be one way we can provide API discovery solutions for developers, by bringing valuable, qualified API resources into their development environments.</p>

<p><a href="http://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/01/new-simplified-adwords-api-pricing.html" target="_blank">Google is adjusting their pricing model for the Adwords API</a>, acknowledging that having a free usage tier is important. &nbsp;Making the API easier to access, while also ensuring a certain QOS.</p>
<p>Google has opted to go with two levels of API access:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Basic</strong> - Basic access is provided by default and allows up to 10,000 operations per day</li>
<li><strong>Standard</strong> - Standard access is available to qualified developers and has no daily limit on operations</li>
</ul>
<p>With both basic or standard access, there are no charges for <a href="https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/" target="_blank">AdWords API</a> usage.  Google is just looking to maintain quality over which developers can hammer on the API, while acknowledging a free tier allows for experimentation and innovation. &nbsp;All you have to do is apply to be part of the standard level, if you reach limits of basic tier.</p>
<p>This is a good model for even a totally open data of free resource APIs.  While you want your data and resources to be open, you also want to be able to offer a certain quality of service, and keep infrastructure costs to a minimum.</p>
<p>To do this, you will need to to secure the API interface to some degree.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/platform-stability.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>I did a <a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">presentation at the DC API Meetup</a>, when I was in Washington DC last week. My talk was some of my usual material around the history, business and politics of APIs, but included a section on trends, where I covered some of the newer aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, BaaS providers like <a href="http://parse.com">Parse</a> and automation tools like <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the meetup, we did a QA panel session, and Javaun Moradi (<a href="https://twitter.com/javaun">@javau</a>n), product manager at NPR digital, made a great point about the reliability and stability of this new generation of third party platforms building aggregate, backend, automation or other types of providers who are in turn, dependent on other API providers.</p>
<p>Javaun questioned the reliability of this new generation of startups, who are newly funded, most likely not yet profitable, dependent on other APIs, and are most likely going to be acquired later on down the road, or go out of business when funding runs out.  Javaun felt that established players like Salesforce and Google are here to stay, you know they aren&rsquo;t going anywhere--where a new startup has greater potential for service disruption and instability.</p>
<p>If you are building your app, and depending on an aggregate API service like Singly, or backend as a service (BaaS) platform like <a href="http://cloudmine.me">Cloudmine</a> or reliant on a automation platform like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, you want to know the company is going to be around in a year.  Right?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the number one way these new breed of startups can alleviate these concerns, is by solving developer problems, delivering value (which every company I&rsquo;ve mentioned is doing) and have a clear business model. Success is the best solution, right?</p>
<p>Another way these startups can instill confidence in the developers who are building apps around around their services is to also offer open source options.  By offering API aggregation, backend and automation as a cloud service, while also as open source download and fork, this new breed of providers can do a lot to build confidence and goodwill with potential users.</p>
<p>Some good examples of this are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a></strong> - Singly AppFabric empowers you to add social login, sharing and friend finding into your mobile and web applications, and <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">Singly Hallway</a> is the open source version to help developers build amazing applications combining data from many sources easily, through one API.</li>
<li><strong><a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">OpenKit</a></strong> - Open source, cross-platform backend services for game developers.  It will be available as client and server download on Github, and no mention if it will be a cloud service</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://rules.io/">Rules.io</a></strong> - Rules.io is a rules and segmentation engine with companion <a href="https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki">Geekier</a> which is part of the rules.io service as an open source framework</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just just a couple examples of how startups are emerging to provide a new approach to rapidly and efficiently building web and mobile apps across many APIs.  These platforms are all about delivering the resources developers need to efficiently build and manage web and mobile apps, without the overhead of rolling out the infrastructure on their own.  With an open option, if for any reason the startup should change or go away, app developers have the option to put the open codebase to use.</p>
<p>This approach will not be for all startups, but with the neck breaking pace in which startups are born, evolve and die, and open by default approached bundled with a healthy as a service option, looks like a positive approach for platform providers, developers, end users and the overall business sector.</p>
<p>As more providers emerge in this space, I hope they choose to adopt an open by default approach.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>For the longest time I would get asked, "Which API service provider should I use to deploy my APIs?".  This was a tough question, because historically the API management providers don't help you deploy your APIs, they only help you manage them.</p>
<p>Deploying your APIs was up to you.  Generally you already had some sort of internal system that you would use to generate RESTful interfaces or you'd go find your own open source API framework and deploy.  Then you'd proxy or connect your API to one of the API service providers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>These lines are now blurred by providers like <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/">Intel with their enterprise API gateway</a>, and through API deployment resources from <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>.  3Scale is investing in open source server technology for <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGINX</a>, and blueprints for API deployment using Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>3Scale recently published a quickstart tutorial on <a title="how to deploy an API on Amazon EC2 for Amazon Web Services" href="http://www.3scale.net/2013/02/quickstart-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-an-api-on-amazon-ec2-for-amazon-web-services-aws-rookies/">how to deploy an API on Amazon EC2 for Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS), and manage it using 3Scale API management.  My favorite part is that everything in this tutorial is completely FREE.  A critical element to experimenting with APIs.</p>
<p>The 3Scale, AWS walk-though provides details for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Creating and configuring EC2 Instance</li>
<li>Preparing Instance for Deployment</li>
<li>Deploying a demo API solution</li>
<li>Enabling API Management with 3Scale</li>
<li>Implementing an Nginx Proxy for Access Control</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several important things going on here, beyond being able to do this for free with an entry level AWS and 3Scale accounts.  But I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, the value of this being free and allowing you to explore, experiment and iterate with your API--without spending a fortune!  This is critical to not just your API initiative, but contributes to a more healthy API space in general.</p>
<p>After being free, you are using proven open source technology like Ubuntu for server OS and NGINX for your web server.  <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/15/3scale-launches-open-source-api-proxy-build-on-ngnix/">3Scale has invested in tools for NGINX</a>, rather than building their own proprietary solutions, because NGINX has been proven to deliver at scale and has large community to support it.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/nginx/nginx-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Third, with this solution, you retain control over your infrastructure.  You are deploying on the proven Amazon cloud (which I hope you are already using in other areas), and you are connecting to free API management services with the opportunity to buy premium services.  You are not proxying all your data and valuable API resources through a 3rd party proxy.  You are connecting to the API management services you need like rate limits, access controls and analytics without giving up control over your data and resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do the <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2013/02/quickstart-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-an-api-on-amazon-ec2-for-amazon-web-services-aws-rookies/">3Scale API deployment tutorial</a>&nbsp;myself, so that I know the process inside and out, have my own AMIs ready to deploy on AWS, and be able to walk others through, when possible.</p>

<p>The library's collection has a total of more than 7,000 hours of sounds, the result of an 80-year collaboration between the scientific community and the library's volunteer collaborators.  An amazing resource!</p>
<p>I couldn't help myself, and emailed them, to let them know a web API of the audio and video collection would be a great addition.  If developers could build web and mobile apps around the sounds, it would extend the reach of the catalog exponentially.</p>
<p>Of course you'd do it in a way that adds value to the collection and <a title="protect it as a brand" href="/2013/01/29/protecting-your-brand-with-api-branding-guidelines/">protects it as a brand</a> and priceless asset.</p>
<p>The digitizing of the <a href="http://macaulaylibrary.org/" target="_blank">Macaulay Library</a>, making it available online is a great example of the potential of open content, data and APIs.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/02/one-api-discovery-definition-to-rule-them-all/">One API Discovery Definition to Rule Them All</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/discovery/discovery-exploration.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I talk about API discovery, in-person at events, or on my blog(s), I notice people automatically default to thinking I mean a universal API discovery language that will work for all web APIs.  I think the technologists that operate in the API space are always striving for technical perfection--resulting in the discussions that you see around REST, HATEOAS, OAuth and similarly for this one about API discovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the passion and dedication of the technologists in this space, but when it comes to API discovery, I&rsquo;m <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> talking about a universal language or approach.  I personally just don&rsquo;t believe there can be one definition to rule them all.  When I reference API discovery, I&rsquo;m focusing on API discovery at the provider level, and providing information and resources that allow people who launch APIs to be successful.  I have no interest in defining or support a world-wide or industry level definition for API discovery.  I leave these conversations to all y'all tech pundits.</p>
<p>I am a fan of supporting API providers to do something, anything! Sure, it should be a standardized as you feel necessary.  I hope you use something that is already in existence like <a title="WADL" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">WADL</a>, <a title="Swagger" href="http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">I/O Docs</a> (don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel), and make sure and look at the <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">approach Google is taking with their API discovery service</a>--as they have some experience in the field.</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In reality though, your motivation to develop JSON or XML definitions for your API will probably be to provide interactive documentation or allow for easy generation of code libraries for your API--not discovery.  With the API discovery conversation automatically defaulting to a universal definition by the tech pundits, API providers will often avoid these discussions, leaving it a lower priority when planning and implementing an API.  Much like with HATEOAS, without concrete examples of value, API providers won&rsquo;t see value in providing JSON or XML definitions of their APIs.  Interactive docs and auto generation of code libraries are clear value propositions, and show potential for bringing discovery back to the forefront.</p>
<p>Once you have API definitions for all of your API endpoints, its pretty easy to publish a single manifest of all of your APIs in a single JSON (or XML) file in the root of your developer area.  Sure I would love all of these definitions to be the same, but I prefer a more pragmatic approach and will accept whatever a API service provider deems suitable for their APIs, and with the resources they have available.</p>
<p>If you think about how web page discovery came together in late 1990s with Yahoo, then solutions provided by Google, and even new approaches from providers like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>.  When it comes to API search and discovery, we are in circa 1997, if we compare it with web page discovery.  You have directories like ProgrammableWeb, but you also have newer vendors emerging like <a href="http://apihub.com">APIhub</a>, who potentially bring a new perspective to the table.</p>
<p>Since APIs are about &ldquo;programmatic discovery&rdquo;, I think how developers discover API will vary, occuring via these directories and hubs, but also occur via their chosen PaaS platform like Drupal, Heroku, Salesforce or with BaaS providers like Parse or Kinvey--as well as popular IDEs like Eclipse who allow for plugins.</p>
<p><a href="http://apihub.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mulesoft/API-Hub-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It will up to PaaS, BaaS or other 3rd party platform providers to assemble resource stacks that are meaningful to their community.  They will do the legwork to find best of breed API resources, which will be made easier if API providers provider JSON or XML definitions of their API resources, but not a requirement.</p>
<p>I believe that similar to website sitemaps, API discovery will have wider definitions that some follow, with successful vendor specific implementations as well, but ultimately it will remain largely imperfect and some API providers will do well, and others will implement poorly. &nbsp;The markets will decide! (<em>cringe</em>)</p>
<p>My object is to help the average API provider hear stories of other successful approaches, and identify the benefits, in hopes that they will implement something, anything! &nbsp;Allowing us to take baby steps forward in API discovery, not defining one definition to rule them all and nobody giving a shit, and we don't move forward at all.</p>

<p>Master API architect at <a title="Layer7 Technologies" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7 Technologies</a> Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund" target="_blank">@mamund</a>) has a great post this week on <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/blogs/index.php/four-tech-related-trends-that-will-shape-2013/" target="_blank">Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013</a>.</p>
<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that <em>"individual service deployments on the Web will get smaller and more numerous"</em>--he clarifies it with:</p>
<blockquote><em>Influenced by the existence of the many mobile apps running on a single device, Web-based services will become small, single-focused offerings that (in the words of Doug Mcllroy) &ldquo;do one thing and do it well.&rdquo; This will also explode the number of available services. The advantage of this trend will be an increase in the agility and evolvability of service offerings. The challenge will be an increased need for governance at the &ldquo;micro-service&rdquo; level.</em></blockquote>
<p>I have to agree.  I think the smaller we can break resources down, the better.  Agility is key in the API economy.  But as Mike points out it won't come without its new set of problems, like life cycle, governance and discovery.</p>
<p>Much like web pages, I think we'll still try to estimate the number APIs available, but there will be so many, we will lose track in the near future.  But we'll find an organic approach to designing, deploying, managing, discovering and consuming web APIs that strikes a balance.</p>

<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that "server mash-ups will increase but client mash-ups will decline"--he clarifies it with:</p>
<blockquote><em>The increasing popularity of languages like Node.js, Erlang and Closure will make implementing server-side mash-ups more efficient and easier to maintain than doing the same work within a client application; especially for the mobile platform. This will reduce the &ldquo;chattiness&rdquo; of client-side applications and increase the security and flexibility of server-side implementations. The result will be a perceived increase in responsiveness and a reduced use of battery power on mobile apps.</em></blockquote>
<p>As with my earlier post, <a title="individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous" href="/2013/02/02/the-scientific-archive-of-biodiversity-audio-and-video-recordings-needs-an-api/">individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous</a>, I agree 100%.  This is where I&rsquo;m going with my post this week on <a title="Virtual API Stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>.  With so many individual resources available on the web, in the coming years we&rsquo;ll see increased &ldquo;mashing up&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo; of new stacks, that are meaningful to a particular app or group of developers.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild is&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, with their API aggregation or mashup, which is available as a service, but is also <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">available as open source on Github as Hallway</a>.  Another recent example is potentially the <a title="OpenKit Gaming BaaS" href="/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">OpenKit Gaming BaaS</a>, which promised to be an open stack designed for game developers.</p>
<p>My predication is we&rsquo;ll see many more returns from server side API mashups, than we did during the client side mashup gold rush days! &nbsp;Especially if providers open source these stacks, while also offering as a service.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://trafficandweather.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/traffic-and-weather/Traffic-and-Weather.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently added the <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather podcast</a> to the right hand menu for everyone to enjoy. What John Sheehan (<a href="http://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a><span>&nbsp;)</span> and Steve Marx (<a href="http://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>) are doing on the podcast is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SO</strong></span> needed in the API space, I highly recommend subscribing to the podcast in your itunes and listening regularly.</p>
<p>I was honored to be critiqued in the podcast this week, where they &ldquo;gently&rdquo; disagreed with my post from earlier this week on my <a title="virtualized API stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">speculation around virtual API stacks</a>.  So I wanted to &ldquo;gently&rdquo; respond and help clarify.</p>
<p>The first 60 seconds, pretty much sum up rebuttal, where they make my argument for me by saying <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTT</a> and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> are already doing this? Which is the whole basis for my story except I use <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a href="http://temboo.com">Temboo</a> as examples.  All of these providers are in the same space in my opinion, I think maybe they are just referencing what they are familiar with (as John used to work at IFTTT).</p>
<p>Second they read in that I&rsquo;m envisioning some grand discovery language?  Not sure where this comes from.  I&rsquo;m just referencing that API providers can provide JSON definitions of their APIs, which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> happening with specs like Swagger, but not being done for discovery but for interactive documentation and code stub generation--the fact it is there is a plus for discovery.  But I have zero visions of there every being a grand &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for discovery, but I feel you can't argue Swagger is picking up momentum.</p>
<p>John and Steve also reference that I&rsquo;m calling for a &ldquo;standardized building blocks API providers can jump on?&rdquo;  Not sure where this comes from.  My arguement is that API will play almost no role in this process at all.  They won&rsquo;t give a shit or prepare in any way.  It will be 3rd party providers stepping up and building these abstracted platforms around existing API providers.  Something we are already seeing with Temboo, Singly and yes IFTTT and Zapier as well as BaaS providers like Kinvey, Parse, etc.</p>
<p>Then at the part they start talking about "API providers do not want to be commoditized", they lose me and deviate from anything I&rsquo;m talking about.  I agree that API providers don&rsquo;t want to be reduced to commodities.  This is just one possible path, and would not be for every API provider or reduce their existing retail relationship with developers.  We see it already happening with <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/07/25/sendgrid-partners-heroku-engine-yard-cloudbees/">SendGrid partners with Heroku, Engine Yard, &amp; others on email management</a>, and <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2012/twilio-partners-windows-azure/">Twilio partners with Azure</a>.</p>
<p>So SendGrid won't be commoditized on Heroku? &nbsp;Twilio won't be commoditzed on Azure?</p>
<p>Google your favorite API by name and add partners with, you will see API providers do care about partnering and reselling themselves, which brings you very close to the commodities line when you resell at that level. &nbsp;What I'm suggesting could just be interpreted as reverse partnering, where a 3rd party platform integrates the API, rather than API seeking partnership--which we see with Singly, IFTT and Zapier, they don't ask for permission from every API provider.</p>
<p>While I listened further, the rest of the conversation had nothing to do with my post.  I blame my storytelling, as I&rsquo;m always trying to perfect how i articulate my visions and obviously I didn&rsquo;t clearly get my point across.  Since it was my first exploratory post on this subject, I will keep trying, and trying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have to call them out a bit, cause I heard standard over and over in the podcast, about building blocks, API interfaces and API definitions.  But if you look at my post I never even used the word standard or standardizing or anything.  So I think you guys read something that wasn&rsquo;t there, cause I am the last API guy who believes in standardizing in the web API space.</p>
<p>With that said, I fuck&rsquo;n love that you guys are doing this!  Makes me happy! &nbsp;Thanks John and Steve!</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/world-bank/The-World-Bank-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of being on stage with <span>Tim Herzog (</span><a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/tgherzog" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>tgherzog</a><span>)</span>, a Open Data Specialist from the <a title="World Bank" href="http://worldbank.com">World Bank</a> yesterday at the <a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">DC API meetup  at NPR</a>.  During the QA panel, at the end of the meetup, a question came from the audience, stating that open data from government is often boring, and thus is the reason much of what we see built on government isn't that exciting--alluding that there has to be more high value, exciting data that isn't being released.</p>
<p>While I agree that much of the data made available from open government initiatives is boring and stale, and there are probably much better datasets available, I also think this is more of a storytelling problem, than a data problem.  After the question was asked, I quickly answered by pointing to my left at Tim Herzog, and said the World Bank does an awesome job at this.</p>
<p>If you look through the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank data catalog</a>, and spend time looking through their blog, you see a symbiotic relationship between their open data, APIs and the stories they tell on the blog.  This approach is similar to what I'm calling <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>, the only difference is I am hosting all my stories on Github as individual repositories.</p>
<p>If you look at the home page of the World Bank data site today, there is a link to the blog post, "<a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-data-tell-us-about-debt-of-high-income-and-developing-countries">What does data tell us about debt of high income and developing countries?</a>"  This is a great example of not just providing a dataset, but actually telling the story around the data, while providing tools that let you interact with the data, making everything a very hands on experience--increasing the chances users will make an emotional connection with the data.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-data-tell-us-about-debt-of-high-income-and-developing-countries" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/world-bank/World-Bank-Exernal-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>According to the blog post, the World Bank maintains two quarterly databases of information on external and public sector debt of many countries. The blog post narrates what the statistical data from the <a href="http://worldbank.org/qeds">Quarterly External Debt Statistics</a> (QEDS) and the <a href="http://worldbank.org/qpsd">Public Sector Debt Statistics</a> (PSD) databases tell us about trends in debt levels of some high income and developing countries, while also providing us with links to the data sets and JavaScript charts (using <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com">Tableau Software</a>) we can play with, making the story an interactive, hands-on experience.</p>
<p>This is <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>.  It isn't just data.  It isn't just an API.  There is a story, giving the data context and meaning.  There are tools to help me play with the data, understand its value, with a link to the raw data for when I'm ready to get down to business.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that Hacker Storytelling is the solution to the boring data coming out of government, non-profit organizations and even in the private sector.  Hacker Storytelling is related to data journalism, but goes further, empowering anyone to publish a dataset and tell the story around it.  Not just journalists or programmers.</p>
<p>We need more open source tools that allow anyone to gather, curate and publish data, while also being able to wrap it in a story and bundle with interactive visualizations and tools that encourage exploration, remixing and sharing of these important stories that have the potential to solve real problems we face every day around the globe.</p>

        <p><a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/openkit/open-kit-logo-larger.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">A new player in the </a><a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space has emerged, from former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFeint">OpenFeint</a> co-founder Peter Relan--called <a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">OpenKit</a>. &nbsp;The new BaaS platform is targeting game developers, providing cross-platform tools for both iOS and Android. &nbsp;The core features of the gaming BaaS platform are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Cloud data sync</strong> - Save game progress in the cloud with data storage. Sync it across both iOS and Android devices for a consistent gaming experience</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards</strong> - Drop-in leaderboard SDK's for both iOS and Android. Give your users the opportunity to compete against millions of other players</li>
<li><strong>Facebook &amp; Twitter auth </strong>- Users login with familiar third party social networks like Facebook and Twitter. No need to create and manage accounts. OpenKit handles it all</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform support </strong>- OpenKit supports both iOS and Android. Our native SDKs are lightweight and will take just a few minutes to integrate into your game</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenKit represents a trend I&rsquo;m tracking on where people are pulling together specialized or <a title="virtualized stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtualized stacks</a> targeting specific groups of developers.  Early movers in the space like Kinvey, Parse and Cloudmine have generally catered to all types of developers by providing them a backend stack, that assists them in rapidly building mobile and web apps. So naturally the next step is to see more specialized stacks, for smaller groups of developers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to see that OpenKit is completely <a href="https://github.com/openkit">open source, readily available on Github</a>, as well as comes out of the box with a REST API.  <a title="open source baas" href="/2012/08/28/open-source-mobile-backend-as-a-service/">Open source BaaS is something I was identifying was missing from the space</a>.</p>
<p>I will add OpenKit to my <a title="baas trends" href="/trends/baas.php">trends section for Backend as a Service</a>, where I&rsquo;m tracking on the BaaS space, and will dive in deeper and compare it with some of the other offerings we are seeing emerge.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/dcapi-january/dcapi-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I came to Washington DC this week for meetings with a couple federal agencies and a handful of private companies who contract with our government--including a conversation last night at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/events/97891662/">DC API Meetup Group</a>, which met at NPR offices downtown.</p>
<p>The API Meetup started with pizza, a healthy selection of beer and networking with around 50 API professionals and API curious from around the DC area.  I was able to meet about 15 folks I know online, but have never had the opportunity to connect with in real life.</p>
<p>Ben Balter (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/BenBalter" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>BenBalter</a>), one of the Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) kicked off the conversation with a presentation of some of the cool API discovery, CSV to API, DB to API and various tool he's developed during his time as a innovation fellow.  I totally dig Ben's style, in making very small, but powerful open source tools that can make a real difference in how government opens up data via APIs.</p>
<p>I was up next, giving a talk titled, "<a href="/talks/apidays/business-models/">From Web, to Programmable Web, to Programmable World</a>".  I wanted to give everyone a healthy dose on the history of APIs, some views on where we are currently, and where API are going with an introduction to concepts like aggregation and automation.  The talk is meant to be a 200K foot walkthrough of the API space, which also reflects all of the sections available on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">APIEvangelist.com</a>.</p>
<p>Next up was Gray Brooks from the General Services Administration (GSA) who walked through some of the open data and API initiatives coming out of the federal government.  He is overseeing some very important aspects of the <a title="White House Digital Strategy" href="/federal_government.php">White House Digital Strategy</a>, and is the point person for the execution of the digital strategy across all federal agencies.</p>
<p>After Gray talked, Tim Herzog (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/tgherzog" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>tgherzog</a>) the Open Data Specialist at the World Bank walked us through what the <a title="World Bank" href="http://www.worldbank.com">World Bank</a> is doing with their open data initiatives, which APIs are at the core.  He discussed how they couldn't have delivered their open data platform in the time and budget, without making it driven by APIs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/dcapi-january/dcapi-7.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>Last up was Javaun Moradi (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/javaun" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>javaun</a>)&nbsp;of NPR, who walked us through some of the lessons learned from deploying and managing the NPR APIs.  His talk was full of nuggets of wisdom, including "Don't build an API unless it solves a user problem" and "We drink our own champagne, because we don't make dog food!".  I'm hoping to spend more time this spring, doing a deeper dive into the NPR approach and share those insights in blog posts and ultimately a white paper.</p>
<p>We wrapped up with the presentations, grabbed another beer, ate some more pizza and networked a bit--then came back for a QA panel with everyone who presented, moderated by Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>) of O'Reilly Media.  Alex did an awesome job at making the panel a conversation with everyone in attendance, encouraging open questions from the audience on APIs.  Alex is extremely knowledgable on not just open data and APIs, but how Washington DC operates, there is no better person to moderate a panel in DC.</p>
<p>The DC API Meetup Group is something I will be coming back regularly to attend and hopefully have the opportunity to present again.  They are looking for speakers and sponsors for future events, so if you have anything you'd like to share or make sure your company supports these valuable API conversations, you can contact Patrick Svenburg (<a href="https://twitter.com/svenburg">@svenburg</a>), Head of Business Development &amp; Partnering at <a title="APIphany" href="http://apiphany.com">Apiphany</a> and organizer of the DC API Meetup Group.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/01/29/protecting-your-brand-with-api-branding-guidelines/">Protecting Your Brand With API Branding Guidelines</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.active.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Active-Network/power-by--drk.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the top five concerns I hear from companies considering APIs is regarding losing control of their brand.  With APIs being about access to raw data and resources, companies immediately think that developers will extract the value, without any attribution or reference to the companies brand.</p>
<p>Even with this being a major concern, I see many APIs implement very poor branding guidelines, giving developers zero direction regarding how to properly provide attribution. &nbsp;This is a missed opportunity to not just protect the API providers brand, but actually extend it and increase its value.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I'm always on the lookout for good examples of API branding guidelines. &nbsp;One recent example I came across while monitoring my <a title="API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>, is from the <a title="Active Network" href="http://developer.active.com/">Active Network</a> which provides activity and outdoor content via their APIs.</p>
<p>Active Network starts with a great explanation of why they provide <a title="branding guidelines" href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines">branding guidelines</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>At ACTIVE Network, we want you to be able to create fantastic applications with the ACTIVE Network APIs. At the same time, we don't want users to get confused about who is responsible for the data they are accessing, so we have some brand guidelines.</em></p>
<p>Next Active Network explains to developers why branding guidelines are important to their own users:</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Active-Network/Active-Branding-Guidelines.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The ACTIVE brand holds credibility in the mind of the customer.  It serves as a seal of approval giving customers the confidence to transact through a trusted source</li>
<li>As a consumer utility, ACTIVE.com&reg; captures and records registration activity providing people with a record of their personal registration history if they need it at a future date</li>
<li>Transacting for an ACTIVE powered activity, tells your customer who they need to call if they need help.  ACTIVE&rsquo;s standard of excellence provides customers with 24/7 support 365 days a year</li>
</ul>
<p>Active Network also provides details on how to properly use their companies name (which I followed in my story), what attribution is required, and a complete branding kit for download as a zip file--containing the following key assets:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Branding Guidelines in PDF Format</li>
<li>Icon Image</li>
<li>Powered by Logos</li>
<li>Register Now Buttons</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a title="Active Network Branding Guidelines" href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines">Active Network Branding Guidelines</a> is one of the better implementations I've come across.  It provides a nice overview, with all of the details and assets needed to execute properly.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't concerned about your brand when it comes to your API, requiring some attribution from your developers will at least help you market and advertise your API, and potentially bring in new API consumers.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/01/28/announcing-the-app-net-file-api/" target="_blank">App.net has just released a File API</a> to add to their messaging and communication stack, allowing any App.net account to natively store files via the social platform.</p>
<p>Each App.net account will be given a 10GB file storage area, allowing applications to read and write files, that can be linked and embedded within App.net communications.</p>
<p>This approach reminds me of what I&rsquo;m seeing within the <a title="backend as a service" href="/trends/baas.php">backend as a service (BaaS)</a> space with other common developer resources like user management, object storage and key-value stores.</p>
<p>App.net is just making sure developers have the resources they will need to be successful building web and mobile apps with the App.net API--a similar motivation for BaaS providers as wel as other API providers.</p>
<p>While many developers are fine with using multiple API providers to get what they need, I can see an opportunity to provide the essential resources developers will need within the primary API that they are building their app around.</p>
<p>As essential API resources are further commoditized, it seems like an opportunity for private label BaaS resources to emerge.  File storage could become something that any API provider could offer alongside their own resources, without having to reinvent the wheel each time.</p>
<p>Maybe such services already exist under other names, and I'm unaware of it, but it seems like a great opportunity for cloud providers to step up and offer private label, backend resources for API providers to integrate into their platforms.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Virtualized-API-Stacks.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Up until now we tend to think of APIs individually--we approach integration in terms of the Twilio API, Twitter API or the Facebook API.  But as the number of <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">public APIs has grown beyond 8K</a>, and an <a title="unknown amount of internal and partner APIs" href="/2013/01/24/estimating-the-number-of-non-public-apis/">unknown amount of internal and partner APIs</a> become available, we are seeing new patterns of <a title="aggregation" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregation</a> and <a title="interoperability" href="/trends/interoperability.php">interoperability</a> emerge from companies like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, but also seeing <a title="automation" href="/trends/automation.php">automation</a> be added into the mix by companies like <a title="Temboo" href="http://temboo.com">Temboo</a>, and entire backend stacks from providers like Parse.</p>
<p>These new aggregated or backend stacks of API driven resources can be as general as object and key-value stores, user management and other developer commodities we see <a title="backend as a service" href="/trends/baas.php">backend as a service providers</a> (BaaS) bring to the table, or they can be very personal like the photos Singly is aggregating across Flickr, Facebook and Instagram and with friends and followers across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>As I see these new aggregate and BaaS providers emerge, at an ever increasing pace, I can&rsquo;t help but think--this still isn&rsquo;t fast enough (its my nature, you should try being me).  If I want common mobile developer resources I can adopt one of these new BaaS platforms like <a href="http://kinvey.com">Kinvey</a> or <a title="Parse" href="http://parse.com">Parse</a>, or if I need personal and social resources, which have <a title="fabric of mobile and web apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/11/13/the-api-fabric-for-next-generation-of-apps/">become part of the fabric of web and mobile apps</a>, I can go to Singly.  But what if I want a more specialized network, say just for <a title="education" href="http://hackeducation.com">education</a>?  I might need user management, object storage, key-value storage, access to commons social tools like friends and photos across multiple social networks, but I also need access to open courseware, teacher and student directories all via a very secure, auditable, efficient stack tailored just for K-12?  I will have to wait, for the next wave of startups to emerge.</p>
<p>While in NYC on Friday I had a great discussion with Temboo about virtualization.  Not just the virtualization we&rsquo;ve come to depend on with cloud computing--which is the virtualization of compute, storage, and database resources, but the <a title="virtualization of network resources" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_virtualization">virtualization of network resources</a> and <a title="software defined networking" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking">software defined networking</a>.  Companies like <a href="http://nicira.com/">Nicira</a>, <a href="http://www.pluribusnetworks.com/">Pluribus Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.anutanetworks.com/">Anuta Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.aristanetworks.com/en/solutions/network-virtualization">Arista</a>, <a href="http://www.vyatta.com/solutions/virtual">and Vyatta</a> are emerging with new products that are allowing the virtualization of networking resource into new and meaningful network stacks for any possible implementation that you can imagine.</p>
<p>After these conversation with the Temboo team, over the weekend I continued to think about the potential of virtualized API stacks.  Why can&rsquo;t I assemble my own API stack?  Why do I have to go to each API individually, or wait for new Singlys' to emerge in other verticals?  Why can&rsquo;t I assemble Parse, Singly, Twilio, Schoology, SendGrid into a virtualized API stack that provides not just ease of use, but the security I need to deploy a backend tailored just for K-12 education?</p>
<p>In this vision of the future, API providers could focus on what they do best, and not worry about every use case out there.  Providers like Singly, Temboo, Parse can build abstracted layers on top of this. With this abstraction I wouldn&rsquo;t be limited to just the friends and followers features on Twitter or Facebook, I could take advantage of the next generation of friend discovery tools like what Singly is delivering--in addition to the value of individual API providers.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/interoperability-trends.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>With a virtualized approach, I could build the stack that is most meaningful for my internal, partner or public developers and if one piece of my stack is proving unreliable, I can replace it with another.  APIs resources would be further commoditized, required to provide JSON definitions of their interfaces (or die a quick death), which virtual API stack platforms could use to discover and offer API resources.  <a title="API Ranking" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API ranking</a> algorithms would emerge allowing anyone to make sure they were discovering, selecting and using the best of breed API resources in the areas that matter for any vertical.</p>
<p>With a virtualized API stack I could launch any specialized set of resources that I desired from the best of breed providers out there.  I could blend private and public resources together and in return offer them for use in private or public environments, further blurring the lines of what is an API and how they are consumed.</p>
<p>As we see APIs continue to become a driving force in government, healthcare and education and bridge the online and physical worlds via our <a title="automobiles" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/automobiles.php">automobiles</a>, homes, <a title="buildings" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/buildings.php">buildings</a> and further grow within healthcare via the <a title="quanitfied self" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/quantified-self.php">quantified self</a>, potentially <a title="disrupt manufacturing with 3D printing" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/3d-printing.php">disrupt manufacturing with 3D printing</a> and drive everything around us with the <a title="internet of things" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/internet-of-things.php">internet of things</a>--the manual assembling of individual or even aggregated API stacks won&rsquo;t be enough.  We will need the ability to virtualize APIs stacks for any purpose within hours, not months or years.</p>

<p>A new example of this in action is Nike's&nbsp;launch of their&nbsp;<a href="http://nikeaccelerator.com/index.html" target="_blank">Nike+ Accelerator</a>--a partnership with <a title="Techstars" href="http://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a> that will host 10 companies for a three-month, immersive, mentor-driven startup accelerator designed to spur development on the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.nike.com/">NikeFuel, the Nike+ FuelBand, and Nike+ Running API platform</a>.</p>
<p>The 10 partner companies will be given the following:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>$20,000</li>
<li>Access to the Nike+ APIs, Nike+ mobile SDKs, and Nike+ FuelBand Dev Kit (Beta) - you will be among the first in the world to receive this access</li>
<li>A Nike+ FuelBand for each team member</li>
<li>Tech support from experienced developers who've built companies, or built with Nike+ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</li>
<li>Code and solution reviews during the program</li>
<li>Mentor sessions with Nike executives and leaders in the start-up community</li>
<li>Two Investor Demo Days: one at the Nike World Headquarters and one in Silicon Valley</li>
<li>Real Access to Decision Makers</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, at the end of the Nike+ Accelerator, each team will present to Nike executives, mentors, angel investors, venture capitalists, and tech industry leaders.</p>
<p>As an API publisher have you considered a built-in accelerator or incubation program within your API ecosystem?  And while I&rsquo;m at it, has your incubator or accelerator consider a partnership program tailored for API publishers?</p>
<p>Sounds kind of like a Reese's Peanut Butter commercial! :)</p>

<p>I just added a new feature to the right hand menu, for the podcast <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>, a podcast about APIs and the cloud from John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) and Steve Marx (<a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m big podcast fan, and I"m always looking for something I can listen to in the background while I&rsquo;m coding or writing stories. &nbsp;Traffic and Weather is great for this.</p>
<p>The podcast dives into various topics ranging from Webhooks to oAuth, but keeps things light, where I think even non-technical folks can get up to speed on the latest in the space.  John and Steve make things very informative, while being friendly and keeping it conversational.</p>
<p>I added a widget to my right hand menu, which will always pull the latest episode from Traffic and Weather.  You can also click on the logo to go directly to their site.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/01/24/the-next-generation-of-api-discovery/">The Next Generation of API Discovery</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/Tag-Cloud-API-Discovery.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>For the last seven years, when you wanted to find an API you went to <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.  It has been the definitive way to discover new APIs, and responsible for all the buzz in the space that has gotten the industry to where it is.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb is at 8400 APIs in its directory</a>, and adding 50-100 each week, it will continue to get even more difficult to discover APIs.  Even for someone like me who has looked at thousands of APIs, it can be very difficult and time consuming to find the API or APIs you are looking for.</p>
<p>In 2013 there are even more ways to find APIs, new approaches that are looking to define the next generation of API discovery and consumption.  Currently I&rsquo;m tracking on 4 API directories in addition to ProgrammableWeb:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="APihub" href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a></strong> - APIhub is the best way to publish, discover and consume APIs. Search our database or browse through our most popular APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="APIs.io" href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a></strong> - APIS.io is an open source and free API registry service that allows developers to publish and discover REST APIs and interact with them online</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.exiconglobal.com/api-dir/">Exicon API Directory</a></strong> - Exicon helps marketers and enterprises find qualified developers through our online platform and advisory services</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mashape" href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a></strong> - Mashape provides a world-class marketplace to manage, distribute and consume both private and public APIs by developers from all over the world</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs.io and Exicon have the least amount of APIs available, but both Mashape and APIhub are currently leading, with Mashape possessing over 1500 and APIhub has over 13,000 APIs available.</p>
<p>In addition to providing the ability to search APIs and browse by category, these new generation of API directories are providing sophisticated tools like interactive documentation, code samples and ways to follow, share, like--providing social interactions for API developers with API publishers.</p>
<p>Beyond these new bells and whistles, what&rsquo;s next for API discovery?  To make developers lives easier they need programmatic ways to discover and understand APIs, as well as some sort of ranking to tell which are good and which are bad APIs.</p>
<p>To provide interactive documentation, these directories posses JSON definitions of each API interface, using formats such as <a title="Swagger" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">Swagger</a> from Wordnik, which opens up the door for more sophisticated discovery in a programmatic way, and potentially directly from within your IDE.</p>
<p>With the  data from the sharing, liking, following, page views and other signals generated via these API directories, there is a potential to develop some sort of ranking.  But we need more data signals from the space to truly develop a meaningful ranking.  I&rsquo;ve developed <a title="API Ranking" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">my own API ranking</a> to help me discover which APIs are trending based upon internal and external signals, allowing me to establish my <a href="http://apistack.com">API Stack</a>.  But its not enough either.  We need a lot more to be able to establish a meaningful way to rank APIs, that truly benefits developer efforts.</p>
<p>As we are switching from showcasing the quantity of APIs, to better understanding the value and quality of APIs, we are going to need a new breed of directories.  I&rsquo;m excited by what I&rsquo;m seeing from these new API directories, and hopeful for what is coming 2013.</p>
<p>Disclosure:  Both ProgrammableWeb and APIhub are API Evangelist partners.</p>

<p>Google is migrating samples and tools for App Engine, BigQuery, Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage to a new Github account, they are calling the <a title="Google Cloud Platform" href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/01/find-sample-code-and-more-for-google.html">Google Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/googlecloudplatform">Google is going all in with its use of Github</a>, something I'm encouraging API owners to do.  They are working to manage all of their essential API tools there like their start projects, which show developers how to get started with Google APIs as well as other helper tools like the OAuth 2.0 Helper, that helps developers be successful.</p>
<p>Github provides a lot of benefit beyond the obvious aspect of open sourcing your code.  Google is actively engaging with developers using Github alongside all of these open source projects.  If you think about it, this offers a more compelling way to engage with API developers beyond forums.  On forums you end up with a lot of general, sometimes senseless questions--Github anchors questions or issues and pull requests around actual code libraries, SDKs, starter kits and other integration areas.</p>
<p>Github provides potentially more meaningful actions to occur between you and your developer community, beyond making code more accessible and openly licensed.  It is good to see Google going this route.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/sdk-bridge/SDKBridge-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><em>This post comes from the&nbsp;<a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a>&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.</em></p>
<p>ProgrammableWeb is known for publishing the number of public APIs in its directory, and they regularly present an impressive&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r-l-utikkyk-hdhyyhjli-j/" target="_blank">graph</a>&nbsp;that shows how this number has increased exponentially over time. However, not all APIs are public, and ProgrammableWeb is not able to obtain information on how many non-public APIs exist.</p>
<p>SDK Bridge writes API documentation as a service, and many of our customers have us document their non-public APIs. That puts us in a unique position to be able to estimate what percentage of APIs is public compared to non-public.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>What exactly is a non-public API? For the purposes of this article, let's define a few terms.</p>
<p><strong>Public API.</strong>&nbsp;A public API is an API where the documentation is freely available on the Web. Using the API may require registering and paying a fee.</p>
<p><strong>Partner API.</strong>&nbsp;A partner API is an API where the documentation is not made available to the public, but is made available to select companies who have some kind of partnership agreement with the API provider. Typically the documentation is accessible through a password-protected website.</p>
<p><strong>Internal API.</strong>&nbsp;An internal API is an API that is only used by developers who work for the company that provides the API. Typically the documentation is available only on an internal website.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Since its inception in 2008, SDK Bridge has written documentation for 23 web APIs. (Web APIs are only a portion of the writing that we do for software professionals. We also write SDK documentation, IT documentation, and training curricula, as well as create video tutorials for developers.) Of these APIs, 12 were public, 9 were partner, and 2 were internal. The following pie chart shows the breakdown:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 200px;" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="bottom"><img src="https://i6.createsend1.com/ei/r/97/AC3/A0A/061035/nonpublicapipie.png" alt="" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Web API documentation by type.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For the non-public APIs (partner and internal), it's interesting to note that 82% were RESTful and 18% were SOAP APIs. Also, 91% supported XML formats and 18% supported JSON formats. This suggests that non-public APIs have mostly made the transition from SOAP to REST, but have largely not made a transition from XML to JSON.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Our data analysis indicates that roughly half of web APIs are not public. Two factors to consider:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The sample size is still fairly small. As time goes on and we get a larger sample size, we will improve the accuracy.</li>
<li>Companies may be less inclined to hire outside writers for non-public APIs than for public APIs. This means that our data could easily result in an underestimation of non-public APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for now, if you are looking for a rough estimation of the total number of APIs, you can take the number published by ProgrammableWeb and double it.</p>

<p>Google's transparency report proves details on Government requests including who they come from, where the requests originate, types of requests and other critical information about how our government monitor us citizens and ultimately the entire world online.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/23/google-releases-new-government-surveillance-data-facebook-stays-mum/">stories on other blogs that state Facebook and other platforms should follow Google's lead with transparency reports</a> of their own.  I agree.  We will never see our government mandate industry leaders to do this, so us people have to lobby corporations to follow Google's lead.</p>
<p>I see this type of transparency being critical to any company claiming they have an "open platform" or "open APIs".  I will be adding transparency report to my list of <a title="legal building blocks for API owners" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">legal building blocks for all API owners</a>.</p>
<p>As more and more of our world, economy and daily lives moves online and are transmitted via APIs, investigations by our legal system and government are only going to grow.  We need to establish a way to report on these inquiries in real-time and in an open way like Google has been doing for two years now.</p>

<p>I love to write.  My girlfriend has really help me kindle this passion.  Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/">@audreywatters</a>.</p>
<p>After 2.5 years of telling stories on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a>, I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at organizing my ideas, and putting out stories that showcase the best (and worst) from the Business of APIs.  I&rsquo;ve gotten so efficient at it in 2012, I even launched <a href="http://apievoice.com/">API Voice</a> which is dedicated to the politics of APIs, <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a> which is dedicated to top APIs and <a href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hack Weekends</a> which is all about hackathons.</p>
<p>When I meet people in the real world, I often hear, &ldquo;You sure blog a lot, I see like 5 posts a day coming from you!&rdquo;  I do write a lot, but it comes in waves.  I tend to write a lot of stories all at once, pumping out 15-20 pieces and then I trickle them out across the appropriate domain over the next couple days.</p>
<p>In 2013, I&rsquo;m going to get even more efficient with my storytelling, with an evolved approach I&rsquo;m calling <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/">Hacker Storytelling</a>.</p>
<p>The process is based upon dwhat I already do, but uses a new blend of:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Pages</strong> - HTML, CSS and text that frames a site, project or research</li>
<li><strong>Blogs</strong> - Chronological blog posts that walk through a project or research</li>
<li><strong>Presentations</strong> - Deck.js presentations that walk through a project or research</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - JSON, XML or database stores that drive the essence of a story</li>
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Simple, data and representations derived from APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I use these formats to tell stories across my blog, but in 2012 I learned some new techniques with existing and new technology that &nbsp;I have discovered, and will be employing a series of technologies that help me better deliver stories:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Github Pages</strong></a> - A quick, easy and lightweight way to host websites on Github allowing anyone to build site with HTML, CSS and Javascript.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme" target="_blank"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> - Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website.</li>
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mustache Templates</strong></a> - A simple way to render structured data from JSON files, using basic HTML templates for displaying--instead of pulling directly from database.</li>
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Deck.js</strong></a> - A JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations. deck.js is flexible enough to let advanced CSS and JavaScript authors craft highly customized decks, but also provides templates and themes for the HTML novice to build a standard slideshow.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default all of my projects start as a Github repository with a base Github Pages + Jekyll implementation I&rsquo;ve setup for my API Evangelist brand.   This will force me to be open and transparent by default.  I know this reality isn&rsquo;t meant for everyone, but for me, I hate seeing many of my projects never leave the firewall and end up being deleted from an Amazon EC2 instance in the dungeon of my IT network.</p>
<p>All my projects will become <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> projects.  Some will have a single page, while others will have blogs, presentations and simple or complex data driven tools that help support the story.</p>
<p>Currently I have four projects who live in this new format and are hosted entirely on Github:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a></li>
<li><a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com">Hack Weekends</a></li>
<li><a title="Hack Weekends Guide" href="http://guide.hackweekends.com">Hack Weekends Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://digitalstrategy.apievangelist.com">Digital Strategy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to be open by default, when it comes to content and data and make sure I share all of my ideas, in the widest and most shareable and remixable way possible.  My objective during my time on earth is to tell stories and write code that will make change, no matter how small.</p>
<p>I believe that <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> will help me do this!  I hope it will help you too!</p>

Giving them access to upcoming Google Drive SDK features and the opportunity to provide feedback.</p>
<p>Google isn't accepting everyone--they will be screening applicants based upon the type and quality of the application, number of users, and ability to implement and provide feedback on new features as they're made available.</p>
<p>An early access program seems like a good idea for API owners.  It gives you the chance to test out your alpha and beta APIs, client libraries, SDK's with a controlled audience, before you release them out into the wild.</p>
<p>With the number of developers Google has, I don't think it will be a problem getting developers to sign up.  But it seems like something you could even pay developers for, if you have a shortage of good developers in your API ecosystem.</p>
<p>An early access program fits right into earlier stories I've done on <a title="possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/10/24/incentivize-your-api-developers-to-contribute-with-lower-pricing/index.php">possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems</a>.</p>
