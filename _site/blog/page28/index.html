        <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MikeAmundsen/posts/9d8QTVVDuJd">I was reminded by my friend Mike Amundsen of the importance of storytelling in our world</a>. When I am asked by anyone doing APIs, what is the most important thing they should be doing, my answer is always "storytelling". I don't care if its internally, publicly, on the corporate blog, or your personal blog, tell the story of what you are doing. I do not care how good your API is, if you aren't telling the story of this, nobody is going to care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I hold up storytelling as the most important tool in your toolbox within developer groups, they often snicker, dismissing it. I also have a contingent of my NOT fanbase in the API space who love to dismiss me with -- nobody reads or cares about stories! I'm never phased by these folks, my focus is on the people who are truly trying to build community, and reach their intended audience. #NoHaterz</p>
<p>While stories swirl all around is many forms, the one I like to reference the most, is when it comes to the mating ritual that is startup funding. If you are looking to get funding for your startup, you have to be sending the right signals, otherwise your VC mate will never be interested in you. You will need to be on TechCrunch, Venture Beat, and other tech blogs. Hacker News, Reddit and Hacker News needs to be in sync. Your stories should also be in sync with what is floating around VC firm blogs, aggregate, and other investor related streams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Startup valuations are are defined by an ocean of stories crashing on the shore each day. Bots are a thing because of storytelling. We are focusing on selling to the enterprise and abandoning B2C solutions because of storytelling. Google loves them some moonshot storytelling. Elon Musk understand the importance of the right story at the right time. Stories of what people are using. Stories of what people are investing in. Stories of what the future will hold, and will be a 20B industry by 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is marketing Kin! I'd put it in the fiction section of the library if I was in charge, but I'm not. Its all storytelling. If you need another example, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">visit my secret to Amazon's success post</a>. This story does 2K page views a month, and I've seen it referenced in keynotes, framed on the wall of a bank, and on the home page of a federal agencies internal portal. This story is more fiction than it is fact, yet it keeps on resonating with folks, getting passed around, and turning people on to the concept of APIs, and why they are important.</p>
<p>Please keep telling your story, if for no other reason, so that I have stories to retell. ;-)</p>

<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc">I came across the Wikimedia Unique Devices data set, which also is served up as an API endpoint, along with the other APIs the platform offers</a>. The data set and API provides access to a list of unique devices that have visited Wikipedia, for a specific period of time.</p>
<p>The data set and API only has data back to January currently, but I'm sure is something that will evolve over time. I really like the fact that we have organizations who are operating at scale, and are open and willing to share their data. This type of information is high value, and is something that can help us all better understand the ever shifting digital landscape around us--thank you Wikimedia for making accessible.</p>
<p>While playing with their <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc">Unique Device API</a>, I also noticed how transparent they are with their page view data, also making it available as simple set of API endpoints. I know Wikimedia is a non-profit, but I can't help but feel their way of doing things provides a blueprint that other commercial platforms should consider following.</p>

<p>I am <a href="http://apis.how/3bjch3csvo">working with my partner Cloud Elements</a> to build out a community of evangelists, who are interested in delivering on <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">many of the essential building blocks I track on when it comes to API evangelism</a>. I get regular requests from companies who are looking for evangelism and advocacy resources -- in desperate need of smart folks who can help craft content, crank out code, in the service of evangelizing a platform.</p>
<p>The work I'm doing with Cloud Elements, is the early work to help deliver on what API providers, and service providers are needing. Right now we are on-boarding new folks to the concept, and getting feedback on what some of the common elements, and challenges will be. One of the folks I'm engaging with on this is expert PHP and API developer, tech lead, author, consultant and open source maintainer, Lorna Mitchell (<a href="https://twitter.com/lornajane">@lornajane</a>).</p>
<p>Lorna is one of several folks I've been working with to help deliver on API Evangelist projects ranging from blog, and white papers, to training, and how-to guides. If you are a PHP developer, <a href="http://www.lornajane.net/?s=git&amp;submit=Search">have been learning about Git and Github in the last couple of years you have probably come across Lorna's work</a>. I was talking to my friend Mark Body on Skype today, and mentioned Lorna and he said oh yeah, I've used her Git training materials before, in my stories and talks -- something I echoed as well, having pointed my readers and clients to her training materials regularly.</p>
<p>After five years of doing what I call hacker storytelling, writing code, JSON, and stories about APIs, I understand how much hard work goes into creating content that is educational and simple, focused on very technical topics like APIs, while also driving search engine traffic over long periods of time. Lorna has done very well these areas,crafting blog posts that will keep being surfaced in Google searches for a long time to come, and help walk people through some very lofty technical concepts--wave after wave.</p>
<p>If you are needing help with storytelling as part of your industry, or API platform, let me know. I'm happy to see where I can help. Feel free to reach out to Lorna as well, she is looking to help the right companies and platforms craft white papers, guides, training and tutorials. If you are an evangelist who is looking to do the same, let me know, and I'm also happy to plug you into the community we are assembling, and see where you can help deliver. If you want to test drive some of first tasks and challenges we have going on in the beta phase, you are welcome to sign up on your own at&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudelements.influitive.com/join/dev032016">Mt. EveREST</a>-- things are just getting going, and we could use your feedback.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://api.slack.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/slack-platform-keeping-in-touch.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the side effects of the recent bot craze, is that I'm getting to showcase the often very healthy API practices of Slack, as they grow, scale, and manage their developer ecosystem. Slack is beginning to renew my faith that there are API providers out there who give a shit, and aren't just looking to exploit their ecosystems. There are two Slack blog posts that have triggered these thoughts, <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-slack-platform-roadmap-34067b054177#.mhuax8lrn">one on the Slack platform road map</a>, and <a href="https://slackhq.com/a-little-thing-about-release-notes-997d2e06842d#.hmmeyia86">a little thing about release notes</a>, both of which reflect what I would love to see other API providers emulate in their platform operations.</p>
<p>Slack is going the extra mile to set the right tone in their community, with what I consider to be some of the essential communication building blocks of API operations, but they simply call <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"keep in touch"</strong></span>:</p>

</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>I just copied and pasted that from their developer portal. Slack does not stop there, also providing an&nbsp;<a title="Frequently asked questions" href="https://api.slack.com/faq">FAQ</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/community-code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://trello.com/b/HPpcIqd8/slack-app-ideaboard" target="_blank">Ideaboard</a>&nbsp;to further set the tone for how things can and should work in a community. What I like about the tone Slack is taking, is that it is balanced--"keep in touch"! Which really is just as much about us API consumers, as it is about Slack. Slack has done the hard work of providing most of the essential API building blocks, as well as a valuable API resource, now its up to the community to deliver--this balance is important, and we should be staying in touch.</p>
<p>Remember the tone Twitter took with us? Developer Rules of the Road!! Very different tone than "keep in touch". The tone really matters, as well as the investment in the common building blocks that enable "keeping in touch", both synchronous, and asynchronously. Having a road map, and change log for your API goes a long way, but telling the behind the why, how, and vision behind your road map and change log--gives me hope that this API thing might actually work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite popular belief in Silicon Valley, there are many different ways to fund the design, development, deployment, and operation of valuable API resources. Not all APIs are destined to be the next Amazon, Twitter, or even Twilio. Some APIs just need exist, be available, and will never be a revenue engine--one of these APIs is the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/#judge-data">Court Listener API.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/">Version 3.0 of the Court Listener API possesses 15 valuable endpoints</a>, providing access to&nbsp;courts, dockets, opinions, people, sources, ratings, and other details about how laws are made in the United States. <a href="https://free.law/2016/04/19/judicial-database-announcement/">With their latest release containing a comprehensive database of judges and the judiciary, to be linked to Court Listener&rsquo;s corpus of legal opinions authored by those judges</a>.</p>
<p>Increasingly APIs like Court Listener, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) API</a>, are capturing my attention. These types of APIs represent the type of impact I'm looking to make using APIs, going beyond what APIs can do for a single application or industry, but what they can do for wider sections of our society. Focusing on getting agile, nimble, and more efficient in how craft laws in our country, and how we make sure people are fed, and find the government services they need in their life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/donate/">The Court Listener API depends on grants, and donations to operate</a>, which is an approach I will be showcasing more when it applies to APIs that deliver valuable human, civic, and research related resources. APIs like the Court Listener API provide an important window into how our local, state, and federal judicial system is operating (or not), and will need our financial support to do what they do. Which I think is a very viable approach to designing, deploying, and operating APis -- that is, if we all step up and support these efforts.</p>

<p>I am using my <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">minimum viable API operations definition tool</a> to continue profiling the API sector, this time to size up the Slack API community. Slack is kind of a darling of the API space, so it kind of seem silly to profile them, but profiling those who are doing this API think right, is what API Evangelist all about--whether I follow the hype or not.</p>
<p>Using my minimum viable API definition, I went through the Slack API portal looking for what I'd consider to be the essential building blocks that any modern API platform should have.</p>

<p>Performing better than <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/21/sizing-up-the-imaterialise-3d-printing-api-with-my-minimum-viable-api-operations-definition/">the review of the i.Materialise 3D printing API</a> that I conducted the other day, Slack checks off all but one of the essential building blocks-everything except for pricing. The only other area(s) that I find deficient, is when it comes to machine readable API definitions like OpenAPI Spec and Postman Collections. These aren't required for success, but they can sure go a long ways in helping developers on-board from documentation, to generating code, and tooling that will be needed for integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming Slack hasn't generated OpenAPI Specs because they have a more XML-RPC design, which I think many folks assume can't be documented in this way. While it doesn't lend itself to more easily being documented with OpenAPI Spec, I found some simple little hacks that make it doable, allowing you to also document even XML-RPC designs. Having some OpenAPI Specs and Postman Collections would make the API more accessible for people looking to play with.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just wanted to test out the <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">minimum viable API operations tool</a> on another API. I am trying to profile several APIs in this way each week, helping the number of APIs I am monitoring grow, while also encouraging other API providers to follow Slack's lead.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/04/25/openapi-specifications-for-642-of-the-schemaorg-types/">OpenAPI Specifications For 642 Of The Schema.org Types</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://schema.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am gearing up for another wave of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition</a> work, so I am taking the opportunity to produce some more tooling that assists me in the process. One of the tools I want to build, is a simple solution for walking me through one or many OpenAPI Specs, and push me to make sure every parameter has a complete set of descriptions. I possess amazing powers of bullshit, and can craft default description for almost anything I come across, but it would be nice to have an an ever evolving autocomplete dictionary to augment my existing super powers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already have <a href="http://apis.json.autocomplete.apievangelist.com/">an APIs.json driven autocomplete tool, that loops through all the parameters within the OpenAPI Specs that are indexed</a>. I just needed a rich set of fields and parameters to pull from -- <a href="https://schema.org">Schema.org</a>. The rich vocabulary that is Schema.org possesses 992 properties across 642 schema types. I've long wanted to craft OpenAPI Specs for Schema.org, but needed a reason to help push things forward, and this is a perfect opportunity to kick things off.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">As a starting point, I created 642 separate OpenAPI Specs</a>. One for each of the schema types. I already have an API that will generate an OpenAPI Spec from any JSON schema, building out GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, as well as a default 200 response, and connecting it to the schema for the API response definition. As I was doing the work I realized that I didn't want to limit the OpenAPI Specs to just the JSON version, so as I generated I also published a YAML version.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/schema-org-api-definitions.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Next I'm going to use <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/schema-org-openapi-specs/tree/gh-pages/api-commons">these 642 OpenAPI Specs as an autocomplete index</a> for helping me quickly fluff up the parameters of other existing API definitions. Next I'll work on wiring up the hierarchies and relationships present in the Schema.org definitions. Right now, none of the OpenAPI Specs will validate as the parameter types aren't all valid, but I didn't want to lose the object references.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond being an autocomplete index which I can use across my micro tools for working with API definitions, I am thinking this Schema.org work will bear a shit ton of fruit in future work. I would like to have API implementations for many of the more common Schema.org types, allowing me to help folks design, and deploy Schema.org compliant APIs. Something that I feel will go a long way to help stabilize and standardize APIs, by helping them speak using a more common vocabulary.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-json-annotation.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am working on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/09/playing-with-one-possible-openapi-spec-for-the-human-services-data-specification-hsds/">one possible API definition for the Human Services Definition Specification (HSDS)</a>, and the next phase of this work involves bringing in a small group of technical, and non-technical folks to have discussions around their API designs, in context of the master specification I am looking to pull together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help drive the discussion I am wanted to use the <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/api-commons/openapi-spec.json">OpenAPI Specification that I created for HSDS</a>, and I also knew I wanted to use Github issue management to help keep track of the synchronous, and asynchronous conversation that would occur around it. However Github tends to have a perceived barrier to entry for many non-developers (which I don't fully get), so I wanted to leverage the platform, but also soften the way everyone discussed the overall specification, as well as each individual endpoint.</p>
<p>The HSDS specification is pretty verbose, and I needed a way to have conversations at the high level, but also down to the endpoint level. To help facilitate this, I got to work on a<a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/"> prototype micro tool which enables a conversation around any API(s) that are indexed within an APIs.json file</a>, producing a human readable list of endpoints, parameters, etc., but then uses Github issue management as the core of the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resulting in <a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/">my APIs.json Annotation tool</a>. It is just a first draft, so there will be a lot of changes that need to occur. I'm going to test it against 20+ APIs.json collections I have defined as part of <a href="http://theapistack.com">my API Stack</a> work to try and harden it a little bit. My APIs.json Annotation tool runs in my single repo app style, leveraging Jekyll + Github Pages + Github API to operate--Github is the front and backend.</p>
<p>Anyone can view the conversation, but if you want to participate you have to be added to the Github repository, and pass in a <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">Github personal token</a>. This is something I often automate with a simple Github login, where I use <a href="http://OAuth.io">OAuth.io to obtain token</a>, but I kind of see the token as a minimum viable investment to understanding Github for using each tool.</p>
<p>It is really important to me that each app stands on its own feet. Not all of my micro tools that I develop in this way will enjoy zero outside dependencies, but most of them can be easily forked, and ran in any Github user account or org (with little or no setup). Conversations around API is just one area I am looking to simulate with this approach to delivering tooling, and specifically APIs.json tooling, that can be used throughout an API life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are welcome to play with <a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/">the APIs.json Annotation</a>, or any <a href="http://apievangelist.com">of the other tools I have listed on my home page</a>. I will keep adding them here, so that they can be found, but like all my work they are all a work in progress. <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools">Each tool has its own dedicated repo and issue management</a>, where you are welcome to join in the conversation around the road map for each one. I am just looking to develop a robust toolbox of small micro tools that will help be more successful across the life cycle of the APIs I am working on, but maybe you can benefit using them too.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I tend to only work in environments where I have full control over the server, so Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is never really an issue for any of the APIs I have control over, but is a pervasive problem for APIs, and JSON files I come across on the web. This is one of the reasons I really enjoy the fact that I publish all of my JSON driven, hacker storytelling projects using Github Pages and Jekyll.</p>
<p>In the last couple weeks I have been working on a bunch of micro tools that deliver specific functionality which can then be used throughout the API life cycle. All of these apps are developed using JavaScript, and depend on being able to read from any number of JSON file stores. Sometimes these files are stored within the project, but most likely I'm calling the remote JSON files of other projects, something that depends on the sharing of resources across domains.</p>
<p>If I am publishing a JSON file publicly on the open Internet, I want it to be accessible from anywhere. CORS has to be default. The speed, and agility at which I'm able to ingest and work with APIs.json files, and the OpenAPI Spec indexes they contain, sets me up for some serious nimbleness across my work.</p>
<p>If you are working with open data on the web, make sure and consider the CORS enablement by default when working with your JSON data on Github. It will make your life easier, as well as anyone else who will be looking to consume the valuable data you are putting out there.</p>

<p>I'm always on the hunt for like-minded folks who I can partner with, and bring needed products, services, and tools to the API space. If someone is selling something to the API space, its likely I have had a conversation with them about the sector at some point. I always enjoy these regular encounters, but its the handful of them that continue, and evolve into deeper relationships that I enjoy the most.</p>
<p>One of most recent relationship which I have been cultivating, is with a new <a href="https://www.hitchhq.com/">API startup called Hitch</a>. I have a long history with both the founders Bruno Pedro (<a href="https://twitter.com/bpedro">@bpedro</a>) and Luke Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/lukeam">@lukeam</a>), in their previous lives with API Changelog and <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, but began talking with them more heavily bout their vision for Hitch earlier this year. I have spent considerable time with Luke and Bruno discussing the current state of the API life cycle, from design to deprecation, helping contribute to their vision and road map in any way that I can.</p>
<p>As Hitch prepares to shift into higher gear, helping API providers build community, the Hitch team asked me to join the team in an advisory capacity. I am always happy to share my thoughts, experience, and views on the space, but I'm stoked for the opportunity to help advise them on their road map. As Hitch evolves, you'll hear me tell more stories about the solutions they are bringing to the API life cycle. I'm hoping I can influence what they bring to the API life cycle, while also using them as another valuable source of stories about the API space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hitch is just getting going so there isn't much for me to focus on yet, but I'm looking forward to continue sharing my research with the team, to help them in any way I can. I just wanted to put it out there that I was involved, and turn up the volume my public storytelling about building community, and the API life cycle in preparation for what Hitch is bringing to table. I'm looking forward to being part of what is cooking over at Hitch--stay tuned!</p>

<p>I was just participating in an interesting conference call about multiple API implementations, which are putting the <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral/blob/master/Human%20Services%20Data%20Specification%20%20v1.0.md">Human Services Definition Specification (HSDS)</a> to use. The call was brought together discuss a shift in the current path one of the projects was taking, which involved using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/search/">Azure Search Service</a>, and whether or not the original vendor solution was still necessary, because the cloud solution appeared to meet all their needs.</p>
<p>I sat and listened to the pros and cons of each approach. Why Azure allowed them to quickly meet the project needs, and could scale. Why the other vendor solution had a more holistic view of the problem, and shared the investment from many implementations. I had nothing to offer. The only common ground I had was around the already established schema for delivering human services. I didn't have any awareness of each individual project, the resources and skills available each group possessed, or a belief in any particular cloud platform, database solution, or programming language.</p>
<p>While Azure, and the other vendor approach dominated the first part of the conversation, everyone one on the call was in agreement around HSDS driving everyone's schema, while also agreeing were missing a common approach to defining and delivering the API. The vendor on the call was working on the next version of their API which used the HSDS format, with the Azure driven solution spoke HSDS as well. To add to the mix, I am also working on two additional implementations that will also be speaking HSDS--we all just needed a common approach to defining the API.</p>
<p>As the next step, I suggested scheduling another call, where I walk through <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">the API definition I am applying to my projects</a>, providing a YAML version of my OpenAPI Spec definition. I prefer using YAML, to help lower the cognitive barrier to entry for business users of the group, demonstrating how OpenAPI Spec can be used by everyone to quantify each individual API, but in a way that we can share, discuss, and reuse--helping establish a harmony in design across all of our implementations.</p>
<p>I always work hard to not set the bar to high when it comes to the magical powers of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> have when it comes to facilitating API discussions between technical and business groups, but the benefits in situations like this are clear. I feel API definitions have the potential to help folks unpack the dogma (and insecurities) we all possess around the architectural decisions we have made, the programming languages we are using, and the cloud platforms that are increasingly depending on. Continuing to demonstrate for me the ways that APIs can help facilitate how we work together, with API definitions acting as a machine readable specification that can help us define what is needed by everyone at the table.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-personal-api-decisions.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://bionicteaching.com/a-bit-more-on-the-personal-api/">My friend Tom Woodward is continuing his personal API journey on his blog</a>, sharing more of his thoughts around taking control over his information, and sharing some of the conversational exhaust that his journey has generated. The conversation around what what is "personal API", is where the value in all of this for me, something that is full of endless perspectives, and views of what APIs do. Which is one of the things I truly love about APIs, as they mean so many different things to different folks.</p>
<p>As i mentioned before, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/16/personal-api-are-not-just-a-local-destination-they-are-a-journey/">when I mention the concept of personal API to some of my engineering friends</a>, they seem to always focus on people designing, developing, and operating an API stack on their own server, or at home. The recent post from Tom, focuses around a comment from our other friend Alan, who commented on his previous post, talking about the process of personal API being, "a bit binary (reclaim or &ldquo;let it burn&rdquo;)". I'm thinking Alan's perspective has been strongly influenced by Tom's heavy "reclaim" desires, as well as two other friends, who have embarked on similar journeys.</p>
<p>I'm endlessly intrigued by the dimensions of personal API that people are drawn into, and focus on. That personal API is about hosting or managing your API, or just about getting your information out of someones platform. When I read Tom's post, I actually do not see local or cloud, reclaim or let it burn, I see Tom working to understanding what information he generates online, understand the tradeoff's around the platform where this information lives, then logically making decisions around how he manage this. Sure this might involve abandoning platforms, and could involve setting up some self-hosted APIs, but more often it will not.</p>
<p>I can't help but think Alan might be missing some details of his own personal API journey, as a result of his focus on his friends. When we focus to heavily on a specific aspect of API enablement (migration), I find people tend to miss many of the other benefits also occurring. I'm guessing that many the reasons that went into his original adoption of Flickr, feeling like he can rely on it, and his lack of interest in ever leaving the platform, were most likely API influenced. APIs have have made Flickr a a ubiquitous tool in our lives, allowing the community to share photos using <a href="http://oembed.com/">oEmbed</a>, develop valuable syndication, upload, and other useful solution, including WordPress integrations, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/tools/aperture">tools like Aperture</a>--APIs have been shaping everyone's decision to use the photo sharing platform for many years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the reasons I keep using the phrase personal API, is because of how people respond to it, view it, and accept of reject it. To me, personal API involves having my own hosted API stack, depending on 3rd party APIs (my personal storage API is Amazon S3 &amp; Dropbox), to host, sync, share, syndicate, publish, reclaim, orchestrate, collaborate, control, open, and restrict access to my bits and bytes. My journey is not yours, and your journey is not mine, but the process of sharing our stories, and having conversations around it are critical to each of us learning from each other.</p>
<p>APIs are empowering every brand you know and love (or hate) to make decisions around how they maximize where their bits and bytes are stored, accessed, and put to use across the web, mobile, and increasingly devices. Additionally APIs are empowering every brand you know and love (or hate) to also make better decisions around how they maximize where your bits and bytes are stored, accessed, and put to use across the web, mobile, and increasingly devices. Personal APIs are about shifting this balance in your favor, but for many of us, in many situations, we are fine with offloading these decisions to others, as it can be lot of work to operate on our own. &nbsp;At some point though, when they are ready, there will be a wealth of information out there to help them take back control, no matter how small that first step it might be.</p>
<p>In the end, I don't care if anyone cares about APIs, or personal APIs, but I do care about people being aware of the online services they use, and that they are equipped to make the best possible decisions they can about what services they use. For me it is less about APIs, than it is about how APIs are already being used to enable your world, and helping ensure that you have the awareness and opportunity to assert whatever amount of control over your digital self that you feel comfortable doing, whenever you are ready.</p>

<p>I always have an inbox full of requests from companies asking me to take a look at their APIs, and provide any feedback that I can. I do conduct a more formal review for some companies, but I also enjoy looking through the API operations of any API, just as part of my regular monitoring (if I have time). When I do have time, the first part of any scope of review, is to see if it meets my definition of a minimum viable API operation.</p>
<p>This is a definition I've been refining for over five years now, looking through thousands of APIs. Even with all this refinement, I still need a single place I could go, and quickly apply to any of the APIs that are in my review queue. My objective in doing these reviews is partly to help me get to know what an API does, but also provide feedback to the API providers, as well as generate stories that I can share with my readers, helping them polish their own strategy along the way.</p>
<p>To help me streamline the reviews I do, and deliver feedback to API providers, I created a little micro tool for my self, that I can use as a checklist while I go through the operations of each API in my queue. To beta test my <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">minimum viable API operation definition tool</a>,&nbsp;I profiled the <a href="https://i.materialise.com/api/">3D printing API i.Materialise</a>.</p>

<p>The only areas the i.Materialise API stumbles for me is having a road map, change log, as well as a dedicated support page, with a contact person and email to reach out to. You can go to the public side of the i.Materialise site and use the contact page, which is linked in the footer of the developer portal, but I strongly recommend having a dedicated support page, and channels that are dedicated to the API community.</p>
<p>The blog, RSS, and Twitter feeds are not dedicated to the API, and are company-wide. This is fine, but at some point I recommend a dedicated blog, RSS, and Twitter accounts for the API. It can be easy to burn out API consumers with too much general information that doesn't apply to them, and there is little overhead involved with deploying a blog, RSS, and Twitter accounts dedicated to the community.</p>
<p>iMaterialise is closer to being a complete API definition, than most APIs that I look at--something that won't take much effort to bring up to speed. The area I do recommend they focus energy on is around the availability of an <a href="http://apis.how/xmynjnqxwr">OpenAPI Spec</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="http://apis.how/xakqrgkfkm">Postman Collections</a> for the platform. These elements would significantly add to the available documentation for the platform, while also allowing them to <a href="https://apimatic.io/">easily generate SDKs for the platform using APIMATIC</a>, which is another deficient area for the API (no code page). In addition to better docs and SDKs, these API definitions would allow any developers to quick load up, and begin playing with the API in popular HTTP clients like <a href="http://apis.how/gwbjyujag1">Postman</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apis.how/ebsh6b2hrd">DHC</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of an OpenAPI Spec is the most deficient area in my opinion. The availability of a definition, would push the presence of the iMaterialise 3D Printing API beyond the minimum viable API operation definition for me, and into the zone of a robust platform. One that will go along way towards attracting new developers, on boarding them quicker, and helping them go from discovery to successful integration -- which is what this is all about.</p>
<p>Next, if I have the time, I will create an OpenAPI Spec for the platform which will give me more awareness around the actual API design.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-outside-in.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>A &nbsp;huge pet peeve for me is when a company has a blog, but not provide an RSS feed--it really grinds my gears! Although it is something that aggravates me, I understand many of the reasons behind it. People just don't see their blog through an outside lens. They visit other company blogs when they want to read them, usually via a bookmark, or possibly rely on an email digest once a week--they aren't RSS reader users. RSS consumers were always a niche (that almost went mainstream), but is one that has taken a big hit with the closing of Google Reader.</p>
<p>I'm sure most of the companies would immediately turn on an RSS feed if I dropped them an email, but I'd rather write about it, and reach just the cream (my readers) on top of the API space. One of the most important side effects of being on the API journey in my opinion, is that expansion, evolution, and fine tuning of your powers for empathy that will occur along the way. Your API developer portal becomes a front line for conversations with the outside world, where you will carefully(hopefully) share your most precious internal resources, and entertain external views on how they should be exposed and put to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my experience companies who are able to think outside the corporate firewall, do the best with APIs, with those who are open to culture change in close second--everyone else will falter. I can't help but feel that RSS is a very 101 example of this in action. I want you to read my blog, but because I didn't think beyond what I do, and my peers, when it comes to providing and consuming blogs, having an RSS feed didn't occur to me. If I was an RSS reader user, and the absence of RSS was a pain point, my tune would be different.</p>
<p>You can see this awareness in play over at <a href="https://www.workiva.com/">the&nbsp;risk, audit, finance, and compliance platform Workiva</a>. It is one of the few places I've seen <a href="http://investor.workiva.com/investors/resources/default.aspx">RSS at work in such a useful, and transparent way</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/workiva-rss.png" alt="" width="250" /></p>
<p>This is a level of RSS, and corporate accessibility that I only dream of. If I had an RSS feed for the press releases, event schedule, and SEC filings for every company I track on, I'd be in heaven. However with Workiva, the dream ends there--<a href="https://www.workiva.com/blog">their blog doesn't have an RSS feed</a>, or at least one that I can easily find.&nbsp;Which for me demonstrates where the average company invests in, and will develop empathy. It is usually developed around their own pain points in their operation, and within their own industry. Workiva is in the the business of monitoring corporations, and they see the value in having RSS for the signals that matter the most to them--blog, obviously not that important of a signal in this game yet.</p>
<p>I do not expect every company to cater to every need the long tail of what the public will want, nor do I expect all companies to be able to see their company through an external lens right out of the gate, but for me, the existence of RSS is one signal I tune into--similar to the signals having an API, or not having an API sends. I understand that many of my readers see RSS as a pretty insignificant thing, but for me having a blog, but not considering the wider syndication, distribution, and consumption of said blog, contributes to how I view a company's ability to think outside their firewall, and empathize with their customers, the public, and external players like me.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Apr 2016</span>

<p>I've heard the same thing for years--that the average person will never care about their digital stuff enough to ever want to learn about APIs, let alone for the concept of the personal API to ever be a thing. People love to comment, and tweet it at me anytime I talk about evangelizing APIs to normals, about reclaiming your domain, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/16/personal-api-are-not-just-a-local-destination-they-are-a-journey/">the concept of the personal API</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, you aren't original. IT has been telling the normals to not worry their :pretty little head" about the technical details for many, many years. It is how those with the power stay in power. If people are technically literate, and we built simple technology solutions for people, they wouldn't need us, or buy our bullshit. It is a very scary notion for many of us very insecure technologists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've worked as a professional developer since 1987, IT lead since 1998, and been evangelizing the API opportunity since 2004. These arguments are nothing new for me, but it does fascinate me that people think they are original, with very little awareness of the larger machine they operate on behalf of when they wield these statements. Like I should stop doing what I do, and having the expectations that I have, because the entire world will not fall into line -- its all or nothing. ?? WTF</p>
<p>I do not think in scale like you do. You are the slave in believing that all your ideas should scale. Not me. I'm happy if I reach one person. People like Tom Woodward (<a href="https://twitter.com/twoodwar">@twoodwar</a>), who understand that personal APIs are not about a single, perfect stack of APIs, living on a single beautiful server in your living room. Which is another rookie assault I get from fantasy believing developers looking to disarm my notion of the personal API, with their extremely simple view of what it is a "personal API".</p>
<p><a href="http://bionicteaching.com/personal-api-progress-in-pursuit-of-nirvana/">Tom is well on his way, when it comes to the API journey</a>. Tom understands that he doesn't have to be a rockstar ninja developer, or all mighty IT player to use APIs. Tom is just working to understand the footprint he leaves online each day, where all hist bits and bytes live, and how he can assert more control over this digital version of his existence. Tom will mostly likely never have a perfect stack of APIs (as technologists envision), but he is making some impressive inroads when it comes to identifying where he operates online, where he'd prefer to be operating, and how APIs can help him achieve the level of understanding and control he is seeking.</p>
<p>My mission as the API Evangelist is not about convincing everyone that APIs are a thing, and that everyone should care about APIs being available on all the platforms that we use as part of personal and professional lives. My mission is about convincing individuals, and individual business owners that they should always be asking the questions that Tom is asking, and working towards a better understanding of their digital self. Each person, business, organization, institution, or government agency I can influence to embark on their API journey, is a win for me.</p>
<p>So remember, when you tell me how nobody will every care about their digital stuff enough to want to learn about APIs, or embark on their own personal API journey, you just marked yourself as being a cog in a very old machine. You believe you are smarter than the average person, and that people are incapable of managing their own digital self, and should pay you, and the new class of technologists to do it for them. I probably shouldn't be educating y'all about this, and just let you keep self identifying for me where you stand on what role technology plays in our lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ownership.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading a post about how <a href="http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/data-security/unclear-sense-of-ownership-hurts-api-security.html">having an&nbsp;unclear sense of ownership hurts API security</a>, which showcases the different views on who owns security, when it comes to exposing corporate digital assets via APIs. When I read the title, I anticipated the story being about a difference in how ownership of the asset(s) itself is viewed, but it ended up focusing on the ownership of security itself, not ownership of the assets which are being exposed -- something I think gets closer to the root of the problem, than who "owns security".&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, the IT and developers who are often charged with exposing corporate assets via APIs will view those digital resource in some very different ways, than other people at the company. These groups will focus on exposing digital resources in a very technical sense, making them available so that others can integrate into their apps and systems--it isn't always in their nature to secure things sensibly. Their focus is to open up access, something the article touches on, but is something I think it goes deeper than just being about API security. Developers and IT are rarely ever going to see the digital resource in the same way that business stakeholders will, let alone security focused players (hopefully your IT and dev team has specialist influencing things).</p>
<p>APIs have made a name for themselves because a handful of companies successfully exposed their digital resources in this new way, allowing external perspectives of those digital resources to enter the conversation, which allowed for innovation to occur. In this handful of API origin stories we tell like to tell, owners of the digital resources at play were open to outside views of what their digital resource was, and how that resource could be put to use. These leading companies were open to an alternative view of the ownership and access of these digital resources, something that allowed API platforms to flourish &lt;&lt; This <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is not</span> something that will happen in all situations.</p>
<p>APIs really begin to go wrong, when the sense of ownership around digital resource is already unhealthy, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/21/almost-everyone-is-doing-the-api-economy-wrong/">resulting in what my friend Ed Anuff speaks of, with everyone doing the API economy wrong</a>. Without proper buy-in, developers and IT will often overlook security around resources being exposed--they just don't understand the importance of the resource in the same way. Coming from the opposite direction, business users will often come in and apply their "wet blanket" sense of ownership on the platform--resulting in heavy handed registration and approval flows, sales cycle(s), pricing, rate limits, and other common things you see slow API adoption.</p>
<p>APIs should be about us exposing our digital resources using the now ubiquitous Internet technology, in a way that opens up our resources, and the culture our business, organizations, institutions, and government agencies to outside views about what our resources are, and how they can be put to use. This is something that when done in the right environment, can reap some serious benefits for everyone involved, but when done in a culture where there is a already an imbalance around what digital resource ownership is, shit can really go wrong -- with security being just one stage where it plays out. In the end, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">APIs are not for everyone</span>. Some people just have too strict of a view around the value of their digital resources, and of the ownership of that resource, for the API thing to every actually work--with company IT and developer security practices being just a symptom of a much larger illness.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/eaEq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-evangelist-250-pricing-and-plan-pages.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I track on the API operations of around 2000 companies. Honestly, most of the 10K+ APIs in the ProgrammableWeb API directory have long been gone, deprecated, acquired, and had the lights shut off. There are only a couple thousand companies, institutions, organizations, and government who are doing public APIs, with only a couple hundred doing them in an interesting way.</p>
<p>This should not diminish the API conversation, as public APIs are just one aspect of the API discussion, and honestly it is one are that not all companies and organizations will have the stomach for. However, a certain amount of available public APIs will always play an important role in setting the tone for the entire API space, providing us with a (hopefully a diverse amount of) lead(s) when it comes to crafting our own strategies for operating our businesses on the Internet. Very little of what I do as the API Evangelist involves ideas that originate from my own head, and is something that requires a wealth of examples which I can point to in the wild.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am working on new ways to earn a living, while also generating research, analysis, code, and specification that the API sector can put to use in their own operations. One way I will be doing this, is by publishing technology, businesses, and politics of API design guides. This isn't API design as in the sense of REST, and how you craft endpoints, it is design thinking around the operations of your API. I learn a ton, flipping through the API portals of the 2000+ companies I keep an eye on, and I wanted to carve off small chunks of this, and share with you.</p>
<p>One area of API operations that has always fascinated me, and is one of the original founding focuses of API Evangelist, is how companies craft their API plans and pricing. Whether or not an API has a plans &amp; pricing page is a very telling signal all by itself, as APIs are often a side-project, without any real support and investment from its parent company or organization, and the lack of a coherent plan, with simple pricing is often a sign of other deficiencies. However when an API plan and pricing page is present, I to find it to be a very telling representation of a company, organization, institution, government agencies, and even individual(s) in some cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I track on many data points for any single API I keep an eye on. Ranging from their Twitter account, and Blog RSS, to the activity of their Github profiles. One of the areas I link to, when present, is the plans and pricing pages. This gives me the ability to quickly check up on the pricing of APIs across various business sectors, something that drives my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans research</a>. With the help of my <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">organization API</a>, and my <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">screenshot API</a>, I was able to easily harvest, organize, and make available the plans and pricing for 250 of what I feel are some of the more relevant APIs out there today.</p>
<p>To help make my research more explorable, I organized my API plan and pricing highlights into a single PDF guide, which allows you to experience the best of my API research, without all the clicking and searching I had to do. When I record details about the plans and pricing for an API, I have a rating of 1-3 for what I call API plan coupling, which is how tightly coupled their monetization strategy is to their API. Is the pricing that is present directly applied to API consumption, or is it more for the SaaS or PaaS side of things? While not all of the plans &amp; pricing I include in this research are tightly coupled with the API, they are all from platforms where the API does play a significant role in platform operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have many of these the common building blocks employed for the <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization strategy</a>, and for the actual <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan implementations</a>, recorded in a machine readable way, as part of my research. For this guide, I wanted to step back, and look at things through more of a design lens, and less from the technical, business, or even the political side of things. I think the visual of each plan and pricing page says a lot, and doesn't need a bunch of analysis from me to fluff it up. Just flipping through, you get a sense of what looks good, what doesn't, a process that I think will hopefully push forward more consistency across the API space.</p>
<p>There are numerous lessons present in the screenshots in this guide, around which building blocks are required to support API plans and pricing. Things like breaking things up into tiers, providing contact information, mechanisms for receiving a quote, demo, and know that a trial version is available. There are also lessons in how to present large amounts of very complex information, and some lessons in not how to do it, with plenty of evidence of why simple works. Oh, and that you should have a decent graphic designer! ;-)</p>
<p>I dismiss claims from the vocal startup, and VC elite, who point out the absolutes when it comes to API monetization, and pricing. That freemium won't work, and that offering unlimited access via API is always a mistake. Every company, API, and consumer will be different. In my opinion there are a wealth of strategies available out there to learn from, which we can apply in your own strategy. There are many variables, seen and unseen, that go into whether or not an API will be "successful" or not, and I strongly reject the notion there are absolutes -- there are only agendas, usually of the behind the scenes kind.</p>
<p>I have a number of API plans and pricing pages that I did not include in the current release of this guide. I will consider evolving, and shifting it up regularly, like I try to do with my other guides. I know I learn a lot from having them in a single place, that I can easily flip through and experience the design patterns present across these 250 API platforms, and hopefully you do to. I'm currently planning an interactive micro-app version of this research, as well as the coffee table edition for the API socialite who also enjoys entertaining.</p>

<p>I was going through <a href="http://developer.ean.com">the Expedia Affiliate Network</a> again yesterday, as part of my <a href="http://travel.stack.network/">Travel Stack Network</a> work. Having individual research projects that pop up on my radar, and force to me take a fresh look at API providers is a huge part of what I do. As I was going through their portal, taking a fresh look at things, their <a href="http://developer.ean.com/approved-devs/catalog/">approved developer catalog</a>&nbsp;was something that stood out for me.</p>
<p>A list of approved developers for any API is something I get asked about fairly regularly, so I want to keep referencing examples when I come across in the wild. Each developer entry in the catalog has the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logo - </strong>A company logo, or photo of individual developer.</li>
<li><strong>Name -</strong> Name of the company or devloper.</li>
<li><strong>Title -</strong> The title of the developer that is available.</li>
<li><strong>Website -</strong> A dedicated website for the developer.</li>
<li><strong>Address - </strong>The physical or mailing address.</li>
<li><strong>Email -</strong> An individual or company email address.</li>
<li><strong>Office Phone - </strong>The office / business line for developer.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Phone -</strong> A mobile phone for developer.</li>
<li><strong>Company Description - </strong>Details about the company.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Overview </strong>- Any additional details about developers.</li>
<li><strong>Sample(s) Of Work - </strong>Samples of work with title, description, and a link.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the big picture, I would bundle developer programs, and catalogs as just another layer of a partner program for any platform. Developer would just be an additional tier, sharing most of the same characteristics of other partner programs. I'll have to figure out how to clearly articulate the developer portion, and coherently weave into <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">my existing partner research</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see mature partner and developer programs operating within every API out there. I'm hoping we'll see this dimension of regular operations gain traction, alongside some of the tightening down of API programs I am seeing, and API providers work to get to know their ecosystems better. In my opinion, it will all work together to help ensure individual API community health, as well as the health of the wider API space.</p>

        <p>I sign up for a lot of APIs, and I am always surprised at what I see, or don't see, when I first signup for an API service. Personally I really enjoy the ones that have a simple, getting started formula to their signup emails. I signed up for <a href="https://developer.rosette.com/">Rosette a text analytics API</a> yesterday, and I thought their registration email was a good example of this.</p>

Oh, I also look to apply some of these to my own operations -- I know my registration process needs some love too.</p>

<p>Over the last five years many of us have been pushing forward our API design skills to deliver valuable resources to mobile apps. The multi channel opportunity for delivering data, content, and other resources to not just websites, and web applications, but also to iPhone, Android, Windows, and other mobile platform is clear. Alongside delivering web apps to multiple browsers (IE, Chrome, and Firefox), we had to learn to deliver to an increasingly diverse mobile ecosystem (iOS, Android, Windows).</p>
<p>When you have an API core, crafting new endpoints that speak to new channels is not as daunting of a task. I'm thinking through how to deliver API Evangelist knowledge into a Slack channel, Facebook Messenger discussions, and via Alex Voice for use at our <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/">APIStrat Conference in Boston this fall</a>. Whether I am creating bots, or delivering new skills to voice enablement, I'm just adding new design constraints to my already existing stack of things I consider when I'm crafting my API stack(s).</p>
<p>I can't help but be in tune with the frenzy around bots, and the interesting things AWS is doing within the Alexa ecosystem. I do not feel like it is a distraction from my core business, as I'm just applying some new design constraints to what I am already doing. I'm not chasing entirely new things, I'm just responding, and participating in what the latest shifts in what technology are.</p>

It is a process where I target the domain, at the request of someone on campus, then slowly spider the website over a couple week period, and identify CSV, XML, XLS, and JSON files, as well as any tables with over five rows--now I"m also tracking on the presence of any HTML form.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/12/developing-api-tooling-for-the-average-business-user-over-at-formio/">At the same time I'm talking with Form.io about some of their case studies and client implementations, working to better understand how their form-centric API solution is making an impact with small business owners</a>. Form.io lets anyone built forms, which then does all the heavy lifting of deploying an API that drives each of the form implemented. I am finding it very valuable to hear about the inroads they are making with businesses, as an API solution, because they speak using "forms"--a language that the average business user often understands.</p>
<p>When it comes to APIs, not everyone has a ready to go implementation in mind for how an API can be used to publish data and content to a website or mobile app, but a greater number of people will understand the need to fill out a form, and have it publish to a central place. I am feeling like this opens up an opportunity to educate the normals about APIs, when it is done in the service of form submissions, eliminating PDF, or even the printed form.</p>
<p><a href="http://low.hanging.fruit.apievangelist.com/">I am adding forms to my list of how I identify low hanging fruit for APIs</a>.

<p>I spend my days mapping out the API life cycle, <a href="http://apievangelist.com">keeping track of what I consider to be the 50+ areas of a modern API life cycle</a>, based upon the approach I am seeing from leading providers. One area of this life cycle I'm spending way more time than I want to be lately, is in the area of <a href="http://deprecation.apievangelist.com/">API deprecation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I conduct my API research in the way that I do, because when people approach me for advice, guidance, or brain dump in any of these areas, I have a wealth of resources I can pull from. Sadly I have a couple of folks ask me for input on what I'd consider to be a good approach to individual API deprecation, as well as entire company, platform, and API deprecation.</p>
<p>Sadly, there very few "good approaches" to shutting down your APIs in the wild. Luckily there are quite a number of very bad approaches available, that we can reverse engineer, and begin putting together a scaffolding for what might be some possible best practices, when it comes to API deprecation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went through <a href="http://deprecation.apievangelist.com/news/">what I had curated as part of my API deprecation research</a>, and assembled these common building blocks:</p>
<p><strong>Types</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individual API Endpoints -</strong> Looking to have a plan for the deprecation of individual APIs, or sets of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Individual API Tooling -</strong> An approach to how you deprecate one of the client solutions available on API platform.</li>
<li><strong>Entire Platform Shutdown - </strong>What is the plan for an entire platform shutdown, ceasing all API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Enter Platform Safe Mode -</strong> What is the plan for just putting the platform into safe mode, and still operating.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Runway</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Expectation Set -</strong> What expectations are, or have been set early on in the API design, and deployment parts of the life cycle when it comes to API deprecation.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Department -</strong> What legally has been provided in terms of service, privacy policy, and other parts of the legal department for a platform.</li>
<li><strong>First Decision -</strong> Establishing that an API or platform will need to be deprecated. Recording the date, time, and other key details on what this decision was reached.</li>
<li><strong>First Notice - </strong>What is the time to the first external notice, either privately to partners, or also publicly to the general community.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Lock-down New Signups -</strong> When will new signups for the platform be locked down, stopping all new user and application registration.</li>
<li><strong>Lock-down New Writes - </strong>When will all POST, PUT, and other write capabilities be locked down, making it easier to stabilize, sync, and migrate for final shut down.</li>
<li><strong>Light Switch Flicking -</strong> Will there be light switch flicking, or dark-out testing, which send real world pain to API consumers, reminding them that a shutdown is imminent.</li>
<li><strong>Other Milestones - </strong>What other milestones are there that will be important to internal, partner, and public stakeholders?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Final Date -</strong> What is the final date for shutdown, requiring all syncs, migrations, exports, and integration to completely cease.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Players - </strong>As soon as the first decision to deprecate is made, who are the key players, and stake holder that need to be contacted, and made aware of the API deprecation.</li>
<li><strong>Public Players -</strong> Once key stakeholders are made aware, what is the plan to go public, and make the general community, and industry aware that the API deprecation is imminent.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule (Runway) -</strong> What does the entire runway look like, with as complete schedule from first decision, to final date -- including a communication schedule documented along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Historical - </strong>What historical communications will be made available from blog posts, to tweets, documentation, and other communication focused efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Be Real -</strong> Make sure that you are genuine in your plans, communication, and out reach.</li>
<li><strong>Be Friendly - </strong>Be as friendly as you can. It will be a hard time for everyone involved.</li>
<li><strong>Be Transparent -</strong> Try to be as transparent as you possibly can, throughout the process.</li>
<li><strong>Be Respectful -</strong> Showing respect for your consumers, and their challenges will go a long way.</li>
<li><strong>PR Campaign -</strong> Craft a public relations plan, and execute it well. Don't take shortcuts.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate Often -</strong> Make sure and email, post to blog, tweet, and communicate regulatly about the deprecation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tooling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Migration -</strong> What data migration tools, services, and support will be made available to help customers get their data off of a platform, and somewhere where they can put to use.</li>
<li><strong>Settings Migration -</strong> Will there be the opportunity to export settings, and other configurations, so that they can be applied into other external systems, either automatically, or manually.</li>
<li><strong>Data Sync -</strong> Are there any real-time data sync opportunities, to help reduce the amount of work that is needed at the time of shutdown, slowly getting API consumers offloaded to their new solution.</li>
<li><strong>Data Portability -</strong> Beyond migration, and syncing, can API consumers get raw dumps of all of their usage data, as well as any other object, and entity they have stored via API operations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Licensing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data License - </strong>How will data be licensed after things are shut down?</li>
<li><strong>Server Code - </strong>What server code will be made available as open source license?</li>
<li><strong>Client Code -</strong> What client code will be made available as open source license?</li>
<li><strong>API License - </strong>How will the API definition, and data schema be licensed for reuse?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virtualization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AWS AMI -</strong> Will there be an Amazaon AMI made available for any server or client implementations?</li>
<li><strong>Heroku Deploy&nbsp;-</strong> Will there be Heroku deployment made available for any server or client implementations?</li>
<li><strong>Docker Image&nbsp;- </strong>Will there be Docker images made available for any server or client implementations?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Github Repo - </strong>Will a dedicated Github repository be made available for the company, platform, API, or other aspects of opportunity, made available for capturing any remaining code, data, and content.</li>
<li><strong>Github Issues - </strong>Is there a Github issues established for handling all concerns, and conversations around the API deprecation.</li>
<li><strong>API Purgatory -</strong> Have you contacted Kin Lane, the API Evangelist, so he can take a snapshot of your API, for inclusion in the API Purgatory Museum.</li>
<li><strong>X-API-Warn -</strong> Using the X-API-Warn header for all requests made to any deprecated APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact Person - </strong>Who is the person (name, email, Twitter, and Github) who is the point of contact for the API deprecation process.</li>
<li><strong>Migration Partners - </strong>Are there any migration partners that can help out during any migrations, syncing, configuration, and setup of external solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Migration Locations -</strong> Are there any other existing platforms, including competitors, that you can point API consumers to, as an alternative to the API being deprecated.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Like the areas of my API life cycle, these API deprecation building blocks are by no means complete. I'm just extracting some of the comment elements that I see when I look through just the little bit of API deprecation history that I've managed to curate. The trick now, is to find more time so that I can dig deeper, and find the API deprecation stories I do not have indexed, and hopefully establish a timeline of sorts, along with some of the other possible building blocks that might help folks craft their own deprecation strategy.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you think should be considered as part of the inevitable API deprecation process. I thought my friend Mark Boyd (<a href="https://twitter.com/mgboydcom">@mgboydcom</a>) did a good job <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/2015-api-deprecation-and-versioning-now-more-strategic-issue/analysis/2016/01/04">capturing the reality of API deprecation from a provider view</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/how-to-manage-risk-losing-api-access/analysis/2016/01/19">what things look like from the API consumer vantage point</a>, if you need a good narrative of what I'm trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think this is a conversation we need to be having more often, with more API providers, out in the open. I'd like to see more platforms publish what their API deprecation strategy is, either as a blog post, or in a more formal way. I'll spend more time next week, digger deeper in the past to find some of the more high profile API deprecation that I'm missing in my research, gather feedback from folks I'm talking to about their API deprecation strategies, and hopefully evolve this list of common API deprecation building blocks forward more.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://low.hanging.fruit.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-grapes.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I get approached by folks all the time who are looking to do APIs at their company, organization, institution, or government agency. The reasons behind these desires to do APIs vary widely. Some want to do API to deliver a specific web or mobile app, while many others just understand they need to get started somewhere, but are unsure of exactly where to begin with this daunting, never-ending task.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In these situations I always tell people to start with the low hanging fruit, which means, if its already on your website, it should also be available as an API. If you are publishing data or content to your website, as HTML, CSV, XML, XLS, or JSON, you should have available via an API. The average company has a mess of information made available via a website, and the API journey is about untangling this mess, and make it available for not just the web, but also mobile, messaging, bot, voice, and other emerging channels in which people are getting their information.</p>
<p>I've been asked to help identify the low hanging fruit for enough groups now, <a href="http://low.hanging.fruit.apievangelist.com/">I'm looking to formalize it as a service</a>. My low hanging fruit process involves spinning up a web spider instance on AWS, giving it a domain as a target, and letting it slowly spider all the HTML pages, looking for the following low hanging fruit, over the course of a couple of weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tables</strong> - Identify an HTML page with a table on it that has more than 5 rows.</li>
<li><strong>CSV</strong> - Identify an CSV file that is linked to from any HTML page within the domain.</li>
<li><strong>XLS</strong> -&nbsp;Identify an XLS or XSLX file that is linked to from any HTML page within the domain.</li>
<li><strong>XML</strong> -&nbsp;Identify an XML file that is linked to from any HTML page within the domain.</li>
<li><strong>Forms</strong> - Identify any page that has a form on it, and also index any fields available with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>After I've spun up the spider server instance, and let it run for a few days, I can output a JSON list of any tables, CSV, XLS, XML, and forms that the spider has found. I publish each of these as JSON files, which can then be reviewed for possible API candidates. Ideally each entry gets fleshed out more, giving it a human readable title, a description, apply some tags, and hopefully identifying the source of the data, and hopefully better understand some of the goals around why it is published.</p>
<p>Once the low hanging fruit bot is released, I follow up with a manual review of the website being targeted, looking for common entities and objects that emerge from the top level, and sub navigation -- reverse engineering the sites information architecture, so it can also be considered alongside the other low hanging fruit that is defined. I would say this process helps identify many of the top level organizational and business motivations for sharing information, where the spidering, and targeting of low hanging fruit represents the under-currents, or less obvious organizational and business motivations behind making information available.</p>
<p>That is my low hanging fruit approach. It is a pretty crude, yet can be a very valuable way to helping jumpstart API efforts at any company, organization, institution, and government agency. If a formal approach has not already emerged out of existing IT, and developer groups within your organization, you might consider a more grass roots, low hanging fruit approach to identifying the next steps for your API effort(s).</p>
<p>With this low hanging fruit target list, and website review in hand, we can start to talk about what is needed next when it comes to designing, defining, deploying, and managing APIs. If you need help with this, let me know, I'm now doing it as a service for more companies and organiations--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/contact/">just contact me via one of my channels, and I'll see what I can do</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. Please make sure you have the legal right to spider the website in this way. I'm only looking to consider the low hanging fruit of your own organization, ad better understand how to jumpstart an official API effort -- we are just doing this from the outside-in.</p>

<p>While I am on the subject of API deprecation, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/12/api-deprecation-art/">showcasing some of the interesting ways folks deprecate their APIs</a>, I want to actually send out a message to API operators, that if you are considering, preparing (or not preparing) to deprecate your API, I wanted to talk with you including it in the API Purgatory Museum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was joking about missing Google Wave today, as I read about the army of bots, and bot platforms today, which resulted in Stefano Buliani jokingly asking about my API purgatory list.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dberkholz">@dberkholz</a> think there should be an API purgatory, do you have the list?</p>
&mdash; Stefano Buliani (@sapessi) <a href="https://twitter.com/sapessi/status/720083808603627520">April 13, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Which is something that actually isn't a bad idea. When an API goes away, I would like to have the chance to take a snapshot of what was. I'm not insane enough to think that I can take every API and stand it up, host it, and continue to operate it. However there would be a handful that I would actually be willing to do that, and for the rest I would at least like to create an OpenAPI Spec, and JSON Schema snapshot of the API. Along with some screenshots of the API portal, docs, and other common elements. Who knows maybe I can get a working mock of it up and running for the museum.</p>
<p>Even though Stefano Buliani and I were joking. I'm actually putting out there for real, so if you are planning on deprecating your API and would like to donate the server code to the API Purgatory Museum, or have me take a snapshot of it, drop me a line. I can't guarantee I'll be interested, but if you are interested in your API living on, beyond what you are able to do -- ping me. I'm happy to keep private, so we do not disrupt the order of the universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might even work out some sort of credit system that could be applied toward forgiving you for your API sins? ;-) A trade that allows you to go on with your life, while your API lives in a virtualized hell, paying for all of our collective API sins, for eternity.</p>

<p>When I am review API services and tooling, the majority of what I see is targeting the API elite, the most technical, and specialized of us in the API space. Rarely do I come across approaches that really speak to the average business person, but each time I talk to the <a href="https://form.io/">Form.io team</a> I am reminded that these tools can, and do exist in the wild.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get regularly walk through from the team, so what they do is no surprise, but each time I see it in action, I'm moved by what is possible, and the inroads they are building into everyday businesses. Using Form.io you can build forms, but these aren't forms, they are apps, and they are APIs, as well as being a form. When you are building a form, you are building an API, and when you hit publish, it publishes the API, with the form as the first web or mobile app that is consuming the API.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://form.io/">Form.io</a> gives you the capability to publish one or many of these apps (forms), and manage the data that is pushed out, pulled in, and aggregated from across your network of apps. Form.io does all the heavy lifting for you, while still speaking the common language of the form -- which almost everyone in the business world understands. I walked though a couple of Form.io most recent case studies (which I'll talk about in future posts), but I wanted to take a moment to highlight that Form.io has made an API design, deployment, and management tool--except you don't realize that is what you are doing, as an end user, you are just building a form that matches meets your business need.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>I'm in the middle of a sprint, where I am going through 50 of my main API stacks, to see what has changed, and who is still home. I'm always fascinated by the number of APIs that just fade away into a 301 redirect to a domains home page. Some projects get gobbled up by domain squatters, where others almost rise to the level of API deprecation art.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/orbe_us___Welcome_to_orbe_us.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I might get this one framed. I thought the background, combined with the message was a great representation of the current state of API affairs. Its getting harder and harder to operate an API, keep it up and going, and live up to the hype and expectations.</p>
<p>I am going to start saving more snapshots of what happens when an API goes away--who knows maybe some day I'll have an interesting collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">I was going through the list of APIs that I depend on</a>, auditing the services that I'm paying for, and trimming the budget where I can, a process that involves spending time on the pricing and plan pages for the APIs I pay for--understanding pricing. <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/apis.json">I have all of my internal APIs defined as an APIs.json collection</a>, as <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/apis.json">well as the 3rd party APIs which I depend on</a>. This allows me to easily navigate all the moving parts of these APIs, and quickly get at what I need during times like this.</p>
<p>As I was browsing the pricing pages, and evaluating the replacement of a couple of these systems I wanted to better understanding the terms of service, and licensing for these APIs I am employing. I try to keep the legal department for all of the API I use indexed with APIs.json as well, something that allows me to then navigate to the legal side of these platforms. My APIs.json index for this IT collection, gives me easy access to the legal side of my API integrations.</p>

<p>While these building blocks are not machine readable like the OpenAPI Spec, Postman, and other items I have indexed with APIs.json, they do provide me with a single place to go and find the pricing, TOS, privacy policies, trademark, branding, security, and support for the APIs I depend on to run my businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use OpenAPI Specs to help guide my integration from the generation of client code, and then load into my Postman or other web API client. I'm also increasingly used other secondary machine readable elements like Twitter users, Github users, and Blog RSS to stay in tune with the heartbeat of these APIs. The Twitter and Github APIs allow me to pull details about these companies operations in real time, something I'm hoping I can do with pricing, security, TOS, and privacy updates some day. #hopeful</p>
<p>Wearing my old IT director hat (which my therapists says I'm not supposed to), it just makes sense to have an up to date, machine readable <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json index of the APIs I depend on</a>. In my opinion, we should have real time monitoring data from my <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a> account, and performance data from my <a href="http://apimetrics.io">APIMetrics account</a>, and accurate data on plans and pricing for services, and what I am spending. Currently, only a handful these providers give me analytics, and API usage data, let alone other vital details on spend, errors, security, and other critical aspects of my integration--if I do get it, I have to go get it manually, a small group have APIs for these data points.</p>
<p>Do you have a single dashboard, list, or napkin with the critical business and legal aspects of API integrations? Or are you just leaving the management of these details to your IT and developers?&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>I see a lot of APIs in my daily work. The diverse number of ways in which APIs are being used is one of the things that keeps my ADD brain interested in all things APIs. While the technical, business, and politics of the API game infinitely has ways to keep me paying attention, I find myself engaged more lately, not just for the belief in the potential of APIs for good, but around the potential for misuse--at a troubling pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Increasingly I am stumbling across API implementations, that when I am initially learning about, the 12 year old boy in me is immediately interested, but then the 43 year old skeptical in me recoils, like I am seeing a car accident on the highway.&nbsp;<a href="https://insitu.com/information-delivery/video-exploitation/tungsten">Insitu's Tungsten Software Development Kit has this effect on me</a> -- Insitu makes technology for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).</p>
<p><a href="https://insitu.com/blog/2016/02/16/a-true-find-capability-for-uas"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/insitu-drones.png" alt="" width="75%" /></a></p>
<p>I think the tagline on their home page sums itup well--the API opportunity is at this layer of civil, commercial, and defense deployment of UAVs.</p>
<p><a href="https://insitu.com/blog/2016/02/16/a-true-find-capability-for-uas"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Insitu-1.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I think their own description of the&nbsp;Tungsten Software Development Kit, speaks well to what APIs can do for almost any device, including UAVs:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Our Tungsten Media Toolkit offers the ideal software development kit (SDK) for companies and platforms that demand flexible, superior, real-time digital media solutions. Designed by software developers, Tungsten can be used for a wide array of media purposes and applications and offers developers an extensive application programming interface (API) to operate on media from a variety of sources, be it cameras, network streams, archives, and beyond. Insitu Mission Systems addresses your metadata-rich media challenges by applying the Tungsten toolkit and deep expertise in tactical data collection and processing.</em></p>
<p>With the awareness I've seen realized from using APIs in between the back-end, and front-end web and mobile applications, I can only imagine what is possible, when you open up API access to a drone, its camera, and all its information gathering capability.&nbsp;It is exciting to think about from a technical perspective, that is when I have my technological blinders on -- which is default mode for me, as a white male software architect living in the US.</p>
<p>However, when I take these blinders off, and think about the potential for abuse in all three areas listed above, I can't help but worry for our future. APIs are a win for these platforms, and their partner developers, but when it comes to transparency and accountability at this layer I've seen very little action. Which is part of the reason I am writing about it. I'm all for APIs being a thing in UAV, but part of my motivation isn't about the drone opportunity, its the opportunity for transparency and accountability to be baked into this layer by default, so that we help minimize the number of negative outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While UAV usage worries me, I think the cat is out of the bag, and there is no stopping this type of technology from being a thing. We just have to get better and ensuring the mechanisms are in place to ensure platform providers, and their developers are doing the right thing. The opportunities for misuse is extremely high, but I am hoping that it will be something that can be reduced with an open API approach. #NotHoldingBreathe</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/">I just published the OpenAPI Spec I just created for the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) into one of my default portals</a>, which once the OpenAPI Spec is indexed via the portals API.json, I get a ready to go landing page, documentation, and other tooling for supporting the API. I have been pushing forward my API documentation, beyond the (now) standard issue Swagger UI, keeping the OpenAPI Spec core, but evolving the UI portion using Jekyll and Liquid.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/documentation/">I have a default API docs implementation, which loops through all OpenAPI Spec included within a project, and renders HTML documentation for each path, verb, etc.</a> I'm still working on how I recreate the dynamic functionality brought to the table by Swagger UI, but so far I'm really, really enjoying the flexiblity with the user interface, and overall experience I get using this approach--I know the interactive portion will come.</p>
<p>One of the things I'm enjoying being able to do, is apply additional, external elements to the OpenAPI Spec, by augmenting them with independent, APIs.json defined schema. <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/apis.json">One example of this I am calling API filters, a simple filter collection defined in both YAML and JSON, that is indexed along with the OpenAPI Spec, within the APIs.json index</a>. For the Open Referral API I wanted to provide the complete documentation, but also play around with other different, filtered views of the API -- designed for specific audiences.</p>
<p>The first entry I made into API filters, I called "learn the basics", only showing the core resources that were available via the Open Referral API, eliminating all of the noise.</p>

<p>This API docs view, gives me just the handful of core endpoints, filtering out the other 60+ APIs that someone who is just learning about the Open Referral API do not need to be bothered with when they are learning. Next, I wanted to focus in on a specific area of the API, like services, and only show the summary elements, that most people will care about when it comes to these services. I'm calling this one "services summary":</p>

<p>The Liquid driven HTML API docs are the same for the <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-api/edit/gh-pages/documentation/index.html">full documentation</a>, for <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-api/blob/gh-pages/documentation/services-summary/index.html">learn the basics</a>, or for the <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-api/blob/gh-pages/documentation/learn-the-basics/index.html">services summary</a>. All three documentation elements are also all <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/api-commons/openapi-spec.json">driven from the same OpenAPI Spec</a>. The only thing I did, was specify one of the API Filters by name, in the top of each specialized docs page -- the Liquid template handles the rest. Its still pretty crude, and I'm sure it will need a lot of polishing, but it provides me with a simple, machine readable way to filter out the endpoints I do not need, accomplishing what I set out to do.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/f073d9a8d1bec151b16a9c8e7f8cd335.js"></script>
<p>I am using schema approaches like this more lately. An approach that when indexed along with the OpenAPI Spec, in an API.json file gives me other layers, and dimension that I can apply for not just documentation, but almost any other stop along the life cycle. To me, and important part of this is that these elements do not live embedded within the OpenAPI Spec, living independent of the the machine readable definition of the API. Each one lives its own schema file, and when indexed alongside each API definition, within the APIs.json, interesting things happen--all without cluttering up the OpenAPI Spec, keeping it purely about the API.</p>
<p>My goal in this work, is to provide me with a way that I can equip the other less technical advocates for the Open Referral format, with a toolbox of documentation, visualizations, and other snippets that will help them articulate what the API can do. Since all of these API documentation snippets are APIs.json, and OpenAPI Spec driven, using Liquid, and Jekyll to render, they are something that anyone could put to use, for any API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>As I was preparing for my talk with Dan from Open Referral, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">I published some of my thoughts on the organization, and the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>. One of the things I did as part of that work was generating of a first draft of an OpenAPI Spec for the Open Referral API. To create that draft, I used the existing Ohana API as the base, exposing the same endpoints as they did in the Code For America project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last couple days, I spent some more time getting to know the data model set forth by HSDS, and got to work evolving my draft OpenAPI Spec to be closer in alignment with the data schema. To do this I took the JSON Schema for HSDS that was available on the Github, and generated used it as a framework to add any missing elements to the API definition, resulting in almost 70 API paths, in support of almost 20 separate entities dictated in the HSDS.</p>

<p>This is a very formulaic, generated, representation of what the Open Referral API could look like. While I have lots of ideas on how to improve on the design, I want to be cautious to not project too much of my own views on the API design--something the community should do together. I can tell a lot of work went into the current specification, and the same amount of energy should go into evolving the API design.</p>
<p>I accomplished what I wanted. Learn more about HSDS, get more familiar with the entities at play, while also producing a fairly robust representation of what an API could look like for Open Referral. It has way more details than the average implementation will need, but I wanted to cover all the bases, providing full control over every entity, and relationship represented in HSDS. Most importantly I was able to get more intimate with the specification, while also producing an OpenAPI Spec that will playing a central role throughout this project.</p>
<p>Next I'm going to play with some minimum viable representations, and other ways to tell stories and talk about the HSDS. I'd like to eventually have a whole toolbox of YAML / JSON driven UI elements, like the one I pasted in this post, allowing me to describe all the moving parts of the Open Referral work. More posts to come, as I work through my thoughts, and play possible designs for the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS).<!--?p--></p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/freemium.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had another conversation with an API service provider today about their freemium accounts not converting. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/22/i-am-hearing-a-lot-more-talk-about-restricting-free-and-freemium-tiers-of-api-access/">I've been sharing my thoughts about these freemium service account conversations</a>, as I work to understand a shift that is occurring, and what my own feelings are. At this point, I feel like we (providers and consumers) are all responsible for freemium not working, than it is about the concept itself not working.</p>
<p>Some of the poor behaviors of service providers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Business Models </strong>- Everything being free, and not having a coherent business model.</li>
<li><strong>No Ascension Possible </strong>- There is free account, maybe one more paid level, then unobtainable beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Card Trap -</strong> Requiring credit card on demos, trials, without easy way to not be billed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the poor behaviors of service consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Communication - </strong>Never actually engaging in a conversation with platform providers.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Accounts -</strong> Using multiple accounts to get around limitations of individual accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Drop Service -</strong> Only use the service to get what you need, then migrating off of service.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel that the concept of freemium model, when its bundled with a coherent monetization strategy, can work. However, I feel like service providers will ultimately have to tighten down their controls, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/30/best-buy-will-not-issue-api-keys-to-free-email-accounts-and-wants-to-get-to-know-your-company/">do like Best Buy has done</a>, requiring that developers get to know them before you get any meaningful API access. #MakesSenseToMe</p>
<p>Sadly, when the bad behavior by developers, and API consumers, is coupled with a push by investors to focus&nbsp; on selling to the enterprise, we are going to see free and freemium tiers go away. We'll see plenty of quality services emerge, but unless you have enterprise resources behind you, you won't be getting access to them. Which in my opinion will further shift the way software is developed and consumed, back toward the old way we did before SaaS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing many of you business folks will just file this under markets working things out. However I think it is more about those with resources actually maintaining the upper hand. It bums me out that 1000lb gorillas can offer free services to lower the bar so low, nobody can survive. These aren't healthy market behaviors or forces, it is just bad for everyone without the resources to survive in these environments.</p>
<p>Another realization I've had about all of this, is that a whole generation of developers have grown up in this environment. I talked to a "senior engineer" yesterday, who told me about his long career, that started in 2007. Leaving me realizing that many developers think free software is normal, and 99c apps is a good thing. Buying into the unrealistic, market disrupting, and dominating behavior of the Googles out there.</p>
<p>Honestly I don't give a shit anymore. I won't be writing about any solutions that my small business can't afford, and kick the tires before swiping my business credit card. Who am I though? Nobody. As a real small business, I will always spend the time to get to know my service providers, and well as my service consumers, and I will be able to find money in the cracks -- as I have since 1988. #onward</p>

        <p><a href="https://restlet.com/products/dhc/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/restlet/dhc/dhc-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am spending time evaluating the evolution of the three applications offered by <a href="https://restlet.com">Restlet</a>, as they work to bring the experience across <a href="https://restlet.com/products/apispark/">API Spark</a>, <a href="https://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet Studio</a>, and <a href="https://restlet.com/products/dhc/">DHC</a>, into closer alignment. To describe what Restlet does in my API terminology, API Spark is an API deployment solution, Restlet Studio is an API design solution, and DHC is an API client solution. These are extreme simplifications, but helps me keep the fast moving API space somewhat organized (for me), and helps me share stories that (hopefully) make sense (for you).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every couple of weeks I spend an hour or two talking with Jerome Louvel (<a href="https://twitter.com/jlouvel">@jlouvel</a>), the founder of Restlet, about their road map, and where the wider API space is going. Similar to my own work, <a href="http://apievangelist.com">trying to map out the API life cycle</a>, Restlet is trying evolve their own suite of API solutions, into more of a life cycle management solution. Restlet touches all of the core areas of the life cycle, including design, definitions, deployment, management, and client, while also making moves into testing, and beyond. I told Jerome I would spend more time thinking about this journey that they are on, and provide any thoughts I can.</p>
<p>While I was playing with DHC, making some calls to my blog API, I kept being pulled down to the bottom tab, below my API response information, where there are tabs for history, assertions, HTTP, and docs. While the API request and response is very technical, at the bottom of the DHC client, I see elements of the business and politics of APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://restlet.com/products/dhc/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/API_Evangelist_Blog_-_DHC_by_Restlet.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>For me, the features Restlet has exposed as tabs in the DHC footer, resemble how APIs are acting as business contracts. The docs represents the contract language, the HTTP tab is the details of the exchange, assertions are what is expected of the contract, and history is the recording of the contracted exchange (or lack of). What keep pulling my eyes to the bottom of the screen in DHC was the concept of assertions, which the dictionary says is:</p>
<ol>
<li>the act of stating clearly and strongly or making others aware</li>
<li>something stated as if certain</li>
</ol>
<p>What assertions are being made of any API? Assertions span the three tiers of API operations for me, crossing the technical, business, and politics. In theory assertions shouldn't just be API developer-centric, they should also reflect the needs of API consumers, business, and end-users as well. As I'm playing with assertions in DHC, I'm thinking how can we open up these definitions to business groups? How do we collaborate and share assertions across our API teams? Or possibly with an entire API community or industry?</p>
<p>While assertions are applied at the specific API level in DHC, I can't help but see the need for a library of company-wide assertions, some unique to specific APIs, with others existing more universally and applied across many APIs. This leaves me thinking that assertions need to stand on their own, independent of any single API, be portable and shareable, and always be written in as plain English as possible--something that can be agreed upon across all stakeholders involved with an APIs contract.</p>
<p>I feel like assertions will be a growing dimension of APIs, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/23/exposing-the-meaningful-skills-our-apis-possess-for-use-in-the-next-gen-messaging-and-voice-apps/">similar to APIs needing to have the "skills" required for simple, meaningful implementations in bot, and voice enable applications</a>, assertions are just the contract level promise of what an API can do, will do, and then actually is proven to do reliably. Anyways, just thinking through my ideas, in preparation for my next conversation with Jerome. Having partners that I can brainstorm with like this helps me work through my ideas, and hopefully they can cherry pick some useful items from my ramblings for their road map.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>It always makes me smile, when I talk to someone about one or many areas of my API research, sharing how I conduct my work, and they are surprised to find how many areas I track on. <a href="http://apievangelist.com">My home page has always been a doorway to my research</a>, and I try to keep this front door as open as possible, providing easy access to my more mature areas like API management, all the way to my newer areas like how bots are using APIs.</p>
<p>From time to time, I like to publish my API life cycle research to an individual blog post, which I guess puts my home page, the doorway to my research into my readers Twitter stream, and feed reader. Here is a list of my current research for April 2016, from design to deprecation.</p>

<p>I am constantly working to improve my research, organizing more of the organizations who are doing interesting things, the tooling that is being deployed, and relevant news from across the area. I use all this research, to fuel my analysis, and drive my lists of common building blocks, which I include in my guides, blueprints, and other white papers and tutorials that I produce.</p>
<p>I am currently reworking all the PDF guides for each research area, updating the content, as well as the layout to use my newer minimalist guide format. As each one comes off the assembly line, I will add to its respective research area, and publish an icon + link on the home page of API Evangelist--so check back regularly. If there is any specific area you'd like to see get more attention, always let me know, and I'll see what I can do.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and Postman</a>, have been gaining in popularity over the last couple of years, mostly because of the their ability to deploy interactive documentation like Swagger UI. However, the API providers who have been using them the longest, have also realized these machine readable definitions can be applied effectively at almost every step along <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/08/my-api-life-cycle-research-from-design-to-deprecation/">a modern API life cycle, from design to deprecation</a>.</p>
<p>I'm always encouraging companies, who are selling software services to the API space (aka API service providers), to make sure and have APIs for their entire stack, as well as speak in as many of the leading API definition formats as you possibly can. To help in this effort, I try to regularly showcase the API service providers who are doing it right--this round, its the folks over at <span><a href="http://apimetrics.io">APImetrics</a></span>.</p>
<p>The screen that comes up, when you go to add new API calls to the monitoring service is exactly what I am talking about, allowing me to get up and running using the API definition format of my choosing.</p>
<p><a href="http://apimetrics.io"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Fullscreen_4_8_16__1_09_PM.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I am given the option to manually add an API, or do a bulk import of the APIs I wish to monitor using the service. I'm given the option of importing WSDL, OpenAPI Spec, RAML, Blueprint, and Postman, which reflects the leading API definition formats, any API service provider should be speaking by default. If you need help enabling this in your services, I recommend talking to the <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> folks about using their <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> are quickly becoming the central contract that gets passed around among technical folks, and increasingly with business units as well. No matter where you exist on the API life cycle, between API design, all the way to deprecation, your customers should be able to onboard, and offboard using all of the modern API definition formats--enabling your users get up and running in seconds, rather than minutes, hours, or even not at all.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>I see quite a few rogue APIs, and often rogue SDKs, but this is the first time I've come across a rogue embeddable button. While browsing Product Hunt this morning I came across this <a href="https://scbutton.com/">rogue Snapchat embeddable button</a>, which allows you to promote your Snapchat account on any website.</p>
<p><a href="https://scbutton.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/rogue-snapchat-button.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>It just makes me sad that platforms don't just ignore platform fans and advocates like this, but actively work to lock things down to prevent this kind of serendipity from happening. Why would you want to shut down people who are looking to promote your tool? You should be enabling them.</p>
<p>If Snapchat had a proper API portal, they would take this signal, internalize it, and turn it into an official set of embeddable tools for the messaging platform. #derp</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://open.blockspring.com/templates"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/blockspring-google-sheets-templates.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One common thing you hear from the growing number of integrations and bots that are leveraging the Slack API, is all about injecting some specific action into the platform and tooling, we are all already using. Startups like <a href="https://current.com/">Current</a>, who are providing payments within your Slack timeline, use the slogan, "transact where you interact". I began to explore this concept, in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/23/exploring-my-thoughts-around-api-injection-into-messaging-voice-and-other-online-experiences/">what I call API injection</a>, and is something I'm sure I'll be talking about over and over in the future, with the growth in <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/">bot</a>, <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a>, and other API enabled trends I am following.</p>
<p>The concept is simple. You inject a valuable API driven resource, such as payments, knowledge base, images, video, or other, into an existing stream, within an existing platform or tool you are already putting to use. It is not a new concept, it is just seeing popularity when it comes to Slack, but really has been happening for a while wit <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview">Twitter Cards</a>, and chatbots who have been around for some time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm seeing another incarnation of this coming from my friends over at <a href="https://blockspring.com">Blockspring</a>, who I've showcased for some time, for bringing valuable API resources to spreadsheet users. Blockspring just released&nbsp;<a href="https://open.blockspring.com/templates">Google Sheets Templates</a>, which enables your spreadsheets&nbsp;to <em>"do useful things"</em>, and <em>"get data, use powerful services, and do things you didn't think were possible in a spreadsheet."</em> Instead of Slack being the "existing tool", it is Google Spreadsheet, but the approach is the same -- bring useful API driven resources to users, where they are already existing and working.</p>
<p>As I continue to watch the latest bot evolution, a stark contrast has emerged between the types of bots we've seen between <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/organizations/">Twitter and Slackbots</a>--a contrast I feel is being defined by the tone and business viability of each platform. Twitterbots are much more whimsical and about stories, poetry, and other information, where Slack is very much productivity, and business focused, making it a prime target for the next wave of startups, and VCs.</p>
<p>I think there is a big opportunity to deliver valuable API resources into the timeline of Slack users. I think there is an even bigger opportunity to deliver valuable API resources into the worksheet of the average business spreadsheet user. The problem is that these opportunities also means there will be a significant amount of crap, noise, and pollution injected into these channels. I'm just hoping there will be a handful of providers who can do this right, and actually bring value to the average Slack, as well as the every day spreadsheet worker -- you know who you are.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/twoodwar"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tom-woodward.jpeg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am regularly reminded of the wide spectrum of what API means to any single person. What is API, and what APIs enable, are all in the eye of the beholder, with only a handful of common aspects shared by any single group of people. This is one of the things that make it very difficult to answer the common newcomer question of where they should start with APIs. This is what makes it so difficult for APIs to ever rise to the expectations of leading architects, and API visionaries.</p>
<p>For me, APIs are about enabling API providers to open up access to their resources, and empower API consumes to get at the resources they need to be successful in their every day worlds. Some folks out there enjoy regularly reminding me that APIs are not for everyone, and they should only be used by a handful of sanctioned tech practitioners, to facilitate the technical, business, and political / ideological motivations of these per-ordained--my dreams of enablement and empowerment are nice, but they are just not reality.</p>
<p>I've heard this from day one of API Evangelist in 2010, and I'm sure I will hear it for some time to come. Some days these currents are strong, and get me down, but other days there are the small rays of light, that keep me hopeful (enough) to keep on, keep'n on. One of these rays of light in my world currently is watching my friend Tom Woodward (<a href="https://twitter.com/twoodwar">@twoodwar</a>) work through his world, after <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/university-api-workshop/">the university API workshop I did in North Carolna</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://bionicteaching.com/first-steps-in-the-personal-api/">Tom has been working through his own thoughts on what a personal API means to him, via his blog</a>. Something that has seriously turned him on to the potential of APIs:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/glassbeed">@glassbeed</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw">@dajbelshaw</a> which to me is a neat idea- the common &amp; structured is what allows for the unique/personal cc <a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a></p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>To the folks I talk about above, who simply see APIs as a tool of the API architect, developers, and IT across startups and the enterprise, will not understand what I am talking about. One person using APIs? They see no opportunity. This will always be dismissed as an anomaly. This isn't how APIs are done, this isn't how technology happens. For me, this is API. This is how APIs will enable and empower, and help individuals be more successful in the companies they work at, the small businesses they run, and across their professional existence--what Tom is doing, is API in my book.</p>
<p>This post is just a reminder to me, to not dwell on the people who see APIs as the pipes in which all our digital resources flow, but are pipes that SHOULD NOT be visible to everyone, allowing only the sanctioned class of API elite, developers, startup and enterprise to understand. This vision of API, which is quickly spreading as one popular view, as Silicon Valley continues its shift in focus towards selling to the enterprise, is not a future of APIs that I will accept, anymore than Facebook being the future of the web (OMG, have you seen the amazing things they are doing in Africa, with those poor people -- ack).</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong here, I am just reminded that there are some very differing views of what APIs are, born out of some very different motivations which I do not share. There are many, many reasons why we need APIs, resulting is some very different concepts around what an API is, and what an API can do. I just need to regularly renew my faith in what APIs are all about, &nbsp;and Tom's journey is giving me one chance to do so.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-slack-platform-roadmap-34067b054177#.xjov5i5um"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/slack-platform-road-map.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Many of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">core areas of my API research</a>, and the common building blocks of the API life cycle that I talk about regularly, often seem trivial to the technically inclined, or the purely business focused segments of my audience. To many, having a road map might be a thing you have when developing and deploying an API, but really doesn't matter if you share publicly. I'd say, with technical folks they often don't even think of it, with the more business focused individuals often deliberately choose not to, seeing it as giving away too much information to your competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-slack-platform-roadmap-34067b054177#.xjov5i5um">I think Slack nails the reason why you want to open up and share your API road map</a>. I can talk about this kind of stuff until I'm blue in the face, but people just don't listen -- they need leadership like Slack brings to the table. In their post today, they open with:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We know that being a developer is hard, and building on a platform is not a decision to be made lightly. Many platforms have burned developers and we frequently see that risk highlighted. This is our response.</em></p>
<p>They nail the the (often elusive) promise of the API ecosystem:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>An ecosystem, a real platform, is shared. We are growing fast, but no one company alone could grow fast enough to meet the amount of potential in front of us. We are working hard, but no one team can work hard enough to meet the demand that lies before us all. Instead, we are building a platform where this potential, this demand, is shared. As we grow, developers are able to succeed with us; sharing our customers and joining us in changing the way people do work. In turn, our customers are delighted, new customers have even more reason to use Slack, and the cycle continues.</em></p>
<p>They nail the reality of the API ecosystem, and how it is a shared experience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>An ecosystem in its healthiest form creates a virtuous cycle. Platforms do fail. We&rsquo;ll make mistakes, but we&rsquo;re building for something much greater. We are building for a future where Slack is dwarfed by the aggregate value of the companies built on top of it. This is our success as a platformâ&mdash;âwhen the value of the businesses built on top of us is, in sum, larger than we can ever be.</span></p>
<p>They connect the reality of an ecosystem with <a href="http://road-map.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">having a public road map</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So, today we&rsquo;re sharing our&nbsp;<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow" href="https://trello.com/b/ZnTQyumQ/slack-platform-roadmap">platform product roadmap</a>. It is a small step in equipping you to claim this opportunity with us. There are three major platform product themes to highlight: app discovery, interactivity and developer experienceâ&mdash;âyou can&nbsp;<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow" href="https://trello.com/c/LqzgzTJq/20-welcome-to-the-slack-platform-roadmap-read-more-here">see more on this card.</a></em></p>
<p>Slack doesn't stop there, and throw in having a idea showcase to help as well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We&rsquo;re also sharing what we&rsquo;re calling an&nbsp;<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow" href="https://trello.com/b/HPpcIqd8/slack-app-ideaboard"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Ideaboard</em></a> &mdash;âa list of useful ideas that could be built into Slack apps per conversations we&rsquo;ve had with our customers. [...]&nbsp;The goal of the Ideaboard is to continue this momentum by creating a bridge between our developer community and our customers&rsquo; needs.</em></p>
<p>As Slack mentions, this won't be perfect. They don't have all the answers. A public road map and idea board &nbsp;might not ultimately make or break Slack as a platform, or ensure the community continues to evolve as a full blown ecosystem. Shit can go wrong at any point, but having a public road map, and active, truly contributing idea board, will go a long way to contributing to positive outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you aren't allowing input from your API community into your road map, truly considering this input as you craft your road map, and then share the resulting plan with your community, how can you ever expect them to stay in sync? It doesn't mean that Slack will listen to everything, and every developers opinion will be included in the road map. It will however, put Slack into a more open state of mind, and go a long way to set the right tone in the API ecosystem, building trust with the individuals and business who are building on their platform.</p>
<p>What tone has been set in the community around the APIs you provide? What is the tone in the communities you exist in as an API consumer?&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-manage-operations.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is pretty easy to design, define, and deploy APIs these days, and I get a number of folks who approach me with questions about how to get going with the operations and management side of things. While each company, and API provider, will have different needs, I have a general list of the common building blocks used by the leading API providers I track on across the API sector.</p>
<p>So that I have an up to date URL to share with a couple of my partners in crime, I wanted to organize some of the common building blocks across <a href="http://apievangelist.com">my almost 50 areas of API research</a>, into a single list, that can be considered when anyone is planning on deploying an API. For this guide, I wanted to touch on some of the building blocks you should consider as part of your central API developer portal, documentation, and other elements of the management and operations, what I feel should be a minimum viable presence for successful API providers.</p>
<p><strong>Taking API Inventory</strong><br />Taking inventory of what web services, and APIs may already exist, be in use, or are available within an organization, providing a master catalog of current resources, that can be put to use, and evolved.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal APIs -&nbsp;</strong>What existing APIs are in operation and use by internal groups?</li>
<li><strong>Public APIs -&nbsp;</strong>What public APIs are currently available for use?</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>On Boarding</strong></span><br />What is the process for on-boarding of new users? Walk through what a new user will experience, looking at each step from landing on home page, to having what I need to make my own API call. Reduce as much friction as I can, and making on-boarding as fast as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portal -&nbsp;</strong>Is the portal publicly available, or just a centrally portal on a private network?</li>
<li><strong>Getting Started -&nbsp;</strong>Does this API have a getting started guide applied to its operations?</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration &nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Is this API available for self-service registration?</li>
<li><strong>Sign Up Email -&nbsp;</strong>Do API consumers receive an email upon signup for an account?</li>
<li><strong>Best Practices -&nbsp;</strong>Does this API have a best practices page applied to its operations?</li>
<li><strong>FAQ -&nbsp;</strong>Does this API have a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page applied to its operations?</li>
<li><strong>Google Authentication -&nbsp;</strong>Is Google Authentication available for platform signup and login?</li>
<li><strong>Github Authentication -&nbsp;</strong>Is Github Authentication available for platform signup and login?</li>
<li><strong>Facebook Authentication -&nbsp;</strong>Is Facebook Authentication available for platform signup and login?</li>
</ul>
<p>The on-boarding experience has to have a little friction as possible, and feel like what API consumers are already used to when they are putting other leading API platforms to use. Do not re-invent the wheel, or introduce obstacles into the API on-boarding process.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation<br /></strong>What is provided when it comes to documentation for the platform? There are a number of proven building blocks available when it comes to API documentation, providing the technical details of what an API can do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List of Endpoints -&nbsp;</strong>Is there simple list of endpoints available?</li>
<li><strong>Static Documentation</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Is there documentation for the API?</li>
<li>Is Slate used for API documentation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Is there interactive documentation or a console available?</li>
<li>Is <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a> used for API documentation?</li>
<li>Is <a href="https://github.com/lucybot/lucy-console">Lucybot Console</a> used for API documentation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Error Response Codes -&nbsp;</strong>Are error response codes and detail documented anywhere?</li>
<li><strong>Crowd Sourced Updates -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform allow the community to edit, and submit changes to documentation using Github, or other mechanism?</li>
<li><strong>Notifications -&nbsp;</strong>Are there notifications that are sent out as part of any change that is made to documentation?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Language Samples</strong><br />Are there small, simple usable samples in a variety of programming languages, and potentially for a variety of platforms, demonstrating each API call available via a platform.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PHP -&nbsp;</strong>Is there PHP samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Python -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Python samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Ruby -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Ruby samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Node.js -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Node.js samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>C Sharp -&nbsp;</strong>Is there C Sharp samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Java -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Java samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Go -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Go samples for each endpoint?</li>
<li><strong>Scala -&nbsp;</strong>Is there Scala samples for each endpoint?</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally samples will have minimal authentication elements, and reduce any external dependencies, focusing in on a specific API endpoint call, in a particular programming language.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Language SDKs</strong><br />What SDKs are available? These SDKs might be hand crafted, or auto generated, but should be available in a variety of languages, encouraging the jumpstarting of integrations by a wide as possible audience.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PHP -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a PHP SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Python -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Python SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Ruby -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Ruby SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Node.js -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Node.js SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>C Sharp -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a C Sharp SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Java -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Java SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Go -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Go SDK for the API?</li>
<li><strong>Scala -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Scala SDK for the API?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is getting more common for API providers to use an SDK generation service, using the machine readable definitions of APIs as the contract to follow. Even with the overhead of SDK generation, development, and support, they are still widely used to help speed up application and system integration.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mobile Solutions</strong><br />There are many overlaps with mobile in the regular SDK portion of this research, but some providers are publishing more resources specifically dedicated to the support of mobile integrations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a page dedicated to the platforms mobile integration resources?</li>
<li><strong>iOS SDK -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an IOS SDK?</li>
<li><strong>Android SDK -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an Android SDK?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Not all platforms will need to support mobile integrations, but the growing number of APIs being deployed, are deploy to support mobile efforts. There are a number of other considerations, but these three areas represent the minimum viable considerations.</p>
<p><strong>Code Management</strong><br />What resources are available for managing code across the platform. This are focuses on just the services, tooling, and process associated with code management, not always the code itself.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Page -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a page in the portal dedicate to the code available for a platform?</li>
<li><strong>Github -&nbsp;</strong>Is Github used to manage code that is part of API operations?</li>
<li><strong>Application Gallery -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an application gallery available for applications that are built on top of the API?</li>
<li><strong>Open Source -&nbsp;</strong>Are there open source code, and applications available as part of API operations?</li>
<li><strong>Community Supported Libraries -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform accept and list community supported libraries?</li>
</ul>
<p>Github should play a central role in the code management of any modern API platform. Much like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn will play important role in your communication and support efforts, Github is key to the management of code resources at all levels of operations.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Service Support</strong><br />What support services are available 24/7, that developers can take advantage of without requiring the direct assistance of platform operators.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forum -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a forum available that provides self service support options?</li>
<li><strong>Forum RSS -&nbsp;</strong>Does the forum have an RSS feed?</li>
<li><strong>Stack Overflow -&nbsp;</strong>Is Stack Overflow used as part of the support strategy for the platform?</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge base</strong> - What sort of content directory and knowledge base is available to search and browse?</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-service support is always present in the successful API platforms. Like the web, APIs are a 24/7 operations, and if developers cannot get direct support 24/7, there should be a wealth of self-service items available.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Direct Support</strong><br />What support services are available that developers can take advantage of, that involves direct employee attention. Even though APIs should be self-service as makes sense, direct support will always play an important role in setting the tone for the community.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an email for API consumers to receive direct support?</li>
<li><strong>Contact Form -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an contact form for API consumers to receive direct support?</li>
<li><strong>Phone -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a phone number available for API consumers to receive direct support?</li>
<li><strong>Ticket System -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a ticketing system available for API consumers to receive direct support?</li>
<li><strong>Social -&nbsp;</strong>Is community support also offered via existing social network profiles and channels?</li>
<li><strong>Office Hours -&nbsp;</strong>Are office hours available, and posted for API consumers to take advantage of?</li>
<li><strong>Calendar -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a calendar of events for office hours, and other support related events?</li>
<li><strong>Paid Support Plans -&nbsp;</strong>Are there paid support plan options available for the platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are a business, and you have to provide support. Many savvy API consumers will browse the blog, Twitter account, and other support channels looking for the right amount of activity, and assistance present -- if its not there, they'll move on.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Road Map</strong>&nbsp;<br />How are we planning, and communicating updates to the platform? Providing a map of how things have changed across the platform, from versioning of the API itself, to even documentation, and other aspects of platform operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Road Map -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a road map shared with API consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Idea Submission -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers and partners submit ideas for inclusion in the road map?</li>
</ul>
<p>A road map plays a critical role as sort of value or joint where platform provider and platform consumer engage. It pushed the provider to consider ideas from the community, bringing the platform closer in alignment with consumers, and goes long way in building trust with the community.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Platform Status</strong><br />What is currently happening on an API platform, providing a real time heart beat of the current status of API resources. There are a handful of common elements platforms use to stay in tune with their platform operations, while also sharing with the community.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Status Dashboard -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a status dashboard available to API consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Status RSS -&nbsp;</strong>Does the status dashboard have an RSS feed?</li>
<li><strong>Status History -&nbsp;</strong>Is status history archived, and available for review alongside the current status?</li>
</ul>
<p>When done right, platform status shared with the community, can send the important signal on a regular basis, that all is well on a platform. Something that will be echoed across the platform, and social web, eventually reaching others who might eventually be new consumers.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change Log</strong><br />What has already happened with a platform, providing a single archive of all changes made to the platform, for consumers to review at any time, in an easy to find location.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change Log -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a change log available for API consumers to review, to better understand what changes have been made?</li>
<li><strong>RSS Feed -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an RSS feed for the platform change log, allowing users to subscribe to changes as they are made?</li>
<li><strong>Notifications -&nbsp;</strong>Notifications about changes to the road map, and status of overall operations that will impact API consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Emails -&nbsp;</strong>Are email notifications sent to API consumers where there is a change in the roadmap or status of API platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>An active change log is one of the clear signs that a platform is active, and something you can depend on. The record that exists across a platforms road map, status, and change log will help set the tone for an API community. A platform where these elements are missing, or has big gaps in information, or out of sync, are all signs of other wider illnesses that may exist across platform operations.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Communications</strong></span><br />What are the communication elements available as part of the overall feedback loop for an API platform. There should be at least a minimum viable communications present, otherwise it is unlikely anyone will learn that a platform exists.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a blog for API communications?</li>
<li><strong>Blog RSS Feed -&nbsp;</strong>Does the blog have an RSS feed?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Twitter account for API communications?</li>
<li><strong>Email -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a email account for API communications?</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a LinkedIn account for API communications?</li>
<li><strong>Slack -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Slack channel for API communications?</li>
<li><strong>Email Newsletter -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an email newsletter dedicated to API communications?</li>
</ul>
<p>Like support, road map, status, and change logs, an active and informative communication strategy will set the tone of an API community, and build trust amongst consumers. Also providing clear signals of when a platform is healthy, or one that should be avoided.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span><br />What other resources are available for API consumers to take advantage of? Common resources provide a wealth of usually self-service knowledge resources that API consumers can consume on demand, as part of their API integration journey.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Studies -&nbsp;</strong>Are there case studies available showcasing how APIs can be put to use?</li>
<li><strong>How-to Guides -&nbsp;</strong>Are there how to guides assisting consumers in understanding how to integrate with an API?</li>
<li><strong>Webinars -&nbsp;</strong>Are webinars conducted, introducing consumers to platform operations?</li>
<li><strong>Videos -&nbsp;</strong>Are there videos available to assist consumers in understanding what a platform does, and how to integrate with it?</li>
</ul>
<p>API consumers will learn in different ways. Not all will need how to guides, and videos, but many users will prefer. Make sure and provide a wealth of up to date, and informative resources.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Developer Account</strong></span><br />Consumers of an API platform always need an account where they can get access to API authentication, usage reports, and other common elements of API operations. What does the developer account, or area look like, and what resources are available for developers to take advantage of.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developer Dashboard -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a dashboard for API consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Account Settings -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers manage their account settings?</li>
<li><strong>Reset Password -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers reset their passwords to their account?</li>
<li><strong>Application Manager -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers manage the applications setup to integrate with API?</li>
<li><strong>Usage Logs &amp; Analytics -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers access logs and analytics for their API consumption?</li>
<li><strong>Billing History -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers see billing history for their accounts?</li>
<li><strong>Message Center -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a messaging center for API consumers to communicate with the platform, and receive notifications?</li>
<li><strong>Delete Account -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers delete their account?</li>
<li><strong>Service Tier Management -&nbsp;</strong>Can API consumers change / update the tier of service their account exists in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Like mentioned in on-boarding, make sure the developer account acts, and feels like other modern SaaS, and online accounts. Don't make it difficult for API consumers to manage their profile and account on an API platform. There are a wealth of healthy examples of how to do this right, across the API landscape.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Operations API</strong></span><br />It may seem silly, but what APIs are available for managing API management related elements? API consumers are increasingly needing programmatic control over all aspects of their API accounts, as the number of API used increases. There are a number of API platforms that provide API management APIs, something that is easy to do with modern API management infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Management -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an API for managing users who have access to any API?</li>
<li><strong>Account Management -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an API for managing account level information?</li>
<li><strong>Application Management -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an API for managing applications that have access to any API?</li>
<li><strong>Service Management &nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Is there an API for accessing service level details for available APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, you may be one of multiple APIs that API consumers are using to drive their web, mobile, and device applications, as well as systems integrations. Allow for the automation of all aspects of their accounts, user details, applications, and service management.</p>
<p><span><strong>Internationalization</strong></span><br />When it comes to API operations, what is needed to reach an international audience? There are number of building blocks emerge that are being used by leading platforms to make sure their properly internationalized for a global audience.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language -&nbsp;</strong>Are there multiple language versions of the portal available?</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are a global resources, and are increasingly being deployed to support multiple regions around the world. Even if internationalization is a down the road concern, take a moment to understand how far down the road it is.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;<br />Authentication is central to many other lines of the API life cycle. There are several common elements present in modern API solutions that address authentication.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an authentication overview available?</li>
<li><strong>Basic Auth -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform employ basic authentication for accessing API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Key Access -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform require API keys for accessing API resources?</li>
<li><strong>JSON Web Token -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform require JSON Web Tokens for accessing API resources?</li>
<li><strong>oAuth -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform require OAuth for accessing API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Tester -&nbsp;</strong>Is there an authentication tester available?</li>
<li><strong>Scopes -&nbsp;</strong>If OAuth is employed, is there a page dedicated to sharing OAuth scopes.</li>
<li><strong>Two Factor Authentication -&nbsp;</strong>Is two factor authentication available for the platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>While not the perfect identity and access management stack, there are plenty of proven approaches to handling API authentication. Carefully consider how much authentication is necessary, based upon what resources are made available, and the expectations around API integration. Do not over do authentication when not necessary, but also make sure and don't under invest in this area, as it will bit you in he ass down the road.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Platform Security</strong></span>&nbsp;<br />The details of security an API platform. Since web APIs often use the same infrastructure as websites and applications, some of the approaches to security can be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Practices Page -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a page dedicated to providing an overview, and some times detail of security practices?</li>
<li><strong>Security Contact -&nbsp;</strong>Is a security contact published as part of platform operations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Share as much detail as possible about what is being done to mitigate threats at all layers of your stack. This should be just as much an admission that you know what you are doing, as it is an important details for API consumers around security. When security details are missing from an API platform's presence, I find it is more because this area wasn't considered, more than anything else.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal Department<br /></strong>The lawyers are driving and guiding almost all value being generated, captured, and done via the growing number of online services depend on. &nbsp;Any savvy API consumer will be looking to understand the legal requirements that surround integration, so make sure there are a handful of building blocks present.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -</strong> A terms of service that guides platform operations, and developer integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Policy -</strong> The privacy policy set for how the privacy of all platform stakeholders will be addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing - </strong>What the licensing considerations are for all data, content, server &amp; client code, as well as APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Branding -</strong> The branding requirements, guides, and other assets to be considered as part of company branding.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best API providers have a legal department that is more human than lawyer, speaking plain english over legalize. A simple, comprehensive, and understandable legal department is a sign of a healthy platform, with nothing to hide from its consumers.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Direct Value</strong></span><br />What are the units of currency the platform uses. What are the individual value units applied to each API, and how are things calculated. Most like this is done in dollars, or euros, but other units are emerging as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value -&nbsp;</strong>What is the direct value associated with an API?</li>
<li><strong>Usage -&nbsp;</strong>What direct value does API usage deliver?</li>
<li><strong>Volume -&nbsp;</strong>How does volume usage of an API deliver value?</li>
<li><strong>Limits -&nbsp;</strong>How is value maintained by imposing limitations?</li>
<li><strong>Users -&nbsp;</strong>How does having more users generate value?</li>
<li><strong>Applications -&nbsp;</strong>How does having more application generate value?</li>
<li><strong>Integrations -&nbsp;</strong>How can more integrations with other systems generate value?</li>
</ul>
<p>You would be surprise how many existing API platforms I speak with who cannot answer many of these questions. They feel their APIs are valuable, but cannot articulate the value they bring to their consumers in a coherent way. Understanding the direct value an API generates is something that should be discussed as part of every API deployment, and shared with API consumers, and other key stakeholders in a coherent way.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Indirect Value</strong></span><br />Beyond the obvious, APIs are generating a lot of value for platform providers, and consumers. What are some of the common ways to look at indirect value generation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Vehicle -&nbsp;</strong>How are APIs used as a marketing vehicle for an organization, products or services?</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Generation -&nbsp;</strong>How is an API used for generating traffic to other websites, mobile applications, or devices?</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness -&nbsp;</strong>How is an API used for increasing brand awareness of an organizations, and its products or services?</li>
<li><strong>Data &amp; Content Acquisition -&nbsp;</strong>How does the acquisition of data or content via an API generate value?</li>
<li><strong>Syndication -&nbsp;</strong>How does the API generate value through the syndication of data, content, and other digital resources?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous APIs that restrict any indirect value from occurring through tightening down on other aspects of API operations. It takes a savvy API provider to be in tune with the indirect value generated via an API, and see the big picture of what is possible with an API presence.</p>
<p><span><strong>Planning Access</strong></span><br />These are the key elements of API plans that I have gathered from across hundreds of API providers. These elements can be associated with specific plans that are available, but they do not have to, and I often use them to generally describe the plans, or perceived plans behind API operations. These are the elements you should be considering as part of your own plans. You do not have to use all of them, but hopefully they will help you better understand the possibilities when it comes to API planning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a page dedicated to providing of all the plans available via the API platform?</li>
<li><strong>Private -&nbsp;</strong>Are there private APIs available via the platform?</li>
<li><strong>Internal -&nbsp;</strong>Are APIs available via the platform used internally?</li>
<li><strong>Partner -&nbsp;</strong>Are APIs available via the platform used by partners?</li>
<li><strong>Public -&nbsp;</strong>Are APIs available via the platform availably publicly?</li>
<li><strong>Free -&nbsp;</strong>Are there free API access via the platform?</li>
<li><strong>Commercial -&nbsp;</strong>Is there commercial usage of API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Non-Commercial -&nbsp;</strong>Is there non-commercial usage of API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Educational -&nbsp;</strong>Is there educational access to API resources?</li>
</ul>
<p>Using HTTP as the transport for your API does not mean it is a public API by default, but there are a number of technical, business, and political elements to be considered when planning the internal, partner, and public access to API resources. Have a plan, share the plan, and use it to guide platform discussions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Platform Metrics</strong></span><br />Beyond the overall access considerations, what are the specific metrics that are being applied to overall API operations, as well as individual plans and access tiers. Depending on the resource, there are a number of metrics being used across the API space, by leading API providers. This layer of the journey is meant to walk through the metrics you will want to consider in your API journey, allowing to cherry pick the ones that are most import to you. Not all metrics apply in all situations, but they are the building blocks of good API plans.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access -&nbsp;</strong>Is access (or not access) used as a metric in monetization, or can you buy access to some API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Calls -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans metered by individual API call?</li>
<li><strong>Transaction -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans measured by overall transactions completed?</li>
<li><strong>Message -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans measured by number of messages sent?</li>
<li><strong>Compute -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans metered by the amount of compute resources available?</li>
<li><strong>Storage -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans metered by the amount of storage used?</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth -&nbsp;</strong>Are API plans metered by the amount of bandwidth used?</li>
</ul>
<p>Metrics are often rooted in what the hard costs are with deploying, managing, and operating an API. Once they are well defined, and you get more in tune with platform operations, and what value is being generated, and what operational costs are, you will begin to see things in new ways. Think about what Amazon Web Services has done with APIs, pushing the concept of how we measure the access of valuable digital resources.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Platform Limitations</strong></span><br />What are limitations and constraints applied as part of the API planning operations. How are these crafted, applied, and reported upon. All APIs will have limitations. Even with wealth of scalable tooling we available today, there are still a handful of areas where limitations are being applied to keep platforms healthy and stable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a page dedicated to helping understand API limits in place?</li>
<li><strong>Range -&nbsp;</strong>Are API rate limits based upon limits of metrics applied to API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Resources -&nbsp;</strong>Are API rate limits applied to individual API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Unlimited -&nbsp;</strong>Are there places where there are no limits applied?</li>
<li><strong>Increased -&nbsp;</strong>Can rate limits be increased?</li>
<li><strong>Inline -&nbsp;</strong>Are API rate limits available inline for each API in the documentation?</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary reasons for setting limitations is to keep API resources available to the entire community, helping ensure stability, and keep operational costs within reasonable realms. However, limitations are also used for business, and political goals, going well beyond the common technical restrictions in place.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Timeframes</strong></span><br />The consumption of API resources is often measured within timeframes, in addition to the wide number of other metrics that can be applied. Having meaningful timeframes defined for evaluating how APIs are consumed, and using as part of overall planning, when it comes to all aspects, ranging from rate limits to billing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seconds -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered in seconds?</li>
<li><strong>Minutes -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered in minutes?</li>
<li><strong>Hourly -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered by the hour?</li>
<li><strong>Daily -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered daily?</li>
<li><strong>Monthly -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered monthly?</li>
<li><strong>Annually -&nbsp;</strong>Are elements of plans metered annually?</li>
</ul>
<p>At first these seem like they shouldn't be included in the minimum viable presence for API operations, but in reality, these timeframes are core to everything we do. We limit API calls by the second, minute, and hour, and we often clear limitations each day or monthly, as we bill for usage or just allow the amount of consumption we can afford as platform providers.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Partner Program</strong></span><br />The communication around partner levels of access is critical to overall health and balance with other tiers of access. Providing as much detail for partners, but also potentially other levels of access is important. Here are a few of the building blocks employed to help manage partner details.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Landing Page -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a landing page dedicated to the partner program?</li>
<li><strong>Program Details -&nbsp;</strong>Are the program details available via a landing page, as well in a portable, shareable format(s).</li>
<li><strong>Program Requirements -&nbsp;</strong>What are the requirements to be part of the partner program?</li>
<li><strong>Program Levels -&nbsp;</strong>What are all the levels of the partner program, and what are the details?</li>
<li><strong>Application -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a partner program application available for prospects to fill out?</li>
<li><strong>List of Partners - </strong>Will there be a list of partners available for other partners and consumers to view?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Are APIs Found?</strong><br />How APIs are being discovered across the current API landscape. How are APIs being found by developers, and application architects at all stages of development.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Directory -&nbsp;</strong>What API directories are in use?</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json -&nbsp;</strong>Is APIs.json in use to provide meta data indexes for API discovery?</li>
</ul>
<p>This provides one possible base for the average API operations. Granted, not every element here should be implemented by all APIs, but it does provide a healthy checklist that can be considered as part of any APIs life cycle. I'm sharing this so that my partners may consider as part of their own operations, and to use as a draft for a future white paper, that any company can use as a guide in their own API journey.</p>
<p>My goal in assembling this information is to help shape what the portal, and potentially online API presence might be for an API. I also want to provide a nice checklist that anyone can just run down, making sure any important element was not considered. It is easy to miss things, while you are down in the weeds making an API happen. This is why I'm here, to help keep an eye on the bigger picture, and provide you with what you need to be as successful as you can in your own API efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it very tough to provide just enough information to people, without going into areas of the API life cycle that do not apply. This guide is meant to address what is needed as you prepare to launch a new API, but could also be used by API providers, with existing APIs and portal, but are looking to consider what might be next for a road map. <a href="http://apievangelist.com">You can find all of these elements as part of my overall research into the API space</a>, as well as additional areas, and building blocks that didn't quite fit into this particular perspective.</p>

Whether your APIs are intended for a public, partner, or internal group, there are many well established techniques, that are employed by successful API platforms, that you can employ.</p>
<p>When I first sat down to write this guide, I was going to label it simply as API evangelism, but after pulling together the building blocks that I needed from <a href="http://apievangelist.com">across my research</a>, to support a specific point, I shifted to make sure it was more of a week to week guide of things that should be considered. I wanted to share my own list which I use regularly, to help make sure I'm not forgetting any important things, and possibly re-evaluating existing practices to make sure they still relevant.</p>
<p>I wanted this API evangelism, outreach, and maintenance guide to speak to as wide of an audience as possible. To help do this, I wanted to focus on some simple goals, and building blocks that could be employed as part of the day to day, week to week, and month to month of the average API operations--here is what I have so far.</p>
<p><strong>What Are The Goals</strong><br />What are the core goals of the API operation? These need to be precise, measurable, and obtainable goals. While there may be unique ones to your situation, these are some of the common ones I see employed regularly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth in New Users -&nbsp;</strong>Is growth in the number of new users a goal?</li>
<li><strong>Growth in Existing User API Usage -&nbsp;</strong>Is growth in usage by existing users a goal?</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness -&nbsp;</strong>Is increase brand awareness a goal in evangelism?</li>
<li><strong>More Applications -&nbsp;</strong>Is a growth in the number of applications integrated with API a goal?</li>
<li><strong>New System Integrations -&nbsp;</strong>Is a growth in the number of system integrations a goal of evangelism?</li>
<li><strong>Other Goals -&nbsp;</strong>What other goals are there around evangelism of the API?</li>
</ul>
<p>These should be strategic goals established, as well as more short term tactical goals, something that should fluctuate from week to week. Some weeks, outreach at events might be a priority, while others may involve content creation, development of how-to guides, videos, or other resources. Avoid only focusing on the usual goals listed above, and try to set other simple, more relevant goals that you truly can achieve.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outreach &amp; Engagement</strong><br />Reaching out to API consumers is essential, not just to attract them as new users, but after they've registered, and as they are putting to the platform to work. Outreach will look different at various stages of the API life cycle, and may vary between your different groups of consumers, but here are a few areas to look at.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresh Engagement -&nbsp;</strong>How are new developers engaged after they sign up for API access?</li>
<li><strong>Active User Engagement -&nbsp;</strong>What does the process look like to engage existing users and get them more active?</li>
<li><strong>Historical Engagement -&nbsp;</strong>How are inactive users engaged, either to reactivate them, or verify for removal?</li>
<li><strong>Social Engagement -&nbsp;</strong>What is the establish tone of social engagement when it comes to outreach?</li>
</ul>
<p>I've experienced APIs where everything is automated and distant. You receive regular emails, and see the occasional tweet, but there really is nobody home, nobody reaching out and making sure things are good. I'm not talking about sales in this arena, I'm talking about genuine outreach, and engagement to see what API consumers are up to.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blogging &amp; Storytelling</strong><br />How does blogging occur via the platform? What approaches are being used to generate, produce, and syndicate stories, keeping a regular stream of information flowing from the platform. There are some common areas to consider when planning this portion of operations, that can be applied on a regular basis, establishing a regular drumbeat of valuable content coming from the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Projects -&nbsp;</strong>What projects are occurring that can be showcased as part of the API effort?</li>
<li><strong>Stories -&nbsp;</strong>Is storytelling a regular thing that occurs on blog(s)--with dedicated resources?</li>
<li><strong>Syndication -&nbsp;</strong>How will blog posts by syndicated out?</li>
</ul>
<p>Platform communication and support, should be done in a way that gives a personality to an API platform. Be genuine, don't market to consumers. Build things that highlight the value an API delivers, tell the stories of how and why you did it, and make sure and spread the word, doing the hard work to syndicate to the most relevant platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Storytelling Activities</strong><br />Your partners are always looking to get some special attention when it comes to blogging, storytelling, and outreach. &nbsp;What are some of the elements that can be considered when looping in partners into your outreach and engagement efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog Posts -&nbsp;</strong>Are there blog post activity opportunities available to partners?</li>
<li><strong>Press Release -&nbsp;</strong>Are there press release opportunities available to partners?</li>
<li><strong>Facebook Post -&nbsp;</strong>Are there Facebook post activity opportunities available to partners?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Post -&nbsp;</strong>Are there Twitter activity opportunities available to partners?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully you have the right partners on board, letting in the ones that will benefit your existing blogging, storytelling, and outreach efforts. It shouldn't be extra work to include partners in your regular operations, they should fit in nicely, or maybe you should be considering if they are the right fit--having the right partners will make all the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Content Acquisition</strong><br />What kind of content relationships can be established as part of partnership activities. Content generated from existing, successful relationships, can be a big driver in forming new partners, as well as keeping existing ones healthy and happy, feeling like they are getting value from the arrangement as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quotes -&nbsp;</strong>Are quotes from partners being gathered?</li>
<li><strong>Testimonials -&nbsp;</strong>Are testimonials from partners being gathered?</li>
<li><strong>Use of Logo -&nbsp;</strong>Are partners given different usage permissions around logos?</li>
</ul>
<p>Showcasing the right partners, in just the right way, can send the signals you need to potentially new customers, and partners. Make a regular habit of asking partners for quotes, testimonials, and to be able to use their logo. Maybe even make it a default requirement as part of the partner application process.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Landscape Awareness</strong><br />Every API operates within a specific space, and understanding the landscape of the space is very important to the health and effectiveness of evangelism efforts. Because APIs are very technical in nature, it can be easy to keep your head down, operate within a silo, and ignore the world at large. There are some common ways you can tune into the landscape in which you are operating, and better understand the role your API will play.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competition Monitoring -&nbsp;</strong>Who is the competition? What are they up to? How do we compare?</li>
<li><strong>Industry Monitoring -&nbsp;</strong>What industry organizations and resources are available?</li>
<li><strong>Keywords -&nbsp;</strong>What are the top key words and key phrases that apply to this effort?</li>
</ul>
<p>Landscape awareness isn't about the numbers, it is about awareness. It is about knowing what your industry is up to, what matters, and in tune with what the competition is up to. Most importantly, it is about picking up your head, and looking beyond your firewall, and seeing the bigger picture.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion Management</strong><br />Forums play a big role in the self-service, and ecosystem nature of API operations. Forums can be within a platform, as well as on existing public forums. Healthy API communities encourage, and engine in conversation across their platform, and within the communities of others. These are some of the considerations with forums when it comes to evangelism.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forum Conversations -&nbsp;</strong>Are the conversations that occur on forums considered as part of overall evangelism and storytelling?</li>
<li><strong>Forum Posting -&nbsp;</strong>Are stories, and conversations from other channels posted on the forum, to help stimulate conversations?</li>
<li><strong>Stories -&nbsp;</strong>What stories are being told, derived from forum activity, or monitoring?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all API platforms will have their own forum, with some not having one at all, leaning on their social presence, and relying on existing communities like Stack Exchange, and Quora. Even if you don't operate your own dedicated community, participating in other communities, and weaving these experiences into your own planning, storytelling, and outreach is important.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support</strong><br />What role does support play in the overall evangelism workflow. Evangelism and outreach is not just about marketing and sales, with much of the tone of evangelism being set by the overall approach to support (or no approach).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email Coordination -&nbsp;</strong>Are there resources dedicated to email coordination with the platform community, and the public?</li>
<li><strong>Email Needs Tracking -&nbsp;</strong>Are issues, and conversations that occur within email support considered as part of other activities like the roadmap, and blogging?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all individual support scenarios should be shared as part of communication, storytelling, and outreach, but the valuable ones should be generalized, and included in regular outreach materials. When possible, ask your consumers if it is ok to share their situation with others. You never know when it could impact how others will view the platform, and help improve their own situation.</p>
<p><strong>SDK Discovery</strong><br />How are SDKs discovered by developers during development? What are the considerations for making sure existing SDK efforts get found. Are there considerations for API discovery being more about someone looking for an SDK solutions, than someone looking for APIs--here are some common considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List SDK -&nbsp;</strong>A listing of available SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>Search SDK -&nbsp;</strong>A search tool for available SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>Browse SDK -&nbsp;</strong>All the browsing of available SDKs by category or tag.</li>
<li><strong>Rating -&nbsp;</strong>Providing a rating system for SDKs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making sure you tell stories, and provide rich content around API operations is more about SEO, and marketing, with most of the people looking for the solution your API provides, not ever being aware they are looking for an API. Many potential developers will be looking for an SDK that meets their needs, and the fact that it is an API might be a separate consideration--make sure code is discoverable.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>GitHub Management</strong><br />Github plays a central role in many areas of the API life cycle, but the social nature of Github lends itself well to evangelism efforts. When it comes to services I encourage API providers to use, Github is #1. The platform is much more than just code, and the social aspects can significantly benefit platform operations -- here are some of the common aspects of outreach on Github I am seeing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Github Repository -&nbsp;</strong>Are Github repositories used for code, support, content, and other parts of outreach?</li>
<li><strong>Github Relationship -&nbsp;</strong>Does the platform engage with other users through issues, wikis, and other social channels available on Github and around repositories?</li>
<li><strong>Github Organization -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Github Organization dedicated to this API effort?</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any other platform you use, your profile should be up to date, but code, wikis, and issue management should be active, and included in all other aspects operations, and projects. Github should touch almost every aspect of API operations, and playing a central role in how you engage with API consumers.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Management<br /></strong>Social media plays a big role in business operations, and is something that is just as critical to API evangelism efforts. As with any other business in operation today, a healthy, active social presence needs to exist. Here are some of the common channels API providers are using social services to engage consumers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LinkedIn -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a LinkedIn user or page associated with API efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter -&nbsp;</strong>Is there one or more Twitter accounts associated with API efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Facebook -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a Facebook user or page associated with API efforts?</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not push every social network, in every scenario. Sometimes Facebook makes sense, and sometimes it doesn't. You will know your audience better than I will, but either way it shakes out, make sure and have a healthy, active, and valuable presence on social media to stay connected with your audience.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Bookmarking</strong><br />Beyond just social networks, some social bookmarking sites can also be important to the API evangelism workflow. Here are some of the social bookmarking sites in use today, that you should be considering.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reddit</strong>&nbsp;- Is Reddit use for discovery, and sharing of news and stories?</li>
<li><strong>Hacker News -&nbsp;</strong>Is Hacker News used for discovery, and sharing of news and stories?</li>
<li><strong>Product Hunt -&nbsp;</strong>Is Reddit use for discovery, and sharing of new products, services, and tooling?</li>
</ul>
<p>Like other channels, these bookmarking sites are not just one way channels to share links out. The management of profiles, engagement with other users, and discovery of new sites, applications, APIs, and other interesting elements is a required part of the dance.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable Tools</strong><br />There are some embeddable tooling that are being employed by API providers making content, data, and other resources available across the web. Some embeddable solutions require a separate JavaScript API, but many leverage the fact that APIs use the web, providing some simple approaches to embedding the value APIs generate within websites, web, mobile, and device applications.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Widgets -&nbsp;</strong>Are there widgets available for consumers to embed on websites, that uses the API?</li>
<li><strong>Buttons -&nbsp;</strong>Are there buttons available for consumers to embed on websites, that uses the API?</li>
<li><strong>Badges -&nbsp;</strong>Are there badges available for consumers to embed on websites, that uses the API?</li>
<li><strong>Bookmarklet -&nbsp;</strong>Are there bookmarklets available for consumers to embed on websites, that uses the API?</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about what the Facebook Connect, and Twitter share buttons have done to bring new users, and awareness of these social platforms. Embeddable tooling should always considered as part of API outreach, providing simple, embeddable goodies that anyone can use, allowing the community share the load when it comes to outreach.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reporting</strong><br />How are evangelism activities being reported upon. Reporting isn't just for your bosses and management. Reporting helps everyone involved better understand the day to day, and month to month details, and helps keep efforts organized. What are some of the common approaches to reporting on API evangelism efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activity By Group -&nbsp;</strong>What are the activities going on around evangelism, broken down by group?</li>
<li><strong>New Registrations -&nbsp;</strong>What do new registrations look like?</li>
<li>Number of Applications -&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Volume of Calls -&nbsp;</strong>What does API activity look like in general, but the number of calls?</li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting should reflect your goals for outreach, and day to day operations. Why are we doing this? Are the goals and outcomes lining up? In addition to internal reporting, and sharing among key stakeholders like partners, consider what should also be shared with the API community, and the public at large.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Events &amp; Gatherings</strong><br />Events are the in-person, retail face of any API platform. While much work can be done in an online environment, also make sure you are available at events where API consumers will already be. There are a number of proven types events, that work for API evangelism.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conferences -&nbsp;</strong>What conferences are being attended, spoken at, and sponsored?</li>
<li><strong>Meetups -&nbsp;</strong>What local Meetups are being attended, spoken at, and sponsored?</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons -&nbsp;</strong>What hackathons are being attended, presented, sponsored, or put on?</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be easy to spend a lot of money in this area, in an effort to be everywhere. A successful, in-person API outreach strategy, is always in sync with a robust, active, online presence. &nbsp;Make sure you efforts here are genuine, and in alignment with the other virtual elements discussed here.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Internal Focus</strong><br />Evangelism is not just an external thing. How is the platform being evangelized internally, even for publicly available APIs. Internal evangelism is very important for maintaining trust, and the continuation of the funding necessary to operate. There are some common patterns I've seen to help stimulate internal involvement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong>&nbsp;- What sort of storytelling about platform gets told internally with leaders, and other stakeholders?</li>
<li><strong>Participation -&nbsp;</strong>What sort of participation internally occurs to get people involved in platform operations?</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons</strong> - Similar to the public hackathon movement, internal hackathons are increasingly a thing.</li>
<li><strong>Process Jams </strong>- Instead of gatherings to build applications, some folks are coming together to just improve on the process.</li>
<li><strong>Brown Bag Lunches -</strong> Gathering people together to just talk, can be a powerful thing, helping educate and spread the word.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting -&nbsp;</strong>What kind of reporting happens internally, keeping people in tune with what is going on with the platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the number one reasons I see APIs fail. From a lack of internal engagement. The most successful APIs I've seen enjoy wide support internally, and are owned beyond just a single group. A lack of internal buy-in, the necessary investment and resources that are required for success, will kill the even best planned API.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Are APIs Found?<br /></strong>How APIs are being discovered across the current API landscape. How are APIs being found by developers, and application architects at all stages of development. Are APIs being shared in a way that they will be found by developers, and the people who will need them most.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Directory -&nbsp;</strong>What API directories are in use?</li>
<li><strong>IDE Integration -</strong> Are APIs available in common IDE platforms?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether they are internal, or public, APIs shouldn't be hard to find. They should be browseable, searchable, and available where the consumers will exist. They should be woven into all other areas discussed in this guide, opening up the opportunity for engagement across all aspects of outreach and engagement.</p>
<p><strong>API Definition Formats</strong><br />A machine readable specification is designed to assist in the area of API discovery. This allows APIs, and their supporting operations to be described in a way that can ingested, and indexed by API search engines, and directories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs.json -&nbsp;</strong>Is APIs.json in use to provide meta data indexes for API discovery?</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Spec</strong> - Are API definitions available to understand what APIs do.</li>
</ul>
<p>These formats make APIs discoverable by other systems, and tools, but also open them up for sharing, collaboration, and syndication. Think of these API definitions like little machine readable business cards, that can be left anywhere for potential consumers to find.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Directories</strong><br />Next up, are some API directories that exist publicly, and provide directories that developers can browse, and search for APIs by keywords. There are a handful of examples of available when it comes to relevant API directories you should be considering today.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ProgrammableWeb -&nbsp;</strong>Are internal users aware of ProgrammableWeb, and do they put it to use?</li>
<li><strong>Mashape -&nbsp;</strong>Are internal users aware of Mashape, and do they put it to use?</li>
<li><strong>APIs.guru -&nbsp;</strong>Are the API definitions available in APIs.guru the Wikipedia for APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>This are is meant to serve the public APIs that are embarking on this journey. These are the leading API directories out there, that allow API platforms to list their APIs, and benefit from discovery, and other network effects these platforms bring to the table.</p>
<p><strong>API Search Engines</strong><br />Beyond just API directories, there are also a new breed of API search engines emerging, that allow for API discovery that goes beyond just static API browsing and search. Currently there is just one API search engine.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs.io -&nbsp;</strong>Are all public APIs registered with the APIs.io search engine?</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrasting API directories, API search engines allow you to maintain the control over the index for APIs that are included in their collections. Eventually open API directories will allow for new ways of API discovery, via fast growing channels like via IDE, spreadsheets, messaging, and other platforms where API consumers are already operating.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business Directories</strong><br />Business directories that allow for additional information related to APIs, as well as having APIs themselves, allowing for discovery of APIs from companies who list themselves in these directories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crunchbase -&nbsp;</strong>Is the business and its public APIs documented with Crunchbase?</li>
<li><strong>AngelList -&nbsp;</strong>Is the business and its public APIs documented with AngelList?</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are hot in the startup, and business arena. Many other companies pay attention to these business directories looking for interesting API implementations. A healthy, active presence in these space can help in the evangelism and outreach process, and help you be more aware of some of things going on in the space.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>I have compiled this list from the evangelism efforts I've helped craft in the past, from keeping an eye on the activities of other evangelists, as well as use as list to cherry pick tasks each day, and week, as part of my own API Evangelist network of sites and APIs. When I am looking for something to do, that will help engage my existing audience, as well as bring in new folks--I work from this list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, i'm opting to focus on more on a digital presence for my operations, but only after five years of heavy, on the road evangelism, as well as maintaining the projects, and storytelling that I do regularly. Consumption of my APIs isn't my #1 priority, as this isn't my main way of generating revenue, but in 2016 this will slowly be shifting--in addition to evangelizing the API efforts of others, I will be stepping up the evangelism of my own APIs, further expanding this evangelism, outreach, and maintenance strategy.</p>
<p>Hopefully this guide provides you with some ideas for how you can formalize your own approach to getting the word out about your API. Whether you are evangelizing them publicly, stimulating partner interest, or making them known within internal groups, you should be able to find something here you can get to work on. After five years of beating my own drum in these ways, I can say that some weeks you will have highs, other times you will experience lows, but if you keep doing consistently, in a genuine way, it will pay off.</p>

<p><a href="http://api.report/">I process many press releases to feed the of API.Report beast</a>. The primary reason I do this work each week, is to identify new APIs, being done in interesting business sectors. One common thing I see, is companies that reference their API in their press release, and when I head over to their website -- no API, or information to be found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, I only spend about 30-60 seconds looking for a link to a dedicated API area, but its pretty clear that people either haven't though making it accessible, or are holding their cards close to their chest. I'm sure there are a whole spectrum of reasons why people do this, but it just doesn't make sense for you to talk publicly about your API, while also making it so difficult to learn more--it is not very API-like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm all for companies intelligently approaching how they tailor API efforts, but if its something you are showcasing as a selling point in your PR, you should also be making it easy for us analysts, bloggers, and potential customers to get additional information, without asking for help. If I can't find a dedicated API portal, and easily discover information about what an API does, I won't add it to my queue of research, and stories -- I'm sure this is the case for other tech writers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Apr 2016</span>

<p>As I study the approach of bot, and messaging platform integrations like <a href="https://current.com/">Current</a>, I keep thinking about the potential for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/23/exploring-my-thoughts-around-api-injection-into-messaging-voice-and-other-online-experiences/">API injection</a> at this layer of messaging. In this scenario I am thinking about Slack, and how you <a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/formatting">craft messages</a>, approach <a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/unfurling">the unfurling of links</a>, and <a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments">customize attachments</a>.</p>
<p>I am envisioning a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview">Twitter Cards</a>, but a more open approach, that can help companies deliver nice looking, well designed, and media rich messages that deliver what messaging users are looking for. The service would be cross platform, allowing me to design for Twitter Cards, Slack Messages, or any other messaging platform that finds its 15 minutes of tech fame. With just a little bit of exploration of how to craft a good looking, and functional Slack message, I can see this being a full time job for someone.</p>
<p>When building my own messaging integration or bot solutions is to not vomit up any text, images, or functionality into people's message timeline. I would like to understand how to deliver exactly what they need, in a visually appealing way. Like every other channel I've developed a competency around, I want to understand the best approaches employed by the savviest of the channel operators, and if I can encourage them to offer their solutions as a service, I will. I don't have the time or patience to master every channel (ie. mobile), and will gladly pay for the right service that actually helps me do this right.</p>
<p>If you are working on any simple solutions that touch on helping inject API resources, and craft them into meaningful messages and experiences, via platforms like Slack, let me know. If you aren't, but want to do as startup, get going, send me a beta invite, and I'll make sure you have my address so you can send the royalty checks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has been acceptable for integration platform as a service providers (iPaaS) like IFTT and Zapier to focus on delivering the end-solutions that their consumers have needed, and requiring them to visit your domain to discover and then make the magic happen. While I have always been an advocate for more accessibility, I have to admin that the current "closed" approach <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has</span> brought a number of new people to the world of APIs, as people realize that IFTTT and Zapier are possible because of APIs!</p>
<p>However to me, it is a no-brainer that if you build a business on top of public APIs, you should pay it forward by providing an API, but I understand many of you startups follow a different philosophy than I do. One that is more about trapping, locking up, and owning these activities. You wouldn't want someone building on what you've done via an API, and potentially offering more value than you do!! Kind of like you did. No we wouldn't want to do that. Derp! #SelfishBusiness</p>
<p>As I see it, the altruistic reasons for offering an API if you are an API integration service providers are being pushed aside, for more business centric reasons, that these startups will have to take notice of. If you do not provide API access to your API driven recipes, they will not be available to discover, and execute for the growing number of bot enabled solutions we are seeing emerge. Your really useful iPaaS recipes will not play a role in this new bot driven phase of API consumption, and be left in the ditch of yesterdays tech.</p>
<p>If you are an iPaaS provider, please make your recipes discoverable, and executable via an API. I have long complained that if I can search for recipes via an API, I'm less likely to know it exists. I'm also less likely to embed your meaningful actions into my web site or application, if there is no API for me to drive embeddable tools. I just wanted to also take a moment and point out that your valuable iPaaS solutions will not be part of the bot evolution if you don't also have an API for my bots to discover and execute your valuable integration(s).</p>

<p>I am spending time talking to more API providers, and API service providers, about the challenges they are facing, while reaching out to potential customers, thanks to the support of my partners <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a>. One of the conversation I had last week was with&nbsp;Diego Oppenheimer (<a href="https://twitter.com/doppenhe">@doppenhe</a>) of Algorithmia (<a href="https://twitter.com/algorithmia">@algorithmia</a>), who shared with me the challenges he faces in getting senior engineers to realize the potential of APIs, and the &nbsp;value API driven platforms like Algorithmia bring to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diego expressed that the biggest thing they face is convincing their engineer, senior dev, and other tech-focused consumers, that Algorithmia isn't just something new they need to add to their existing stack, and that it is more about enabling what is already in place. While some folks will benefit from discovering entirely new algorithmic approaches on Algorithmia's marketplace, the biggest impact will come from the platform's approach to defining, scaling, and stabilizing the algorithms developers and IT folks are already putting to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the content, data, and other resources you are already putting to work, the algorithms in your business life that already have relevance in your operations. I'm constantly working to focus on the fact that APIs are all about making these resources better defined, accessible and more discoverable, but when you also leverage what's being called "serverless" approaches like Algorithmia, you are also making them more scalable, more stable, and usable as well.</p>
<p>Diego said he's always trying to reassure senior tech folks of the fact that they aren't pointing out that they don't have the skills needed to define, deploy, and scale the bits of code (algorithms) that are making all of our worlds go around. It is about employing APIs, the cloud, and making your existing algorithms more agile, flexible, and scalable, augmenting your existing world with tangible benefits--ultimately making you better at what you are already doing.</p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.com/2015/12/03/if-i-cannot-scale-it-on-my-own-or-use-a-service-provider-i-do-not-scale-it">I've talked about this concept before within my own operations</a>. As the API Evangelist I will not scale what I do, unless I can find a service that augments what I already do, justifying an added costs only by truly achieving relevance in my daily operations. Little API driven algorithmic nuggets is how I do this. All you have to do as an APi service provider and enabler, is convince me of the tangible benefit you deliver in my operations, and your products, services, and tooling will naturally become more relevant.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/services/bw-embeddable.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/hello-pinboard-customers-from-linden-tibbets-the-ceo-of-ifttt/">During the latest IFTTT flareup</a>, I realized how much I haven't written about my feelings surrounding API integratio service providers, iPaas, or whatever else you call it. Something that always frustrates me in the future, as I am unable to reference my earlier thoughts with a specific URL. So while I am ranting about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/05/the-api-integration-providers-who-have-api-access-to-actions-will-be-successful-in-bot-environments/">the lack of APIs for these integration platform as a service (iPaaS) provider</a>, let me add to my list of critical elements I feel are missing from the space: Embeddability!</p>
<p>As a user of your service, provide me an API, so I can embed your API recipes into any website, web and mobile application. While the fact that Zapier does have a public API, where IFTTT does not have one at all, the Zapier API doesn't not provide me any access to what API integration recipes (Zaps) are available (ie, core business value). I cannot automatically search for all the Google Spreadsheet integrations. I cannot search for all the Twitter API integrations. Let alone embed the actions enabled by these recipes on any of my website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When preparing any list of meaningful actions you can take with APIs, <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/university-api-workshop/apis/">like I did for my university workshop a couple weeks ago</a>, I have to manually go to Zapier, search for actions, and then craft my own link to the detail page (which isn't public BTW). The response from Zapier to why there is no API for this, each time I ask, is that nobody has ever asked for that? Which is starting to smell more and more like business lock-in to me, in the wake of the IFTTT / Pinboard shitstorm.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/19/button-to-run-this-api-in-the-http-api-client-of-my-choice/">It isn't like the concept of an API driven, embeddable button is anything new</a>. Facebook Share, Twitter Tweet? I just can't buy the fact that nobody has asked for a Run Zapier Zap button? I'm just guessing that folks aren't seeing the embed opportunity, when they are down in the weeds, <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/button-to-run-this-api-in-the-http-api-client-of-m">like with the Run in Postman button</a>&nbsp;was. It just takes time for it to happen, a process I am always looking for ways to expedite. ;-)</p>
<p>Anyways. If you are running an API integration service provider, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay APIs forward by having an API for your platform.</li>
<li>Make all aspects of your service available via API.</li>
<li>Provide embeddable buttons, and linkable hooks at any point in the action.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do this, your service will become more than just a destination for discovering and enabling API driven recipes. With a complete API, your platform can become baked into the API enabled fabric of our web, and mobile world(s). As an API integration platform as a service (iPass) provider, it is your responsibility to pay the API concept forward (hear the laughter of my haterz), and not terminate, and capture all the value generated via APIs. The reasons for this are much more than the altruistic visions you may think I'm speaking of, and touch on real world business advantages that you are missing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2016</span>

<p class="p1">Here is the email I received from the CEO of IFTTT, in response to the whole <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/03/my_heroic_and_lazy_stand_against_ifttt/">Pinboard kerfuffle</a>, a few minutes ago. It looks like they've done a little soul searching, and wanted to apologize:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">Hello Pinboard Customers,</span><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">We've made mistakes over the past few days both in communication and judgment. I'd like to apologize for those mistakes and attempt to explain our intentions. I also pledge to do everything we can to keep Pinboard on IFTTT.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">IFTTT gives people confidence that the services they love will work together. There are more services in the world than IFTTT can possibly integrate and maintain alone. We are working on a developer platform that solves this by enabling service owners to build and maintain their integration for the benefit of their customers.</span><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">The vast majority of Channels on IFTTT are now built on that developer platform by the services themselves. We made a mistake in asking Pinboard to migrate without fully explaining the benefits of our developer platform. It's our responsibility to prove that value before asking Pinboard to take ownership of their Channel. We hope to share more on the value of our platform soon.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">I also want to address Pinboard&rsquo;s concerns with our Developer Terms of Service. These terms were specific to our platform while in private beta and were intended to give us the flexibility to evolve our platform in close partnership with early developers. We&rsquo;ve always planned to update and clarify those terms ahead of opening our platform and we are doing so now. We are specifically changing or removing areas around competing with IFTTT, patents, compatibility and content ownership. The language around content ownership is especially confusing, so I'd like to be very clear on this: as a user of IFTTT you own your content.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">I truly appreciate all of your feedback, concerns and patience. Helping services work together is what IFTTT does. We respect and appreciate the open web. This very openness has been instrumental in enabling us to build IFTTT and we fully intend to pay it forward.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">Linden Tibbets</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s2">CEO, IFTTT</span></p>
<p class="p3">I want to believe. I want to believe. However, when you build a company on top of public APIs, and you do not have a public API paying it forward, you do not have ANY transparency around your partner program, and there isn't even a pulic URL for me to reference as part of your apology --- I just can't believe. I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="p3">You have a great idea IFTTT. You ave captured the imagination of the average person when it came to what the API potential is. The problem is you don't have API in your DNA. You just don't understand how APIs can enable partnerships like you enjoyed with Pinboard at one point in time, and you took it for granted once you found success. I've seen many API driven companies make this same mistake.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">Without a public API, a transparent partner program, and a public communication strategy, you won't recover from this.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://openreferral.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/icarol-screenshot.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am working on several very rewarding API efforts lately, but one I'm particularly psyched about is <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a>. I'm working with them to help apply the open API format in a handful of implementations, but to also share some insight on what the platform could be in the future. I have been working to carve out the time for about it, and finally managed to do so this week, resulting in what I am hoping will be some rewarding API work.</p>
<p>As i do, I wanted to explore the project, work to understand all the moving parts, as well as what is needed for the future, using my blog. I am not recommending that Open Referral tackle of all this work right now, I am just trying to pull together a framework to think about some of the short, and long terms areas we can invest in together. I intend to continue working with Greg, and the Open Referral team to help spread the awareness of the open API specification, and help build the community.</p>
<p>Open Referral is all about being an open specification, dedicated to helping humans find services, and even more humans to help other humans to find the services they need--I can't think of a more worthy implementation of an API. In my opinion, this is what APIs are all about -- providing open access to information, while also allowing for commercial activity. To help prime the pump, let's take a look at the specification, and think more about where I can help, when it comes to the Open Referral organization and eventually, the Open Referral platform.</p>
<p><a name="human-services-data-specification"></a></p>
<p><strong>Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</strong></p>
<p>"The Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) defines content that provides the minimum set of data for Information and Referral (I&amp;R) applications as well as specialized service directory applications." &nbsp;Which represents a pretty huge opportunity to help deliver vital information around public services, to those who need them, where they need them, using an open API approach.</p>
<p>Currently there is an existing definition for HSDS available on Github, but I'd like to see the presence of HSDS elevated, showcasing it independently of any single implementation of the API, or the web, and mobile applications that are built on top of it. It is important that new people, who are just learning about HSDS understand that it is a format, and independent of any single instance. Here is a break down of the HSDS presence I'd like to see.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website</strong>&nbsp;- Establish a simple, dedicated website for just the specification.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>&nbsp;- Establish a dedicated Twitter account for the specification.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral">Github Repo</a>&nbsp;</strong>- Can repo be moved under Open Referral Github?           
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definition(s)</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Specification</a></strong>&nbsp;- Establish a representation for HSDS.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>&nbsp;</strong>- Establish a representation for HSDS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Definition(S)</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a></strong>&nbsp;- Establish a set of JSON Schema for HSDS</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/mson">MSON</a></strong>&nbsp;- Establish a set of MSON definitions for HSDS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Partners</strong>&nbsp;- Link to the Open Referral partner network.</li>
<li><strong>Road Map </strong>- What is the road map for the specification?</li>
<li><strong>Change Log </strong>- What is the change log for the specification?</li>
<li><strong>Licensed</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 License</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I want to help make sure HSDS is highly available as an OpenAPI Specification, as well as the API Blueprint format. Both of these formats will enable anyone looking to put HSDS to work, to use the definition as a central reference for their API implementation, that can drive API documentation, code samples, testing, and much more.</p>
<p>I do not know about you, but having an open standard for finding and managing open data about human services, that can be used across cities, regions, and countries, seems like a pretty vital API design pattern--one that could make a significant impact in people's lives. When you are talking about helping folks find food and health services, making sure the disparate systems all speak the language matters, and could be the difference between life and death, or at least just make your life suck a little less.</p>
<p>While Open Referral, and HSDS was born out of Code For America, there is an organization in place, to use as a base for evolving the format, and building a community of implementations around the important specification. I wanted to take some time and organize some of the existing moving parts of the Open Referral organization, while also exporting what elements that I feel be needed to help evolve it into a platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="the-open-referral-organization"></a></p>
<p><strong>The Open Referral Organization</strong><br />As I mentioned, there is an organization already setup to guide the effort, "the Open Referral initiative is developing common formats and open platforms for the sharing of community resource directory data &mdash; i.e., information about the health, human and social services that are available to people in need." -- You can count me in, helping with that. Right up my alley.</p>
<p>Right now Open Referral is a nice website, with some valuable information about where things are today. The "common formats" portion of that vision is in place, but how do help scale Open Referral toward being an open platform, while also enabling others to also deploy their own open platform, in support of their own human services project(s). Some of these projects will be open civic projects by government and non-governmental agencies, while some will be commercial efforts -- both approaches are acceptable when it comes to Open Referral, and HSDS.</p>
<p>Let's explore what is currently available for the Open Referral organization, and what is needed to help evolve it towards being a platform enabler. Here is what I have outlined so far:</p>
<p><strong>Organizational<br /></strong>There is already a basic web presence for the organization, it just needs a little help to look as modern as it possibly can, and assume the lead role in getting folks aware, and involved with Open Referral and HSDS as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openreferral.org/">Website</a>&nbsp;- Having a simple, modern web presence for the Open Referral organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenReferral.org is the tip of the platform, but if we want to increase the reach of the organization, and take the conversation to where people already exist, we'll need to think more multi-channel when it comes to the organizational presence.</p>
<p><strong>Communications<br /></strong>There is already a great presence in place, an active blog, Twitter, and Google Group. Based upon the approach of other open formats, and software efforts, there are a number of other platforms we should be looking to spread the Open Referral presence to.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Open_Referral">Twitter</a>&nbsp;- Managing an active, human presence on Twitter.</li>
<li>LinkedIn&nbsp;- Managing an active, human presence on LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Facebook&nbsp;- Managing an active, human presence on Facebook.</li>
<li><a href="https://openreferral.org/category/blog/">Blog</a>- Having an active, informative, blog available.</li>
<li><a href="https://openreferral.org/feed/">Blog RSS</a>&nbsp;- Providing a machine readable feed from blog.</li>
<li>Medium - Publishing regularly to Medium as well as blog.</li>
<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openreferral">Google Group</a>&nbsp;- Maintaining community and discussion on Google Groups.</li>
<li>Newsletter - Provide a dedicated partner newsletter.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far we are just talking about marketing, and social media basics for any organization. We will need to make sure the overall organizational presence for Open Referral dovetails seamlessly with the more technical side of things, establishing a very non-developer friendly, yet still a little more technical, developer, and IT focused audience.</p>
<p><a name="open-referral-developer-portal"></a></p>
<p><strong>Open Referral Developer Portal<br /></strong>I suggest following the lead of other successful open standard, and software efforts, and establish a dedicated portal for the platform at&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.openreferral.org">http://developer.openreferral.org</a>. This central portal will not provide access to a working implementation of the API, but focus instead on the community resources it will take to help ensure the widespread adoption of HSDS.</p>
<p>Right now, there is only the Ohana API, and supporting client tools that have been developer by Code for America. This is a great start, but Open Referral needs to evolve, making sure there are a wealth of language and platform formats available for supporting any implementation. I went to town thinking through what is possible with the Open Referral developer portal, based upon other open API, specification, and software platforms I have studied. Not everything here is required to get started, with a minimum viable developer portal, but provides some food for thought around what could be.</p>

<p>The Open Referral developer portal really is just a project website which organizes links, and meta information about any valuable code that is developed, that uses HSDS as its core. The ultimate goal is to provide a rich marketplace of server, client-side, platform, and language resources that can be applied anywhere. Some of it will be officially platform support, while other will be partner and Open Referral community supported. The central portal is purely to help organize all the valuable resources that are generated from the community, and easy to find by the community.</p>

<p><a name="open-referral-demo-portal"></a></p>
<p><strong>Open Referral Demo Portal<br /></strong>I'd like to see a dedicated demo portal for the platform available at&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.openreferral.org">http://demo.openreferral.org</a>, which can be forked and launched as a new project if necessary. Maybe there can be multiple demo portals available, meant for different languages and platforms? I'd like to see a forkable, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript version available, that can be used as a base, with some of the more dynamic aspects done in specific languages, or via specific platforms.</p>
<p>I have assembled this outline, based upon the portal presence of leading API platforms like Twitter, Twilio, and Stripe. As with every other area, not all these elements will be in the first iteration of the Open Referral demo portal, but we should consider what the essentials should be in a minimum viable definition for an Open Referral demo portal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This base portal design will act as a demo implementation, with an actual functional API operating behind it. It could also be potentially forked, and used in other Open Referral API implementations, as a forkable base, that can be customized, and built on for each individual deployment. Github, using Github Pages, along with Jekyll pages allows for the easy design, development, and then forkability of an open portal blueprint. I'd like to see all the project sites that support the Open Referral effort operate in this similar fashion, which isn't unique to Github, and can run on Amazon S3, Dropbox, and almost any other hosting environment.</p>
<p><a name="partner-program"></a></p>
<p><strong>Partner Program<br /></strong>One of the strengths of the Open Referral organization, and is essential to evolve into a platform is the availability of a formal partner program to help manage a variety of different partners who will be contributing in different ways. I suggest operating a site dedicated to the Open Referral partner program, located at the sub domain&nbsp;<a href="http://partner.openreferral.org">http://partner.openreferral.org</a>. This provides a clear location to visit to see who is helping building out the Open Referral platform, and get involved when it makes sense.</p>

</ul>
<p>Formalizing the partner program for Open Referral will help in organizing for operation, but also provide a public face to the program, lending credibility to the platform, as well as to its trusted partners. Not all partnerships need to be publicized, but it will lend some potential exposure to those that want. Not every detail of Open Referral partnerships needs to be present, but operating in the open, being as transparent as possible will help build trust in a potentinally competitive environment.</p>
<p>There will be some HSDS API implementations, as well as potentially web or mobile applications that are developed by Open Referral, with some developed and operated by partners. Whenever possible, being transparent about this will help build trust, and reduce speculation around the organizational mission. Formalizing the approach to platform partnerships, that help set a positive tone for the community, and go from just site, to community, to a true platform.</p>
<p><a name="service-needs"></a></p>
<p><strong>Service Needs<br /></strong>I wanted to explore some of the services that will be needed in support of the Open Referral format specification, open source software development, as well as specific implementations. Not all of these services will be executed by Open Referral, with partners being leveraged at every turn, but it will also be important for Open Referral to develop internally capacity to support all areas, and as many types of implementations as possible. This internal capacity will be necessary to help move the specification forward in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Here are some of the main areas I identified that would be be needed to help support core API implementations, as well as some of the web and mobile applications implementations that will use HSDS.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server Side</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>&nbsp;- The deployment of existing or custom server implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting</strong>&nbsp;- Hosting and maintenance of server implementations for customers.</li>
<li><strong>Operation</strong>&nbsp;- The overseeing of day to day operations for any single implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Services</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong>&nbsp;- The coordination, access, and overall acquisition of data from existing systems.</li>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong>&nbsp;- The process of normalization of data as part of other data service.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>&nbsp;- The deployment of a database in support of implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting</strong>&nbsp;- The hosting of database, APIs, and applications in the support of implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Backup</strong>&nbsp;- The backing up of data, and API, or application as part of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Migration</strong>&nbsp;- The migration of an existing implementation to another location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Development</strong>&nbsp;- The development of an application that uses an Open Referral API implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting</strong>&nbsp;- The hosting of a web or mobile application that uses an Open Referral API implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- The management of an existing web or mobile application that&nbsp;uses an Open Referral API implementation.</li>
<li><strong>UI / UX -</strong>&nbsp;There will be the need to create graphics, user interface, and drive usability of end-user applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Developer Portal</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>&nbsp;- The demo portal can be used as base, and template for portal deployment services.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- Handling the day to day operations of a developer portal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DNS</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Registration</strong>&nbsp;- Registering for the domains used as part of implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- Running the day to day management of DNS for implementations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>App Monitoring</strong>&nbsp;- The monitoring of apps that are deployed.</li>
<li><strong>API Monitoring&nbsp;</strong>- The monitoring of APIs that are deployed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>API&nbsp;</strong>- Initial, and regular evaluation of the security of the API.</li>
<li><strong>Application&nbsp;</strong>- Initial, and regular evaluation of the security of applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In some of these areas I want to offer API Evangelist assistance as a partner, while in others I will be looking for partners to step up. I will also be looking at what cloud services, or open source software can assist in augmenting needs in these service areas. These are all areas that Open Referral will not be able to ignore, with many projects needing a variety of assistance in any number of these areas. Ideally Open Referral develops enough internal capacity to play a role in as many implementations as possible, even if it is just part of the platform storytelling, or support process.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers<br /></strong>What service providers will be used as part of operations? Throughout this project exploration I've mentioned the usage of Github, a potentially free, and paid solution to multiple service areas. I've listed some of the other common service providers I recommend as part of my API research, and would be using to help deliver some of my contributions to the platform, and specific projects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Github</strong>&nbsp;- Github is used for managing code, content, and project sites.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong>&nbsp;- AWS is used as part of database, hosting, and storage.</li>
<li><strong>CloudFlare</strong>&nbsp;- Used for DNS services, and DNS level security.</li>
<li><strong>Postman</strong>&nbsp;- Applied as part of on boarding, testing, and integrating with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>3Scale</strong>&nbsp;- A service that can be used as part of the API management.</li>
<li><strong>API Science&nbsp;</strong>- A service that can be used as part of API monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>APIMATIC</strong>&nbsp;- A service that can be used to generate SDKs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a well balanced approach I recommend that Open Referral strike a balance in the number of services it uses to operate the platform, and what it suggests for partners, and specific implementations. If possible, it would be nice to have one or more cloud services identified, as well as some potentially open source tooling that might be able to help deliver in the specific area.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Tooling<br /></strong>What tools will be used as part of operations? Complementing the services showcased above, let's explore some of the open source tooling that will be used as part of Open Referral platform operations. This should be a growing list, hopefully outweighing the number of cloud services listed above, providing low cost options to tackle much of what is needed to stand up, and operate an Open Referral, HSDS driven solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swagger UI</strong>&nbsp;- An open source, interactive JavaScript UI for OpenAPI Spec.</li>
<li><strong>Slate</strong>&nbsp;- A static, presentation friendly version of API documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Jekyll</strong>&nbsp;- An open source content management systems used for project sites.</li>
<li><strong>D3.js</strong>&nbsp;- An open visualization toolkit, to build interactive solutions using JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have only gotten started here. There are no doubt other open tools already in use, as well as some we should be targeting. What are these, what will they be used for, and do their licensing and support reflect the Open Referral mission. Each of these solutions should be forked, and maintained alongside other organizational developed or managed software.</p>
<p><strong>Open Definitions<br /></strong>HSDS is an open definition, built on the back of, and supporting other existing open definition formats. Let's showcase this heart of what Open Referral, and HSDS is, by providing an update to date list of all open definition formats, and standards in use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Spec -</strong>&nbsp;An open source, JSON API definition format for describing web APIs.</li>
<li><strong>APIBlueprint&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>An open source, Markdown API definition format for describing web APIs.</li>
<li><strong>MSON</strong>&nbsp;- An open source, markdown data schema format.</li>
<li><strong>JSON Schema&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>An open source, JSON data schema format.</li>
<li>The Alliance of Information and Referral Systems<a href="http://www.airs.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3363">&nbsp;XSD</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://www.airs.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3386">&nbsp;211 Taxonomy</a></li>
<li><strong>Schema.org</strong>&nbsp;- Civic Services Schema (<a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/CivicServices">at the W3C</a>)</li>
<li>The National Information Exchange Model - via<a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/initiatives-priorities/interoperability">&nbsp;the National Human Services Information Architecture</a>&nbsp;- logic model<a href="http://https//raw.github.com/hserv/open-human-services/master/doc/NHSIA_conceptual_data_model.jpeg">&nbsp;here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open source software, and open definitions are the core of Open Referral. The goal is to provide open formats, APIs, data, and tools that can be easily replicated by cash strapped municipalities, government agencies, and other organizations. However software development, and operation takes money, and resources, so there will be a monetization aspect to Open Referral, which will need to be explored, and planned for.</p>
<p><a name="platform-monetization"></a></p>
<p><strong>Platform Monetization<br /></strong>I wanted to take what I've learned in the API sector, and put towards the evolution of a monetization framework that can applied across the Open Referral platform, down to the individual project level. Most monetization planning will be at the project level, with some of these considerations when it comes to thinking of generating revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong>&nbsp;- What does it cost to get everything together for a project from first email, right before development starts.</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong>&nbsp;- What person hours, and other costs associated with development of a project.</li>
<li><strong>Operations</strong>&nbsp;- What goes into the operation of APIs, portals, and other applications developed as part of integration.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Value</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;- What revenue is generated as part of services.</li>
<li><strong>Grants</strong>&nbsp;- What grants have been received, and being applied to projects.</li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong>&nbsp;- What investments have been made for platform projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Value</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Branding</strong>&nbsp;- What branding opportunities are opened up as part of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Partners</strong>&nbsp;- What partnerships have been established as part of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic</strong>&nbsp;- What traffic to the website, project sites, and other properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>&nbsp;- What internal reporting is needed as part of platform monetization?</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- What reporting is needed to fulfill public needs?</li>
<li><strong>Partners</strong>&nbsp;- What partner reporting is needed as part of the program.</li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong>&nbsp;- What reporting is needed for investors?</li>
<li><strong>Grants</strong>&nbsp;- What grant reporting is required for grants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these areas will be applied to each project, but no doubt will need to be rolled up and reported, and understand across projects, as well as by other areas listed above. Open Referral will not be a profit driven platform, but will be looking to revenue generation to not just develop the open specification further, but also push for the development of open tooling, and other resources.</p>
<p>Monetization strategies applied to Open Referral will heavily drive the plans for API access that are applied to each individual implementation. While not everything will be standard across HSDS supporting implementations, there should be a base set of plans for how partners can operate, and generate their own revenue to support operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/open-referral/pricing-mapbox.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p><a name="platform-api-plans"></a></p>
<p><strong>Platform API Plans<br /></strong>What are the details of API engagement plans offered as part of operations? I wanted to explore the many ways that leading API platforms open up access to their resources, and hand pick the ones that made sense for a minimum set of plans that could be inherited by default, within each implementation. Of course, each potential implementation might be different, but these are some of the essential platform plan considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elements</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- What are the details of public access.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial</strong>- At what point does access become commercial.</li>
<li><strong>Sponsor</strong>&nbsp;- How much access is sponsored by partners?</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong>&nbsp;- Which plans are only available to partners?</li>
<li><strong>Education</strong>&nbsp;- Are there educational and research access?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time Frames</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Seconds</strong>&nbsp;- Resources are restricted by the second.</li>
<li><strong>Daily</strong>&nbsp;- Resources are restricted by the 24 hour period.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly</strong>&nbsp;- Resource access is reported on my monthly timeframe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Metrics</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Calls</strong>&nbsp;- Individual API calls are measured.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- Support time is measured.</li>
<li><strong>Writes</strong>&nbsp;- The ability to write data to platform is measured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Geo</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Country</strong>&nbsp;- In country deployment opportunities are available.</li>
<li><strong>On-Premise&nbsp;</strong>- On-premise options are available for deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Regions</strong>&nbsp;- The deployment in predefined regions are available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Limits</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Range</strong>&nbsp;- API access limitations are available in multiple ranges.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minutes</strong>&nbsp;- Support access is limited in hours</li>
<li><strong>Hours</strong>&nbsp;- Support access is limited in hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong>&nbsp;- There are access limitations applied to specific API paths.</li>
<li><strong>Verbs</strong>&nbsp;- There are access limitations applied to the method / verb level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is ideal that HSDS implementations provide public access to the vital resources being made available, it is not a requirement, and some implementations might severely lock down the public access elements of the platform. Regardless, all of the items listed should be considered, when one to five separate API access plans. The plans should cover hard infrastructure costs like compute, storage, and bandwidth, while also providing other commercialization opportunities that support revenue generation as well.</p>
<p><strong>Resources<br /></strong>These are mostly the resources that currently exist on the public website, but I wanted to also make sure and provide other details about the organization, the team behind the efforts. &nbsp; These are a few other resources that shouldn't be forgotten.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://openreferral.org/faq/">FAQ</a></strong>&nbsp;- Providing an organized list of the frequently asked questions for the platform.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://openreferral.org/about/history/">History</a></strong>&nbsp;- Provide the history necessary to understand the background of the project.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://openreferral.org/about/strategic-overview/">Strategic</a></strong>&nbsp;- What are the strategic objectives of the organization and specification.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://openreferral.org/about/technology-overview/">Technical</a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;- What are the technical details of the organization and specification.</li>
<li><strong>About</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Organization</strong>&nbsp;- Description of the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>&nbsp;- Description of the team involved.</li>
<li><strong>Specification</strong>&nbsp;- Description of the HSDS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can keep adding to this list, but I think this represents a pretty significant v2 presence for Open Referral, as well as the&nbsp;Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) format. This isn't just a suggested proposal. I needed to think about what was needed, and what is next to help support projects on table, and proposals that in the works for specific implementations. I couldn't think about any single project without exploring the big picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://ohanapi.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/icarol-screenshot.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Now I'm going to share this with Greg Bloom, the passionate champion behind Open Referral, and HSDS. I just needed to make sure everything was in my head, in support of our discussion in person tomorrow. We'll be looking to move the needle forward on this vision, in conjunction with the implementations on the table. Exploring the big picture on my blog, is how I put my experience on the table, working through all of its moving parts, and make sure I've covered all the ground I need to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>What Does The Road Map Look Like?</strong><br />Greg and crew are in charge of the road map. I just need to get more intimate with the specification. I have already created a v1 draft, scraped from the Slate documentation for the existing Ohana API implementation, using OpenAPISpec. I have the PDF documentation for an Open Referral partner to convert to a machine readable OpenAPI Spec as well. The process will help me further build awareness around the specification itself. This post has helped me see the 100K view, crafting the OpenAPI Spec will help me dive deep down into the weeds of how to deliver a human services API using the HSDS standard.</p>
<p>Since PHP is my primary language, I'll get to work on a PHP / Slim Framework implementation of HSDS, providing a working prototype. I'll use the Ohana API generated OpenAPI Spec as my guide for the server side API code, the documentation, as well as some client code in both PHP and JavaScript. I'll push forward with some of the aspects of the demo portal implementation above, as well as completing some of the PHP code needed for server, and client side in the process. After all of this, I should have a pretty solid view of the details of what is possible with a human services API.</p>
<p><strong>A Model For Human Services API And Hopefully Other Public API Services</strong><br />I'm pretty stoked with the potential for working on Open Referral, and honored Greg has invited me to participate. This is just a first draft, tailored for what I would like to see considered for Open Referral / HSDS API, and for a couple of immediate implementations. However the model is something I will keep evolving alongside this project, as well as a more generic blueprint for how public service APIs could possibly be implemented.</p>
<p>There are several other API implementations that have come across my desk, which I've felt a model like this should be applied. I was thinking about applying this to the&nbsp;<a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">FAFSA API</a>, to help develop a student aid API community. I also thought it could be applied around the deployment of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/the-next-steps-for-the-the-recreation-information-database-ridb-api/">RIDB API</a>, in support of our national park system. In both of these environments a centralized, common, open API definition, with supporting schema and dictionaries, and a healthy selection of of open source server, and client side web or mobile app implementations, would have gone a long ways.</p>
<p>Anyways, I have what I need in my head so that I can talk with Greg, and coherently discuss what could be next.</p>

<p>I'm engaging in another conversation with a higher education institution about where to start with APIs on campus. A new CIO has assumed a leadership position, and some very forward thinking folks on campus asked me to come visit, talk with IT about APIs, and try to understand where they can get to work with APIs on campus--a perfect opportunity to get to work developing an API culture at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.davidson.edu/">Davidson College</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidsonCollege">As their Twitter profile says</a>, <em>"</em><span><em>Davidson is a highly selective independent liberal arts college committed to access and equal opportunity.</em>" Sounds like a rich environment to get to work empowering students, teachers, and faculty using APIs. Which leaves at the familiar place of being asked by folks on campus, where do we start with APIs?</span></p>
<p>First we need a place to coordinate the getting started with APIs effort at Davidson with:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/low-hanging-fruit/davidson-college">Creating a Github Repo</a> - To help facilitate the discussion, as well as store any code, data, and content that is generated.</li>
<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/">Publish a Github Pages</a> - To help provide a web friendly destination to share content, information, and act as public face.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/low-hanging-fruit/davidson-college/issues">Leverage Issue Management</a> - To help establish an asynchronous communication stream around the initial API effort.</li>
</ol>
<p>Second, let's start mapping out all the moving parts, that will be meaningful to APIs on campus:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/who-are-the-key-stakeholders/">Who Are The Key Stakeholders?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/what-are-the-campus-run-systems-used/">What Are The Campus Run Systems Used?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/what-are-the-cloud-services-being-put-to-use/">What Are The Cloud Services Being Put To Use?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/what-open-source-software-tools-area-used/">What Open Source Software Tools Are Used?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/what-are-the-bits-and-bytes-that-are-involved/">What Are The Bits and Bytes That Are Involved?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/who-are-the-key-individuals-involved-with-api-efforts/">Who Are The Key Individuals Involved With API Efforts?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/what-is-the-low-hanging-fruit-on-the-public-website/">What Is This Low Hanging Fruit On The Public Website?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone involved, from IT, to students, including myself can use the Github repo, and the pages setup to support each of these areas, can be used to collectively establish a map of where to begin with APIs. Once a map of all these areas begins to come into focus, individual API opportunities will emerge, and become more clear. We are looking for the low hanging fruit when it comes to deploying APIs on campus.</p>
<p>We will use each page of this low hanging fruit project website as a workbench, and we'll use <a href="https://github.com/low-hanging-fruit/davidson-college/issues">the Github Issues management as a communication channel for the work</a>, providing an asynchronous, centrally located place to identify individual micro-projects that can be executed. Hopefully this work will spawn other Github repositories for each individual project, putting them into any Github Organization that makes sense -- <a href="https://github.com/low-hanging-fruit">this one lives in a low hanging fruit organization managed my API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<p>This project is not an official project by Davidson College. The goal is to involve several key individuals on campus to help identify the low hanging fruit, then deploy individual projects within the institutional domain that can be pushed forward by campus IT, faculty, and students.</p>

<p>I always dig it when API stories spin out of control, and I end up down story holes. I'm sure certain people waiting for other work from me do not appreciate it, but these are where some of the best stories in my world come from. As I was writing <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/30/best-buy-will-not-issue-api-keys-to-free-email-accounts-and-wants-to-get-to-know-your-company/">the story about Best Buy limiting access to their API when you have a free email account</a>, which resulted in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/30/i-am-seeing-more-api-platforms-manage-their-blog-presence-using-medium/">the story about Best Buy using Medium for their API platform blog presence</a>, which ended up pushing me to read Medium's terms of service.</p>
<p>Anyways, to help manage the evolution of the terms of service, privacy policy, Medum uses Github to establish a historical record of all the changes to all legal documents that impact platform, and API operations. Seems like a pretty sensible, and default approach to the legal department for any platform. Hosting your legal department on Github, making sure their is as much transparency, and logging across this area of operations will play a central role in establishing and maintaining trust with your partners and consumers.</p>
<p>Maintaining the legal side of your platform operations on Github, taking advantage of the version control build in makes a lot of sense. Something that also opens the door for using Github Issue Management, and the other more social aspects of Github for assisting in the communication of legal changes, as well as facilitate ongoing conversations around changes in real time. I can see eventually working this into some sort of rating system for API providers, a sort of open source regulatory consideration, that is totally opt in by API platforms -- if you give a shit you'll do it, if you don't, you won't.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://medium.com/best-buy-developers"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/best-buy-medium.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One thing that struck me as I wrote <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/30/best-buy-will-not-issue-api-keys-to-free-email-accounts-and-wants-to-get-to-know-your-company/">my post about Best Buy stopping issuing API keys to free email accounts</a>, was the fact that <a href="https://medium.com/best-buy-developers">Best Buy operates their developer blog on Medium</a>--something I am seeing more of. As I discover new API-centric companies via my blog, Twitter, Product Hunt, AngelList, and the many other ways I tune into the space, I'm seeing more companies operating the blog portion of their presence in this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of voices in my head points out that this just doesn't seem like a good idea. It reminds me of hosting our blogs on Posterous. Medium doesn't let you map your domain, or sub-domain to your blog (invite only), but I'm sure is something they'll do soon. They don't have RSS, and they don't have a read API either? <em>*warning bells*</em> &nbsp;While I get the Medium thing, it seems like one of those neatly tended gardens, where as many roads out are gated off with friendly hand-painted signs.</p>
<p>However some of the other voices in my head chimed in that <a href="https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f#.9x8qwapqq">Medium is just asking for non exclusive license to use your content</a>. They let you delete your account, and I know they are working hard on their API strategy. Also, I'm a big supporter of API providers being as scrappy as possible, as many of us have to do as much as we can with some often very non-existent budgets. <a href="https://github.com/BestBuyAPIs">Best Buy rocks it at leveraging Github</a>, Medium, Twitter, and all the channels I usually recommend. So in the end I really can't bitch about API platforms using Medium for their blog presence.</p>
<p>When you use Medium you get the network effect for your blog presence--something I'm working to understand better, and leverage more as part of my own work. I'll keep tracking on the APIs I find that use Medium for their blog presence. Right now my only complaint is simple -- THERE IS NO RSS!!! Beyond that, I'll just track on and see how it all plays out. My advice is to still to utilize a WordPress, Jekyll, Blogger, or other hosted service where you can map a subdomain to, keeping all the valuable exhaust within your domain. Then follow the <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a> principles when incorporating Medium into the communication strategy for your API platform.</p>
