{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of my self-appointed roles in the API industry is to shed light on, and discuss the business of APIs when many other API owners and evangelists tend to keep their strategy and business closer to their chest.Many API owners don’t discuss their roadmaps, either because they feel they will be giving away their secret sauce, or quite possibly because they don’t have a clue where they are going with it.I think it’s more the latter, as we are all making this shit up as we go along.One subject you don’t hear API owners discuss often, is when their API will be deprecated or shuttered, leaving developers and tech bloggers to speculate on the subject.Because of this you tend to hear just the extreme views on the subject.</p>
