<hr />

<p><em>After looking back at 2012, I wanted a January 1, 2013 blog post for my blogs.  My first blog post of 2012 was my tour schedule for January, 2012.  While it was a pretty busy time for evangelizing and hackathons, I wanted something a little deeper.  I&rsquo;m not sure what, but I will play with the format year to year, until I find what I&rsquo;m looking for.</em>
<p><em>Every year I rewrite my bio, based upon where I am in my life.  I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 2009.   This year I will write inaugural blog posts along with my bio reworking, and post to each of my active blogs.  We&rsquo;ll see if it resonates again in 12 months, and I do it again in 2014.</em>

<p>title: ‘History of APIs:  ProgrammableWeb’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ProgrammableWeb-10-2005.png</p>

<hr />

<p>While writing about the&nbsp;<a title="history of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs</a>, it is easy to be so focused on just APIs, that you overlook the single most important player in the entire history of the web API--<a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.
<p>In July 2005, John Musser started ProgrammableWeb. According to his original about page:
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/programmableweb/ProgrammableWeb-10-2005.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<blockquote><em>ProgrammableWeb is a web-as-platform reference site and blog delivering news, information and resources for developing applications using the Web 2.0 APIs.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I started this site because I couldn't find what I was looking for: a technology focused&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2005/08/20/so-many-apis-so-little-time/">starting point for web platform development</a>. (For a bit more see my initial post.) Although no guarantees, the last time I started a reference site it somehow became Google's highest rated link on the topic. Given that this site will be a collaborative effort with community input as well, this can be what we make it.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I hope you find the site useful.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>John Musser - Seattle, August 2005</em></blockquote>
<p>I think John&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2005/08/20/so-many-apis-so-little-time/">original blog post</a>&nbsp;on why he started ProgrammableWeb, says it all:<strong><em>&nbsp;Why? Because going From Web Page to Web Platform is a big deal</em></strong>.
<p>Web APIs are a big deal! Whether its social networking, government, healthcare or education--having a programmable platform to make data and resources available will be a critical part of how commerce and society operates from here on forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>John made a early decision to showcase open and RESTful approaches to deploying APIs vs. parallel attempts of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a>(SOA) and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">Web Services</a>, and focused on telling stories about open APIs--way before it was the thing to do in Silicon Valley.
<p>When I started API Evangelist in July 2010 (5 years after PW), and started talking about the business of APIs, the technology of web APIs was already widely accepted in Silicon Valley, because of the stories John Musser and Adam Duvander have told on ProgrammableWeb.
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/programmableweb/programmableweb-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>As we close 2012, a year in which I think we can confidently say APIs are moving mainstream, and I feel we owe much of the success to ProgrammableWeb. The stories John, Adam and other writers have been telling on ProgrammableWeb have been crucial to quantifying and defining the API industry--allowing us all to build, iterate and move things forward. Without stories around the technical, business and politics of APIs, these virtual interfaces would not have been able to find a place in our real life worlds.
<p>Thanks John, Adam and ProgrammableWeb, for telling the stories that got us here.

<p>You can learn a lot from the <a href="/history/">history of APIs</a>, and following what the pioneers are doing. &nbsp;Salesforce isn't the coolest API within the Hacker News community, but when it comes to building an API ecosystem--Salesforce knows what they are doing.
<p>I was reading through the <a href="https://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/12/yearinreview.html">Salesforce top developers highlights of 2012</a>. &nbsp;Their highlights doesn't just showcase the success of the community, but what Salesforce feels is critical to keeping their ecosystem healthy.&nbsp;
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>800,000 developers and climbing:</strong>&nbsp;the Salesforce Platform Developer Community is growing at an unprecedented rate.</li>
<li><strong>Cool new Salesforce technologies:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Identity">Identity</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Salesforce_touch_platform">Salesforce Touch Platform</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_Canvas">Force.com Canvas</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/9/19/announcing_heroku_enterprise_for_java/">Java on Heroku&nbsp;</a>for the Enterprise were released.</li>
<li><strong>Content is king:</strong>&nbsp;Great books such as&nbsp;<a href="http://media.developerforce.com/pdfs/salesforce_touch_platform.pdf">The Salesforce Touch Platform Mobile Development Guide</a>&nbsp;and Dan Appleman&rsquo;s new book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Apex-Programming-Salesforce-com-Force-com/dp/1936754053">Advanced Apex Programming for Salesforce.com&nbsp;</a>hit the shelves.</li>
<li><strong>Community is making noise:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/">Salesforce Stack Exchange</a>&nbsp;launched and is already at&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/12/salesforce-stack-exchange-qa-site-reaches-1000-users.html">1,000 users</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_User_Groups">Developer User Groups</a>&nbsp;have grown to 60 groups across the globe and climbing.</li>
<li><strong>New leaders have emerged:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp_profile_andyb">Andy Boettcher</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp_profile_junii">Junji Imaoka</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp_profile_keir">Keir Bowden</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp_profile_sanuki">Sanuki Ikou</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp_profile_simonb">Simon Goodyear</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;are the most recent MVPs to join ranks of the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp">Force.com MVP Program</a>.</li>
<li><strong>We are staying connected, more often and in more ways:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/content/type/Webinar" target="_blank">Webinars</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/codetalk" target="_blank">CodeTalks</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgIMQe2PKPSJ8bIOnDSXihHEnEcgIiOfv&amp;feature=view_all" target="_blank">Google+ Hangouts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/forcedotcom" target="_blank">Facebook</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/forcedotcom" target="_blank">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://sforce.i.lithium.com/sforce/?category.id=developers" target="_blank">Discussion Boards</a>, and the list goes on.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Events of Epic Proportions:</strong>&nbsp;10,000 Developers at Dreamforce &lsquo;12 with close to&nbsp;<a href="https://events.developerforce.com/conference/dreamforce">300 sessions</a>, Developer Zones at Cloudforce in New York, Tokyo, and London, and Developer Weeks in Brazil and India.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I hear when I read this list is that to get to 800K developers (holy shit), you need to constantly release new technologies, product resources and content to support your platform, give your community a voice with an emphasis on showcasing the leaders--while also engaging with developers both online and offline.
<p><a href="https://www.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/12/yearinreview.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/salesforce/Force-Com-Developer-Relations.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>Salesforce has been building their API ecosystem for 12 years! &nbsp;Twice as long as Twitter. &nbsp;What they highlight as part of their developer community in 2012 is something you should be doing in your own developer community.

<p>Storytelling in the API industry is critical to the healthy growth of the space.  John Musser and <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> have been telling great stories in the tech industry, since way before APIs were all lthe rage they are now.
<p>While I was at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a> this year,  I was speaking with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) of <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a>, and we started talking about how Amazon, Netflix (and I&rsquo;d add Twilio) tend to dominate the API discussion.  I considered my talks from API Days, and sure enough--Netflix and Amazon were in there multiple times!
<p>There are other stories we tell around Twitter, Facebook Google and other smaller APIs, but Amazon, Netflix and Twilio were cornerstones of API folklore in 2012.  While I will keep telling these pillar stories (because they matter), as well as evolving other pioneers from my <a title="history of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs</a> section, I want to develop a fresh lineup of amazing API stories for 2013.
<p>Stories like <a title="ohnson Control's, Panoptix API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/17/make-an-impact-on-our-environment-using-apis/">Johnson Control's, Panoptix API</a>, and how a 125 year old company can change their culture and embrace a new way of doing business via APIs.
<p>I will make sure there is easy access to the classic Amazon, Netflix and Twilio API stories.  I will also be adding new versions of some other classic stories from Salesforce, eBay, Flickr and other API pioneers.  But in 2013 I will be working to find a new set of API stories from brands and companies we know.
<p>If you have an API success story you&rsquo;d like to share, please let me know.

<p>I'm immersed in deep thought around my personal data, asking some important <a href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/">questions about my digital self</a>--which includes the state of my online personal data.
<p>After reading <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/12/14-trends-for-2013.html">14 big trends to watch in 2013</a>, by Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>), I got immersed in <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_ITTC_PersonalDataNewAsset_Report_2011.pdf">World Economic Forums Personal Data: The Emergence of a New Asset Class</a> paper.
<p>I'm still processing all of my thoughts around the paper, but one statement really stands out:
<blockquote><em>The issues surrounding personal data &ndash; political, technological and commercial alike &ndash; are numerous and complex. The choices stakeholders make today will influence the personal data ecosystem for years to come.</em></blockquote>
<p>The World Economic Forum then outlines five key area that require action:
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Innovate around user-centricity and trust. The personal data ecosystem will be built on the trust and control individuals have in sharing their data. From a technological, policy and sociological sense all stakeholders need to embrace this construct. One particular area of focus is the continued testing and promoting of &ldquo;trust frameworks&rdquo; that explore innovative approaches for identity assurance at Internet scale</li>
<li>Define global principles for using and sharing personal data. Given the lack of globally accepted policies governing the use and exchange of personal data, an international community of stakeholders should articulate and advance core principles of a user-centric personal data ecosystem. These pilots should invite real-world input from a diverse group of individuals who can not only articulate the values, needs and desires of end users, but also the complex and contextual nuances involved in revealing one&rsquo;s digital identity</li>
<li>Strengthen the dialog between regulators and the private sector. Building on a collective sense of fundamental principles for creating a balanced ecosystem, public and private stakeholders should actively collaborate as the ecosystem begins to take shape. Those responsible for building and deploying the tools (the technologists) should more closely align with those making the rules (regulators)</li>
<li>Focus on interoperability and open standards. With the appropriate user controls and legal infrastructure in place, innovations in how personal data moves throughout the value chain will be a key driver for societal and economic value creation. Enabling a secure, trusted, reliable and open infrastructure (both legal and technical) will be vital. Participants should identify best practices and engage with standards bodies, advocacy groups, think tanks and various consortia on the user-centric approaches required to scale the value of personal data</li>
<li>Continually share knowledge. It&rsquo;s a huge challenge for entities to keep up with new research, policies and commercial developments. To stay current, stakeholders should share insights and learnings on their relevant activities, from both successes as well as failures. After all, the ecosystem&rsquo;s promise is about the tremendous value created when individuals share information about who they are and what they know. Clearly, this principle should also apply to practitioners within the development community</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether its social networks or education and healthcare, personal data will be a major driver of API adoption in 2013.  Personal data is at the heart of the recent social and mobile movements, and there are very serious illnesses in how we buy and sell personal data in Silicon Valley.
<p>I agree with Alex Howard, that personal data ownership will be big issue in 2013, and intrigued by the World Economic Forums insight on personal data, it asks a lot of great questions--questions that we need bring mainstream in 2013.

<p>My name is Kin Lane, I am the <a href="http://apievangelist.com" target="_blank">API Evangelist</a>.
<p>While traveling the globe, dedicating my life to API evangelism, I only drink one beer--IPAs.
<p>Coincidence?  I think not!
<p>This blog is dedicated to discussing the amazing world of India Pale Ales, also known as IPAs.
<p>Once you have acquired the taste for the hoppiness of IPAs, you'll never go back.

<p>The end of the year is a great time to reflect--looking back at the year with a desire to quantify and understand ourselves.
<p>With our increasingly digital (social, cloud, mobile, APIs) lives, there are more opportunities than ever to ask our digital self very specific questions, and with the power the API get an answer back.
<p>Over the holidayz, I spent some time asking some questions I wanted to know about my world in 2012--things that were important to me, and help me feel healthy, happy, accomplished and ultimately successful. (aka.&nbsp;<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/10/18/optimize-for-happiness.html" target="_blank">Optimize for Happiness</a>)

<p>This is all a work in progress. &nbsp;I wanted a list that could evolve, but I could use as a framework for actually answering some of these questions--either annually or real-time if possible, using APIs.
<p>To facilitate this process, I've <a title="Personal Data Questions" href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">published as project on Github</a>. &nbsp;I will be publishing all the questions I ask, and their solutions. &nbsp;
<p>So far, I've been able to use <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and answer a number of critical questions about 2012 using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Google--via the <a href="http://singly.com">Singly API</a>.
<p>If you have questions you'd like asked, you can visit my <a href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/">personal data questions project</a> and comment via Disqus or if you want, you can <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/personal-data-questions">fork and contribute</a> your own questions and API driven solutions.

<p><a href="https://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/earth-as-art/desolation-canyon.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>I was scrolling through my feeds today and I came across, "<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/earth_art_detail.html">Earth As Art</a>" from NASA.  I clicked on the homepage and didn&rsquo;t think much, and moved on.  Then I came across <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2012/12/21/earth-as-art-from-nasa/">Earth as Art book from NASA on Flowing Data</a>, where they showed an actual image from the &ldquo;Earth As Art&rdquo; collection.
<p>Sure, I suffer from ADD.  But so does much of the world.  I work through huge amounts of data on a daily basis, looking for gems.  Sometimes I can find them myself, and sometimes I need help.
<p>The &ldquo;Earth as Art&rdquo; is an amazing collection of satellite photos from NASA.   I feel the entire collection could be made into an exhibit, allowing us to experience, take in and discuss the meaning of art, created from space of the planet we live on.
<p>I also feel NASA&rsquo;s Earth as Art I think is a poster boy example of how APIs can open up and provide access to content, but also work as conduit for syndication, sharing, remixing and expression around content the owner may not have been able to see.
<p>The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/earth_art_detail.html">deployment of the Earth as Art collection at NASA</a> has a title, description and meaningless photo thumbnail--accompanied by a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/703154main_earth_art-ebook.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nasa-earth-as-art/id577527077?mt=8">iPad app</a>.  Obviously NASA saw the value in delivering an iPad app, and making the content accessible to the masses via a PDF.
<p>As soon as I saw the images I want to create something that would share, syndicate and bring awareness to their beauty.  My hands are immediately tied, with only a PDF and iPad app--I am not equipped with the tools of a developer.
<p>If there were simply a JSON file of all images, titles, locations and details. Before I got to work, I looked around, but couldn&rsquo;t find any raw data for the project.  So I created <a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/earth-as-art/gh-pages/data/photos.json">my own JSON representation</a> of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/703154main_earth_art-ebook.pdf">Earth as Art PDF</a>.
<p>JSON output is so much more valuable than PDF output.  It took me about 2 hours to reverse engineer the Earth as Art PDF and render as images and text.  Now, equipped with the parts and pieces of the Earth as Art content, with JSON file as a framework--I can get to work creating several, more interactive representations of the satellite imagery.
<p>Before I create any visualizations, I need a place to put my project.  No better place than <a href="/admin/blog/http:/github.com">Github</a>.  I can use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to host my project and with a JSON file as my data source, I can easily use <a href="https://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> to display the images and allow for basic browsing.
<p>Instead of a single, static PDF--I now have all my images and the title, details, location and paths in a JSON file I can render the content in any way I want:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>HTML Templates</strong> - Using JSON + Mustache I can view images on a listing with detail pages</li>
<li><strong>Deck.js Presentation </strong>- Create a presentation in markdown using the satellite imagery and content, laid out using the deck.js framework</li>
<li><strong>Widgets</strong> - Develop several, embeddable, syndicatable JavaScript widgets that are driven from the JSON file</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/earth-as-art/great-salt-desert.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>Having the Earth as a Art assets stored as individual images with name, details, location and image paths as JSON allows me build my own HTML display, presentations and widgets around the content.
<p><a href="https://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank">Hosting the Earth as Art project at Github</a> allows me to provide simple, inexpensive, open hosting for the data, content and display elements--allowing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">anyone</span> to fork, download and remix and even choose to contribute back.
<p>As another project, I can explore the licensing, branding and other aspects that will ensure the creators of the content (NASA), get the attribution they deserve for creating such amazing content.
<p>When I first saw the Earth as Art pictures this morning, I couldn&rsquo;t get over the fact that they weren&rsquo;t in a format that allowed for remix, sharing and syndication.  The images are amazing and really lend themselves for infinite presentations and interpretations.
<p>Hopefully the project will only grow from here.

<p>There is an OG API t-shirt that recirculated this week for me--the <a href="http://schwag.140proof.com/product/capitalism-t-shirt">You Can't Spell Capitalism Without API</a>. &nbsp;This is an awesome shirt from the <a href="http://www.140proof.com/">social advertising platform, 140 Proof</a>. &nbsp;
<p>140 Proof launched the shirt at the Twitter Chirp Conference, and I think it is a classic, that should never go away.

<p>The history of APIs is something I discuss a lot. &nbsp;The history of modern web APIs is something I include in all my talks, and I'm always surprised by how little people understand some of the more popular APIs that got us to where we are at.
<p>To further support this area, I've launched a <a title="History of APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/history/">History of APIs</a> section where I've hung the stories I've already done in this area, and will be looking to dig up the history on other APIs that are shaking things up.
<p>When I'm talking to people about APIs, the term APIs can mean many different things. Sometimes it means hardware APIs, or the Java API or various other technical incarnations. Right now when you hear the term API, it probably means web API or an API built using REST, running on the same infrastructure the World Wide Web runs on.
<p>When it comes to APIs, I strongly feel that to understand where we are, we need to understand the short, modern history of the web APIs. There are several patterns to why the modern web API movement has worked, that I think you can take home and use in your own API strategy.
<h2>Commerce</h2>
<p>While modern web APIs were officially born with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm" target="_blank">Roy Fieldings dissertation Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures in 2000</a>--Web APIs first appeared in the wild with the&nbsp;<a title="Saleforce" href="/history/salesforce.php">introduction of Salesforce</a>&nbsp;on February 7th, when the company officially launched its API at the IDG Demo 2000 conference. Salesforce was an enterprise-class, web-based, sales force automation as a "Internet as a service", with XML APIs were part of Salesforce.com from day one.

<p>Later in the year, on November 20, 2000,&nbsp;<a title="eBay" href="/history/ebay.php">eBay launched the eBay Application Program Interface (API)</a>, along with the eBay Developers Program--which was originally rolled out to only a select number of licensed eBay partners and developers.

<p>Then on July 16, 2002,&nbsp;<a title="Amazon E-Commerce" href="/history/amazon.php">Amazon launched Amazon.com Web Services</a>&nbsp;allowing developers to incorporate Amazon.com content and features into their own web sites. Amazon.com Web Services (AWS) allowed third party sites to search and display products from Amazon.com in an XML format.

<p>The modern Web API movement was kicked off. But for some reason it didn't gain the momentum we see today, whether it was due to the "dotcom" bubble bursting or other things werent quite ready--web APIs wouldn't get traction until things got social.
<h2>Social</h2>
<p>In February 2004 the popular photo sharing site Flickr launched. Six months later&nbsp;<a title="Flickr" href="/history/flickr.php">they launched their now infamous API</a>, and six months after that, they were acquired by Yahoo. The launch of the RESTful API helped Flickr quickly become the image platform of choice for the early blogging and social media movement by allowing users to easily embed their Flickr photos into their blogs and social network streams. While allowing Flickr to focus on a&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/" target="_blank">new approach to business development using web APIs</a>.

<p>Then on August 15th 2006,&nbsp;<a title="Facebook" href="/history/facebook.php">Facebook launched its long-awaited development platform and API</a>. Version 1.0 of the Facebook Development Platform allowed developers access to Facebook friends, photos, events, and profile information for Facebook.

<p>One month later on September 20, 2006&nbsp;<a title="Twitter" href="/history/twitter.php">Twitter introduced the Twitter API to the world</a>. Much like the release of the eBay API, Twitter's API release was in response to the growing usage of Twitter by those scraping the site or creating rogue APIs.

<p>At the same time Facebook and Twitter were playing with the social powers of web APIs, Google was exploring the power of web APIs supporting embeddable tools and apps. The&nbsp;<a title="Google Maps" href="/history/google-maps.php">Google Maps API launched was just shy of 6 months after the release of Google Maps as an application</a>, and was in direct response to the number of rogue applications developed that were hacking the application. Google Maps was immediately so popular that developers hacked the JavaScript interface and developed application such as housingmaps.com and chicagocime.org.

<p>At this point web APIs were showing the power of the Internet when it came to sharing, making things embeddable and social. Web APIs still were perceived as "hobby" by mainstream business. You couldn't take care of business...yet.
<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>As APIs were generating social buzz across the Internet, Amazon saw the potential of an&nbsp;<a title="RESTful approach to business" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/restful-business-architecture/" target="_blank">RESTful approach to business</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/" target="_blank">internalized and saw APIs in a way that nobody had seen them before</a>--giving re-birth to an Amazon Web Services that was much, much more than just e-commerce.
<p>In March, 2006 Amazon launched a new web service, something completely different from the Amazon bookseller and e-commerce site we've come to know. This was a new endeavor for Amazon: a storage web service called&nbsp;<a title="Amazon S3" href="/history/amazon-s3.php">Amazon S3</a>. Amazon S3 which provided a simple interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives developers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites.
<p><a title="Amazon S3" href="/history/amazon-s3.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="center" /></a>
<p>Six month later, shortly after launching Amazon S3, Amazon followed with a new cloud computing service dubbed&nbsp;<a title="Amazon EC2" href="/history/amazon-ec2.php">Amazon EC2</a>&nbsp;or Elastic Compute Cloud. Amazon EC2 provided resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing developers to launch different sizes of virtual servers within Amazon data centers. Just like its predecessor Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 was just a RESTful API. Amazon wouldn't launch a web interface for another three years.
<p>With cloud computing, web APIs got real. You could now deploy global infrastructure using APIs. It wasn't just about social fun anymore, you could actually run your business using APIs.
<p>Even with this new found power of API driven cloud computing, it would take one more essential ingredient before web APIs were ready for the prime time.
<h2>Mobile</h2>
<p>With everyone focused on social and the cloud, a new device emerged, and much like social and cloud, would prove to be a game changer. In June of 2009 Apple launched the iPhone 3G, the App Store began allowing iPod Touch and iPhone owners to download applications through the iTunes desktop software or the App Store on their iPhones--opening up entirely new world of mobile applications, one that APIs would be the driving force.
<p>Soon after the launch of the iPhone, in March 2009&nbsp;<a title="Foursquare" href="/history/foursquare.php">Foursquare launched</a>&nbsp;at the SXSW interactive festival in Austin, TX. Foursquare was a location-based mobile platform that makes cities more interesting to explore, by checking in via a smartphone app or SMS, users share their location with friends while collecting points and virtual badges. This new type of mobile app, utilized APIs to allow developers to deliver a new generation of location aware, API driven applications, feeding the growing app economy.

<p>The mobile evolution of the Internet was under way, and the following year on October 6, 2010,<a title="Instagram" href="/history/instagram.php">Instagram launched its photo-sharing iPhone application</a>. Less than three months later, it had one million users. Kevin Systrom the founder of Instagram focused on delivering a powerful, but simple iPhone app that solved common problems with the quality of mobile photos and users' frustrations with sharing.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Immediately many users complained about the lack of central Instagram web site or an API, with Instragram remaining firm on focusing its energy on the core iPhone application. In December a developer name Mislav Marohni? took it upon himself to reverse engineer how the iPhone app worked, and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/" target="_blank">built his own unofficial Instagram API</a>&nbsp;on top of private Instagram APIs. By&nbsp;<a href="/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/" target="_blank">January Instagram shut down the rogue API, announcing that it was building one of its own</a>.
<p>The appetite for API resources to drive mobile has only grown with the introduction of the iPad tablet and the growth of the Android and Windows mobile platforms.
<p>Mobile was the finalize piece of the digital strategy puzzle, which included commerce, social and cloud--all required before the original vision of web APIs could be realized.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Web APIs got their start in early e-commerce on the Internet, but without social, a scalable cloud backend and a ubiquitous mobile devices--APIs weren't ready for prime time. In 2012, we reached that point.
<p>Every company needs a healthy digital strategy for success in 2013, which includes sensible uses of social, cloud, mobile--all depending upon APIs. While there are plenty of other APIs to learn from, we can learn a lot from the history of modern web APIs, and these early web API pioneers.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/scripting-platforms.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m working hard to understand the emerging patterns of of how APIs used, work through the details, and grasp the differences in competing approaches--in hopes of identifying <a title="what is next when it comes to web APIs" href="/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">what is next when it comes to web APIs</a>.
<p>One trend I&rsquo;m tracking on is the emergence of API scripting platforms.  This is a difficult are to track on, because we script against APIs all the time, right? This is different.  Scripting platforms are providing platforms and libraries to support easily scripting against multiple APIs.
<p>To help me understand this new approach to using APIs I&rsquo;m studying three separate approaches:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a></strong> - Authentication, integration and scripting platform.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a></strong> - Beyond&nbsp;code snippets, into ready-to-use processes, that simply API integration, taking care of authentication, credential management, updates and more</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/">Google Apps Scripts</a></strong> -&nbsp;<span>A JavaScript cloud scripting language that lets you extend Google Apps, integrate 3rd party services and build mobile and web applications.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these platforms are bringing together valuable API resources, from multiple sources into not just a common interface, but providing a language library you can use to build apps efficiently across multiple API resources.
<p>I&rsquo;m still working to understand the nuances of each approach. For example, Google provides its JavaScript like, stripped down language, where Webshell focuses on JavaScript and CoffeeScript.  Temboo provides ready to go processes or what they call choreos, with language SDKs in Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby and Python.
<p>Google Apps Script provides access to Google APIs and services, but recently opened up scripts to acts as connectors, that can be developed by 3rd party providers.  Temboo has over 100 APIs in its library, while Webshell is just getting going with less than 25.
<p>I see what Webshell, Temboo and Google are doing as similar to the aggregation, integration and some times automation we are seeing in other trending API areas, but these approaches are actually building languages that allow you to be more expressive with not just single APIs, but fluently with many APIs at once.
<p>This area is new and emerging, and I&rsquo;m still working to understand the different approaches.  let me know if you if you have anything I should be looking at or other thoughts. &nbsp;
<p>More to come...

<p>I'm working on a new trends section of API Evangelist. &nbsp;One area i'm tracking on is the opportunities around 3D printing and APIs. &nbsp;
<p>I did some fun research, and <a href="/2011/05/18/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">laid down some interest thoughts on APIs and 3D printing in 2011</a>. &nbsp;This was part of some research I was doing while working at Mimeo. &nbsp;
<p>As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts. With this trends research into 3D printing, I am working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact.&nbsp;
<p><span>I've identified 10 major components of 3D printing:</span>

<p><span>Of course this is just my perspective of the industry and can evolve as I learn more, and collaborate with other industry players.</span><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-manufacturing.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />&nbsp;
<p><span>This series was just to help me understand the major components, and I will do another series on how APIs can impact these areas. &nbsp;</span>I also have a summary post on&nbsp;<a title="ProgrammableWeb.com" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb.com</a>&nbsp;about the role of APIs in 3D printing.
<p><span>3D Printing is something I will be talking about a lot in 2013. &nbsp;I think all of these areas I laid out have the potential to be radically transformed by APIs. &nbsp;I will be taking my original research on 3D printing from 2011 and see where I can evolve it based upon what is going on in the 3D printing space in 2013. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

<p>The <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/22/6000-apis-its-business-its-social-and-its-happening-quickly/">number of available APIs is growing at a neck breaking speed</a>.  I have trouble keeping up with individual APIs, and I feel I am losing touch with the nuances and trends within specific areas like music or travel.
<p>I am getting more and more questions like this via email and twitter:
<blockquote><em>
<p>I am doing some research on music APIs. I am considering using one to integrate music streaming and relevant data into an app.  Can you recommend anyone who has technical or business expertise (or both) with these in particular?  I would love to speak with an expert to help lead me and my developers in the right direction.  Some points I am considering:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Technical capabilities (streaming speed, limitations of service, etc.)</li>
<li>Access to support from API parent company</li>
<li>Business opportunities or restrictions that arise when relying on the API</li>
</ul>
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<p>These are concerns that might be shared with other industries, but knowing the music industry--there are plenty of unique issues developers encounter when building applications and businesses around music APIs.
<p>Back in February, I did write on how <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/15/emi-helps-developers-navigate-building-apps-for-music-industry/">EMI is helping developers navigate building apps for the music industry</a>, but beyond just shedding light on what others are doing, I don&rsquo;t have the time to specialize in the details of how APIs are transforming the music industry.
<p>There is a huge need for more professionals to step up within specific industries and develop the domain expertise necessary to make sure APIs are being deployed with the proper technical, business and political building blocks, and help developers understand how to navigate the nuances of a particular industry being transformed by web APIs.
<p>Could you be this person, feel free to connect with me. &nbsp;I see a desperate need for experts in the music industry, education, health care, government and other fast moving business sectors.

<p>I had a chance to talk with the <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/content/us/en.html">Johnson Controls</a>, <a title="Panoptix API" href="https://developer.panoptix.com/">Panoptix API</a> team this last week.  The <a href="http://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">Panoptix&reg; community</a>&nbsp;offers:
<blockquote><em>a combination of software and services that easily and cost-effectively helps customers see more so they can do more to achieve optimized building performance and energy efficiency</em></blockquote>
<p>To understand what Panoptix enables...imagine if all of our buildings:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Thought for themselves</li>
<li>Teach us to reduce energy consumption</li>
<li>Diagnose problems in real-time</li>
<li>Self correct when necessary</li>
<li>Call a service provider when they need repair or tuning</li>
</ul>
<p>Panoptix starts with a cloud-hosted platform that enables buildings to collect and manage data, along with tools for automating operations at the building and space levels providing metering for electricity, water, gas oil steam, carbon and weather--with very granular level reporting up to overall trends of energy use.
<p>To grow Panoptix, Johnson Controls introduced a <a title="marketplace" href="http://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix/apps">marketplace of apps</a> combined with supporting news, information, resources and entire community dedicated to building performance and efficiency management.
<p>This marketplace and community is driven by an&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.panoptix.com/">API developer area</a>, allowing anyone to <a href="https://developer.panoptix.com/signup/">sign up</a> and get to work developing apps and start selling them in the Panoptix marketplace.  The Panoptix API is free to use for anyone looking to developer one app, allowing you to collect 70% of revenue from app sales in the marketplace (an essential ingredient for developer success).
<p>I like Johnson Controls approach to building a community around building management applications, data and resources--complete with a API driven developer area.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s great to see a 125 year old company open up their hardware and software with such an innovative approach.
<p>I&rsquo;ll be digging further into how <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/content/us/en.html">Johnsons Controls</a> deployed the Panoptix API, with further entries to this blog series, and a full case study on their approach to delivering their API driven building management platform.

<p>Some great <a title="API questions for Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier" href="http://startupjuicer.com/2012/12/wade-foster-co-founder-ceo-of-zapier/">API questions for Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier</a> over at <a title="Startup Juicer" href="http://startupjuicer.com/">Startup Juicer</a> today.
<p><strong>Zapier is a company that couldn&rsquo;t have existed even a few years ago as API&rsquo;s were not commonplace. What other advanced do you envision changing the way businesses operate?</strong>
<blockquote><em>APIs are just the first piece, but it&rsquo;s still the wild west in the API world with APIs constantly changing. One thing that will happen is APIs will move away from polling driven to push driven. That way API consumers don&rsquo;t have to constantly asking providers for new data like a kid on a long trip asking &ldquo;are we there yet&rdquo; but can instead rely on the API provider to send us the data when we get to the proverbial travel destination.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>What your thoughts are about the changing landscape of API access with some of the free big networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin are becoming increasingly restrictive in the way they allow developers to access their feeds?</strong>
<p><a href="http://startupjuicer.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/startup-juicer/startup-juicer.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a>
<blockquote><em>The only services I&rsquo;m seeing become more restrictive in how they allow developers to use their APIs are free tools. Many those services are in the high growth stage and are starting to think about monetization and are experimenting with lots of different ways to make money. Unfortunately this means instability for developers. Zapier leans heavily B2B though. And B2B services are doubling down on their APIs. For them, more usage of the API leads to more usage of the core product and since their core product is a paid service that means more paying users and the paying users are upgrading to higher plans. That means a service like Zapier is highly valuable to both API providers and to consumers alike.</em></blockquote>
<p>Those are just two of the questions <a title="Startup Juicer" href="http://startupjuicer.com/">Startup Juicer</a> asked, head over to the full <a href="http://startupjuicer.com/2012/12/wade-foster-co-founder-ceo-of-zapier/">interview with Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier at Startup Juicer</a>.

<p>Using oAuth from Twitter, Facebook and especially Github for API providers, just makes sense in this online world.  As a user, I don&rsquo;t want to create yet another login--I want to pick from my preferred social network.

<p>title: ‘Exploring a New Way of Planning and Executing Hackathons’</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/hackweekends/oc-hackerz/oc-hackerz-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>I started tracking on Hackathons full time in 2011, as part of my API Evangelism toolbox.  In 2012 I&rsquo;ve watched <a title="Hackathons explode and become a popular way for API owners to engage and build a relationship with developers" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/10/08/458-hackathons-in-the-united-states-so-far-in-2012/">Hackathons explode and become a popular way for API owners to engage and build a relationship with developers</a>.  (if done right)
<p>As I do with other trending areas, I launched as its own site, <a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com">hackweekends.com</a>.   I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of demand from hackathon organizers and sponsors to add events and other news and information.  To support this I recently <a title="Open Sourced Hack Weekends on Github" href="/2012/12/08/open-sourcing-hack-weekends-using-github/">launched Hack Weekends on Github</a>, so anyone can edit pages, write blog posts and add events to the calendar.  A sort of crowd sourced hackathon hub.
<p>To further support the hackathon community I also wanted to provide an <a title="open source hackathon guide" href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">open source hackathon guide</a>, helping anyone understand how they can throw their own hackathon.  There were already two great hackathon guides out there which are <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBuisDTIiBAz9u2tr7sgv6GdDLOV_aHbafjqHXSkNB0/edit">Open Data Hackathon How to Guide</a> and <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">The Hack Day Manifesto</a>---both licensed openly.  So I took this excellent material and merged with my own material to create a <a title="Hack Weekends Guide" href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">Hack Weekends Guide</a>.
<p>The Hack Weekends guide provides a very detail guide to throwing a hackathon, and I also included a <a href="https://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">website template that runs on Github Pages</a> using Jekyll.  My goal is to make it a plug-n-play guide with all the tools and resources you need to be successful in your communities hackathon
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/hackweekends/hackathon-home-2.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>Next I need to actually prove my &ldquo;open source&rdquo; approach to planning, designing and marketing hackathons.  I&rsquo;m planning several hackathons to make sure the process works.  The first hackathon I am planning is for <a title="OC Hackerz" href="https://www.meetup.com/OCHackerz/">OC Hackerz</a> in Orange County, California.  OC Hackerz is a big supporter of developers, and is in sync with my vision of what the hackathon space should look like, so they are a great partner to plan two initial hackathons:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="OC Hackerz Hackathon Los Angeles" href="https://kinlane.github.com/oc-hackerz-hackathon/">OC Hackerz Hackathon - Los Angeles - March 2013</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The planning of the OC Hackerz Hackathon is meant to be an exploratory deployment of the Hack Weekends Guide, intended to make hackathon planning an open and collaborative process between organizers, sponsors and the local stakeholders.
<p>Hack Weekends is all a work in progress.  So I&rsquo;m lookiking for feedback.  If you&rsquo;d like to get involved in hackathons or use the Hack Weekends process yourself, feel free to reach out.   The platform already has other supports such Singly, AT&amp;T and Hacker League.  My vision is to have everyone in the community contributing.

<p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> is continuing its quest to easily explain what it does for developers. &nbsp;The San Francisco startup has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/10/singly-launches-app-fabric-platform-for-developers-to-speed-up-integrations-with-dozens-of-services/">re-launched defining itself as, fabric for connected apps, or AppFabric</a>. &nbsp;
<p>Singly puts it best:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Singly AppFabric empowers you to add social login, sharing and friend finding into your mobile and web applications.&nbsp;</em><br /><em>Singly DataFabric handles syncing, data formatting, de-duplication, and normalization letting you query by location, keyword, and more.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When building mobile apps you are going to need to bridge social networks for your users, allowing them to authenticate with their preferred platform as well as pull friends, images and provide sharing in a meaningful way. &nbsp;You either do this platform by platform, or you use Singly's AppFabric to do this for you.</em>
<p>The best example of this in the wild, is with Singly developed mobile app <a title="Timehop" href="http://timehop.com/">Timehop</a>.
<p><a href="http://timehop.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/singly/timehop/timehop-1.png" alt="" width="400" /></a>
<p>Timehop lets you see your photos and updates from this exact day in history.

<p>To use Timehop, I need to sign up using <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> (this is Singly).
<p><a href="http://timehop.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/singly/timehop/timehop-3.png" alt="" width="400" /></a>
<p>Now I'm registered for Timehop and I have my <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> history connected.
<p><a href="http://timehop.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/singly/timehop/timehop-4.png" alt="" width="400" /></a>
<p>Using Singy AppFabric, Timehop allows me to easily connect my <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/foursquare">Foursquare</a>, <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a> and Flickr services.

<p>Now <a href="http://timehop.com/">Timehop</a> can intelligently connect me to my friends across these networks and share my Timehop stories, where it is most important to me.
<p>Singly is weaving together the most critical of social and personal APIs into an AppFabric, that developers can use to build the next generation of API driven mobile apps.
<p>As a developer, you won't think of development with single APIs anymore like <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a>. &nbsp;You can use AppFabric to build meaningful apps, knowing the social authentication, friends, sharing, photos and other objects across the multiple networks is at your disposal in a single, standardized interface.
<p><a title="Singly is AppFabric for our personal and social data" href="https://singly.com/">Singly is AppFabric for our personal and social data</a>, that developers can use to build the apps that we depend upon ever day.

<p><a href="http://www.mulesoft.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/mulesoft/mulesoft-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>API Discovery is becoming an increasingly troubling problem.  As an analyst, I see a dizzying amount of APIs each month.   When I get asked to find a particular type of API, or group of APIs in a particular industry--it gets difficult to discover a meaningful results to any query.
<p>My options for API discovery historically has been <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.  The OG API Directory.
<p>Today there is a new player on the block, <a href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a>.  APIhub is a fresh attempt at solving the API discovery, with over 13K APIs organized by category, type, protocol, format and security.
<p>API Hub is looking to provide a solution for two distinct groups:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Developers</strong> - Developers need an ecosystem to discover, learn, test and use APIs</li>
<li><strong>Publishers</strong> - Publishers require a platform to publish, manage, engage customers, and monetize APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>With first release APIhub&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have much out of the gate that is different than <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, except for a much cleaner layout, search tools that is not cluttered by news, mashups and advertising.
<p><a href="http://www.apihub.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/mulesoft/API-Hub-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a>
<p>Once you explore APIhub further, you start seeing early signs of deeper features.  When you add or claim your API, your given the option to upload a API spec in a Swagger or WADL format, with more formats coming soon.  If implemented for all 13K APIs, this could be a powerful discovery engine.
<p>Beyond programmatic discovery I see hints of ranking on the platform.  Right now its just 5 star ranking, but have hopes for more sophistication on how developers, publishers and analysts can rank APIs in the future.  Allowing consumers to find new and existing APIs in meaningful ways--other than just 5 star ranking or my number of followers and mashups built on an API would be extremeley valuable.
<p>APIhub, marketplace or directory is nothing new.  You see folks like <a href="http://apis.io/apis">APIs.io</a> trying to step up with a directory and startups like <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> providing a hub of their own, in a similar attempt to create an API marketplace.
<p>I think there are several things that will decide whether <a href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a> is successful and it will center around their ranking and discovering algorithm, but also their ability to attract API owners to come, claim and enhance their listings.  But more importantly can APIhub and Mulesoft get developers to care and participate in curating, ranking and consuming APIs via the new APIhub? &nbsp;Just like the web API movement, developers will make or break APIhub. &nbsp;If it add values to developers worlds, they'll embrace it--if not, APIhub will have hard time staying relevant.

<p>Hackathons have been a big part of current web API movement.  They are one of the most meaningful ways API owners can connect with developers in person. &nbsp;Twilio, Amazon and Facebook have all used hackathons to build their ecosystems.
<p>I started a section on API Evangelist in 2011, dedicated to hackathons. And in early 2012 I rolled this section out as its own site, hackweekends.com. &nbsp;Over 2012 the number of hackathons has grown significantly--making it difficult to ignore hackathons as channel for reaching developers.
<p>This weekend I <a href="/2012/12/08/open-sourcing-hack-weekends-using-github/">migrated the Hack Weekends directory to run on Github</a>.  It uses <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> for the blog.  I deployed <a href="https://mustache.github.com/">mustache templates</a> and JSON files for the events calendar and curated news section.  I&rsquo;m working on ways to easily crowdsource the management of Hack Weekends, while establishing it as an open source hub for the hackathon community.
<p>In addition to establishing Hack Weekends as a hub for the community, I wanted to create a <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">guide to throwing hackathons</a>.  So anyone can organize their own event. To help feed this, I&rsquo;ve been gathering my own research on hackathons from attending, mentoring, hacking and organizing hackathons over last 2 years.
<p>I also knew that there was other really good information available from other hackathon experts.  So I pulled together the best, open information on throwing hackathons and combined it with my own research.  Pulling content from:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hack Weekends</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBuisDTIiBAz9u2tr7sgv6GdDLOV_aHbafjqHXSkNB0/edit">Open Data Hackathon How to Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">The Hack Day Manifesto</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With this content and my experience I wanted to organize into something more.  Remixing and setting into motion,  a guide that anyone can use to organize a hackathon.
<p>While maintaining the calendar for Hack Weekends, I see a lot of hackathon sites.  To accompany the Hack Weekends Guide I wanted <a href="https://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">hackathon organizers to be able to easily deploy a website in support of the event</a>.
<p><a href="http://hackweekends.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/hackweekends/hackweekends-logo.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">Hack Weekends Guide</a> comes with a <a href="https://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">hackathon website template </a>as part of the Github repository.  So all you have to do is fork the Hack Weekends Guide, and you get a detailed guide in addition to a website. It is up to you, which parts of the guide you will use--as little or as much as you feel necessary.
<p>The Hack Weekends directory, guide and website is meant to be community owned.  You can deploy any hackathon with the guide and site, and participate in marketing your hackathons using Hack Weekends and other partner sites.
<p>I will be using the model to deploy 5 hackathons in the coming months, to contribute my own content and data, I hope you will get involved too!  I look forward to your feedback and hackathon expertise.

<p>While I was in Paris speaking at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io" target="_blank">API Days </a>last week, a drawing of me was circulated on Twitter. &nbsp;I was a little speachless when I saw them on Twitter. &nbsp;I am always looking for new graphics to use in API Evangelist. &nbsp;I worked for hours to come up with the logo I have, so I was stoked to see someone create something so cool, in the moment.

<p>title: ‘Some Thoughts For the Enterprise Embracing Web APIs’</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/enterprise-business.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>At the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas, NV last week I discussed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>"grass-roots web API movement"</em></span> with quite a few enterprise folks.  Walking through the exhibit floor, where I did my <a href="/2012/11/30/my-api-building-blocks-workshop-with-intel-at-the-gartner-aadi-conference/">building blocks of an API workshop</a>, I noticed the signage and discussions were all focused on APIs.
<p>During my discussions with multiple enterprise developers, analysts, architects and executives, one question seemed to come up a lot:  <strong><em>Didn&rsquo;t we do all of this 10 years ago?  What is different this time around?</em></strong>
<p>With a strong focus on the technology of web services, many in the enterprise fail to see the difference between SOA and API.  In an effort to better tell stories in this area, I wanted to revisit the SOAP vs. REST argument, and refresh my thoughts. &nbsp;So I got to work pulling up old stories, and while conducting my research I noticed the same patterns I see in the REST debates--a heavy focus on the technical, with only a few discussions of the business and politics of web services.
<p>If you are new to the SOAP vs. REST debate, let me get you up to speed.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">Wikipedia defines SOAP</a> as:
<blockquote><em>SOAP, originally defined as Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of Web Services in computer networks. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em> SOAP was designed as an object-access protocol in 1998 by Dave Winer, Don Box, Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein for Microsoft, with a specification of SOAP currently maintained by the XML Protocol Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>After SOAP was first introduced, it became the underlying layer of a more complex set of Web Services, based on Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI). </em></blockquote>
<p>SOAP, XML and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Service">Web Services</a> are all part of earlier approach to APIs which is widely considered to be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a> (SOA).  While SOA is still used in enterprise environments, it is considered in open developer circles to have been a failure in comparison to API efforts in the more grassroots, popular web API approach employed by companies like Flickr, Twitter and Amazon.
<p>I will spare you much of technical detail of the SOAP vs. REST debate, but the the main advantages of a web API approach are:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Simple and Lightweight</li>
<li>Human Readable Results</li>
<li>Easy to Build and Consume</li>
</ul>
<p>The SOAP advantages are:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Rigid, Well Defined and Adhering to a Contract</li>
<li>Wide Variety of Development tools</li>
<li>Agreed Upon Standard</li>
</ul>
<p>SOAP is a very well defined, strict technical, industry defined set of rules for approaching APIs.  To the enterprise, SOAP and a SOA approaches appears to be the proper solution for the exchange of structured information.
<p>But around 2003, outside the enterprise, we started seeing a shift in how developers viewed web services.  According to <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3005">Tim O&rsquo;Reilly of O&rsquo;Reilly Media</a>:
<blockquote><em>Amazon has both SOAP and REST interfaces to their web services, and 85% of their usage is of the REST interface. Despite all of the corporate hype over the SOAP stack, this is pretty compelling evidence that developers like the simpler REST approach. </em></blockquote>
<p>Over the course of the next nine years we see this trend continue with <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/1-in-5-apis-say-bye-xml/">REST + JSON</a> growing in dominance, wrestling control over web services and the term API from a more SOAP + XML approach.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/enterprise-business-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>After re-reading much of the SOAP vs. REST debate this weekend, I see the same as with the REST debate, where much of the discussion is technical.  But there are some great statements on what contributee to the success of API over SOA.  From <a href="https://supunk.blogspot.com/2012/08/rest-vs-soap-adoption-perspective.html">Supun Kamburugamuva on Life of a Software Engineer blog</a>:
<blockquote><em>REST as a framework gives the developers exactly that. The freedom to innovate. Developers love that. As a framework REST introduces very few rules. Most of them are not even rules. Rather they are soft guidelines. So building a proper powerful REST API is an Art and a challenging task. In my opinion this makes it cool. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>This is completely opposite to SOAP. SOAP gives the developer all the rules. First thing about SOAP is you get a SOAP envelope where you have to put your data according to some rules. So from start to end the system is pretty well defined. There are standards for doing even the simplest things. Top of all this SOAP is very complex to understand. So in my opinion SOAP doesn't give user the nuts and bolts to innovate. Instead it gives a half baked solution that user has to obey. I guess not all developers like to bog down by rules and they don't like to learn that kind of rules as well.</em></blockquote>
<p>Martijn Linssen at&nbsp;CloudAve also had a great statement:
<blockquote><em>SOAP was originally introduced to and by Microsoft, and was one in a range of futuristic machine-to-machine self-describing protocols. Needless to say, the world wasn&rsquo;t ready then, nor is it now. Current implementations of SOAP are arbitrary, proprietary, bi-lateral human agreements at best. In their worst form, SOAP implementations are dictated by governments and other bodies of power and bring nothing else to the other party but a cumbersome and hard-coupled interface</em></blockquote>
<p>In my opinion SOAP vs. REST is about Structure vs. Simplicity, Defined vs. Organic, Control vs. Open.  The differences aren&rsquo;t just technical.  As technologists we like to see things through a certain lense, add in capitalists and we can really have our blinders on.
<p>There are a lot of lessons in the modern web API movement that the enterprise can learn from.  SOA and API have a lot of parallels in trying to facilitate the exchange of structured information between applications, but where they begin to differ is that SOA was born within industry and within an enterprise.  API was born on the open Internet, where it was able to get the oxygen it needed to grow.
<p>My advice to the enterprise is when you look at adopting a web API approach over SOA approach, you look beyond just the technology and vendor solutions--you need to look at a lot of the more human elements that exist in the business and politics of APIs.  Consider essential elements like:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Keep things small, modular and intuitive</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong> - You should be widening access to your resources, not ever limiting</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong> -  While not everything should be 100% open, be as open as possible</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - Provide insight into operations and your roadmap allowing consumers to operate in alignment</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - Two way communication between you and your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Protect the privacy of your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong> - Be open to alternative licensing and ownership of content and data that is favorable to consumers</li>
<li><strong>Legal</strong> - Be as open as you can be with copyright, patents and trademark in API initiatives</li>
<li><strong>Terms</strong> - Establish terms of use that favor your business, but also the interests of consumers</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - Acknowledge the monetization needs of your consumers</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the key ingredients in the grassroots recipe that so many companies are following when deploying web APIs.  A balance of technical, business and politics has been found and is currently being explored in the web API movement. You can see examples of both success and failure in these areas, with APIs like Amazon and Twitter. Both API providers have found success technologically, but took different approaches to business and politics, delivering very different results within their respective developer ecosystems.
<p>There is a reason web APIs have found success on the open Internet.  Web APIs require a certain amount of &ldquo;open&rdquo; to be present in not just the technical, but also the business and political layers.  When embracing APIs,  make sure you understand the full scope of why API is different than SOA--then internalize this difference and make it part of how you conduct business internally, with partners and the public on the open Internet.

<p>I&rsquo;ve been maintaining a calendar of hackathons for all of 2012.  Originally it was just a section off of <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, but eventually the site needed to be its own project.  Up until now its just been a blog and calendar of events I curate from Eventbrite, Twitter, Google, Eventful and event organizers.
<p>I spend about 8-12 hours a week curating the events and stories for blog posts, and with the increase in the number hackathons over 2012, so does the time I need to maintain.  I was adding an API so other users can add to calendar or event guest post, then I decided I would like to also have databases of hackathon organizers, sponsors, vendors, venues and other key building blocks of hackathons.
<p>My goal is to create an information hub for the hackathon community.  But an &ldquo;open API&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t seem like enough.  I wanted everything about it to be open and accessible, as well as community owned.  I decided to publish&nbsp;<a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com/index.html">Hack Weekends on Github</a> and run it like an open source project.
<p>I launched the site using <a title="Github Pages" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> with <a title="Jekyll" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.  These run the pages and blog for Hack Weekends. &nbsp;But, I needed something to run the calendar, and other systems.   I wanted them to be simple--I went with <a href="https://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> + JSON stores.
<p>The implementation isn't perfect.   I had problems getting search and sort tools to work, so I scaled back to a minimal viable implementation.  I got the following areas up:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Hackathon Calendar </strong>- Listing of hackathons global, sorted by city (for now)</li>
<li><strong>Cities Hackathon Directory</strong> - Breakdown of hackathons by cities</li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends Blog</strong> - Blog running on Jekyll, which I edit using prose.io</li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends News </strong>- Curated, relevant hackathon links from my pinboard</li>
</ul>
<p>I will get all the bells and whistles in there soon. Before that, I&rsquo;m working on a basic Github template for planning and executing a basic hackathon.  I would like to see hackathon organizers using a common, open approach to planning and delivering hackathons around the globe.  I&rsquo;m hoping it will work in conjunction with an open approach to Hack Weekends and other hackathon community sites.
<p>Hack Weekends is a work in progress.  I went ahead and made it live, as its about 85% of what I had on the previous version.  Having it running as a completely client-side and static site on Github will force me to learn to approaches to manage my content and data in a way that is open and machine readable by default. &nbsp;
<p>Feel free to fork <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends">Hack Weekends</a> and make contributions. &nbsp;You can add blog posts, news or calendar events. &nbsp;I will be building other client side tools for interacting with the site as time goes on. &nbsp;

<p>I had the pleasure of speaking at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> in Paris, France this week.  The organizers originally asked me to do one talk, but after some speaker shuffle, I ended up with three separate talks on APIs.
<p>The second talk I did at API Days was <a title="The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal" href="/talks/apidays/internal-apis/" target="_blank">The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal</a>. &nbsp;This material was evolved from past stories I've done on <a title="Amazon" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon's</a> and <a title="Netflix" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/20/apis-power-netflix%E2%80%99s-move-to-cloud-enabling-world-domination/">Netflix's</a> success with internal APIs. &nbsp;
<p>I really want to tell more stories about other companies who have had success with internal APIs. But these are the hardest stories to come by, and I feel they are some of the most important API stories we can tell. &nbsp;
<p>If you have a great internal API story you'd like to tell, I love to hear more. &nbsp;Feel free to email or DM on Twitter, and we can figure out the best format to tell your story.
<p>You can view my presentation of&nbsp;<a title="The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal" href="/talks/apidays/internal-apis/" target="_blank">The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal</a> from <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a>, and I believe the session was video taped, so I'm sure there will be videos coming soon!

<p>The organizers of <a href="http://apidays.io/">APIs Days</a> asked me at the last moment if I'd like to do a third talk at the European API event, due to last minute cancellations. &nbsp;Of course, I jumped on the opportunity to generate to material and work through it in front of a live audience. &nbsp;
<p>The talk was on <a href="/admin/blog/Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up" target="_blank">business models for your API as a start-up</a>. &nbsp;On the plane ride over I reviewed <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmusser/j-musser-apishotnotgluecon2012" target="_blank">John Musser's great material on API business models</a>, and prepared a walk through, from a startup's perspective. &nbsp;
<p>Then after watching Guillaume Ballas (<a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebalas">@guillaumebalas</a>) from 3Scale give his talk&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323" target="_blank">APIs for Biz Dev 2.0, Which Business Model?</a> &nbsp;And watching other speakers I decide to scrap what I had put together, and went an entirely different direction.
<p>I decide to walk through the evolution of an imaginary startup, keeping in mind 3Scale's philosphy that:

<p>Then I walked through what I would consider a robust, healthy startup business model with five tiers:
<p><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15473323" width="342" height="291" align="right"> </iframe>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Free users</li>
<li>Paid users</li>
<li>Free developers</li>
<li>Paid developers</li>
<li>Partners</li>
<li>Incubation</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this approach isn't for every startup. &nbsp;I highly recommend checking out 3Scale's presentation if you want to better understand <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323">which API business model is right for your startup</a>.
<p>I wanted to tell the story of how you could apply some or all of the monetization strategies outlined by John Musser in his work, while also listening to Guillaume from <a title="3Scale" href="https://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>.
<p>The talk is rooted in my research on the <a title="Business of Twitter's API" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Business of Twitter's API</a> and experience I've had in the field consulting and building strategies with existing API owners.
<p>You can view the presentation of my <a title="Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up" href="/talks/apidays/business-models/" target="_blank">Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up</a>, and I believe the session was video taped so I'm sure there will be video coming soon.

<p>I gave a talk at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> in Paris, France this week. &nbsp;This talk was using some of my usual material around the <a title="building blocks of an API" href="http://apievangelist.com/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">building blocks of an API</a>. As I always do, I omitted some slides and evolved my presentation a little further. &nbsp;This is one benefit of using <a title="reveal.js" href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a>, driven from the API Evangelist database--I can evolve my content and make better with each talk.
<p>I discussed 5 main areas to consider when building your API developer portal:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>History of APIs</li>
<li>API Design &amp; Planning</li>
<li>API Development</li>
<li>API Evangelism</li>
<li>Whats Next for APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to keep organizing and sharing my view on API design, planning, development and evangelism so my readers can put to use in their own API efforts.
<p>It was interesting to talk through my <a title="API Building Blocks" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building block</a> approach with API owners in France, after giving my talk. &nbsp;I learned a lot by talking with folks there. &nbsp;And I really think Europe has huge opportunity in front of it, when it comes to the API economy.

<p>I got back last night from France, where I spent the week at the #APIDays conference, billed as the first international event on APIs in Europe.  The two day event was organized <span>by&nbsp;</span><a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a><span>, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and by</span><a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">WebShell</a><span>, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs</span>
<p>After some scheduling shuffling due to speaker cancellations API Days asked me if I&rsquo;d do three talks on APIs, instead of just my one--resulting in these three presentations:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Building Blocks (Bricks) For Your Developer Portal" href="/2012/12/07/building-blocks-bricks-for-your-developer-portal-apidays/" target="_blank">Building Blocks (Bricks) For Your Developer Portal</a></li>

<li><a title="Business Models for Your API as a Start-Up" href="/2012/12/07/business-models-for-your-api-as-a-startup-api-days/" target="_blank">Business Models for Your API as a Start-Up</a></li>
</ul>

<p>While the building blocks presentation is my usual material (but needs to be told over and over to new audiences), the other two talks represents entirely new work based upon other stories and research I&rsquo;ve done in the past.
<p>I learned a lot while at API Days.  It was about 200 people, discussing APIs over the course of two days.  I was really impressed with the passion everyone had for APIs and the genuine interest in understand the essence of the web API movement--discussing ideas, philosophies and approach rather than just the technology of APIs.
<p><a href="http://webshell.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-days-paris-france/webshell-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I feel an awakening occurring in Europe right now in regards to APIs.  My Twitter has lit up in the past three months with new European based followers focusing on APIs, and flood of new requests for discussions and information about APIs.
<p>With a very healthy stance on transparency, privacy and data ownership I think the EU has an excellent opportunity to become a major player in the <a title="API Economy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>, and I predict good things to come out of not just France, but other EU countries in 2013.
<p>I look forward to getting back soon, and talking APIs!

<p>I read a great post recently about how a company called <a href="https://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/4979/Start-Up-Offers-Blueprints-For-3D-Printed-Parts.aspx">Teenage Engineering has started providing 3D CAD files that allow their customers to 3D print replacement parts</a> for the products they make.
<p>It is awesome to see things I talk about become reality. &nbsp;I wrote about the concept of a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/08/01/my-3d-printed-junk-drawer/">3D printed junk drawer</a> last year, while doing research on 3D printing and APIs.
<p>Teenage Engineering is taking a big step, and potentially leading the industry in new ways. &nbsp;Can you imagine if companies by default, provide 3D drawings of common replacement parts and pieces for their products?
<p>There is still a lot of gaps in how all of this can work, 3D printing is widely available yet, but with retailers like <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/staples-3d-print-mcor-iris,19447.html">Staples playing around with offering 3D printing on demand</a>, the future for 3D printing is looking pretty bright.

<p>There was a great post last week on <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> from Curtis C. Chen (<a href="https://twitter.com/sparCKL">@sparCKL</a>), on how a company called <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/11/22/spectragram-is-a-gateway-to-instagram-api/">Spectagram has launched a new JavaScript library built on top of </a><a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>.
<p><a href="http://lab.adrianquevedo.com/jquery-spectragram/">Spectagram</a> uses JQuery to provide a basic set of embeddable tools for Instagram allowing users to embed widgets showing latest photos, popular photos, and photos by tag.
<p>Instagram has been notoriously focused on their core product, which leaves a lot of areas open to its developer community.  Even the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/">first version of the Instagram</a> API was created by a passionate developer.
<p>It is interesting to see such a sophisticated Javascript library developed by a developer, essentially rolling out something <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a> should be doing themselves, but obviously haven&rsquo;t prioritized.  Something I&rsquo;m sure many API owners would love to have happen in their communities.

<p>I conducted two workshops this week in partnership with Intel at the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas.  Working from my <a href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">Building Blocks of a Successful API</a> material, I put together a 30 minute workshop that I conducted at 12 and 6PM on Tuesday.
<p>My workshop started with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=History">history of APIs</a>, then walked through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a> in 3 areas:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API Design&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Development&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Evangelist</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I stepped back and emphasized that APIs are all about research &amp; development and business development for your company.
<p>After stepping back, I looked into whats next with APIs with API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, API automation platforms like <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTT</a> and new API programming libraries like <a href="http://webshell.io">Webshell</a>.
<p>The goal of my talk was to plant a few seeds in attendee&rsquo;s mind:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs Are More Than Tech&nbsp;</li>
<li>APIs Require a Business Approach&nbsp;</li>
<li>Politics Can Be Biggest Killer of APIs&nbsp;</li>
<li>Focus Delivering Value</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view the slide deck below for the workshop.  If you&rsquo;d like a custom demo feel free to contact me and we can do a Google Hangout.

<p>I got an email from Anthony Wu over at <a href="http://learnsprout.com/#home">LearnSprout</a> yesterday.  If you are not following what LearnSprout is up to, they are bridging legacy student information systems (SIS) and providing easy to use web APIs that application developers can use to build educational apps.
<p>The email from Anthony was in regards to a SIS LearnSprout was integrating with, which he said:
<blockquote><em>IlluminateEd is the best SIS API we've seen so far!   Clean &amp; simple. OAuth, JSON, no bullshit. If every SIS did this, we could just move on to greener pastures. This kind of thing should be encouraged!</em></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Anthony. The&nbsp;<a href="https://demo.illuminateed.com/dna/?ApiDocumentation">IlluminateEd API</a>&nbsp;is clean and simple.  They intelligently use common technical API building blocks like oAuth and JSON, while keeping the API interfaces intuitive and meaningful and provide simple, up to date documentation.
<p>My only criticism is simple, and would be about the description for the API:  &ldquo;This API allows third party applications to interact and communicate with the Illuminate system&rdquo;.   This is a classic mistake from API owners.  Unlike Anthony I had no idea what the Illuminate system is.  I can assume its a SIS, but they should really make it a little more description for newcomers.
<p>Even though the API isn&rsquo;t perfect LearnSprout says it is better than:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Humans as APIs (i.e. office secretary mashup with Excel)</li>
<li>CSV as APIs (the status quo)</li>
<li>Screen Scraping as APIs (for some, the ends justify the means&hellip;)</li>
<li>Legacy DOS terminal emulation</li>
</ul>
<p>Learsprout sees a lot of different approaches to accessing and sharing data between SIS systems.  They have a lot of value to bring to the industry, and I enjoying telling the story about what they are experiencing.  And I agree with Anthony and this type of effort should be encouraged within the education space.  Nice work <a href="https://www.illuminateed.com/">IlluminateEd</a>.

<p>Right before the Thanksgiving holiday, in an effort to make the Facebook platform more responsive and dependable for developers, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/11/15/delivering-important-alerts-about-your-app/">Facebook announced Developer Alerts</a>.  Developer alerts are a way for Facebook platform developers to receive critical information about their apps via email or Facebook notification.
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts provide the following for Facebook app administrators:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Breaking Changes </strong>- If your app is using functionality that FB is changing or removing, you will be sent an alert at least 90 days before the change goes into effect</li>
<li><strong>App Status Changes</strong> - If you have submitted Open Graph actions or created an app detail page for App Center, FB will use Developer Alerts to notify you when the status of your submission changes</li>
<li><strong>Policy Violations and Enforcement -</strong> If your app doesn&rsquo;t adhere to FB Platform Policies you will be notified through these alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts are more than notifications, it is an issue management system which will allow multiple developers on a project to known when action is required or things have been resolved.
<p>It seems like a great approach to improving communications between API platforms and its API application developers.  I think I will add platform alerts as an official API building block, and recommend it as something API should consider when developing their platform.

<p>Poster boy for how to properly run your API ecosystem properly, <a title="Twilio" href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, recently updated their <a href="https://www.twilio.com/doers">DOer Gallery</a> to highlight developers in the Twilio ecosystem that build cool stuff on the popular voice and SMS API.
<p>Twilio has the best record I&rsquo;ve seen of any API, when it comes to showcasing and being loved by their developer community, and I'm sure the DOer Gallery plays an important role in that.
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/doers"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/twilio/twilio-doers-gallery.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a>
<p>The Twilio DOer Gallery has the following features:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Personal Details</li>
<li>Short Bio</li>
<li>Skills</li>
<li>Other Profiles</li>
<li>Projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Devloper Galleries like Twilios might not be for every API platform.  But if you have a passionate base of developers you might want to consider giving them their own profile and a gallery where they can not just discover and interact with each other, it can let other companies find potential developers to execute projects via your API.
<p>A Developer Gallery can be a great way to give your API developers some love and attention.  Twilio even features developers from their DOer Gallery on their blog in a "DOer of the Month".
<p>Would showcasing your &ldquo;API DOers&rdquo; benefit your API community?

<p>In 2012 the number of APIs has grown significantly.  We are transitioning from &ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t enough APIs&rdquo; to &ldquo;how do we more intelligently use many APIs&rdquo;.  As I track on this and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of web APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m noticing growth in the number of API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.
<p>A couple of weeks ago I was introduced <a title="Adigami" href="http://www.adigami.com/">Adigami</a>, a "Singly for Analytics".  While Singly focuses on personal data API aggregation, Adigami is focused on <a title="aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today" href="http://www.adigami.com/">aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today</a>--covering seven key channels:
<p><a href="http://www.adigami.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/adigami/adigami-data-visual.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web</strong> - Google Analytics</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - Google AdWords, Microsoft Bing</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - DoubleClick, Yahoo! APT, Facebook Ads, MediaMind</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Facebook Insights, Twitter</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Yahoo! Mobile, Verve Wireless</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> - MailChimp, SendGrid, ConstantContact, ExactTarget</li>
<li><strong>Custom</strong> - Adigami can import proprietary data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating your business on the Internet or "in the cloud" is a reality, and as we operate more and more in this cloud, each platform will have its own set of analytics--making the need to centralize and standardize analytics across channels and platforms more and more critical.
<p>Adigami is just the tip of the iceberg.  I predict we&rsquo;ll see API aggregators emerge from top industries like government, healthcare and education.  In 2013 we will learn to more fluently communicate with web APIs with the help of API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a title="Adigami" href="http://www.adigami.com/">Adigami</a>.

<p>Swag can be a critical tool in any API evangelist toolbox.  And stickers are one piece of swag that if possessing the right design, can be something developers will take home and put to use.
<p>Earlier today Ari Fuchs (<a href="https://twitter.com/arifuchs">@arifuchs</a>), developer evangelist for <a href="https://www.aviary.com/">Aviary</a> asked, &ldquo;<strong><em>who do you use to print your sticker swag?</em></strong>&rdquo;

<p>The legal building blocks of an API can be just as critical as the technical and business building blocks.  It makes sense to version and communicate your API terms of use (TOS) , privacy policy and branding guidelines alongside your code.
<p>Since Github will allow document types other than code, such as markdown and PDF, it can make sense to use Github for managing the legal side of your API.
<p>Using Github for the legal aspects of API operation will provide a level of transparency developers will appreciate, allowing them to download and store for their own records while being able to see the difference between each version, in a format that makes sense to them.
<p>Just as with all other areas of an API, Github will allow you to completely manage the evolution of your API terms, privacy and branding in a way that is in sync with all the other technical and business building blocks of your API.
<p>Consider using Github for API legal building block management.

<p>I am heading to Paris, France next week for <a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>.  API Days is December 3rd and 4th in Paris and is dubbed as the <em>"First National Event on APIs in Europe"</em>.   The two day event is organized by <a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a>, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and by <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">WebShell</a>, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs.
<p><a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>&nbsp;sees the API economy the same way I do:
<blockquote><em>The Web 1.0 was readable, the Web 2.0 was social, now the web is programmable through application programming interfaces, aka APIs. Web APIs are a unique opportunity for companies, governments and developers to either better organize the governance of their IT into a scalable and flexible model, either leverage a complete ecosystem around the organization, exchanging data through the web for trillion of applications on billion devices. Because each civilization has been described by the way it communicates and make exchanges, API are the beginning of a programmable civilization.</em></blockquote>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-days-paris-france/API-Days-Kin-Lane.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>The API event is hosting over 50 sessions from over 30 speakers--including two of my own talks:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The Secret to a Successful API is Internal</li>
<li>Business models for your API as a start-up</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see APIs getting interest in Europe.  And after working with the Webshell team for several months and learning more about FaberNovel, I'm excited to be working with both of them to drive API adoption in Europe.
<p>If you are planning on going to <a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>, let me know and I&rsquo;ll make time to talk.  If you aren&rsquo;t, I will publish more info about the event and my talks here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, when it is all wrapped up.

<p><a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/chartboost/Chartboost-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>The team over at <a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank">Chartboost</a> have a pretty forward thinking <a href="http://blog.chartboost.com/post/36221629171/web-3-0-help-site?hn">blog post about what they see as the next generation of web application development</a>.
<p>They feel that the future is about creating web applications, not sites.  The server side should be an API and the client should be a self-contained app which uses the API as its back-end.  With mobile applications following the same pattern.
<p>To practice what they preach, Charboost is overhauling their help site to be an API driven web app using the following approach:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Push State</strong> - Provide site navigation without page refreshes by faking navigation and inserting JavaScript callbacks</li>
<li><strong>JSON-API </strong>- A REST API providing JSON to drive the site</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Design </strong>- Providing an application design that responds to mobile as well as it does laptops or desktop computers</li>
<li><strong>Vector (Icon Fonts &amp; CSS)</strong> - Using a combination of icon fonts and CSS3 to deliver the UI. SCSS - A new technology that uses CSS-preprocessing to make the CSS code cleaner and res-usable</li>
<li><strong>Markdown</strong> - Using the simple markup language to allow anyone on their team to write and edit help articles</li>
<li><strong>GitHub</strong> - Using Github to manage the help center as an open project</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/chartboost/Chartboost-Help-Center-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I agree that their metholody has the potential to be one possible future of web and mobile application development.  JavaScript and API development have both matured in the last 10 years, getting us to this point where you can build some damn sexy, but simple apps that run smoothly on the web or mobile devices. &nbsp;
<p>Or as Chartboost puts it:
<blockquote><em>We believe that the web is finally reaching a tipping point. The culmination of a decade of incremental improvements to web technologies is upon us, and lets us do things in a way that is radically new and better.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m also playing around with my own approach to delivering apps in this way using Github + Jeckyll + Mustache Templates with JSON data stores, all running as open repositories using Github Pages.
<p>I&rsquo;ll have more to publish on this in the near future.

<p>Social analytics provider&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://www.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr</a>&nbsp;has won a temporary injunction against Twitter today, with a complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court. It reads:
<p><em>PeopleBrowsr seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent Twitter from destroying its business, interfering with PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s contractual and prospective business relations, and restraining competition in markets using Twitter data.</em>
<p>The complaint was filed in response to a trheat from Twitter to cut off PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s access to its Firehose by November 30, 201 &nbsp;PeopleBrowsr has had access to the full Twitter full firehose for over four years. According to the complaint:
<p><em>PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s products require the full Firehose feed. A mere sample of Twitter data is insufficient for PeopleBrowsr to provide the products its users expect. Though there are some data analytics companies that can provide certain limited types of Twitter data analysis based on sampling, PeopleBrowsr competes in a separate &ldquo;Twitter Big Data Analytics&rdquo; market, in which a few, highly sophisticated players analyze massive amounts of Twitter data to provide deeper insights.</em>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s decision to terminate PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s firehose follows a&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">pattern of it consistently cutting off partner and developer access to the platforms and its data</a>. In doing so Twitter&nbsp;has sought more control in their effort to monetize the social networking platform and provide&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/07/22/investment-in-twitter/">investors with a return on their investment of almost 1.4B dollars</a>.
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/PeopleBrowsr-logo.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>PeopleBrowsr states that it has &ldquo;invested millions of dollars and years of work in building a business based on the Firehose&rdquo;. It says it did so in rlying on Twitter&rsquo;s representations that it would maintain an &ldquo;open ecosystem&rdquo; and allow other companies to use of its data. Through agreements with Twitter PeopleBrowsr felt it could compete without fear that Twitter would cut off access to its data in order to influence which businesses succeed or to usurp business opportunities for itself.
<p><a href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Twitter has consistently described</a>&nbsp;the Firehose as a part of this open ecosystem that it would make available to &ldquo;everyone in the system&rdquo;, and this open approach was a key component of Twitter&rsquo;s business strategy.&nbsp;
<p>The injunction PeopleBrowsr received today will keep their firehose access open until January, when further hearings on the case will be held. Until now, all the outcy regarding Twitter&rsquo;s restriction of access to the platform have been vocal, but without any legal action. The filing by PeopleBrowsr shows the situation has truly become serious and will move discussion about Twitter access from the tech blogosphere and hacker news into the U.S legal system.
<p><em>Disclosure: API Evangelist has provided API strategy services to PeopleBrowsr.</em>

<p>Those of you who follow my blog, know my favorite API management service provider is <a title="3Scale" href="https://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a>.  It&rsquo;s no secret I&rsquo;m a fan of what they are doing.  We share a vision of the API space and what a healthy API industry <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> look like.
<p>In support of that vision, 3Scale just launched a new open source API proxy build on the <a title="NGINX" href="https://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGNIX</a> web server technology--a move, I feel is important for 3Scale, as well as the entire API industry.
<p>What makes 3Scale&rsquo;s approach signficant, is that by deploying the NGNIX proxy, API providers don't need to rely on proprietary API proxy solutions, while also gaining additional benefits, such as acess to a library of 3rd party <a title="addons" href="https://wiki.nginx.org/3rdPartyModules">addons</a> and <a title="modules" href="https://wiki.nginx.org/Modules">modules</a> available in the NGNIX ecosystem. All while employing an established technology that has been proven to deliver in highl volume production environments.
<p>In addition to the benefits provided by NGNIX, the proxy provides seamless integration with 3Scale&rsquo;s API management platform that delivers:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API business modeling using service contracts, API rate limits and pricing rules</li>
<li>API access control &amp; security with API key generation with user id, app id, oAuth</li>
<li>API analytics &amp; reporting including alerts, statistics, business intelligence</li>
<li>API billing &amp; payments supporting pre-paid, post-paid, PCI compliant, six separate payment gateways</li>
<li>Developer portal for self-service registration and onboarding</li>
<li>Interactive API Documentation for better adoption using Swagger</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="3Scale" href="https://www.3scale.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-API-Proxy-Admin-Panel.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>This list represents everything you will need to get your API up and running.  3Scale enables you to do this both on premise or in the cloud, using a proxy that you cotrol--then alllowing you to choose which 3Scale API management services you need to use.  But what is most important for me, is 3Scale allows you start off without spending any money.  3Scale has a free, entry level tier that will allow you to design, experiment and iterate until you find the meaningful API definition that works for your developers--at which time you can scale, paying for only what you need, as you grow.&nbsp;
<p>This approach is critical to success of individual APIs as well as the overall health of the API industry.  We need to allow companies to innovate without spending a fortune, give up control of their data, and being locked into unnecessary commitments--allowing the industry to go from thousands of APIs to millions of APIs as quickly as possible.
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;As of today this makes 3scale the API Management solution provider with the richest and most flexible set of technical options to manage API traffic,&rdquo; said Guillaume Balas, 3scale CMO. &ldquo;At 3scale we want companies with great and valuable APIs to be able to distribute them easily, rapidly, without hampering the economics of their API project and without disrupting their existing infrastructure: this what 3scale&rsquo;s API Management solution provides.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The 3Scale approach is in aligment with my industry philosophy, that we shouldn&rsquo;t stand in the way of API providers with costly, proprietary proxies.  We should leverage existing, proven, open technologies like NGINX to allow API providers to deploy wherever their infrastructure exists, either in the datacenter or the cloud--while enabling them to &ldquo;connect&rdquo; to the best of breed API management services, which allow them to scale, grow and evolve their API ecosystem in the healthiest way possible.

<p>title: ‘Where Are The APIs For State Health Insurance Exchanges?’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/State-Healthcare-Insurance-Exchanges.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/State-Healthcare-Insurance-Exchanges.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I was listening to a story about <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/165057222/nevada-quietly-starts-implementing-obamacare">Nevada quietly starting their implementation of health insurance exchanges</a>, as part of what everyone loves to call Obamacare.  I&rsquo;m not even going to get involved in the politics and merit of making sure everyone is insured--I want to focus on the execution of it.
<p>Immediately I think:  <em><strong>Where is the state health insurance exchange platform API?</strong></em>
<p>According to healthcare.gov an exchange is:
<blockquote><em> A mechanism for organizing the health insurance marketplace to help consumers and small businesses shop for coverage in a way that permits easy comparison of available plan options based on price, benefits and services, and quality.  By pooling people together, reducing transaction costs, and increasing transparency, Exchanges create more efficient and competitive markets for individuals and small employers.</em></blockquote>
<p>And the principles and priorities of state health insurance exchanges are:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Establishing a State-based Exchange</strong> - Establishment of an Exchange is a critical step that States must take to be on track for achieving certification of an Exchange by January 1, 2013 under Section 1321. </li>
<li><strong>Promoting Efficiency </strong>- Exchanges must be mindful of costs for consumers, employers, and the federal government. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Adverse Selection</strong> - Successful Exchanges will avoid adverse selection by ensuring that those who buy through the Exchange are a broad mix of the healthy and the less healthy.</li>
<li>Streamlined Access and Continuity of Care.  Section 1311(d)(4)(F) requires Exchanges to evaluate and determine eligibility for applicants in Medicaid, the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and other health programs - Exchanges must also comply with all applicable federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination.  The federal government will provide critical building blocks and financial support for achieving an efficient enrollment process including verification of&nbsp;eligibility for tax credits.</li>
<li>Public Outreach and Stakeholder Involvement - Section 1311(d)(6) requires Exchanges to consult with a broad range of stakeholders in carrying out their activities.</li>
<li>Public Accountability and Transparency - Accountability requires transparency.  Section 1311(d)(7) requires public reports on Exchange activities, and Section 1311(e)(3) requires additional reporting, which should include standardized data reporting on price, quality, benefits, consumer choice and other factors that will help measure and evaluate performance. </li>
<li>Financial Accountability - Section 1313 provides for the efficient and non-discriminatory administration of Exchanges, and seeks to prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are going to successfully implement 50 state health insurance exchanges that meet the definition, principles and priorities of the federal government objectives, you will need an open source platform, complete with a robust API strategy.  Maybe it exists, and I&rsquo;m unaware of it.
<p>If you know more about current initiatives in this area, please let me know.

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/singly-logo_300.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://singly.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/singly/singly-logo_300.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for meaningful API analogies, to stock my evangelism toolbox.   Ways that I can relate the potential of APIs, in a way that anyone can understand, even non-developers.
<p>In my opinion, the success of the web API movement lies in the ability to extend, potentially complex resources in a very simplistic and universal way.  So, as an evangelism I have to abstract away the complexities and make sure I connect with my audience.
<p>As I&rsquo;m tracking on the API space and working to quantify the potential future of APIs, I&rsquo;m struggling to find meaningful analogies to articulate where API driven platforms like Singly are moving the industry.  But just as with the technology, leave it to the Singly team to do this for me.
<p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> made a slight shift in their branding recently, using the words <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API Fabric</span></strong></em> in the description of what they do.  This seems like a slight change, but it truly is an exceptional way to describe the Singly approach to app development using social authentication and data.&nbsp;
<p>At first glance, to a non technical person, fabric may be defined as:
<blockquote><em><strong>fab&middot;ric/Ëfabrik/</strong> Noun: Cloth, typically produced by weaving or knitting textile fibers</em></blockquote>
<p>With synonyms being cloth, material, structure, textile, texture and web. Using this definition of fabric as the source for my analogy can work by itself.  It can help a non-technical person understand what is possible when you can quickly begin weave together apps using different APIs--visualizing some sort of woven textile, with unique meaning.  Immediately helping anyone, visually relate to the potential when developing on top of social and personal APIs.
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/singly/mayan-weaving.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>If you are more technical, the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; might help you understand Singly at another level. In information technology, fabric is a synonym for the words framework or platform.  In general, the term fabric can describe the way different parts of something work together to form a single entity.  Fabric can be used as a metaphor to illustrate the idea that if someone were to document computer components and their relationships on paper, the lines would weave back and forth so densely that the diagram would resemble a woven piece of cloth.
<p>Bringing us back full circle to the visualization potentially related to non-developers.  The word fabric has deep meaning through our personal worlds, it might be your favorite jeans, blanket the uniform you wear to work every day.  APIs are fast being woven into every aspect of our lives, and the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; is an excellent way to relate what API providers like Singly are doing with specific groups of APIs, like personal and social data APIs.
<p>Our sometimes very personal data and sometimes very public social data is fast becoming fabric of our daily personal and work worlds on the Internet and our mobile devices.  We are going to need to provide ways of assuring developers can build the most powerful, meaningful apps possible--by weaving together the best of breed data and resources into a strong API fabric!

<p><a href="http://www.socrata.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/socrata/Socrata-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p><a title="Socrata announced today that they are preparing to release an open source, cloud-based, open data system" href="http://www.socrata.com/newsroom-article/socrata-announces-open-source-option-for-leading-open-data-cloud-platform/">Socrata announced today that they are preparing to release an open source, cloud-based, open data system</a>, called the &ldquo;Socrata Open Data Server, Community Edition.&rdquo;  If you don&rsquo;t already follow what Socrata does, they are the data platform behind municipal open data initiatives like <a title="New York City Data" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/new-york-city/">NYC City Data</a>, <a title="San Francisco City Data" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/city-of-san-francisco/">San Francisco City Data</a> and <a title="Data.gov" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/data-gov/">Data.gov</a>.
<p>The new Socrata Open Data Server is meant to be a reference for the <a title="open data standard" href="https://open-data-standards.github.com/">open data standard</a> they are actively evolving to promote data portability throughout open government data ecosystems, and support open source software policies in public organizations around the globe--called <a title="Open Data Substrate" href="https://open-data-standards.github.com/">The Open Data Substrate</a>.
<p>The goal of the Socrata open source strategy is to enable customers to rapidly accelerate the process of breaking data out of traditional database &ldquo;silos,&rdquo; move it to the cloud and opening it for mass consumption to end users and developers. &nbsp;The Socrata Open Data Server will support the ongoing evolution of open data standards in three key areas, that Socrata feels are required for a thriving open data ecosystem:
<ol class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Data Catalog Interoperability </strong>&ndash; Enable universal federation of different open data catalogs using a standard catalog schema, based on the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)</li>
<li><strong>Data Portability Based on Standard Data Formats &ndash;</strong> Standardize outputs including JSON, XML, and CSV, as well as RDF and other Linked Data standards. The goal is to evolve towards standard schemas that developers can use for popular data sets, based on real-world examples and collaboration between data publishers</li>
<li><strong>Application Portability Based on Open Data API Standards &ndash; </strong>Standardize the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used to programmatically access open data, using established paradigms and protocols such as REST, HTTP, and Structured Query Language (SQL)</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://open-data-standards.github.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/socrata/The-Open-Data-Substrate.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>Socrata&rsquo;s move to open source their technology is in line with their mission:
<blockquote><em>Socrata&rsquo;s mission is to help government organizations everywhere reap massive economic benefits from data liberation by promoting unfettered access, shareability, consumability and reuse of public data.</em></blockquote>
<p>And I share a similar vision with Socrata&rsquo;s CEO Kevin Merritt:
<blockquote><em>"Socrata is constantly inventing new products that help people visualize and contextualize data in consumer-friendly web and mobile experiences, and as machine- and developer-ready APIs. We are part of a broader ecosystem that is creating massive downstream benefits and economic incentives for government to open the data floodgates,&rdquo; adds Kevin Merritt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough to reduce friction in the supply of data, we also need to hardwire interoperability and data portability into the open data experience, to keep everybody honest and create a financially-sustainable business model for the entire ecosystem to thrive."</em></blockquote>
<p>We need all city, county, state and federal goverment to have APIs.  Let&rsquo;s not stand in the way.  The same can be said about the private sector--which is why I have been a <a href="/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">proponent of more open source offerings in the API industry</a>.
<p>The Socrata Open Data Server will be released in the first quarter of 2013, as freely downloadable open source software, but will also come fully integrated with other components of the company&rsquo;s commercial software products.
<p>I&rsquo;m excited by the opportunities for opening up government data with Socrata&rsquo;s approach, but we all have a lot of work to do.  We can&rsquo;t expect government to do it all alone.  Everyone needs to step up and help educated our local government about the potential of open data and APIs, and get involved and contribute to what Socrata has set into motion.

<p><a href="http://www.bandpage.com/">BandPage</a>, a hub for musicians to manage and control their online presence, just expanded their reach with <a href="https://developers.bandpage.com/home">BandPage Connect</a>, an API, allowing  developers to build apps for the music industry.  I wrote about their <a title="update once, publish everywhere with an embeddable API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/25/update-once,-publish-everywhere-with-the-right-embeddable-api-strategy/">update once, publish everywhere with an embeddable API strategy</a> back in July, feeling an API would be next.
<p>When it comes to a Bands most treasured assets, music is always held up as the most valuable piece of the catalog, but band info, events, venues, videos and photos of the band are essential to the success of these artists--emotionally connecting fans with their favorite bands.
<p>This is where BandPage Connect comes in.  The API will allow bands to provide content to open API developers, as well as their partners, in a self service approach.  BandPage Everywhere allows bands to easily manage their presence with robust embeddable apps that they can easily distribute across the web, but BandPage Connect takes this to the next level--allowing developers define what is next, when it comes to building web and mobile apps that connect bands with their fans.
<p>BandPage Connect provides a solid approach for the music industry to provide access to valuable band assets, but also provides a centralized way to control presence.  Ryan Kavontrka, Digital Manager for Maroon 5, Sara Bareilles, Gavin DeGraw, and Eve 6, says, "There are a lot of platforms out there that have our bio, photos, and videos, but the info they have about us is out of date and we don't have a way to change it. This makes it so that any member of a band or their manager/label can update the content, not just the guy who knows HTML. If you're connected with BandPage, you know your entire online presence is up-to-date."
<p><a href="https://developers.bandpage.com/home"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/bandpage/BandPage-Developer-Portal.png" alt="" width="525" /></a>
<p>All a band has to do, is manage their presence via BandPage, and they can use BandPage Everywhere to allow any fan or partner to easily embed content on sites and social networks, as well as allowing developers to build custom experiences--all while maintaining control over every aspect of a bands presence.
<p>After diving into BandPage Connect they&rsquo;ve done a great job launching the API, providing valuable endpoints, and all the <a href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">essential API building blocks so developers can be successful</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;building apps on the platform.  I think the BandPage approach to their embeddable and API strategy, is a model for other industries that showcase artists, to follow--giving them the highest level of control over their presence, while achieving the large distribution and presence possible in an API driven online and mobile world.

I&rsquo;m not a big fan of covering funding, acquisition or launch press releases, unless there a significant business story there.  But the acquisition of Vordel is another important sign for the API industry in 2012.
<p>Financial terms of the deal haven&rsquo;t been disclosed, but the acquisition shows the API industry is maturing and producing desirable companies with proven API products, that larger software companies can use as a competitive advantage.  While Vordel's API management, SOA governance and identity management will help Axway&rsquo;s customers, I think Vordel&rsquo;s customers is probably the type of new client large software companies will want be also seeking out through acquisitions.

<p>I always joke with John and Adam at <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> about, &ldquo;Is this the year of the API&rdquo;? They have been at it longer than I have, and are very hesitant to dub any particular year, the year of the API.  But, with the growth we&rsquo;ve seen in 2012, two open source API management platforms deployed and now a major acquisition in the space--I confidently would say 2012 is the year APIs came of age.
<p>I predict in 2013-2015 we are going to see more of these types of acquisitions occuring.  Large software companies are going to need a robust set of API tools to bring legacy systems into the modern, API driven economy.  Companies that have invested in API management service providers like <a title="3Scale" href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> will see the return they are looking for, as the space continues to grow in the next five years.

<p>title: ‘Communicate Your API Roadmap with Github’</p>

<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>When you operate an API, you need to make sure and communicate with your developer community about what your plans are for the future, so developers can plan their own roadmap, and keep in sync with the coming changes to the API.
<p>In addition to <a title="API issue management with Github" href="/2012/11/08/api-issue-management-using-github/">issue management using Github</a>, API providers can use Github to manage their roadmap using the milestones features of the social coding platform.  Milestones can be directly related to issues or can be larger goals around where you intend to take your API.
<p>Milestones give developers insight into what the plans are the future of an API, using just a title, description and target date.  Milestones are one of the simplest aspects of an API, but can go a long way in creating goodwill with your developers.
<p>API providers have to balance transparency versus giving away information to competitors, something that will take regular consideration.  A transparent roadmap for your API will let developers prepare properly, while also letting them know what features are coming in the future--eliminating the possibility of competing with your own ecosystem.
<p>Consider what you can include in your Github roadmap, and using Github for issue management.

<p>Backend as a Service (BaaS) provider <a title="CloudMine" href="https://cloudmine.me/">CloudMine</a> and aggregated social API platform <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> announced a partnership today, to make sure the mobile applications developers are building using CloudMine have social baked in by default.
<p>CloudMine is delivering on the BaaS promise and providing all the tools developers need to rapidly develop and scale their mobile applications, by providing a complete backend solution for developers including user management, object storage, push notifications, syncing and other essential tools developers need to be successful.
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/53044170?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0" width="500" height="281"></iframe>

<p>Social is the logical next step in the BaaS evolution.  Social authentication, data, friends, followers are also essential for any developer building an app these days, so the partnership being CloudMine and Singly makes sense.  Instead of CloudMine aggregating these essential social tools, they can rely on Singly to bring this to the table for CloudMine developers--allowing CloudMine to stick with what they do best.
<p>If you want more information, you can head over to <a title="CloudMine" href="http://blog.cloudmine.me/">CloudMine</a> or <a title="Singly" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/11/12/teaming-up-with-cloudmine-for-backend-superpowers/">Singly</a>, and see how their approach can help your mobile app development.

<p>Mobile app development is at the center of API deployment in 2012.  Much of the interest in designing, developing and deploying APIs is so that you can successfully launch one, or multiple mobile applications.
<p>I get a lot of questions from companies looking to deploy APIs, where they can find development talent that will help them with their API driven mobile initiatives.  Up until now I didn&rsquo;t have much to offer them, any mobile developer I know that is good, is already snatched up, and without direct experience deploying projects with a development shop, I didn&rsquo;t have one to recommend.
<p>Now that has changed, I&rsquo;ve been working with a rock star web and mobile dev shop called <a href="http://concentricsky.com/">Concentric Sky</a>. And over the last couple years I have really gotten to know their team of developers and management--and I&rsquo;ve been blown away by some of the projects they are producing:

<p>Those are just a few of the amazing projects come out of <a href="http://concentricsky.com/">Concentric Sky</a>.  I&rsquo;m psyched to not just have a mobile and web development partner, but one of such high caliber.  I&rsquo;ve worked closely with their leadership, project managers and developers on a couple projects, lead their team on conference panels, and have made a habit of going out to lunch with members of their team when I&rsquo;m in town. &nbsp;
<p>Now, in the future, when I get asked for recommendations of a mobile, web or API development shop, I&rsquo;ll be sending them to Concentric Sky.  Feel free to <a href="http://concentricsky.com/contact">contact them directly</a> and let them know I sent you, or you can contact me and I&rsquo;m happy to introduce you to their team.

<hr />

<p><a href="http://defragcon.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/defrag-2012/Defrag-2012-Conference.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>I was trying to explain the experience of being at the <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag Conference</a>, to a friend&nbsp;the other day.  We are both gearing up for the event, next week (November 14th &amp; 15th), in Broomfield Colorado, and he had never been to one so I wanted to share a little about what the experience is like.
<p>The Defrag event is organized by Eric Norlin, who also organizes Gluecon and Blur conferences, all at the Omni Interlocken resort in Broomfield.  Each of Eric&rsquo;s events have evolved each year, but currently reflect the following focus:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://gluecon.com/2012/">Gluecon</a></strong> - Cloud, Mobile, APIs, Big Data for developers</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag</a></strong> - What's coming next  in technology</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.blurcon.com/">Blur</a></strong> - Human Computer Interaction (HCI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Eric has a unique way of bringing together the leaders from the space to discuss relevant technologies in a very intimate space.  The Omni Interlocken resort is a very key element to the events, which makes it unlike other events I attend.
<p>The first of Eric&rsquo;s events I attended was a Gluecon, several years back.  We drove out to the location, and I remember thinking, &ldquo;oh man we are going to be stuck way out here for 4 days&rdquo;.  But as I learned, that is the point.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/defrag-2012/Omni-Interlocken.png" alt="" width="525" />
<p>You are stuck in a very intimate location where you will eat killer grub, including beef sliders and drink some kick-ass craft beers while rubbing elbows and having deep technical and philosophical conversations with the deepest thinkers and leaders in our space.
<p>Defrag and Glue are part of a small group of events I recommend you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span></strong> miss in the space.  I&rsquo;m pretty burnt out on large technology conferences, but the value you walk away with from Defrag can&rsquo;t be found anywhere else--putting Defrag in entireley different category for me.
<p>I hope to see you at Defrag next week. If your there, I&rsquo;ll buy you an IPA, while we talk APIs.

<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> should be the center of your API operations, with the most obvious use being for <a title="SDK repositories" href="/2012/10/25/sdk-management-for-your-api-with-github/">SDK repositories</a>, but Github offers a lot of other valuable tools that you can use to manage your API platform.
<p>One great use of Github is as an API issue management tool.  The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories, for processing by your development team.
<p>To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management.  Think of it as repository for your API itself.
<p>Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentially be part of the API product development cycle.

<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> isn't just for code.  Github can be used for HTML documents and PDF's as well.  This opens up endless possibilities for management of documents you wish to share with your developer ecosystem.
<p>One excellent example of this is publishing presentations from the various talks, hackathons and conferences you present at.  When you are done with a talk and would like to share with your community, you can just expose it as a PDF or HTML document, and push to Github.
<p>You can also use this same approach for how-to guides and training materials you want to make available for your developers.  Allowing them to download and fork, or even follow the changes on Github, for the richest training materials an API provides.
<p>Github provides a powerful way for you to version, evolve and share your essential API resources with the community--keeping them in sync with all other activity around your API.

<p>I'm digging on this statement from Gil Elbaz @ Factual. &nbsp;<span>Gil is participating on a panel &ldquo;The Forest for the Trees: The Meanings of Data&rdquo; at the&nbsp;<a href="http://techonomy.com/conf/12-tucson/" target="_blank">Techonomy Conference</a>&nbsp;</span><span>on Sunday, November 11th in Tucson, Arizona at the Ritz Carlton.&nbsp;</span>

<p>title: ‘API KPIs Should Be Optimized for Developer Success’</p>

<p>image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/funnel.jpeg</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/funnel.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>When it comes to measuring the success of an API, we often experience a lack meaningful metrics, with <a title="many companies only tracking the number of new developers and quantity of API calls" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/15/developing-more-meaningful-api-metrics/">many companies only tracking the number of new developers and quantity of API calls</a>.  Going beyond these basic API metrics and identifying true performance indicators (KPI), will be essential if you want to find success with your API.
<p>To speak in a more traditional marketing sense, a pretty standard sales funnel can be used to set the stage, defining the intake of developers as the top of your funnel, paid accounts and production applications the bottom of your APIs funnel--giving you a common framework for hanging KPIs on. &nbsp;
<p>However, when using a sales funnel to frame your API marketing efforts, be careful of being blinded that success will all be all about moving developers from the top, to the bottom of your funnel.  While this is definitely a large part of your efforts, there are plenty of good things that can happen within the funnel that will further drive users into the funnel as well as build trust and evangelism efforts that can be essential to the growth of your API ecosystem.
<p>When planning your API sales funnel, the top is all about bringing in new registrations and the bottom should reflect the business objectives of your API.  But your funnel flow shouldn't always consist of direct flow to the bottom--think about what other beneficial activities can happen within the funnel:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition</strong> -   Finding new developers who understand your API and market</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Marketing</strong> - Tweets and other social media exhaust for users</li>
<li><strong>Story Building</strong> - New stories you can tell about the value your API delivers</li>
<li><strong>Idea Generation</strong> - Creative ideas around how to use your API</li>
<li><strong>Feedback</strong> - Quality feedback from developers about how to make your API better</li>
<li><strong>Evangelists</strong> - Develop the next generation of developer evangelists and advocates</li>
<li><strong>Brand</strong> - Awareness of your brand and the value it represents</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong> - The trust of developers who will use your API to solve problems in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these activities can boost the strength of your operations, others can feed the bottom line and meet your funnel objectives, but all of them will work to bring more developers into the top of the funnel--helping you scale.
<p>To properly define your API funnel, you need to begin by profiling developers, as they come in the door, and try to figure out where they fit.  Don&rsquo;t assume all developers will be there to build production ready app and drive revenue for your company.  Developers come in all shapes and sizes.  Get to know your developers, who they are and understand where they fit into the equation.  Don&rsquo;t scare off developers who can benefit the ecosystem with an aggressive sales approach..
<p>When establishing and evolving the key performance indicators for your API, make sure be developer centric in your measurements and decisions--don&rsquo;t make them just about monetization and the bottom line.  If you optimize for developer success, when it comes to web APis you&rsquo;ll often find success in all other areas of your API operations.

<p>I call it being an evangelist, but it has other names, such as advocate or ambassador.  Someone who is good at evangelism, in my opinion, starts with a love of hacking but is also having a love of helping others learn and understand technology.  I can&rsquo;t help being an evangelist, it&rsquo;s just part of my personality.
<p>These days, I get enough requests for evangelists, so I decided to start finding passionate hackers within specific communities to help fill requests.  Some requests for evangelists are full time positions, some part time, while others involve just going to meetups and hackathons in evenings and on weekends as needed.
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m on the hunt for some passionate hacker personalities in New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Austin, Atlanta and Portland.  If you live in these cities, are passionate about API, mobile, social and the cloud--you should consider a life of evangelism.
<p>Even if you aren&rsquo;t quite sure what an evangelist, advocate or ambassador does, feel free to reach out.  Chances are you are already attending meetups, hackathons and already doing evangelism activities--you just aren&rsquo;t getting paid or receiving incentives to do so.
<p>Visit the <a title="interested in evangelism" href="/interested_in_evangelism.php">interested in evangelism page</a> and I can answer your questions and get you plugged in. &nbsp;

<p>One very powerful way to use <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> within your API strategy is for developer profiling.  This approach requires the deployment of another Github solution, API <a title="Developer login using Github" href="/2012/10/29/api-developer-login-using-github/">Developer login using Github</a>.
<p>After you implement authentication for you API using Github, the <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/github">Github API</a> provides a wealth of opportunity for you to learn more about developers.
<p>The types of developers you want for your API are also developers who have an active Github profiles.  Using Github, you can immediately tell if someone is an active developer based upon their presence and usage of the social coding network.
<p>Github provides basic profile details, like where a developer lives and which programming language they use.  You can also see which other tools and code they following and commit to, giving an overall profile of their developer lifestyle.
<p>Using Github you will also be able to tell if a user has downloaded or forked your own API SDK's, giving you insight into how well your SDK"s are being received and used.   There are endless ways you can use Github to stay in tune with your developers, but first you have to employ <a title="Github authentication as part of your API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/09/05/provide-api-developers-with-github-login-using-singly/">Github authentication as part of your API strategy</a>--then get to work profiling developers, and better understand who they are.

<hr />

<p>I spend a lot of time trying to find company logos and a little blurb about what a company does. &nbsp;You'd think in this cloudy API driven world there would a simpler way. &nbsp;
<p>I decided to create my own solution. &nbsp;I created an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/about.json" target="_blank">about.json file for API Evangelist</a>.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4003224.js?file=about.json"></script>
<p>When you need my company logo, a quick description about API Evangelist or other key information like my Twitter account or Blog RSS, you know where to find it.
<p>Now, could you please create one for your company? &nbsp;You can copy my about.json above, go to <a href="http://jsoneditoronline.org/">JSON Editor Online</a>, paste it in and create your own. &nbsp;When done, make sure and save to your desktop as text file and upload to the root of your site. &nbsp;
<p>I'll always take a look at http://example.com/about.json first to see if a company has it, before Googling on my own for a logo and about blurb.
<p>Maybe some day, every site will have one.

<p>title: ‘Help EFF Make Case For No Copryight on APIs’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/electronic-frontier-foundation-logo.gif</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/electronic-frontier-foundation/electronic-frontier-foundation-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/no-copyrights-apis-help-us-make-case">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) needs our help</a> to explain to the Federal Circuit Court on why there should <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong> be copyrights on APIs.  As EFF published today:
<blockquote><em>Earlier this year, we applauded District Court Judge Alsup for getting it right and holding that, as a matter of law, one could not copyright APIs. The case, Oracle v. Google, is now on appeal to the Federal Circuit, where a three-judge panel is going to revisit Judge Alsup&rsquo;s ruling.</em></blockquote>
<p>The EFF is soliciting the our assistance in how to help build the case, asking for feedback on two example areas:
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Software reimplementing someone else&rsquo;s API, calling someone else&rsquo;s API, or any other uses of third-party APIs for interoperability, competition, or innovation.</li>
<li>Reimplementation of an API, where the resulting software benefitted the original API creator, perhaps by increasing the creator&rsquo;s user base or otherwise benefitted the developer community</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we are in the infancy of API deployment, so it&rsquo;s going to be tough to find many solid examples. &nbsp;But I think the two areas we can demonstrate the importance of no copyright on APIs, is within two business sectors that evolved on the web, using APIs and are critical to business and government today:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - As EFF said, Eucalyptus reimplemented the Amazon API to offer a competing cloud storage service.  You also saw the same with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/09/01/google-storage-for-developers-interoperability/">first implementation of Google Developer Storage</a> and up to &amp; other providers: <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/dunkel">Dunkel Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="https://www.hosteurope.de/produkte/Cloud-Storage">âHost Europe Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/greenqloud">GreenQloud Storage Qloud</a>, <a href="http://www.scaleupcloud.com/">ScaleUp Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.mh.connectria.com/rp/order/cloud_storage_index">âConnectria Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/lunacloud">Lunacloud</a>, and <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/dreamobjects">DreamObjects Cloud Storage</a>&nbsp;providing unprecedented interoperability for cloud computing.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Same as with cloud you have seen competition pop up for both Twitter and Facebook, mimicking their platform and APIs.  Platforms like <a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a> have copied Twitter&rsquo;s social network providing competition, and potential value to Twitter users by allowing developers to use App.net for things they can't use Twitter for.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think another clear example of open API design being used to help users is Pinboard&rsquo;s implementation of the Delicious API:
<ol class="mainlist"> 
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="85" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/pinboard/pinboard-icon.png" alt="" width="75" /></td>
<td><strong><a title="Pinboard" href="http://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard</a></strong> - Wherever possible the Pinboard API uses the same syntax and method names as the Delicious V1 API. This implementation allowed users to seamlessly export Delicious bookmarks accumulated over several years to Pinboard when Delicious was sold by Yahoo. &nbsp;If Yahoo had copyrighted their API design, Pinboard could never have done this.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</ol>
<p>A slightly different approach to offering benefit to users via an open API design is surrounding the Instagram API:
<ol class="mainlist"> 
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="85" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/instagram/instagram-icon-250.png" alt="" width="75" /></td>
<td><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/">Instagram API </a></strong>- In 2010, before Instagram itself launched an API, a passionate developer launched a rogue API for the popular photo sharing platform based upon Instagram's own internal API design they used to drive the popular iPhone application.  The move showed Instagram the demand for an API, and after designing and launching their own asked the rogue API to shut down.  A slightly different scenario, but if API design was copyright this may not have been possible.  We&rsquo;ve seen the same approach with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/25/lack-of-pinterest-api-is-a-lack-of-api-business-strategy/">rogue Pinterest API</a>, but it hasn&rsquo;t resulted in the same response from Pinterest unfortunately.   But community driven API design has a lot of potential for opening up companies and encouraging API innovation.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</ol>
<p>I strongly believe that APIs have massive potential for innovation across many business sectors.  The copyright of API design would eliminate much of this potential.  Open API design allows for healthy competition, interoperability and innovation as we&rsquo;ve seen with cloud and social.  But open API design can also augment the lack of standards through market leadership, helping grow healthy industries and essential online utilities.  Amazon EC2 and S3 design standards are clear examples of this in the wild.
<p>Cloud and social are fast become essential components in our everyday lives, but open API have the potential to become mission critical with implementations like <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a>.  Some API designs are just too important to be proprietary.   I would argue Twitter, Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2 also fall into this category and need to remain open for the greater good.
<p>Open API design reuse represents the future of API communication.  Companies like <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a>, <a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a>, <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> and <a title="Zapier" href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> are building API aggregation, automation, and languages that very much rely on flexible API terms of use, as well as API design reuse.  Copyright of API design would prevent companies from openly competing, offering redunancy as well as limit new and more meaningful APIs to be derived from existing API implementations.
<p>Without the ability to copy, mimic, mashup, translate, emulate and re-define API design we won&rsquo;t be able to become more fluent in communicating via web and mobile apps using APIs.  We are just beginning to understand online communication via the power of mobile apps.  As we still grunt and groan while communicating via APIs--let&rsquo;s not stunt our growth and development with allowing API design to be copyrighted.

<p>We are wasting no time getting the&nbsp;<a href="/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>&nbsp;back on track, after being put on hold because of hurricane Sandy. With the current status of New York City, it&rsquo;s subways, airports, there is no way the event could have happened--we made the right decision to cancel.
<p>We are currently discussing the best dates for rescheduling in January and February of 2013, and are hopeful that we will have date finalized next week.
<p>While we are awaiting that process we figured we&rsquo;d spend some time and discuss the session lineup for the conference. We are rather proud of the keynote, panel and session lineup we&rsquo;ve pulled together, but we feel we can make it even better.
<p>So we are going to hold a Google Hangout today at 11:30 AM PDT / 2:30 PM EDT, to discuss the API Strategy &amp; Practice session lineup and invite you to participate. If you&rsquo;d like to be a participant in the hangout, email me at&nbsp;<a title="kinlane@gmail.com" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e3e1e6e4e9e6edc8efe5e9e1e4a6ebe7e5"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3b505255575a555e7b5c565a525715585456">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>and if you&rsquo;d like to just watch the hangout, follow&nbsp;<a title="@apistrat" href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@apistrat</a>&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ll tweet out the Youtube link right before.

<p>When it comes to <a title="API Service Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">API service providers</a>, there is one brand that I would say is widely known, but when we are talking about APIs, often gets overlooked.  That company is Intel.
<p>In addition to a whole suite of SOA and Cloud Middleware, all with an emphasis on security--<a title="REST Web Services &amp; API Security" href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/solutions/rest-web-services-api-security">Intel has a REST Web Services Gateway</a>.   This provides a simple solution to the number concern I get from potential API owners:  <strong><em>How do I secure my API?</em></strong>
<p>The Intel REST Web Services Gateway provides:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Invoke Security Token Service credential mapping or validation</li>
<li>Ensure throttling and SLAs by REST service</li>
<li>Extend Enterprise audit and compliance to WOA and REST</li>
<li>Detailed XML threat prevention and payload inspection</li>
<li>Service virtualization, proxy, and abstraction as a policy enforcement point</li>
<li>REST API security and management</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/white-papers/enterprise-security-for-rest-soap/">summary of the product</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/data-sheets/expressway-service-gateway/">full data sheet</a>, as well as some video tutorials over at <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/solutions/rest-web-services-api-security">Intel</a>.

<p>If you would like to know more, or have questions make sure and come to <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> this week in NYC.  Intel will have a session on their approach to APIs, as well as be on a panel that I&rsquo;ll be moderating on API service providers. &nbsp;Intel is also a <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">gold sponsor of API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>--the event wouldn't be happing if it wasn't for Intel. &nbsp;Thanks!
<p>If that isn&rsquo;t enough!  I will also be doing some workshops with Intel at the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/technology/summits/na/applications/">Gartner AADI conference in Las Vegas</a>, the end of November. &nbsp;So you will have another opportunity to speak with both of us.
<p>If you can&rsquo;t make to either New York or Las Vegas, drop me an email and I&rsquo;ll get you in touch with Intel.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />As with most social platforms, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> provides oAuth for their platform, allowing developers to provide secure credentials and authentication for their users via a Github account.
<p>Service providers like <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> are providing two click authentication using Github's oAuth.  This allows any website or app to offer their users the ability to login with their Github profile.
<p>Allowing authentication via Github is no brainer for API providers. Why require users to create yet another login, or even use <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> oAuth?  Allow them to login and retrieve API keys via the one social profile that reflects the programmer side of their online profile.
<p>Github login can be implemented in any programming language, and because it is oAuth, it is something end users will understand.  In addition to providing easy authentication, you will be able to immediately see other important data about a developer that is available via their Github profile.
<p>Consider the potential of using Github authentication as part of your API strategy.

<p>One API I&rsquo;ve been watching grow and evolve from day one is the <a title="Pearson Developer Community" href="http://developer.pearson.com/">Pearson Developer Community</a>.  I first wrote about them when Peasron <a title="announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/10/pearson-plans-api-platform-to-unlock-content/">announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content</a> in May of 2011.  Then in <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/16/re-inventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">August 2011 they launched three APIs</a>:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/longman-dictionary/apimethod/get-entry-0/189/overview">Longman Dictionary</a></strong> - The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English is the flagship Longman dictionary</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/ft-press/apimethod/get-book-block/189/overview">FT Press</a></strong> - FT Press provides essential insights from the best business books and original writings by leading business thinkers</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/eyewitness-guides/apimethod/entries-guide/189/overview">Eyewitness Guides</a> </strong>- The DK Eyewitness Travel Guides show you what others only tell you</li>
</ul>
<p>After Pearson got acquainted with the ins and outs of API evangelism, and supporting the Pearson developer community, they <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/18/launching-apis-one-book-at-a-time/">released two more APIs</a> this year:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/pearson-kitchen-manager/apimethod/courses/190/overview">Pearson Kitchen Manager</a> </strong>- Pearson Kitchen Manager is a valuable resource for food enthusiasts and chefs alike, featuring a vast collection of recipes from bestselling Pearson textbooks of top culinary schools</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/nursing-health-survival-guides-api/apimethod/get-article/189/overview">Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API</a> </strong>- The best-selling Pearson Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guide series is the UK's premier quick reference, aide memoire support for health and social care students and professionals while in practice and studying</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like Pearson is really finding a rhythm with identifying content to make available, as well as the right approach to deploying as APIs. They have 3 more high value publishing APIs available:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/penguin-classics-api/apimethod/get-article-1/189/overview">Penguin Classics API </a></strong>- The Penguin English Library is a collection of 100 of the best novels ever written in the English Language. Classics like Jane Eyre, Dracula and Great Expectations </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/dkimages-api/apimethod/list-images/189/overview">dkimages API</a> </strong>- The dkimages API is an encyclopaedic collection of 90,000 high-resolution images</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/peachpit-visual-quickstart-guides-api/apimethod/get-article-0/190/overview">Peachpit Visual QuickStart Guides API</a></strong> - With more than 12 million copies in print, Visual QuickStart Guides have been a vital part of the computer book category for years</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a total of 8 APIs endpoints Pearson has made available via their developer center--providing some valuable text and image content that developers can use to build web and mobile apps.
<p>What impresses me with Pearson is that they&rsquo;ve found an efficient way to identify valuable assets within legacy inventory, part them out and expose these valuable parts and pieces as APIs.  Essentially giving them a new life--driving web, mobile and tablet applications.
<p>Pearson has deployed their developer center with all the <a title="essential API building blocks" href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">essential API building blocks</a>, while also executing an efficient API evangelism campaign around their APis, and delivering value to developers.  It&rsquo;s a commendable operation for such a big publisher.
<p>If you are interested in hearing more about what Pearson is up to with their APIs, you can catch them at the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference this week in NYC</a>.  Pearson will be presenting as part of a media API session as well as helping sponsor the event, to make sure we can all get together an have these conversations.

<p>Code samples in a variety of languages are how API owners help developers understand an API in the language that makes the most sense to them.
<p>Not all developers will understand REST, HTTP and other things you might take for granted.  Very simple code samples will help demonstrate an APIs functionality, making the learning process a hands-on experience.
<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> provides a very lightweight tool for publishing API code samples, that can be embedded on any website, called <a title="Gist" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a>.  You can easily copy / paste a working code sample into a Gist and Github returns a lightweight, embeddable JavaScript that you can use in documentation, blog posts and any where you will need to share with users.
<p>Github Gists can be a much sexier, and easier to implement alternative to html &lt;code&gt; tags. While also allowing easy management and versioning of API code samples alongside <a title="Github API SDK Management" href="/2012/10/25/sdk-management-for-your-api-with-github/">Github API SDK repositories</a>.

<p>The most common use of <a title="Github" href="https://www.github.com">Github</a> by API providers is to publish API SDK's to the popular social coding platform.  If you look at most of the the top API providers in operation today, you will find they are actively using Github to not just manage and publicize their API SDK's, but actively interact with their developer ecosystem in the process.
<p>Github provides the necessary workflow for initial design, development and publicizing of API SDKs, allowing owners to create separate repositories for web-based SDKs like PHP, Python and Ruby and mobile SDKs for iOS, Android and Windows mobile.
<p>By making API SDK's public repositories on Github you get all the code management benefits of Github, but also make them available for social interaction by your developers.  They will be able to download, fork and potentially commit additions and modifications back to an SDK's repository, allowing owners to harness the creative potential of the developer community.
<p>Active Github repositories for an API are an essential part of any API ecosystem.  If you don't use Github for anything else, make sure you publish your SDK's as a public repository. It will make the development of your client libraries a much more social experience, providing huge benefits for your API.

<p>I get so busy sometimes my stories pile up. Some only seeing the light of day when I get caught up on research, projects, travels and speaking. On story I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write for almost 3 months now is about <a title="APIPhany" href="http://www.apiphany.com/">APIphany</a>, one of the new generation of API providers.  I met the APIphany team in person when I went out to Washington DC in August.
<p>The APIphany team was cool enough to come out and support my <a title="API Craft Washington DC" href="/2012/08/18/api-craft-washington-dc/">API Craft meetup in DC</a>, then the next morning I went out to their offices and met the rest of the team.  APIphany sees the industry very similar to me, and believe in self-service, pay as you go API services that allow for anyone to innovate around APIs.
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching their progress and they have 3 very cool projects made public so far:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a> -</strong> Developer area for Washington Post, providing some endpoints including an Issue Engine API, White House Visitors Log API,  and the Campaign Finance API</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.ridemetro.apiphany.com/">Houston Metro</a> -</strong> Developer portal for the Houston area, providing public transit in the Houston metropolitan area for bus and rail</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.votinginfoproject.org/">The Voting Information Project (VIP)</a> </strong>- Offering APIs and developers tools to provide voters with access to customized election information, helping them navigate the voting process and cast an informed vote</li>
</ul>
<p>When I met the team in August, they described how they were building out so many custom projects for customers that were API driven, they decided to standardize their approach and offer a product.  The APIphany API management solution provides all the standard offerings we are getting used to in the space:
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-team.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Administration Portal</li>
<li>Developer Portal</li>
<li>Key Management</li>
<li>Access Control and Security</li>
<li>Subscriptions and Billing</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Analytics and Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>APIphany also gives you the ability to host the API in a variety of cloud providers, and my favorite is they provide you with an API to manage your API.  The team has been building and managing web APIs for government, enterprise, and non-profit customers since 2006--so they get it.
<p><a href="http://www.apiphany.com/">APIphany</a> is also supporting the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> in New York City, November 1st and 2nd.  If you want to meet the team, you should make sure your there--if not just head over to <a title="apiphany.com" href="http://apiphany.com">apiphany.com</a> to talk with them directly.

<p>While I was <a href="/2012/10/24/my-presentation-to-the-presidential-innovation-fellows/">out in Washington DC this week</a>, one of the Presidential Innovation Fellows in my workshop was from the Department of Energy, and shared one of the best examples of APIs delivering value I&rsquo;ve seen in awhile.
<p>The <a href="https://bioenergykdf.net/">US Department of Energy has developed the Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework</a> (KDF), which is a platform for researchers and engineers from national laboratories, academia, and private industries to upload files, customize information online, and exchange knowledge with each other.
<p>The Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework provides acess to a landmark &ldquo;Billion-Ton&rdquo; bioenergy study on fuel resources, providing a wealth of information from a variety of researchers.   The study generated a large volume of interest, and resulted in numerous requests for raw data disclosure from the researchers.
<p>In response the project deployed a web API, providing direct access to raw data, saving the resources necessary to reach out to researchers as well as the researchers valuable time in processing requests and providing data.
<p>The US Department of Energy estimates they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saved $882,000</span> in operational costs and researchers valuable time by bundling the API with the bioenergy study.
<p>This is why I evangelize APIs.  The US Department of Energy case study demonstrates not just the value of APIs, but how they can actually make government more efficient and save tax payers money.
<p>In addition I strongly advocate that&nbsp;<a title="APIs and raw data access should be default" href="http://kinlane.com/2012/05/15/diving-deeper-into-data-from-research/">APIs and raw data access should be default</a> for all studies and resulting reports, allowing anyone to dive deeper into the research and provide additional insights.

<p>Out of date API documentation is by far the most common mistake API providers make, and also the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">number one pain point for API developers</a>.  It makes sense that you will want to keep your API documentation in sync with each version of your API, and one way to handle this is to version them both, using Github.
<p>To use Github for your API documentation, all you need to do is create an single public repository, which you can use to manage HTML versions of your API docs.  By putting your API documentation in its own repository you can keep the version of the API code repository in sync with it's corresponding documentation.
<p>With the API documentation in Github, you can then easily publish to your API area or just allow developers to go directly to the Github repository and browse documentation there.
<p>To help you edit your API documentation, you can use tools like <a href="http://prose.io/">prose.io</a>,&nbsp;which will allow even non-developers to assist in maintaining API documentation, with all changes stored neatly in a central Github repository.
<p>Storing API docs in Github will also make them more portable.  Some developers may wish to download a copy for offline work, or just prefer having locally for their own reference.
<p>With the right approach to managing your API docs with Github, you can easily keep them up to date, in sync with your API, while also making them easily accessible by all API consumers--without much of the headache often associated with managing API documentation.

<p>I spent two hours with a handful of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a> in Washington DC yesterday.  They were some super savvy folks from a wide variety of agencies and backgrounds including education, energy and health.
<p>During my two hours with them I walked through several areas of  the API industry, from my perspective, including:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>History of APIs</li>
<li>API Planning &amp; Design</li>
<li>API Development</li>
<li>Business of APIs</li>
<li>API Service Providers</li>
<li>API Tools, Services, Platforms</li>

<li>API Evangelism</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s Next for APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>You can access my <a href="/federal-digital-strategy/innovation-fellows/">innovation fellows presentation off API Evangelist</a>, I&rsquo;ll leave it up permanently.  It&rsquo;s minus all my commentary and banter, but hopefully it will give you an idea of what I covered.  If you&rsquo;d like a custom presentation on it, let me know and I&rsquo;ll see if I can find a slot to do a Google Hangout.
<p>I had a blast talking to the Presidential Fellows, and I hope that I left them with some value that will help them be successful in their various initiatives.  They are already halfway through their sprint, and have a lot of expectations put on them.
<p>I will be following their progress closely and publish any stories I can on their progress.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>

<p>I had a great discussion with a friend who works in federal government yesterday.  We were talking about various ways to &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">successfully</span>&rdquo; deploy APIs within the federal government.  She gets APIs, understands the benefits, but she had some very realistic perspectives on where API deployment within the federal government can fail.
<p>While discussing this with her, we kept coming back to two points:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Garbage Littering the Internet</strong> - With some of the tools, making it easier to deploy APIs, the potential to just post meaningless and worthless data sets grows</li>
<li><strong>Lack of API Ownership </strong>- There are big movements to get APIs deployed, but then very little ownership once its up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding worthless APIs being deployed, I think we can mitigate this by providing some sort of ranking or voting systems for APIs, allowing developers to upvote or downvote and add some critical feedback on what is right, or what is wrong.  This will allow the &ldquo;cream&rdquo; to rise to the top, and everything else just disappear from view.
<p>Next, her perspective on lack of API ownership after an API is launched, is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very big problem</span>.  It is something I see in the public sector all the time.  Everyone gets excited about standing up an API, but once it&rsquo;s in the wild, they lose enthusiasm--leaving the API to whither on the vine.
<p>APIs will not succeed if they do not have an owner.  For technology companies, it might make sense for them to have an API as a product, assemble a team and dedicate resources to the API. &nbsp;Even hire an evangelist or advocate.
<p>When it comes to government, maybe we need a different approach.  A sort of personal API deployment platform like <a title="Socrata API Foundry" href="http://www.socrata.com/api-foundry/">Socrata API Foundry</a>, that will let anyone publish a dataset as API--allowing any individual to achieve "machine readable by default", as <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">directed by President Obama back in May</a>.
<p>By empowering data owners within government to publish themselves, and give them the tools to handle the business of their APIs, and interact directly with consumers, maybe we can ensure APIs have an owner--one that cares about the data and truly understand the value it offers.
<p>Just some quick thoughts, from a great conversation.  I will flush out more ideas on this as soon as I can.

<p>After talking to several people I was directed to a gentleman by the name of Warren Wilbee (<a href="https://twitter.com/wwilbee" target="_blank">@wwilbee</a>), Director of ISV Evangelism at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a>.  Wilbee is a passionate evangelist, one that isn't just externally evangelizing, he is actively working to evolve internal culture and options about the value of hackathons at Microsoft.  When I got on the phone with him, he said the reason I was directed to him is because he had recently circulated an internal memo regarding the makeup and value of hackathons.
<p>He feels strong that hackathons are very useful, you get the opportunity to get X number of people into a room, doing exactly what you want--delivering a very direct result. "Hackathons are purpose built", when you put on a hackathon for developers you get to define exactly what you, sending the desired message your company wants developers to receive, says Wilbee. By contrast, sponsoring a hackathon is a very different exercise and value proposition--proceed with caution.  The hackathon organizer gets to define the purpose and drive the outcomes. The sponsor will not have access to this value, potentially excluding you from all the marketing or social "halo" produced at the event.  Sometimes there are opportunities to offer a prize that will be in-line with the organizers purpose, but just flashing your logo will not deliver much value to your company.

<p>When you do put on a hackathon, Wilbee is passionate about it being a "participatory event". Get your people to come and participate, don't just require them to show up, make it part of their responsibility to be involved.  There is a social and community aspect to hackathons, "the shared experience of being in a room at 3am, committed to a common goal is a galvanizing, bonding experience." This is something you get by just showing up for a short period of time or just sponsoring an event.
<p>In Wilbee&rsquo;s opinion APIs and software platforms are here to stay, and hackathons do a great job educating people about the value they deliver.  We will definitely see more organized efforts around these types of events, across many business sectors, in the future.

<p>title: ‘Open Source Your API With Github’</p>

<hr />

<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>&nbsp;is a frequently used service in the toolbox of API owners.  The most common use of Github is for publishing API SDKs in a variety of languages and platforms.  But when it comes to truly being an "open API", some API owners are actually open sourcing their API design using Github.
<p>Open sourcing the design of your API will not be sensible for every provider.  Many companies are looking to ensure developers use their API, maintaining an advantage over competitors.  However in some cases, open sourcing the design of your API is a way to ensure interoperability between partners or among mutliple companies within a certain business sector.
<p>Simple examples of an API design might be for common systems like blogs, news, links, calendars or other API designs that don't deliver any sort of proprietary offerings.  If you are looking to ensure synchronicity between say, the calendar of multiple organizations, developing a single API and open sourcing the design and possibly a version of it in multiple programming languages, might make sense.
<p>With a consistent API design, and code to deploy the API, any organization can download or fork the Github code, deploy the API for themselves--ensuring consistency and interoperability between any deployment. If a single organizations has unique needs, they can extend and commit the code back to Github, allowing the central repository manager to decide if it is a change that should be added to the core offering.
<p>Not all APIs are created equal. &nbsp;Consider the possibility of actually open sourcing your API, the benefits it might bring to others, as well as your organization--they might exceed keeping it closed and proprietary.
<p>This approach to using Github, is by far the truest meaning of the word, "Open API".

<p>When <a href="/2012/10/20/the-right-partnership-for-the-api-strategy--practice-conference/">3Scale and I first decided to do the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> in New York, one of the first people I reached out to about speaking and sponsoring the event, was Laura Merling (<a href="https://twitter.com/magicmerl">@magicmerl</a>), SVP Applications Enablement Platform and Strategy at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent</a>.
<p>As soon as I told her about the event, she said &ldquo;We are in! What do we need to do, to support it!&rdquo;
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to have Laura kick off the event on Thursday, November 1st with a keynote as well as having <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">Alcatel-Lucent as a gold sponsor.</a>
<p><a href="https://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/sponsors/alcatel-lucent-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard Laura speak, I highly recommend making sure you are there.  She always has great insight into the success Alcatel-Lucent is having within emerging markets and the telco space. &nbsp;Also, her talks are always positive, energetic and demonstrate leadership in the space--something I want my daughter Kaia to experience.
<p>During Laura&rsquo;s keynote I&rsquo;m sure we will here more about <a href="/2012/09/06/alcatel-lucent-open-sources-their-api-management-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent's new open source offering, API Grove</a>, as well as their openly licensed <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/alcatel-lucent-creates-methodology-for-apis-and-makes-available-under-creative-commons/">API lifecycle and methodology</a>.
<p>Make sure you <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">get registered</a> today, before the event is sold out--there aren&rsquo;t many tickets left. &nbsp;I'll see you there.

<p>The <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> is kicking off in 12 days in New York City.  The event will be keynotes, sessions and panels from over <a title="60 leading individuals across all sectors of the API industry" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">60 leading individuals across all sectors of the API industry</a>.
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to have an API industry event that was about ideas, practice and strategy, not just about companies, their products and clients for a while now.  This is something that I could never achieve on my own.  I just don&rsquo;t have the money or all the connections to bring everyone together.
<p>To make API Strategy &amp; Practice happen it took the right partnership.  That partnership is with <a title="API service provider 3Scale" href="https://www.3scale.net/">API service provider 3Scale</a>.  The 3Scale team views the industry much like I do, that by openly educating people about the benefits of APIs and discussing the technical, business and political challenges we face in the industry--we can truly make change across all business sectors. &nbsp;Allowing all of us to be succesful in whatever products and services we provide.
<p>Through the regular discussion I have with the 3Scale team, we discovered our shared desire to have such an API industry event.  We discussed what the event would look like, then quickly started figuring out what it would take to make it happen.  We felt we both had resources necessary to pull it off, and even though there is a lot of risk, that it was something that had to happen, for the benefit of the industry.
<p>Here we are, 8 weeks later, and the event is a reality.   I just wanted to say thanks to 3Scale for not just sharing my vision of the API industry, but also partnering with me to make this event a reality.  I hope all my readers can make it to the event and participate in the discussions about APIs, platforms, mobile, and how we can all work to solve the biggest challenges in the space. &nbsp;This discussion will allow all of us to make significant change across all business sectors and at all levels of government using APIs.

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/open.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>When I set out to put on an API industry event in early 2012, I had grand visions of what it would be.  Getting everyone together to discuss the best ideas, approaches the  industry has to offer--while also discussing the critical topics such as open APIs, developer rights, monetization, etc.
<p>Fast forward 10 months, and the event is a reality, and even though it doesn&rsquo;t exactly look like I imagined, it is damn close--with&nbsp;<a title="lots of amazing API discussions" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php">lots of amazing API discussions</a>.
<p>After I <a title="API event has 60 speakers" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">announced the event has 60 speakers</a>&nbsp;yesterday,  I saw a tweet from Dave Winer (<a title="@DaveWiner" href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">@davewiner</a>):
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 35px;">
<p>A conference about APIs with only speakers representing corporate APIs. Not one open API, so no interop. Lost.<a title="http://0ox.r2.ly/" href="https://t.co/VBmfy5nb">0ox.r2.ly</a>
&mdash; Dave Winer â® (@davewiner) <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/257727406872342528">October 15, 2012</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Now for those of you who don&rsquo;t read entire posts, I&rsquo;m NOT going after Dave.  We&rsquo;ve already tweeted back and forth and discussed, and he is supportive.  This post is about my feelings and thoughts on "open", and how we can all work together to make sure the industry is as open as possible.
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t see things as black and white.  When it comes to politics, life or the API industry.  To ability to snap our fingers and everything becomes open will not happen.  It will be a lot of hard work and be very painful.
<p>Next, I can honestly say there isn&rsquo;t anyone else in the space who is dedicated to open APIs as much as I am.  Sure Dave is much bigger name and has more history on this, but this is ALL I do.  Period.  I don&rsquo;t work on anything else. It is my day and night job.
<p>I have written constantly about the need for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/">open API building blocks</a>, <a title="open API billing and traffic control" href="/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">open API billing and traffic control</a>, all while constantly <a title="what open even means" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/30/public-api-vs-open-api/">asking what open even means</a>?  My evangelism has helped guide two of the service providers in the space to deliver the first enterprise grade open source API products, from <a title="WSO2" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager/">WSO2</a> and <a title="Alcatel-Lucent" href="http://apigrove.net/">Alcatel-Lucent</a>. &nbsp;While these products aren't everything I want, they are a start.
<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in constantly discussing what &ldquo;open&rdquo; means.  Is it free access, write capabilities, TOS, open source software under the hood, distributed technology, embracing open standards or is it just using the word, as many people feel comfortable with.  Through these open and honest conversations, I firmly believe we&rsquo;ll educate people and change their opinions one by one.
<p>This is one of my goals at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>.  At first glance it is easy to think the event might appear to be a corporate API lovefest, but let&rsquo;s scratch the surface a little bit:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Steve Klabnik</strong> - His keynote title is &ldquo;Why Open?&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Singly</strong> - I don&rsquo;t know anyone who cares more about open access to personal data than Singly&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - Tony and the gang are building amazing open source tools that facilitate API development</li>
<li><strong>Kirsten Jones</strong> - Kirsten&rsquo;s talk on educating owners and devs about HTTP is critical to the standard being used consistently across industry&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Temboo &amp; Webshell </strong>- These guys entire business rely upon open TOS allowing them to aggregate APIs and their existence provides real pressure for API owners to open up&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Hack Education</strong> - I&rsquo;m biased here.  But there is nobody in education working as tirelessly as my girlfriend Audrey Watters to open up data that is locked in education silos</li>
<li><strong>Donors Choose</strong> - An online charity that provides open data and APIs to make classrooms better&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Seabourne</strong> -  Seabourne has a suite of open source and open API products like Cumula that are transforming the government and making it more open and transparent</li>
<li><strong>Digital Strategy</strong> - I will be showcasing all the open tools, data and API initiatives across federal agencies--spearheaded by the GSA</li>
</ul>
<p>That is 10 out of 60 of the session and keynote speakers bringing open discussions to the table. &nbsp;There are also three panels that are purposefully designed to discuss open:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Building Great APIs: Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Business Models&nbsp;</li>
<li>APIs Platforms and Business Model Tradeoffs</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see there will be plenty of "open" discussions at API Strategy &amp; Practice--I&rsquo;m sure I could extract more if I had time.&nbsp;I would love to be able to have a perfectly open API industry and perfectly open API event, where everyone agreed on what open was, widely used open standards and came together to truly make the industry the best it can be.  But it doesn&rsquo;t exist.  We have to create it incrementally.
<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/index.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-home-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>API Strategy &amp; Practice took corporate sponsorship to make sure everyone has an event to come to.  Then we got to work bringing together the best minds (yes some corporate running closed APIs), to work together and discuss all the issues across a multitude of industries.&nbsp;
<p>I&rsquo;m 100% dedicated to the concept "open".  I don&rsquo;t work for any corporation, I&rsquo;m 100% independent so that I can have the loudest, most unrestrained voice possible. And I am dedicated&nbsp;to making sure the event is about the community, ideas, strategy and real discussions about the toughest challenges we face in the space.
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t there, participating in these discussions, I&rsquo;m afraid we are losing an important voice, and that is a lost opportunity.  So please contact me if you wish to be there.  I will make sure you get in. &nbsp;Otherwise, you will miss your chance to convince some of the folks who might not see open, in the same way you do.

<p>I finished updating the <a title="speaker linup" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">speaker lineup</a> for the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> this weekend.  While we still have a couple of panels to finalize and keynotes to announce, the speaker lineup is almost final.
<p>We have spent almost 8 weeks reaching out to leaders across the API industry, soliciting submissions for keynotes, panels and sessions.  It has been a lot of fun taking all the submissions and crafting the most compelling schedule as possible.
<p>It was really important to me that we didn&rsquo;t just&nbsp;discuss the common areas of the API industry, like service providers, REST, etc.  Not that these aren&rsquo;t relevant--they are!  But I wanted to make sure we discuss some areas that are critical to the space, but do not get much airtime.  Topics like API design and API life-cycle methodologies.
<p>I feel it is also critical to discuss where we are going, by covering topics like API automation, aggregation and building of programming frameworks on top of numerous APIs--trends that will allow us leap forward in how we consume and build apps on top of APIs.
<p>In the next two weeks I will be going through our lineup in detail and talking about the various API session tracks like music, social, payments, government and education to name a few prominent session areas.
<p><a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-home-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>While I started getting excited about this event back in August, it is really starting to get real.  I&rsquo;m really psyched about how this event has come together.  There will only be 250-300 people at the event, so it&rsquo;s going to be a very intimate opportunity for network with these API industry leaders.
<p>Make sure and <a title="register for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">register for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> ASAP, and I look forward to seeing you there.

<p>title: ‘Thoughts On Running a Successful Meetup From Jeremia Kimmelman of Mobile Mondays’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Jeremia-Kimelman.jpeg</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/healthy-developers/Jeremia-Kimelman.jpeg" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
<p>As part of my research into how to create <a title="Healthy Developer communities" href="http://kinlane.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=HealthyDevs">healthy developer communities</a>, I've been spending time reaching out to organizers of developer meetups in different cities so I can get some insight into what it takes to successfully organize and run a developer meetup.
<p>I recently spoke to Jeremia Kimelman (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeremiak">@jeremiak</a>)&nbsp;of <a title="Tout" href="http://www.tout.com/">Tout</a>, who runs <a title="Mobile Developer Mondays" href="https://www.meetup.com/momolabs/">Mobile Monday Developers</a>. Jeremia took over the Mobile Monday Developers with the idea that he would create a meet up format where tech companies could reach out to developers in a non-spammy way.  Companies could sponsor workshops and come in to deliver on topics like HTML5 or HTML5 vs Native Apps, and do it in a way that would add value to developers worlds.
<p>This is a model that I'm sure many tech companies would drool over, and very often view meetups as a perfect medium for this type of sales pitch.  As I reach out to meet up organizers I get the vibe that many of them already get solicited by companies in this fashion--either because they don't respond at all, or by being somewhat hostile to my questions about their meetup.
<p><a title="Tout" href="http://www.tout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/healthy-developers/Tout.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a>
<p>Jeremia was able to grow his meet ups from about 40 to 140 members with this model, but when I asked him if this was a model that could be replicated, he replied, "definitely not".  It doesn't create value. It doesn't solve the problems developers face and ultimately will doom your meetup to failure.
<p>As platform and API owners it's easy to drink our own kool-aid and think what we are offering is what developers want.  Jeremia said it's easy to project your business understanding onto developers, and assume they are concerned with things like monetization and in-app payments, when in reality these things might be the furthest thing from their minds.
<p>In an effort to truly deliver value to developers, Jeremia decided to pivot, working to better understand better how to make it a community owned event. By actually solving the problems developers face, making the event truly about learning and growth--not about what we perceive developers will need, and our products.
<p>Not all developers are created equal.  iPhone developers won't see things the same way as Android devs, and Windows mobile developers are going to have way different needs than others.  "Don't try to be everything to everyone", said Jeremia.
<p><a title="Meetups" href="https://www.meetup.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/meetup/meetup_logo.gif" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a>
<p>To make it about developers and to introduce community into the meetup he is playing around with letting attendees share the problems they personally face as developers, letting the group openly discuss the problem, provide solutions and help each other learn and grow.  This has the potential to bring value and community to the meetup in an organic way, not something that is imposed by him or a company.
<p>As API or platform evangelists I think it's easy to be self-centered, making hackathons and meet ups all about us. &nbsp;When in reality we should be actively working to just support developers as they are. &nbsp;We need to work with them to understand the problems they face, and help them find solutions--even if the solutions are not our products and services.
<p>In the end, if the developers are successful and we helped them get there.  It will go a long way in building trust, something that can't be established when just evangelizing or selling our company to developers at meetups around the country.

<p>title: ‘Heading to Washington DC to Talk APIs with Innovation Fellows’</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/federal-government/innovation-fellows/PresidentialInnovationFellows.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I was honored this month to receive an invitation from Todd Park (<a title="Todd Park" href="https://twitter.com/todd_park">@todd_park</a>), the U.S. Chief Technology Officer, on behalf of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows Program</a>, to come out to Washington DC and spend an afternoon coaching and working with some of the Presidential Innovation Fellows on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/opendata">Open Data Initiatives</a> project.
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows program brings together top innovators from the private&nbsp;sector, nonprofits, and academia with top innovators in government to collaborate on solutions that aim to deliver significant results in six months, while being supported by a broader community of interested citizens throughout the country.
<p>The objective of the OpenData Initiatives are centered around:
<blockquote><em>Stimulating a rising tide of innovation and entrepreneurship that utilizes government data to create tools that help Americans in numerous ways</em></blockquote>
<p>Working with the Innovation Fellows is just one areas I&rsquo;m <a title="working to change the way our government works using APIs" href="/federal_government.php">working to change the way our government works using APIs</a>.  I strongly feel that opening up our government, and evolving how it operates using web APIs is fundamental in bringing democracy into the 21st century.
<p>While speaking with the Innovation Fellows I will cover the usual material I have published here on API Evangelist:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of APIs" href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=History">History of APIs</a></strong> - Brief overview of the modern web API movement</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Building Blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">API Building Blocks</a> </strong>- The essential building blocks to a successful API</li>
<li><strong><a title="Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">API Service Providers</a></strong> - Roundup of the service providers who can help deploy APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Tools" href="/apitools/">API Tools</a></strong> - Pull together list of tools that can be used to design, deploy and manage APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Industries" href="/industries/">Industries</a></strong> - Some of the top industries putting APIs to use</li>
<li><strong><a title="Hackathons" href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hackathons</a></strong> - How hackathons are being used to drive innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>My intentions are to help share everything I know with the fellows to make sure they are well equipped to execute as part of the OpenData Initiatives.  APIs will be the underlying technology that stimulates innovation and the interface that allows Americans to develop tools that utilizes government data.
<p>APIs won&rsquo;t just be the underlying technology that drives this, the philosophies and methodologies that have fueled the current web API movement will be essential in changing culture in washington.  APIs have the potential to allow federal agencies to take inventory of the rich data and content they posses, and open up government, making their day to day operations much more public, and a truly participatory process.
<p>This process won&rsquo;t be giving the folks who run our government another thing to learn or do, it will allow them share much of heavy lifting associated with day to day operations with the public, corporations and nonprofits--leaving them much more nimble to accomplish their core mission.  APIs aren&rsquo;t just about technology change, they are about cultural change, and have the potential to be the change we want to see in washington.
<p>As I prepare my thoughts to go out to DC I wanted to put it out to my readers and see what you feel I should share with the Innovation Fellows about the API space.  What do they need to know to make their six month iniatives as impactful as possible?  How can I best distill down everything we&rsquo;ve learned in the public space about openness, transparency and developer ecosystems, so they get the true essence of this movement?
<p>Please share your thoughts below, tweet them <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> or email me directly at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cba2a5ada48baabba2aebdaaa5acaea7a2b8bfe5a8a4a6"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6e070008012e0f1e070b180f00090b02071d1a400d0103">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>

<p>
Lots of big news coming out of <a title="Apple's World Wide Developer Conference" href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">Apple's World Wide Developer Conference</a> (WWDC2011) in San Francisco today.
<p>
<span>We saw major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion. What really stood out was their new <a title="iCloud" href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>.</span>
<p>
<span>iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.</span>
<p>
<span>This means documents you've written, presentations you've prepared are available on any IOS device. You can view and edit the same document, in its latest state, on all your devices. And since iCloud automatically updates any changes you make, you don't even have to remember to save your work. </span>
<p>
<span>iCloud will also have a full set of APIs for developers to take advantage of, allowing them to implement iCloud storage, sync, and backup for documents into any application.</span>
<p>
<span>Apple's iCloud represents a continued evolution of the file system from being local to existing on the Internet and available on any device. This means that all design, collaboration, publishing and printing will move off the desktop as well. </span>
<p>
<span>More to come on iClouds role in <a title="self publishing and print on demand integration" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">self publishing and print on demand integration</a>.</span>

<p>title: ‘The API Evangelist Mission’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-evangelist-logo-400.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-logo-400.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>Many folks who encounter <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> think I'm working to evangelize a single API. &nbsp;I field so many questions about this I thought I would address by publishing an API Evangelist mission statement.&nbsp;
<p>The mission of API Evangelist is to educate business, nonprofit and government leaders about the value of APIs to their organizations.
<p>API Evangelist is made up of four properties:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Evangelist </strong>(<a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>) - Business of APIs</li>
<li><strong>API Voice</strong> (<a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>) - Politics of APIs</li>
<li><strong>API Stack</strong> (<a href="http://theapistack.com">theapistack.com</a>) - API discovery and ranking </li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends</strong> (<a href="http://hackweekends.com">hackweekends.com</a>) - Hackathon news and calendar</li>
</ul>
<p>With API Evangelist I strive to be the independent voice for the industry, providing the public with information about API:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Building Blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">Building Blocks</a></li>
<li><a title="API Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">Service Providers</a></li>
<li><a title="API Industries" href="/industries/">Industries</a></li>
<li><a title="API Tools" href="/apitools/">Tools</a></li>
<li><a title="API News" href="/news/">News</a></li>
<li><a title="API Analysis" href="/blog/">Analysis</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to provide a wealth of resources for those looking to design, develop and deploy APIs without bias towards a specific platform--allowing them to make an educated choice about what path they should take.
<p>To stay independent and operate API Evangelist, I need to bring in revenue, and keep things moving forward.  I strive to do this in as healthy of a way as possible, without giving away control over my attention and focus, and contribute as much as possible to resources I provide to the public.
<p>Areas I currently offer consulting services in are:
<p><strong>Strategy</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Evangelism</strong> - Design and oversight of companies API evangelism efforts</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Strategy</strong> - Design and oversight of a companies API monetization, business model and incubation approaches</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons</strong> - Targeting, planning and execution of hackathons</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Industry</strong> - Analysis of specific industries, API providers within and the opportunities available</li>
<li><strong>Markets</strong> - Identifying and deeper understanding of evangelism opportunities within specific cities and countries</li>
<li><strong>Developer Profiling</strong> - Targeting and profiling of developers within industries, markets and of specific, existing APIs</li>
<li><strong>Providers</strong> - Providing a deeper understanding of how specific APIs operate their API operations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Speaking</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Webinars</strong> - Participating in webinars with companies and individuals</li>
<li><strong>Conferences</strong> - Speaking and presenting at technology conferences</li>
<li><strong>Meetups</strong> - Speaking and participating at local meetups</li>
<li><strong>Workshops</strong> - Design and execution of workshops at existing events</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these consulting areas are design to provide as much value to the client, while amplifying the signal and content via the four API Evangelist properties, and other syndication opportunities, under a <a title="Creative Commons License" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">creative commons license</a>--enabling the public to consume and provide the greatest possible good for the API industry.
<p>I feel strongly that a wealth of open resources will help ensure a fast growing and healthy industry by educating non-developers, non-technical business leaders about the benefits of APIs and healthy developer and partner ecosystem.
<p>Please let me know how you can help support me in what I do, providing the industry with the information it needs to be successful, while also giving you what you need to successfully provide the services you offer.
<p>This <a href="http://kinlane.com/mission.php">mission statement is a permanent fixture on my central kinlane.com site</a>, it''s not just the API Evangelist mission, it is my mission.

<p>title: ‘NPR Adds Content Permission Control to their API’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/npr-logo.jpeg</p>

<hr />

<p><a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/npr/npr-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>NPR is defining new models for content distribution. One that other media providers can follow, when designing their API driven content delivery platforms.
<p>The <a href="http://dev.npr.org/">NPR Story API</a> provides digital access to NPR content and to other station content--allowing both NPR and stations to contribute and consume local and national news stories.
<p>In an effort to provide NPR stations with more control over the content they contribute to the platform for distribution, <a href="http://digitalservices.npr.org/post/npr-api-content-permissions-control">NPR Digital Services has introduced content permissions control via the NPR story API</a>.
<p>Currently content stored on the  Story API&rsquo;s platform can be retrieved by anyone with an API key--allowing content pushed across the network to be consumedd in 3 ways:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Create Once, Publish Everywhere</strong> - Stations and npr.org push content into the API and then pull the content onto other platforms, such as other station-owned web properties and mobile apps</li>
<li><strong>Station Networks</strong> - Content is shared between multiple stations in a content network, both on web sites and mobile apps</li>
<li><strong>National</strong> - Station content is featured on npr.org and NPR mobile apps with links back to station digital properties</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the new content permissions, stations can now control who is allowed to pull their content from the API.  The permissions work by allowing stations pushing content to specify whether the content should be:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Public to all</li>
<li>Public to the NPR station network</li>
<li>Public to a group of stations listed in a whitelist </li>
<li>Public to everyone except for stations on a blacklist</li>
</ul>
<p>The new changes allow stations to set these permissions at the individual story level, as well as create permission groups to add multiple stories to.
<p>NPR's approach is a great model for how APIs can facilitate content exchange across a large network of providers, allowing for the widest distribution possible-while also allowing content owners control over who has access to their valuable content in a very granular way.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/npr/NPR-Digital-Services.png" alt="" width="450" />
<p>APIs are all about providing access to valuable content and resources, but should also be designed to give the proper amount of access, so your content doesn&rsquo;t end up being consumed, distributed in ways you don&rsquo;t find appropriate.

<p>Marketing to developers is no straightforward task, and with the growth in the number of APIs, platforms, tools and active evangelists and advocates, it is only going to get harder.
<p>Developers just don&rsquo;t want to be sold anything.  We just want to do what we do, and just be left alone--until we need help and reach out.  Then we need you to be there.
<p>With <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I&rsquo;m evangelizing the importance of APIs to a wider audience beyond developers, while also helping companies understand how they can market their services to developers.
<p>Helping non-developers understand about APIs is getting easier each month, while helping API owners market to developers is getting harder.
<p>Many companies are even opting to not use the term advocate or evangelist, as these names are beginning to have a negative impression with developers.
<p>Developers are bombarded by one or many evangelists, everywhere they go, and many of these evangelists are more sales and marketing than developer support--giving everyone a bad name.
<p>If you are looking to evangelize your API in the near future, deeply consider your approach.  Your objective is not to sell developers on your API, but to help them be successful in what they are doing--something that may or may not involve your companies API.
<p>Your only option for evangelism is to be as authentic as possible and truly solve the problems developers face, otherwise developers will look elsewhere--and with the increased competition, developers have a growing number of options when it comes to APIs and platforms to get the job done.

<p>I will be doing a webinar with Chris Haddad (<a href="https://twitter.com/cobiacomm">@cobiacomm</a>) of <a title="WSO2" href="http://wso2.com/">WSO2</a> on October 9th, where we discuss <a title="API management best practices for digital business ecosystem" href="http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2012/10/wso2-case-study-api-management-building-blocks-business-value/">API management best practices for digital business ecosystem</a>.
<p>WSO2 is one of my partner API server providers.  I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what they do because they were the first open source API service provider to emerge out of the <a title="20 API Service Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">20 API service providers</a> in the space.
<p>Chris and I will be exploring a couple are of specific areas, regarding the business of APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Emerging API economy and digital business ecosystems</li>
<li>How to assemble the building blocks of a successful API</li>
<li>When a complete open source API management platform delivers business value</li>
<li>Future trends in maximizing the value of APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>WSO2 brings a wealth of API experience to the table and I look forward to exploring these areas with Chris.    The webinar titled "<a title="WSO2 Case Study &ndash; API Management Building Blocks and Business Value" href="http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2012/10/wso2-case-study-api-management-building-blocks-business-value">WSO2 Case Study &ndash; API Management Building Blocks and Business Value</a>", will be on Tuesday, October 9, at 9:00 a.m. &ndash; 10:00 a.m. PDT.

While all of these social networks aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, I think there is one social network that represents the future of all social networks--<a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what Github is, you probably aren&rsquo;t a programmer.  Github is a social network built around the software version control software <a title="Git" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>. &nbsp;Using Github, programmers can collaborate around repositories of code, which allows them to download, fork and commit back code in any format--making software development a social endeavor amongst potentially thousands of developers.
<p>While Github is primarily a social network of programmers, repositories don&rsquo;t have to be just code.  Github repositories can contain HTML, text files and many other formats that can be edited by anybody--allowing the power of version control and collaboration to occur between anyone, in any business sector.
<p>I just finished watching <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html">Clay Shirky&rsquo;s talk on how the Internet will (one day) transform government</a>, using the platform to deal with a flood of new, often times divergent, ideas.  As always, Clay masterfully uses history to lay the groundwork for his argument, that social collaboration and version control with Github is in alignment with how democracy should work.
<p>While Twitter and Facebook have proven to evoke profound social change, I think Github holds amazing potential for change as well. And whether it is allowing developers to build open source software, government to make the legal process truly inclusive of its citizens or <a title="empowering teachers to collaborate on curriculum with Github" href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/16/github-for-education-revisited/">empowering our teachers to collaborate on classroom curriculum</a>--Github holds an amazing amount of untapped potential.
<p>Github opens up unlimited possibilities for much more constructive and meaningful social interactions than we&rsquo;ve seen with Twitter and Facebook. &nbsp;Social interactions that will allow anyone to benefit from the successful aspects of open source software development--unleasing a new era of social networking and collaboration.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/gears-grey.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>Hackathons are a popular way for developers to come together and hack on mobile and web apps, in hopes of winning prizes and getting noticed for their innovation.  Silicon Valley has done a great job of keeping hackathons about building apps, but there are many other ways to apply the hackathon model.
<p>One hackathon model that I&rsquo;ve seen a couple times now, is more about hacking a process, rather than hacking an app.  A hackathon where any company, organization or individual can come, with their existing process, and walk participants through what they are looking to accomplish--with the goal of making it better.
<p>The process could be anything they already do on a regular basis and are looking to optimize, or a new process they would like to develop. In our ever-increasing digital world, where Software as a Service (SaaS) and APIs are becoming commonplace in our daily lives, there is an need for constantly identifying, refining and establishing new processes.
<p>APIs open up huge opportunities for more efficient ways of getting things done, and a hackathon is a great way to pitch a process to a bunch of new users, form teams and spend some time hacking together a more efficient way to get it done.  The objective of this form of the hackathon is to refine a process and help make it better, using technology to better solve the problems we deal with every day.
<p>While building apps is a great focus of a hackathon, they might be better used to help people gain efficiencies at their companies and organizations--allowing them to get access to creative new approaches, and knowledge about other potential tools and platforms they can put to use. &nbsp;
<p>I predict hackathons will continue to grow in popularity, and hopefully we can continue to evolve them to reach the widest possible audience. &nbsp;

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/tumblr/tumblr-black-logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
<p>The Tumblr engineering team has been hard at work on a new Github page, showcasing the <a href="https://tumblr.github.com/#code">open source projects they've released</a>. &nbsp;
<p>Tumblr has also added a <a href="https://tumblr.github.com/#coming-soon">coming soon section,</a> highlighting open source projects they are planning on releasing in the near future.
<p>What's interesting is they have also included <a href="https://tumblr.github.com/#presentations">select presentations from conferences and events Tumblr has presented at</a>.&nbsp;
<p>The <a href="https://tumblr.github.com/">Github implementation by Tumblr</a> is pretty unique, and to go even further, Tumblr has also&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tumblr/tumblr.github.com">open sourced their whole approach to deploying it on Github</a>.
<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
<p>Tumblr's use of Github is worth showcasing. &nbsp;I think it's an innovative approach that other API owners could follow to showcase the open source project they are working on, as well as valuable event presentations.
<p>I'm really impressed with the number of innovative uses of <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> I'm seeing lately.

<p>When it comes to any business, you want to showcase your team, and the value they bring to the table. &nbsp;
<p>One of the things I do here at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, is showcase great examples of technology across the API industry. &nbsp;
<p>With this in mind I wanted to showcase the <a title="Singly Team Page" href="https://singly.com/about">Singly team page.</a> &nbsp;When you visit singly.com and click on team in the footer, you get immediately see a team member photo carousel:
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/singly/team/Singly-Team-Carousel.png" alt="" width="500" />
<p>Which isn't very unique, but next you get 3 things that are unique:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Average number of hours each Singly team member slept this week</li>
<li>Number of Github commits in the last 7 days</li>
<li>Distance walked by Singly team members</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/singly/team/Singly-Sleep-Commits-DistanceWalked.png" alt="" width="500" />
<p>Singly team members provide this data using Quantified Self (QS) data from products like <a title="Fithbit" href="https://singly.com/docs/fitbit">Fitbit</a> and <a title="Runkeeper" href="https://singly.com/docs/runkeeper">Runkeeper</a>, and social programming networks like <a title="Github" href="https://singly.com/docs/github">Github</a>--driven by APIs. &nbsp;
<p>Next Singly shows a map of their neighborhood in the San Francisco mission district:
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/singly/team/Singly-Neighborhood.png" alt="" width="500" />
<p>Then they wrap up with <a title="Instagram" href="https://singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a> photos from team members:
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/singly/team/Singly-Team-Instagram.png" alt="" width="500" />
<p>The Singly team page is the best company team page I have ever seen. &nbsp;It shows extremely personal data from their Fitbit and Rukneeper devices, as well as the day to day business of code pushes via their Github accounts. The team page also shows you where the team is located and some Instagram photos to help you get the vibe of the team.
<p>What does your website team page tell about your companies team?

<p>When you spend a lot of time going to conferences, hackathons and events, you start really getting picky about which events you go to. To disrupt my regular routine, I need an event that will always add value to my professional career, but also be a good time!
<p>When it comes to the latest in Internet technolgy, I always make time each year for the Gluecon and Defrag conferences. <a title="Gluecon" href="http://gluecon.com/2012/">Gluecon</a> is usually in the spring and <a title="Defrag" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag</a> is in the fall--both occurring at the Omni Interlocken in Broomfield, CO.
<p><a title="Defrag Confernece" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/defrag-2012/Defrag-2012-Conference.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p><a href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag is coming up November 15th and 16th</a>--right after November 1st and 2nd for the&nbsp;<a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC.</a>
<p>API Strategy &amp; Conference is psyched to be partnering with Defrag in our first year.  If you <a title="Register for API strategy" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">register for API Strategy &amp; Conference</a>, you will get 10% off of your registration for Defrag.
<p>The event combination will make November a great time to immerse yourself in the API industry, with API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference, then two weeks later, go further with Internet technology discussions at Defrag.
<p>I look forward to seeing you at both <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> and <a title="Defrag" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag</a> in November!&nbsp;

<hr />

<p><a title="Github" href="https://www.github.com">Github</a> should be the center of your API operations, with the most obvious use being for SDK repositories, but Github offers a lot of other valuable tools that you can use to help manage your API platform.
<p>One great use of Github is as an <a title="API issue management" href="/buildingblocks/ticket_system.php">API issue management</a> tool. &nbsp;The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories.
<p><a href="https://github.com/Singly/API/issues" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/github/Issue-Management-Github.png" alt="" width="525" /></a>
<p>To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management. &nbsp;Think of it as repository for your API itself.
<p>Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentialy be part of the API product development cycle.
<p>Along with API Issue Management with Github, you can link issues with the milestones portion of Github, providing deeper roadmap integration, but I will cover that in a separate post.

And while a few of the agencies still have querks with their HTTP Codes and with JSON formatting, the code is starting to stabilize. &nbsp;So I decided to start <a title="Publishing to Github" href="https://github.com/kinlane/digital-strategy">sharing it on Github</a>, allowing others to put it to use.
<p>The first sample script I'm publishing is a <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/digital-strategy/blob/master/pull-agency.php">basic example of how to pull the JSON version of a single agencies digital strategy</a>. &nbsp;Once it pulls the JSON, it then loops through each item and field on the strategy, and renders to screen. &nbsp;It doesn't make any assumptions on what you wish to do with data.
<p>Next I will publish a more sophisticated version that stores values in a database. &nbsp;Here is the pull federal agency digital strategy PHP script:

<p>I&rsquo;m currently processing several discussion I&rsquo;ve had with folks about APIs and the future of search when it comes to voice enabled apps, like <a title="Apples Siri" href="https://www.apple.com/ios/siri/">Apple&rsquo;s Siri.</a>
<p>It started with a discussion with the <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/home">Webshell</a> folks about their blog post, <a title="Webservices supply chain management : the SIRI case" href="http://api500.com/post/27440326130/webservices-supply-chain-management-the-siri-case">Webservices supply chain management : the SIRI case</a>.  Next I was reading a presentation from Pat Cappelaere(<a href="https://twitter.com/cappelaere">@cappelaere</a>) CEO of <a title="Vightel Corporation" href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/companies/vightel-corporation/">Vightel Corporation</a>. called <a title="Building Tomorrow&rsquo;s Web Services API" href="http://www.slideshare.net/cappelaere/building-tomorrows-web-services">Building Tomorrow&rsquo;s Web Services API</a>.
<p>Pat has an interesting image in his deck, showing who the next generation consumer of your API will be:
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/siri/Siri-API-Search.png" alt="" width="525" />
<p>These conversations reflect a whole new area of consideration for the future of web APIs.  Will voice be the dominant way to search via our mobile devices?  If so, how do we expose our companies resources, in a way that makes them easily consumed by voice enabled apps?
<p>At the simplest, we need to discuss where REST fails us in this scenario, and at the most complex we need to discuss what &ldquo;activities&rdquo; will be consumed by voice apps and what types of &ldquo;supply chain management&rdquo; processes or framework will we need to manage all of this.
<p>All of this will feed into to whether or not your company, its products and services will be found in a Siri-like search, when voice enabled apps become the default.

<p>title: ‘Simple API Developer Tracking Framework’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/charts-graphs-2.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/charts-graphs-1.png" alt="" align="right" />
<p>When you have an API, you track two things:  1)  Number of Developer Registrations and 2)  Number of API requests.  This is how we determine a successful API, right?
<p>You should track those two things, but those metrics alone do not define a successful API.  You should go much further.  Each API owner will have their own definition of success, thus their own set of metrics to measure success.
<p>With this in mind, there is no single framework for measuring your API, but here is one suggestion for a basic framework to think about when tracking your API developers.
<p>First establish some buckets to put users in:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>New</strong> - Brand new developer</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong> - Developer actively using API (come up with number)</li>
<li><strong>Inactive</strong> - Developers who go below the "active" number threshold for X number of days</li>
<li><strong>Billable</strong> - Developer who is paying you $$</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong> - A developer who are working closer with than rest of developers</li>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - Your staff or contractors who actively use your API, even for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Then make sure and flag each user with a timestmap when they change status:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>5/2/2012 - New</li>
<li>5/2/2012 - Active</li>
<li>7/9/2012 - Billable</li>
<li>8/15/2012 - Inactive</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/charts-graphs-2.png" alt="" align="right" />
<p>I like to generate daily, weekly and monthly counts for each bucket, plus see numbers on the churn between buckets.
<p>Looking at developers in buckets, and tracking on their transitions between buckets allows you to start seeing the big picture, when large groups of users are migrating between status, or the individual picture, like why a single developer just went inactive.
<p>I don&rsquo;t see much to learn from just watching new registrations and number of API calls, but by creating meaningful buckets to place developers in, then understanding their evolution between these buckets, I think you can learn a lot with a pretty simple set of metrics.
