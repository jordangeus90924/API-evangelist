        <span class="post-date">24 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="/admin/blog/"></a><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/dpla-home-page.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Not all companies who have an API are Twilio, where the API is the product. With Twilio when you land on their website home page, you are in API developer area by default, this is what Twilio does. Many other API driven companies like Twitter, provide link to the API developer program as a link in the footer of the main site, something developers have become accustom to finding.</p>
<p>Many companies I review, don&rsquo;t even have a link prominently listed on their site, forcing me to dig around looking for any evidence of an API. This story isn&rsquo;t about these companies, that is a whole separate post, this story is about the <a href="http://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)</a> and how they have brought their API front and center by having the API present in the top level navigation, and listing their application showcase on their home page. This demonstrates that the DPLA API is something that goes well beyond just being a footnote in operations, and at DPLA it is something that all site visitors should know about--not just developers.</p>
<p>This may not seem like much at first glance, but when it comes to educating visitors of all types, that an API exists, it can be the difference between them knowing their is an API, or not. In 2014, APIs are moving closer to being a part of the mainstream consciousness and you shouldn&rsquo;t have to hide your API. Developers, and non-developers alike should know you have an API. If you want your visitors to potentially integrate with an API, use an application built on your API, or maybe even just spread the word about your API, consider moving it more front and center, giving your API more real estate on your home page, and make it a first class citizen in your site's global navigation.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/11/21/there-are-four-api-design-editors-to-choose-from-now/">There Are Four API Design Editors To Choose From Now</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-design.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the early days, there was just one API design tool to use, <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a>. Now at the end of 2014, we have four separate API design tools to choose from. I credit Apiary.io for opening up this new era of API design, expanding the API life cycle, and emphasizing healthy API design practices over just API deployment and management.</p>
<p>In my opinion the expansion of APIs design formats, and API design tooling is extremely important to the space, allowing API providers to have conversation around API design with developers, and key business stakeholders, before development actually begins. However, the benefits of healthy API design, using leading API definition formats, goes well beyond just design, and the rewards can be seen throughout the entire API lifecycle.</p>
<p>There are three API design tools, from each of the providers of the modern API design formats:</p>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://apiary.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/apiary-editor.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a> - Collaborative design, instant API mock, generated documentation, integrated code samples, debugging and automated testing using the API Blueprint API definition format.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://api-portal.anypoint.mulesoft.com/raml/api-designer"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/mulesoft-api-designer.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://api-portal.anypoint.mulesoft.com/raml/api-designer">API Designer | Anypoint API Portal</a> - Enables the ability to design APIs in the RAML API definition format, and mock, preview and save API designs into a notebook, and integrate with other Mulesoft API tooling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://editor.swagger.io"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/swagger-editor.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://editor.swagger.io">Swagger Editor</a> - Allows the designing APIs in the Swagger format in both YAML and JSON, allowing you to import, edit, preview, and export API design docs.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All three of these API design tools are developed by the creator of the leading API definition formats, <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. (aka. Apiary, Wordnik, and Mulesoft). Now, a significant evolution in the API design tooling space has occurred and a cross format API design tool has emerged from the popular Java API framework <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>.</p>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://studio.restlet.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/restlet-studio.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://studio.restlet.com">Restlet Studio</a> - Allows you to create, and load API designs in Swagger and RAML formats, save, and generate server side scaffolding, and client side SDKs in multiple languages.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The emergence of the Restlet Studio is significant because it represents the expansion API design tooling beyond the three leading API definition format providers, as well as being the first cross-format API design editor. There are other API service providers who deliver vital API services along the API lifecycle like <a href="http://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/overview/">Ready! API</a>, for mocking and testing your APIs, or <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> which generates SDKs, both of which support multiple API definition formats, but Restlet Studio is the first cross-format purely API design editor (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be spending more time mapping out all of the tools that are emerging to deliver vital services throughout the API design life cycle, something that gives me hope for things standardizing when it comes to designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs. It is an exciting time to be in the API space, as the universe rapidly expands, and more companies emerge to help us make sense of this rapid expansion.</p>

<p>I was reviewing an API over the last couple of weeks--I signed up for an account, came back several times, and made a handful of API calls in hopes of learning more about how the API works. This is something I do a lot, and it is always interesting to experience the on boarding process (or lack of) for APIs.</p>
<p>I first signed up about two weeks ago for this particular API, and within 48 hours I received an email asking if I needed help with my integration--that was nice of them. I like getting an email from the provider, and the more human it is, the better. At this point I didn't need any help, I&rsquo;m just playing, learning, and depending on the self-service resources made available to me via the API ecosystem.</p>
<p>About a week later I get another email, again asking if I need help. At this point I&rsquo;ve put down the API, but when I pick back up I might respond to the platform then, but I just have more learning to do before I have questions. Then about a week later, right before I was about to pick up the API again, I got another email asking me what my plans were, putting more pressure on me to share my plans for how I was going to be using an API, which I'm just not sure yet.</p>
<p>I am not your usual API consumer. I know this. However this API, I was actually planning on integrating into my core API tracking system at some point, so in addition to being the API Evangelist who might write a story, there is a good chance I will become a customer. I really like, and believe in the self-service nature of APIs, and while I like getting an email letting me know someone is home, I tend to be turned off by each consecutive email--nothing reminds you are in someones sales funnel, like a series of emails.</p>
<p>When you consider the touch points for your API on-boarding flow, make sure and think about the different types of users who will be registering, and the fact that not everyone will fit squarely in your perfect funnel definition. You want to make sure your API consumers know that someone home, and that you are there to help, but you really should rely on your self-service resources to get the bigger job done. Your initial email after I sign up should do this, then leave the next steps up to me, and be very thoughtful, and possibly dynamic with each engagement after that.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://dev.mailjet.com/email-api/v3/metadata/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mailjet/logo-mailjet.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When I landed on the <a href="http://dev.mailjet.com/email-api/v3/metadata/">version 3.0 landing page for the Mailjet API</a>, the first thing I noticed was their API configuration API. Providing a set of API endpoints for managing my own API usage is definitely something I can get behind, and think it is something worth showcasing.</p>
<p>As part of the API Configuration portion of their email API, Mailjet provides five separate endpoints for users to manage their API developer account.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>/apikey -</strong> Manage your Mailjet API Keys. API keys are used as credentials to access the API and SMTP server</li>
<li><strong>/apikeyaccess - </strong>Access rights description on API keys for subaccounts/users.</li>
<li><strong>/apikeytotal -</strong> Global counts for an API Key, since its creation</li>
<li><strong>/apitoken - </strong>Access token for API, used to give access to an API Key in conjunction with our IFrame API</li>
<li><strong>/metadata -</strong> Mailjet API metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>I like this approach to providing developers with API access to their developer account details. It is an approach I&rsquo;d like to <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">explore and standardize using the 3Scale API</a>. I think it is something I've written about before, but I couldn't find it.</p>
<p>API access to a developer account is something I haven't seen anywhere else, but I'll definitely be using <a href="http://dev.mailjet.com">Mailjet</a> as a blueprint for demonstrating what is possible, and see if I can&rsquo;t convince other API providers that it is a feature they should consider.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><iframe src="https://www.eff.org/sites/all/libraries/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Ffiles%2F2014%2F11%2F07%2Fgoogle_v_oracle_computer-scientists-certpetition-amicus-brief_14-410_final.pdf" height="360px" align="right">https://www.eff.org/files/2014/11/07/google_v_oracle_computer-scientists-certpetition-amicus-brief_14-410_final.pdf</iframe></p>
<p>As the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_v._Google">Oracle v Google API copyright</a> case was on its way to the Federal Circuit Court in 2012, the <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/07/us-precedent-for-api-copyright-hinges-on-oracle-v-google/">EFF reached out to me for help in crafting stories of how important it is that APIs remain free of copyright</a>, ensuring they remain open and interoperable. I shared three stories, one on cloud computing and AWS APIs, the second on Delicious APIs, and the third on Instagram APIs, all reflecting three different scenarios that would never have happened if APIs were copyrightable.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago EFF reached out again, asking for my signature again, on <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/computer-scientists-ask-supreme-court-rule-apis-cant-be-copyrighted">another Amicus Brief to support Google&rsquo;s request of the Supreme Court to review the circuit courts decision</a>, and reverse it. As it stands right now, there is a precedent that copyright can be applied to APIs, and even though the case itself is moving onto the question of fair use, if we let the current decision stand, other companies can follow Oracle&rsquo;s damaging lead and sue for protection of their APIs--which is why we need to convince the Supreme Court to review, and overturn the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very damaging</span> decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect that the Supreme Court will decide whether or not to grant Google&rsquo;s petition to review the Federal Circuit&rsquo;s decision sometime in January or February of 2015. So I need your help to stir up buzz around the issue, and post stories on your blog, call your congressman, and light up any other channel you can, to help educate people about the importance of the issue. When the Supreme Court takes on the case (which I feel strongly they will), we will need to regroup, and refile, a more expansive brief on the importance of APIs remaining free of copyright.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working to expand my <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">restaurant menu analogy</a>, to help people understand the importance of APIs, but if you have other analogies that you think would help the Supreme Court understand the separation of API interfaces, and their supporting server side or client side code, please share with me so I can work with the EFF to potentially include in the next brief that is filed. APIs are touching every sector of business in 2014, and if we allow Oracle&rsquo;s copyright claim to stand, we are in danger of pouring glue into the gears of each of these business sectors, at a point in time where we need to introduce as much lubrication, and transparency as we possible can, to ensure that the web, mobile, and Internet of Things applications built on APIs remain open and interoperable--ensuring they serve not just their platform owners, but also developers, and end-users equally.</p>
<p>Join me, in helping bring awareness to the issue, which right along with Net Neutrality, is one of the most important issues we currently face when it comes to deciding the future of technology, and how our society works, shares, collaborates and interoperates in this new online digital world we have created for our world.</p>

<p>You can find me in San Francisco tomorrow, at the Kabuki Hotel for<a href="http://www.sfmusictech.com"> SF MusicTech</a>. I'm <a href="http://www.sfmusictech.com/schedule/">moderating a panel, dubbed &ldquo;API Ecosystem&rdquo;</a>,  where I will be talking APis with Antti Silventoinen (<a href="https://twitter.com/Lamantiini">@Lamantiini</a>) of <a href="https://www.musickickup.com/">Music Kickup</a>, Justin Woo (<a href="https://twitter.com/jzwoo">@jzwoo</a>) of <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> / <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a>, Steven Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of <a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a>, and Bill Hajjar from <a href="http://corp.senzari.com/">Senzari</a>.</p>
<p>I'm planning on walking the panelists through the world of API design, development, management, and focus on API monetization, but I suspect that we'll keep things pretty &nbsp;relevant to the experience, and diversity we will have present on stage. There is &nbsp;a healthy mix of music industry focused providers like Music Kickup, and Senzari (aka <a href="https://developer.musicgraph.com/">Music Graph</a>), but also API architecture provider 3Scale, and payment API pioneer Paypal / payment API startup Braintree.</p>
<p>You can catch the panel tomorrow at 2PM, in the spring room. Let me know if there is anything you'd like me to discuss with Antti, Justing, Steven, and Bill, during the panel. I&rsquo;ll be hanging out at SF Music Tech all day, and of course drinking beers in SF tomorrow evening--let me know if you want get together and talk APIs!</p>

<p>I've been crafting Swagger 2.0 definitions for many of the leading APIs i track on lately, and to help alleviate my pain and suffering, I&rsquo;m willing to write about your company if you write your own Swagger 2.0 spec. I&rsquo;m sorry, this is really important work, but it can be very grueling detail work, and I'd really like your help!</p>
<p>If you send me a 80% complete <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger 2.0 specification</a>, or for that matter, an <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> or <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML specification</a>, I will review your API efforts on the API Evangelist blog. I'm pretty adamant that all APIs today should have a machine readable definition in a popular format like Swagger or API Blueprint, as well as each API developer program possessing an <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.son</a> index of all of their APIs, including a reference to the machine readable API definition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m determined to hand craft machine readable Swagger specs for the best APIs out there, and in time I will do this, but I could really use the help of API providers as well. Send me a link to your Swagger spec, and I&rsquo;ll make sure a story gets into my story queue. I would add a disclaimer, that you need to make sure your API offers value, and your overall effort is thoughtful, otherwise I may call you out on some things. :-)</p>
<p>Once we get to a point where all APIs have a machine readable definition, we will start seeing entirely new opportunities around API design, deployment, management, integration, and discovery. I'm determined to bootstrap the work that will help us get to this point, but damn, I sure need some help. T<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">weet at me</a>, or feel free to <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">email me a link</a> to any machine readable API definitions that you know of. #thanks</p>

<p>It always makes me happy to see a pricing page, front and center when I visit an API, but I found an added bonus over at the email API, Inbox. At the bottom of their pricing page, they have a pretty simple question: <em><strong>Hey, why isn't this free?</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>It&rsquo;s become painfully clear in the past few years that if you&rsquo;re not paying for something, you&rsquo;re the product. In practice, this has resulted in &ldquo;free&rdquo; platforms that eventually were forced to show ads, sell user data, or fire-sale to a large company to only be unloved or shut-down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking a different approach. The Inbox API isn&rsquo;t free. You pay us, and we run the service. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>We know our pricing might still be prohibitive to some apps getting started. If you&rsquo;re a startup building on the Inbox Platform, please get in touch by emailing support@inboxapp.com.</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>I like their style. I just don't understand the smoke &amp; mirrors when it comes to pricing in the API space, and fully support API providers who offer no B.S. pricing for their API resources.</p>
<p>It is little things like this that keep me trolling through the developer areas, and back alleys of the API space each day.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-monetization.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lost in API monetization land, evaluating the business models of common APIs, so you are just going to have to cope with it, until I get through this research. Honestly, I really don't care this much about making money off of APIs, it is just telling me a lot about the motivations behind many of the APIs I keep an eye on. This particular story is extracted from my research into the monetization strategies of multiple core business sectors in the API space, and one of my regular conversations that I have, with an API provider around how they can settle in on a sensible monetization strategy.</p>
<p>In the same conversation around how these valuable resources even became APIs, we were immediately led to the topic of what we were going to charge for, and how we were going make money off these potentially resources. As I&rsquo;m discussing resources based API design, I&rsquo;m also having a resource based API monetization conversation&mdash;which tells me we are so lost in the infancy of all areas of API design, deployment, management, and ultimately monetization.</p>
<p>How these resources are going to be used? How will these API resources actually be put to use by end-users within web, mobile, and IoT applications? Seems like we should be considering the perspectives on how people will experience these APIs as we design the interfaces, let alone before we attach prices to them.  If we don&rsquo;t know ho they will be used, how will we ever know what someone will pay for them?</p>
<p>I just don't know the answer. I know that we have hard costs for crafting these API resources--the compute, storage, and bandwidth to serve them up. I do not know if anyone will even pay a dime for any of them, or even need them at all. Where do I focus? Do I concentrate on the resources that I have, and more about how to make them accessible, while also covering my overhead, and hopefully make some profit on top? Or do I focus how thinking about how they will be used, and the value they have with end-users? I can't decide on where I should focus: 1) resource based API monetization, or 2) experience based monetization. #help</p>

<p>I spend my time gathering what I call b"uilding blocks",&nbsp;as I work my way through the API landscape. I&rsquo;ve been tracking on the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks of API management since 2011</a>, and have expanded that to include API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">deployment</a>, <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/">evangelism</a>, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">integration</a> and other areas of the API lifecycle in the last 3 years. I'm working my way through the <a href="http://theapistack.com">700 APIs in my API stack</a>, I am looking for industry focused building building blocks, as well as the ones associated with an APIs business model, or monetization strategy.</p>
<p>I have almost twenty monetization building blocks I'm tracking on ranging from free access to the availability of partner programs. As I work my way through various business sectors being impacted by APIs, I'm starting to see interesting patterns, some of which can act as a red flag for me that there are potential problems within an API operations. To the uneducated API pundit, the illnesses around APIs arise from simplistic concepts like &ldquo;being public&rdquo;, when in reality there are deeper issues at play, usually around the business model, and these patterns for me begin to really get at the root of the problem, rather than just speculating on the cause.</p>
<p>An example of this has to do with the existence of a handful of management and monetization building blocks, and the absence of others--such as when an API does not have a pricing page, service tiers, or any paid infrastructure, but offers free access to an API. This is amplified when a provider also doesn't provide any clear rate limiting available, resulting in a service you do not want to depend on, because I can guarantee buried in the terms of service is a clause that they can start charging at any moment. The most well known example of this in the wild is Twitter, who despite having Gnip and DataSift, still does not provide clear and scalable pricing options for its developer.</p>
<p>As I continue studying the monetization strategies of APIs, I'll work to establish more patterns that are derived from the presence of, or absence of, specific combinations of monetization building blocks that may tell a larger story. Hopefully I can work to counter much of the BS in the space, and when you hear statements like &ldquo;public APIs are not viable&rdquo;, we can clarify with &ldquo;public APIs who don&rsquo;t have clear business model, and communicate their pricing and rate limits are not viable&rdquo;.</p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/docker-spreadsheets.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wrote a story about a company I&rsquo;m advising for last week called <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/29/now-our-development-environment-is-now-containerized-and-scalable-like-our-production-environment/">Codenvy, who is delivering modular, scalable, cloud development environments using their web IDE and Docker</a>. I'm currently working my way through the spreadsheet to API, and API to spreadsheet solutions I track on, and it is making me think that someone should deliver a <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>-like containerized spreadsheet environment.</p>
<p>With this type of environment you could forever end the emailing of spreadsheets, allowing people to craft spreadsheets, complete with all the data and visualization goodness they desire, and clone, fork, share, and collaborate around these containerized spreadsheets. You could have a library of master planned spreadsheets that your company depends on, and manage user permissions, analytics, and even scalability, performance, and distribution of vital spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Using this platform you could easily spawn spreadsheet driven APis using services like <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>, and you could come full circle and have spreadsheets that obtain their data directly from valuable API driven resources, to really blow your mind. Personally I'm not a big spreadsheet lover, but I do recognize that it is where a majority of the worlds data resides, and the user interface of choice for many business folk--making it a good candidate for the next generation of containerized API data sources, and clients.</p>
<p>Just another one of my random ideas that accumulate in my Evernote, that I'll never have time to build myself, and hoping you will tackle for me. As I review all of the existing spreadsheet APi solutions available currently, I&rsquo;m sure I'll have more API centric, spreadsheet ideas bubble over t o share with you.</p>

<p>I found the DNS implementation over at the Messente SMS API interesting, and worth of sharing for deeper evaluation. I've been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/26/gathering-my-thoughts-around-common-patterns-for-base-urls-across-nearly-700-apis/">considering the various approaches by API providers when crafting their domains, or subdomains for API access</a> heavily over the last couple weeks.</p>
<p>During some research time today I stumbled across the M<a href="https://messente.com/">essente SMS API</a> which opts to provide two domains for making HTTP(S) requests of their API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>api2.messente.com</li>
<li>api3.messente.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Messente provides a little disclaimer to handle the developer side of manual load-balancing these API calls:</p>
<blockquote><em>These two domains have the same final destination regarding the API functions. In order to ensure that your requests always reach Messente API services, please use one of them as primary and the second one as backup. Both API domains work as equal, but in case of any unexpected downtime with one of them (HTTP 5xx), the other one must be used on client side.</em></blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure this manual approach to providing API endpoints is the optimal path when delivering on the stability of your API, let alone the location of your resources, but it does provide an interesting contrast on the perspectives that are available out there in API-land.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I should rebrand as API Anthropologist, as I find the approach of my fellow API providers more interesting than what I'd expect to find in a mature API landscape. This reflects the importance of showcasing what is going on, to help bridge to where we should be, rather than focusing exclusively on where we should be. (deep shit, man)</p>

<p>Our company didn't actually write this post, we just grabbed it from a blog that we regularly read, written by someone who actually understands the topic.

<p>When we found this post, it had an informative title, but for the purposes of this guest post we changed the title a little bit, in an effort to make it more desirable, clickable, and shareable by our readers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This post also had a lot more context when we found it, but for the purposes of this guest post we are going to remove most of that context. We also want to make sure and not cite the author, and potentially provide any unnecessary background--well maybe a Twitter account so people can spew venom at them. All of this goes along way in making sure the article invokes the passion we are looking to generate, which will result in the volume of traffic we desire.</p>
<p>Once this is posted, we will syndicate to the places on the Internet where the worst people you can imagine dwell. This is the tech industry, so there are some pretty proven places to go to find these types of folks. These people don&rsquo;t represent the entire Internet, but because they are so outspoken, you'd think they do. All we have to do is post a link, artificially pump up the first few votes, and the community does the rest. #magic</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m digging deeper into my Evernote lately, getting back to those half written stories I have laying around, and next up is about the Carvoyant API sandbox and simulator. I came across their <a href="https://www.carvoyant.com/2014/10/31/free-connectedcar-data-candy-in-the-sandbox/">Free #connectedcar data candy in the Sandbox blog post</a>, and was intrigued by the concept of a simulator, not just for IoT related APIs, but potentially for any API.</p>
<p>Carvoyant provides a free API account which comes with a <a href="https://sandbox-driver.carvoyant.com/">sandbox API for playing with the platform</a>, and a <a href="https://sandbox-auth.carvoyant.com/login/auth">traffic simulator that allows you generate vehicle and trip data</a> for use in developing applications. I can see how a sandbox plus simulator is essential for developing automotive related applications, as you can&rsquo;t be expected to have real car connection and data in all scenarios, something clearly Carvoyant has put a lot of thought, and work into.</p>
<p>Providing an API sandbox plus API simulator seems like it could also be two essential building blocks required for all device based API platforms, aka Internet of Things. This approach would be significant in on boarding new developers, providing them with immediate scenarios they can hack against, to learn about an API, as well as light the fire within their imagination regarding what is possible with the platform's API.</p>
<p>I already have a sandbox as one potential <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building block</a> that API providers should consider. I think I will also add a simulator to the API management building blocks, and keep an eye out for other API simulators in the wild. I know I&rsquo;ve covered <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/24/salesforce-adds-sandbox-templates/">sandbox templates from SaleForce</a> in the past, but usually once I&rsquo;ve seen something in the wild a couple of times, and add it as a formal building block to track on, I immediately tend see more of it out in the space. Have you seen any cool API simulators?</p>

<p>One pattern I'm seeing emerge on some of the API platforms I&rsquo;m watching from week to week are integration pages, showcasing the other 3rd party services than an API has integration with. An integration page is similar to an application showcase, but instead of showing apps build on an API, you are showcasing other platforms that are already integrated with.</p>
<p>A recent one that I&rsquo;ve seen out in the wild is from web development annotation platform <a href="https://usersnap.com">Usersnap</a>, showing the platforms they connect to:</p>
<p><a href="https://usersnap.com/connect"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/usersnap/usersnap-integrations.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>The second I came across was from <a href="http://www.opsgenie.com/">OpsGenie</a>, the alerts and notification platform, showcasing all of the common platform they work with:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opsgenie.com/integrations"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/opsgenie/opsgenie-integrations.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add an integrations page to my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks for API providers</a> to consider. An integration page can showcase a wide range of integrations that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">introduce reciprocity into platform operations</a>. Integrations could start with using Zapier, but could also be seamless, providing plug and play connectors for users. I would say integrations goes right up to what I call platform development kits (PDK), which would be open source code that developers could use to get up and running on 3rd party platforms.</p>
<p>If you don't have any existing integrations to showcase, I recommend spending some time and figure out the top 5 platforms that would complement the value delivered by your API, and get to work integrating. Existing API integrations are great for stimulating the imagination of developers, as well as provide ready to go solutions for non-developers--either way an integrations page will help onboard new API consumers.</p>

<p>As I write up a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/03/the-expanding-api-universe-more-api-sdk-focused-services-emerge/">story on Magnet</a>, another one of the API SDK service providers to emerge in the space, I can't help but evaluate what other building blocks have the potential to evovolve, and be offered as a specific service. Machine readable API definition formats like <a href="http://bitly.com/1tnYxV8">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a> make services like <a href="http://bit.ly/1qnXcI0">Apimatic</a> and Magnet possible, and I enjoy thinking about other potential services that could be easily generated from definitions in this way.</p>
<p>One possiblity that comes to mind is server side scaffolding, and the possibilities of generating server side scaffolding for your APIs in a variety open source API frameworks, using machine readable definitions. It is difficult to generate 100% of the server side of an API using machine readable API definitions, but you sure can go a long way in auto generating a scaffolding that will get you most of the way there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m picturing a whole library of every REST framework known to man (and woman), and the ability to select framework, and upload a machine readable Swagger specification, and the service generates a zip file, or publishes to Github for you. The service would save you the time of going out and finding the latest version of your favorite (or clients) REST framework, and do most of the heavy lifting in setting up, configuring, and crafting API endpoints. Eventually you might think about other ways to distribute, like docker containers on AWS, Google, and even PaaS services like Heroku.</p>
<p>It would be easy to use <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files to find API design patterns, and make those available in a library alongside all of the available REST frameworks. I would build this myself, but I just don't have time, and it isn&rsquo;t an idea I think anyone is going to get rich off of, but I think you could make a good living charging a couple bucks to generate server side API scaffolding, and keep tabs on the latest REST API frameworks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep sharing these ideas that are generated from my monitoring of the API space, in hopes some of you take advantage of them, and bring them to life.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/elasticsearch/elastic-search-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a>, the open source, distributed, real-time search and analytics engine just announced that it is introducing a security layer on top of their API driven search platform.  Historically you have to secure any APIs exposed via Elasticsearch through your own proxy or firewall solution, now with "<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/shield">Shield</a>" you can natively manage your APIs directly in Elasticsearch.</p>
<blockquote><em>Shield, in the same spirit of Marvel, is built on top of Elasticsearch public extensions points, and is easily installed as a plugin to add security features to any existing Elasticsearch installation. It does not require a different distribution of Elasticsearch, and relies heavily on the open public APIs Elasticsearch already exposes.</em></blockquote>
<p>The security Elasticsearch is bringing to the table reflects the core features you see in the API space from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.3scale.net/">API infrastructure providers like 3Scale</a>--providing the basics of what you need to secure access to API endpoints:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Role-based Access Control - </strong>Set granular cluster, index, and alias-level permissions for each user of your Elasticsearch cluster. For example, allow the marketing department to freely search and analyze social media data with read-only permissions, while preventing access to sensitive financial data.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication System Support -</strong> Shield integrates with LDAP-based authentication systems as well as Active Directory, so your users don&rsquo;t need to remember yet another password. We also provide a native authentication system, for those who want to manage all access within Elasticsearch.</li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Communications -</strong> Node-to-node encryption protects your data from intruders. With certificate-based SSL/TLS encryption and secure client communications with HTTPS, Shield keeps data traveling over the wire protected.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Logging - </strong>Ensure compliance and keep a pulse on security-related activity happening in your Elasticsearch deployment; record login failures and attempts to access unauthorized information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've had Elasticsearch in the <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">API deployment research project</a> for some time now, but now I will add it to my&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management research as well.</a> If you can manage your API access, user roles, and generate log files for analytics from Elasticsearch API endpoints, the tool is moving squarely into the API management category.</p>
<p>I makes me happy to see open source tools like Elasticsearch improving their security features. Elasticsearch is something I recommend to government agencies to use when looking to open up access to document stores, using APIs. I would like to see more of the API management players working together to allow for interoperability between management platforms, but I&rsquo;m guessing this is a wish I won&rsquo;t get anytime soon.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner.</em></p>

I wrote about <a href="https://apimatic.io/">Apimatic</a> a few months back and how they are focused on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/07/evolving-how-we-approach-the-api-lifecycle-with-apimatic/">generating high quality SDKs</a> from machine readable API formats like <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>.</p>
<p>This last week I was introduced to another provider, <a href="https://magnet.com/">Magnet</a>, and their <a href="https://developer.magnet.com/">rest2mobile service</a> which will &ldquo;generate mobile native code for REST services&rdquo;.  Magnet has chosen to focus exclusively on mobile SDKs, where Apimatic is focused on web and mobile SDKs. I consider web SDKs one building block, and mobile SDKs another building block, and companies should evaluate their need for them side-by-side, something service providers like <a href="https://apimatic.io/">Apimatic</a> and <a href="https://magnet.com/">Magnet</a> are looking to assist with.</p>
<p>As the API universe continues its expansion we will see more API services like these emerge who are focused on helping API providers better deliver the building blocks of their API platforms. I will keep tracking on the common building blocks of API design, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a> and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, and continue to showcase interesting companies stepping up to provide services that deliver the valuable building blocks the space needs to operate.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://readme.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/readme/readme-io-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It makes me happy to see new arrivals in the world of API management service providers, especially after all the consolidation we saw last year with many of the 1st and 2nd wave of providers like Mashery, Vordel, Layer7, and Apiphany. One of the new API management providers that have emerged is <a href="https://readme.io/">Readme</a>, who is looking to provide an attractive, simple, and intuitive way to launch developer portals for your APIs.</p>
<p>Readme reminds me of some of the landing page tools designed for web marketers over the last decade, to provide informative gateways for site visitors, but ReadMe is all about providing meaningful doorways to our API resources. First, I like ReadMe's definition of what is a developer hub?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Topical guides, tutorials and troubleshooting.</li>
<li><strong>API Reference </strong>- Low-level, deep-dive reference material.</li>
<li><strong>Community -</strong> Provide support and answer questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their definition of what is a developer hub is goes beyond just the technical documentation as what many developers see, and acknowledges that your portal should be about providing the resources necessary to educate API consumers, and potentially build community around their needs. ReadMe provides the essential building blocks I'd expect of any modern API portal builder:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Theme Builder </strong>- Easily create a beautiful dev community that matches your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Editor - </strong>Markdown-based drag-and-drop editor makes documentation almost fun.</li>
<li><strong>API Explorer - </strong>Let users play with your API right inside the documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Application Keys - </strong>Your users can view their application keys embedded right in the docs.</li>
<li><strong>Support - </strong>Let users ask questions and request features in the support forums.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then ReadMe goes a little further to include some concepts that I see in some of the leading API providers, features that go beyond just basic features, allowing you to better manage your API portal:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Collaboration -</strong> Crowdsource your docs! Users can keep docs current by suggesting changes.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Sync -</strong> Keep auto-generated reference docs synced with your actual code changes.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning - </strong>Maintaining old or testing beta versions of your docs is a breeze.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2014, emulating the social elements that Github has introduced into the world of coding, in your API program is essential. You cannot manage your entire API community by yourself, and including your developer in the process is essential. This adds relevant layers to the term "open" that everyone likes to use, providing the roots you will need to actually build trust with your developers, in something that goes both ways, and will also grow your own trust of developed within your own API community.</p>
<p><a href="https://readme.io/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/readme/readme-io-what-is-a-developer-hub.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I'm keeping an eye on what ReadMe is up to, alongside the other API management providers I've been tracking on. I haven't give a lot of attention to the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> space in the last year, as I've been focusing on the faster growing areas like API <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, but now that I see new players stepping up, I will make sure and give the area equal attention in my research and monitoring.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2014</span>
        <p>I know. I&rsquo;m kind of a broken record this week, but I&rsquo;m trying to quantify the business model, and monetization strategies of APIs across various industries, and understanding what companies are charging for their services just makes me crazy sometimes. I don&rsquo;t know what people are thinking when they craft their approach to explaining what an API will cost to access.</p>
<p>Here is an example of what I&rsquo;m talking about over at <a href="http://www.stocklytics.com/">Stocklytics</a>. When you land on Stocklytics home page, this is what you see:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/stocklytics/stockyltics-completely-free.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>After spending some time looking for anything else about pricing, I signed up for the service, and after I logged in to my account I found this page, which then takes me directly to a Paypal page:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/stocklytics/stocklytics-credit-account.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Do companies even think about what this does to the on-boarding process? I&rsquo;m not evening focusing on the errors in my brand new developer account that I had to contend with before I discovered the add credits page. At this point, why would use this service? Even if the data is amazing? You just bullshitted me into signing up for your service. There was never a mention of cost until I signed up.</p>
<p>This is one of the things I love about the API space--the dead simple lessons in the value of honesty and transparency. I really don&rsquo;t care how you structure the pricing for API, I&rsquo;ll let developers vote with their usage of your API decide that. What I do care about is how you communicate your pricing. There really isn&rsquo;t any reason to hide your pricing&mdash;just be straight up about it, and I bet you&rsquo;ll do a lot more business as a result.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-magic.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you look through as many APIs as I do, you start to get a feeling for many of the subtle signals, that can result in a wealth of information about the actual viability of an API. One signal I'm starting to track on more is pricing, and I'm gathering more details about how an API provider articulates their pricing, or often times doesn&rsquo;t. The way an API provider discusses their business model can tell you so much about their motivations, the amount of resources they have available, and the experience they have in managing APIs and engaging developers.</p>
<p>Pundits in the space love to talk about the viability of public vs private API, and that public APIs just aren't viable, and will be going away soon. When in reality the public vs. private discussion is not the issue, it is lack of business model, and monetization strategy that is the real tell in all of this. Public APIs like Twilio and Amazon do not have a problem, because they have put a lot of thought into their business models, and their pricing is well thought out, competitive, and front and center in their API developer areas--they aren't in danger because they are public?? DOH!</p>
<p>The companies who will be shuttering their API programs often do not have clear pricing on their site, reducing pricing to be simply a question in the FAQ, and something you have to request more information on.  Many companies are trained in sales techniques and are just looking to apply this knowledge in the world of APIs, but I&rsquo;d say for many of the companies I evaluate, hiding or obfuscating your pricing is not about entrenched sales practices, it is more about exploitation at every turn.</p>
<p>As I go through the <a href="http://theapistack.com">700 API companies in my API Stack</a>, I&rsquo;m tracking on the details of their business model, and will be judging APIs on how they showcase their pricing (or don't). I don't care if companies are still working to figure it out, or have top tiers that are &ldquo;enterprise pricing&rdquo;, and &ldquo;request more details&rdquo;. What I do care about is how communicative you are about your pricing, and enforcing that the pricing for API resources is one of the most important signals you can send as part of your API management strategy.</p>
<p>Remember, when you use Twitter as and example of how public APIs aren&rsquo;t viable, you are actually referencing the lack of a coherent business model that fully includes the developer ecosystem, and has nothing to do with the viability of public APIs. Public APIs are here to stay, but the smoke and mirrors of &ldquo;enterprise pricing&rdquo; will have to evolve if you expect to play in this new game, and actually get the attention of developers.</p>
<p><em>P.S. The magic wand is my new icon for "enterprise pricing", because I see the term being used as a magic wand for making up pricing, more than I see it used as viable sales cycles. I searched for images of pulling pricing out of your ass, but it didn't result in family friendly images I can show here, so I'm using a magic wand.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m envisioning a whole marketplace of visualizations I can choose from, driven from various popular APIs like Twitter, Crunchbase, OpenCorporates, and much more. There are number of proprietary data visualizations tools emerging out there (I&rsquo;m watching you), but what I'm looking for is specifically an open solution using D3.js.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem if there are premium layers, and features that are driven by commercial APIs, or there being added charges for API consumption in general, but I want the visualization, and underlying JSON to be open and configurable&mdash;encouraging access and re-use.</p>
<p>It can be tough to help people understand just exactly what an API is, and I feel like an open visualization layer using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, driven from <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> would be one of the quickest ways to help people understand exactly what value an API can deliver.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going through each of the 100+ business sectors I track on as part of my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>. As I make my way through each sector, and generate <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files, the language of the resources used across a particular sector starts to come into focus. I&rsquo;m talking about the words used for crafting URLs, parameters, and the underlying data models for common APIs.</p>
<p>In a perfect world everyone would come together and use something like <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>, and work to extend, in an organized, collaborative way across different industries&mdash;I would call this the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) approach. Unfortunately what we have is a shitload of dialects popping up, driven from the dark depths of our legacy IT infrastructure, only seeing the light of day when an API gets exposed, and the dialect used by an isolated IT tribe all of a sudden becomes part of the mainstream world.</p>
<p>Some weeks my inbox seems to reflect where my research is going, and as I ponder the language used by popular news sites like NYTimes, USA Today, and NewsCred, I get an email from a reader in Europe, who works at the equivalent of BBC their country, who asks:</p>
<blockquote><em>Currently I'm thinking about the API vocabulary and i wonder if there is some kind of standard out there when it comes to the verbs, parameters, etc. that are used for Media/Broadcaster API`s. I think there should be some kind of standard (used by netflix, bbc, espn, abc, etc..) Do you have any idea if there is such a standard?</em></blockquote>
<p>If there is a schema.org for the broadcasting industry I&rsquo;m unaware of it. As I generate a crude dictionary for each of my API Stack business sectors I will stop, and conduct some due diligence on what is already out there for each industry regarding standards, etc. I&rsquo;m assuming if there is, it won't always be Internet ready, let alone API ready, but hopefully there is already something that is driven by the industry that can provide a starting point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the need for a common dictionary, when it comes to API design, in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">my thoughts on a perfect API design editor</a>. I will work to publish any dictionaries that I aggregate, as they come into focus. As with much of the API space I suspect that dictionaries will be defined from bottom up, using common slang used in the space, as opposed to a top down from coordinated OED approach, but hopefully by aggregating and educating API designers we can make strides towards a more coherent API space in some of the business sectors currently being impacted by APIs.</p>

<p>Throughout 2014, when I look at the top 10 posts in my Google Analytics dashboard each month, there has been a consistent theme of what stories are driving page views. The concept of a page is only one metric I look at when evaluating where the API space might be going, and while I don&rsquo;t write stories specifically to page views, they do provide me with a general barometer of what my readers are interested in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing give areas consistently generating the most views across the API Evangelist Network:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal APIs - </strong>This slot is pretty much dominated by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret To Amazons Success Is Internal</a> story getting thousands of page view each month, even with being written back in January of 2012.</li>
<li><strong>Single Page App Tooling - </strong>Simple, easy to use formable single page apps like my <a href="http://csv-converter.publicprivatesector.org/">CSV Converter</a>, and my <a href="http://data.ongithub.com/">Data.Ongithub.com</a> produce some really long lasting traffic, providing value to users.</li>
<li><strong>API Design - </strong>This is definitely the topic of 2014, with all of my stories talking about <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> tools like Swagger and API Blueprint dominating the top 10.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia - </strong>Its time has come in 2014, and hypermedia stories like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">What Are Some Examples of Hypermedia APIs</a> are popular with developers, and non-developers when it comes to understand what hypermedia is all about.</li>
<li><strong>API Roundups -</strong> A pretty proven formula of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/26/payment-apis-that-i-am-watching/">rounding up listings of APIs for a specific purpose</a>, the only difference is when I do it, I personally look at each API and make sure there is something there, defining what I consider to be <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com">API stacks or collections.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll revisit this at the end of the year and see if it still stands up. For me it provides some sort of map of where my readers heads are at, and by no means is any measurement of where the API space is going, but is at least a place to start thinking about what is on people&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t spend much time looking at metrics across my platform, but I see a lot of interesting trends, and I like being a transparent layer for the API space, so I think i will try to better track on some patterns I&rsquo;m seeing in my own network, as well as across the space, and share as stories here on the blog.</p>

<p>I was taking a look through the <a href="http://www.newscred.com/developer/docs">NewsCred API</a> yesterday and there was a parameter I have seen before, but find interesting, and wanted to share with you. It was a field called query_fields, which you could include the fields you wished to have searched, using a keyword provided in the parameter &ldquo;q&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You often see a parameter which determines which fields I get back with my response, but I like the concept of have a parameter to choose which fields I want searched in the first place. I think it is a simple, parameter based way to give developers more control over their API calls, in a way that will make sense to a wide audience.</p>
<p>Now I need to figure out a way to aggregate these simple little <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> tricks and make them available to readers when they are designing their APIs. My goal is to help API designers make their APIs as powerful as possible, while keeping the surface area as simple as possible along the way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://codenvy.com"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/codenvy/codenvy-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The production environment for delivering web and mobile applications has radically evolved in the last couple years, becoming more distributed, scalable, virtualized, and containerized. APIs, and new development frameworks are providing a smorgasbord of resources for developers to put to work, and devops is putting more power and control, throughout the development life cycle, directly into a developers hands. It is time that a developers environment evolves to keep pace with the environment developers are building applications for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">containerization in the API space</a>&nbsp;for a while now, something that is still a very manual process, so I have been looking out  for a potential development environment that matches my vision for orchestration with APIs for some time now. This is why I was stoked when I ran into Tyler Jewell (<a href="https://twitter.com/TylerJewell">@TylerJewell</a>) back in September, who introduced me to <a href="http://codenvy.co">Codenvy</a>&mdash;"a new SaaS developer environment that allows developers to create hosted environments optimized for creating, editing, compiling, testing and debugging applications authored in different programming languages&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://codenvy.com"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/codenvy/codenvy-api-ide-screenshot.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At first glance Codenvy appears to be just another web-based IDE, with autocomplete, data source management, and Github integration. As you play with more you begin to realize you can configure and share projects, allowing you to setup environments, share and even clone them. Then you realize the whole IDE is configurable, clone-able, shareable, and scalable using the ever popular Docker, complete with API or CLI access to all work spaces, projects and files. This is the environment I was looking for&mdash;this is the orchestration I envision for building applications using APIs.</p>
<p>My head is swimming with ideas of how I can orchestrate application development environments now that both the development and production environments are containerized, scalable, bite-size goodness, complete with a Github layer in the middle. While many users of Codenvy will be using to manage their own devop workflow, I will be pursuing it to manage my own infrastructure, but more importantly using it as a platform to craft <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">custom API stacks</a>, share and publish publicly, and explore more opportunities around being an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/flare"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/eclipse/eclipse-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Another layer to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/29/now-our-development-environment-is-now-containerized-and-scalable-like-our-production-environment/">release of Codenvy this week</a>, was the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20141027_cloud_initiative.php">announcement of the Eclipse project Che</a>, an open source "project to create a platform for SAAS developer environment that contains all of the tools, infrastructure, and processes necessary for a developer to edit, build, test, and debug an application&rdquo;.  Che represents the next generation IDE that runs in the cloud, which coincides with other signs I've seen around <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> moving into the IDE with signals from API pioneers like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-with-the-developers-ide/">SalesForce&nbsp;and Google</a>, or from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-delivers-relevant-api-code/">Microsoft in Visual Studio</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning about Che, but I&rsquo;m beginning to see two distinct ways Che and APIs can be employed. First lets start with the environment:</p>
<blockquote><em>You can build extensions for Che, and when those extensions are compiled into the kernel, Che creates server-side microservices, a RESTful API, and cross-browser optimized JavaScript, which is then pluggable into a browser IDE. With Che, developers are given the pluggable structure of Eclipse, but accessible through a cloud environment.</em></blockquote>
<p>This means you can orchestrate development workflows, with APIs. You can predefine, deploy, customize, maintain and orchestrate very modular development environment where everything can be controlled via API. What a perfect environment for orchestrating the next generation of application development.</p>
<p>Next I see APIs leading the development lifecycle as well, not just defining the development environment and process. Earlier stories I&rsquo;ve done on API discovery via SDKs, showcase SaleForce and Google providing native discovery of their APIs directly in Eclipse. In an Eclipse Che driven development environment, you could define pre-built, or custom API stacks, bringing exactly the API resources developers will need and bake them directly into their IDE&mdash;meaning APIs find the developers, developers don&rsquo;t have to find their own APIs.</p>
<p>This approach to API discovery via the IDE provides some various interesting opportunity for marrying with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">earlier thoughts I&rsquo;ve had around being an API broker</a>. I can envision a future where API evangelism evolves to a point where you don&rsquo;t just represent one API, you can represent many APIs, and configure API fueled developer environments for building any type of application. Think of what <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/companies.html">Backend as a Service (BaaS) providers like Parse and Kinvey</a> have been doing since 2011, but now think of pre-configured, or custom tailored IDE environments with exactly the resources you need.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting started with <a href="http://docs.codenvy.com/che/">Che</a>, and <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>, so it will take me a while to work through my thoughts on using it as an API brokerage platform. The one thing you can count on me for, is that I will tell stories all along the way as I figure it out.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-experience-design.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I really love the thought process around API design, and I am always looking for ways to push forward my craft. Telling stories is one way I do this, forcing me to make what I&rsquo;m doing understandable to a wider audience, which is also the exact thing I&rsquo;m trying to do with my API designs&mdash;mind blown!</p>
<p>An example of this in action is with my link API, which I use in multiple places across my API monitoring system. The Link API has a pretty basic design, that reflect the resource, and its underlying database structure:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/link/ (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)</li>
<li>Title, Description, and URL</li>
</ul>
<p>I use this API in numerous ways, the original API design is very much based upon the resource that it is, a link. As a developer who understands REST, and very much comes from a world of databases, this works just fine. However much of the magic around my usage of links is defined in my code, and not in my API interface, something I&rsquo;d like to change.</p>
<p>After having two separate conversations with folks about my link API, I experienced two very different motivations on using said link system, and came with very different perspectives on how to use mu ink API, that had nothing to do with the database or resource this API was born from.</p>
<p><strong>Archival Motivations</strong> <br />One person I discussed my link API with wants to use it for archiving a link. When they pass the link to an API, if it isn't already recorded it logs the URL, and then grabs a screenshot of the page, as well as stores any HTML content present. This could be a one time archive, or they could also pass a parameter that would set up a daily, weekly or monthly archive to occur.</p>
<p><strong>Harvesting Desires <br /></strong>The second person I discussed my link API with wants to use for harvesting of specific things from the page, and in this particular conversation it was to harvest all other links available on the page. You would pass the URL to the API, and get back a list of URLs available on the page. The only setting was to filter and return only URLs that contained the base URL of the URL being passed to the API (mouthful of URL).</p>
<p><strong>Pushing My Resources To Deliver Experiences </strong><br />This story reflects why I feel that companies should hurry up and begin their API journey, so they can begin moving beyond just APIs designed based upon the resources as they exist, to more of an experience based focus, designing APIs that deliver &nbsp;the solutions that people desire. Both of these folks I talked to were not programmers, and only understand APIs enough to be dangerous. They understand the basic CRUD abilities I gave with my resource design, but it doesn't excite them or really mean anything. What really motivates them was satisfying a specific need that fits in with their experiences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working on what this new set of APIs will look like based upon these thoughts, but I wanted to tell the story of this slight shift in my API design thinking. It is extremely difficult to see API design this way unless you are actively on your API journey, having discussions with people who want to use your APIs. It is easy for us developers to get caught up in perfectly defining our API resources from the technical perspective, when in reality the most important part of the journey seems to me is all about learning to craft APIs that deliver meaningful experiences, not serving up just services&mdash;experience oriented architecture over service oriented architecture.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">benefits of APIs over download of data stores</a> in the government space, and I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for other interesting examples of making data available via an API, as well as a full data download. I&rsquo;m doing a lot of research right now on the financial API space, and <a href="http://blog.quandl.com/blog/quandls-first-premium-databases/">stumbled across Quandl</a>, a data provider who has free access financial data APIs, while also selling access to premium databases.</p>
<p>Quandl has <a href="http://blog.quandl.com/blog/quandls-first-premium-databases/">aggregated 7 financial and economic databases into one database solution that you can pay to download</a>, or you can freely access via their unlimited use API--Quandl puts it like this:</p>
<blockquote><em>All these new premium databases will of course automatically benefit from Quandl&rsquo;s free data-usage features: unrestricted API access, integration with 20+ libraries and tools, unlimited downloads in any format, multiple export and visualization options, and more. (Needless to say, the addition of these premium databases to Quandl will not change the &ldquo;free Quandl experience&rdquo; in any way. All data and all features that are currently available for free on Quandl, will remain free forever.)</em></blockquote>
<p>It is an interesting approach to monetizing database assets, while also making freely available via an API. I&rsquo;m not exactly clear on what you get in database vs. the API with Quandl, but now that I have the &ldquo;building block&rdquo; identified, I will keep an eye out for other API providers who are doing similar things. Right now I&rsquo;m just looking at financial, banking, payment, and other commerce APIs, but I&rsquo;m sure there are other data providers doing similar things.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had several browser tabs open around the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/14/us-snapchat-future-security-idUSKCN0I32UJ20141014">recent Snapchat security breach</a>, hoping to craft an API-centric story around the whole affair. I think <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/apis/readyapi/security-lessons-courtesy-of-snapchat/">SmartBear covers the security lesson around the Snapchat breach well</a>, my motivation in writing a story would be more about incentivizing popular mobile platforms like Snapchat to establish a robust approach to APIs, and provide a platform for everyone discuss the tech, business, and politics of application integration, rather than keeping it all in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>Your Application Programming Interface Surface Is Publicly Available</strong><br /> As I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/07/mapping-the-world-of-internal-apis-via-rogue-api-registry/">play with tools like Charles</a>, <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>, <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">API tools</a>, and other proxy and application traffic management tools, I can easily map out the surface area of any iPhone application I have installed&mdash;providing me with a blueprint of an API, and potentially its underlying data model. If I can do this for your mobile app, you have a public API, regardless of how you view the world.</p>
<p><strong>Bring More Awareness, Control, Security, And Stability To Platform</strong><br /> The benefits of have a public API approach to delivering a public mobile application gives you a new layer to understand how not just your mobile app is using resources, it gives you a central channel for al mobile, web, and Internet of Things apps to use. An API focus gives you a central point to log how resources are being access and put to use, introduce analytics, monitoring, and other vital security components into operations. There are a wealth of API management services available on the Internet, and having an API management strategy can open up a company to a wealth of vital resources across an application's lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Legitimize 3rd Party Developers With A Modern API Platform</strong><br /> The 3rd party developer who was responsible for the latest Snapchat breach was not given official access to Snapchat APIs, because there is not formal API program. If there was a Snapchat API platform program, users could request access, and the platform could still deny acess to anyone they wished, and all applications would have to adhere to a standardized approach to dealing with identity, and access management for all resources. With a modern approach to API management, developers can be legitimized, while also providing a more secure perimeter to keep rogue applications from gaining access, and compromising privacy and security.</p>
<p><strong>Empower End-Users With Identity And Access Control (oAuth)</strong><br /> If you have a public mobile app available today, you owe it to your end-users to provide them with the latest in account management, and tools for managing who has access to their data. If you need a model for where the bar should be set, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/06/05/google-accounts-as-blueprint-for-all-software-as-a-service-applications/">go look at what Google does</a>. Modern approaches to API management, along with a common approach to using oAuth, provides the tools all mobile application users should have, allowing them to help contribute to their own security.  End-users need to be aware that they should only use mobile applications that provide API access, and oAuth controls, allowing them to take control over their digital footprint, and play an active role.</p>
<p>APIs are not a cure-all. I'm not prescribing APIs because they fix everything. I&rsquo;m prescribing APIs because it provides a layer where a platform, its users, 3rd party developers, and the public can come together and make sure any platform is seriously addressing security and privacy. APIs aren't just about innovation and all that bullshit you hear from us in Silicon Valley, they are about providing the access, and tools necessary to strike a balance in providing remote access (aka mobile) to wide variety of partners, 3rd party developers, all in support of end-users.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.snapchat.com/post/99998266095/third-party-applications-and-the-snapchat-api">Snapchat issued a response to all the API discussion on their blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>It takes time and a lot of resources to build an open and trustworthy third-party application ecosystem. That&rsquo;s why we haven&rsquo;t provided a public API to developers and why we prohibit access to the private API we use to provide our service. Don't get us wrong - we're excited by the interest in developing for the Snapchat platform - but we're going to take our time to get it right. Until then, that means any application that isn't ours but claims to offer Snapchat services violates our Terms of Use and can&rsquo;t be trusted.</em></blockquote>
<p>It does take time to build an open and trustworthy third-party application ecosystem, but with the proven blueprints already in existence, and a growing number of API service providers, it doesn't take a lot of resource. What Snapchat and other mobile providers lack is a healthy awareness of not just the tech of APIs, but also the critical business and political aspects of API operations, and just putting their head in the sand and pretending like these issues do not exist.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/services/api-management.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you have a publicly available mobile application, you have a publicly available API, and you should possess a modern API management strategy to protect the privacy and security of your end-users. How open you make access to this API is up to you, but I encourage you to make it as open as possible, providing transparency into security, and platform operations.  I don't feel like this is something state or federal government should be enforcing, but is something that should be the acceptable approach to delivering public applications, something that is enforced by end-users be educated about avoiding web and mobile applications that do not have an API, and this transparent approach, demonstrating they have each users privacy and security in mind.</p>
<p>What has happened to Snapchat will continue to happen to other companies, with an increased frequency. You can greatly mitigate the risks of having a public web or mobile application, with a formal API strategy, and <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/apis/readyapi/security-lessons-courtesy-of-snapchat/">listening to security advice from providers like SmartBear</a>, as well as protecting the interests of your end-users.  If you do not have the expertise on staff at your company or organization, let me know, I can help point you in the right direction to find the resources you will need.</p>

<p>I just finished going through my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and recording some information about each of the providers in my API monitoring system. When I started looking through my stack a couple days ago there was 830 companies listed, and after this pass through I carved the stack down to 690--why?</p>
<p><strong>APIs Go Away</strong><br /> It is a fact of life, APIs go away. I'm always amazed at how quickly an API will disappear or just fall into disrepair. I don&rsquo;t have time to assess what exactly has happened to all APIs, but if I get 404s, or can't find signs of an API program in 10 seconds, and a quick Google search, I pull them from the stack. I've noticed many start-ups seem to be coming out with a slick mobile app + API, and then a few months later the API seems to disappear. I'll start tracking on things better, and see if I can&rsquo;t produce some better examples to discuss this in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Raising The Bar</strong><br /> As I look at hundreds of APIs, and try to get familiar with them, I can't help but get frustrated by certain things, something that inevitably raises the bar of what I include in my API stack, all along the way. Sometimes I'll notice an API is actually a SOAP web service, or after playing with I find it very difficult to navigate, on-board, and actually put to use. Whatever the reasons I will remove some companies from the stack, and while I will still be keeping an eye on what they are doing (or not doing), the API is not something I'm looking to shine a light on as part of my stack.</p>
<p><strong>Hiding The Docs</strong><br /> One thing I feel like I keep coming across as I look through APIs, are companies pulling back their API documentation. As with APIs going away, I don't always have details about what types of documentation were available historically (something that is changing), so it is hard to tell if an API had docs, then moved them behind a password protected area. Regardless, if I can&rsquo;t learn about an API, without registering for yet another account, you aren't in the stack. I will not be requesting access, signing up for, or begging you for the opportunity to learn about, and showcase your API.</p>
<p><strong>API Is A Priority</strong><br /> Your API is not a &ldquo;support entry&rdquo;, or &ldquo;advanced feature&rdquo;. Your API is the next step in the evolution of your companies online presence. While I may still showcase some seemingly dysfunctional APIs, usually there is other value present there, otherwise I wouldn't be highlighting a company's effort. If your API is buried deep within your CMS, or barely a footnote in your online presence, it is likely I won't be talking about it. You can tell sites where APIs are a priority, because they have portals available at http://developer.example.com, modern API documentation, simple sub-domains like http://api.example.com for their APIs, and a link to APIs in the header or footer navigation for a site.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my API Stack will grow and shrink over time, and new APIs will come, and others will mature and be put back into the stack. Right now <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack is just a list of 690 companies doing interesting things with APIs</a>, and some basic details, with links to their efforts. I&rsquo;m working to better defining the over 100 business categories these companies exist in, as well as better define each API resource they possess, and I'm looking to continue providing a better defined API stack.</p>
<p>In 2014 when it comes to APIs I&rdquo;m a little more focused on quality, than quantity.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-puzzly-square.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just finished going through <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a>, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and looking for one simple thing&mdash;the base URL for each of their APIs. Throughout the process I looked at almost 700 API developer areas, trying to find the base URL they are using to serve up some of the most valuable API resources publicly available on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Accepting The Madness</strong><br /> When you look at 700 APIs, you have to wade through a lot of madness. When I'm looking at APIs, I&rsquo;m looking for more than just a perfectly designed API from a technical perspective, I&rsquo;m interested in value, presentation, and other more meaningful aspects. Often times I will overlook your base URL, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop me from taking note of some of the crazy domains, and subdomains people are using to provide access to their API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Patterns For Base URL</strong><br /> Once you wade through the madness, and start looking for the strongest patterns for base URLs applied across the API space, it is easy to see that two of the most common approaches are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>api.example.com -</strong> Pretty simple, common, and current approach to pointing a subdomain to a company&rsquo;s API resources.</li>
<li><strong>example.com/api -</strong> When you don&rsquo;t have control over setting up subdomains, a simple API folder is next in line.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subdomain for a company&rsquo;s API effort says a lot. When you do not put much thought into the path for your API program, it demonstrates that you will probably not put a lot into your overall API effort. A subdomain may not seem like much on the surface, but it consistently provides a barometer for other things that are going on, as I wade through these APIs.</p>
<p>Another thing I'm consistently seeing, is that many API providers assume that API consumers will understand the the API is available at the root domain, and referencing /api/v1/ as a root, without directly stating the base URL is http://example.com/api/v1/. It is not a punishable offense, but something that reflects the short-sighted, siloed world that many API providers operate within.</p>
<p><strong>A Distributed, Programmable Web</strong><br /> After identifying the strongest patterns for base URLs, the next layer of domain usage, that I found interesting, was the use of account or user based, network, and geographic based subdomain API access:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>[user].example.com -</strong> A dynamic subdomain based upon a users account, allowing for API access centered around a user&rsquo;s platform account.</li>
<li><strong>[network].example.com -</strong> A select group of network, and CDN locations. Sometimes they were based upon AWS regions like east and west coast, and other times just providing DNS redundancy with know clear geographic intent.</li>
<li><strong>[geo].example.com -</strong> Other times you would clarity in assigning API domains based upon geographic regions like US, UK, and German specific locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have three motivations in telling this story, 1) for my own education, 2) encourage more consistent patterns amongst API providers, and 3) work to understand where things might be going. I think the use of a user account, network, and geographic centered URL for your API, tells something about where things might be headed. I think that your API access will be tailored just for you by delivering virtualized containers, just for your account (you can pay for more performance), that may run on specific networks, and in specific geographic regions, as the API world move forward.</p>
<p>As I struggle to deal with the madness I'm finding across base URLs for APis, and enjoying it greatly when I come across more standard approaches, but what is really interesting me is trying to better understand how we are going to scale all of this to better meet the needs of developers, end-users, and keep pace with changes like we are seeing with the Internet of Things. How do we keep things up and running, stable, while also meeting the terms or service of online platforms, ensure security across numerous 3rd party developers, while also keeping the privacy and interests of end-users in mind?</p>
<p>In the future I can see terms of service (TOS) negotiations at the API level for each user, support in their personal needs, and keep API traffic isolated in a particular region, or via a particular network base upon a countries laws, all the way to delivering on an individual citizens wishes. For now, all I can do is try to understand what is going on, and hope for a future where this type of scalability, regionalization, and interoperability is truly a reality.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2014</span>

<p>I am tracking on around 2500 companies who are doing interesting things in the API space. Out of these companies about 1000 of them have blogs, which for me is a pretty important signal. About 1/4 of these companies with blogs, do not have an RSS feed, which in 2014 seems a little odd to me, but maybe I'm an old timer.</p>
<p>I believe that a blog is one of the most important signals, any API provider come put out, right alongside Twitter and Github. Historically I depend on the Twitter account for these RSS-less blogs, but now I'm taking a different path, and using <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com">Kimono Labs</a> to fill in the gap.</p>
<p>Using the Kimono Labs Chrome extension, I just visit the main blog page for one of these companies, and select the title of the first blog post. Kimono gives me the ability to name this field, which I usually just call &ldquo;title&rdquo;. Since the title is a link, Kimono also associates the link to the blog post, along with each title. You could also highlight the summary text, but I don&rsquo;t need this, as I have secondary processes that runs and pulls the full content of a blog post, as well as the timestamp, author, and taking of a screenshot.</p>
<p>Within a couple of seconds, using Kimono Labs, I now have an API for each companies blog, assuming the role RSS would normally play. When I have time each week, I will generate an API for the most important companies I'm tracking on. Maybe someday I will close the entire blog syndication gap for the companies I track on, but for now its nice to be able to tackle the most high value companies, and know that I have a viable solution to the problem with <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com">Kimono Labs</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-interactive-api-docs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">visual API documentation</a> a few months back, after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">I looked at the approach from OpenFDA</a>, and now after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/dwolla-using-slate-for-an-evolved-api-documentation-experience/">taking a look at the value Slate brings to API providers like Dwolla</a>, these feelings are re-surfacing in my mind. Since I have limited time, I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at putting my ideas out there, allowing anyone to step up and execute on opportunities I&rsquo;m seeing across the API space&mdash;I just do not need the extra work.</p>
<p>I love me some <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>, as you can tell from the fact that all of my APIs use <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger as the API definition format</a>, as well Swagger UI for the interactive documentation. I&rsquo;m pretty convinced of the importance of documentation being a hands-on experience, but after looking at approaches like OpenFDA, and Dwolla with their Slate driven API docs, I&rsquo;m convinced they should also be more beautiful and functional.</p>
<p>Let me explain what I would like to see developed for the API space:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Definition Core -</strong> As we are beginning to see across the space with current interactive API documentation practices, everything needs to be driven by a machine readable API definition, providing a set of instructions for how any user will engage with an API.</li>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-endpoint-visualization.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<li><strong>Interactive - </strong>In 2014 the bar is already set, and API documentation should be interactive, allowing users to make live calls to a demo, or production API, making learning about an API hands-on experience. </li>
<li><strong>Inline Code - </strong>The tools are available to generate code samples from Swagger and API Blueprint, and wherever we make an API call, we should also be able see the code for making the call inline, side-by-side with wherever I am engaging with the API&mdash;in my language of choice please!</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations -</strong> I don&rsquo;t want just to get back a response from the API, I want to be able to visualize the value returned from an API. I would like a suite of <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js visualizations</a> for each API endpoint I&rsquo;m interacting with, allowing me to immediately see the value generated by each API.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet - </strong>Allow me to export a CSV, or more robust Excel or Google Spreadsheet representation of an API. Sure, this would not be applicable to all APIs, but would bring a lot of value to many APIs out there. APIs aren&rsquo;t just for developers in 2014. Oh, and make me the D3.js code for any visualization too copy &amp; paste as well.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable - </strong>I enjoy being able to deploy my Swagger UI to any Github repository using Github Pages, and I think portability is essential for the success of API engagement. I want to be able to copy &amp; paste API expressions, visualizations, and other simple, easy to use widgets to any site, anywhere&mdash;no coding experience necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source -</strong> If you are building something like what I&rsquo;m describing, it really should be open source so that all aspects of it can be reused, by anyone, anywhere. It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to be a proprietary, closed solution, and you if are building something in this way you owe me <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$1 million dollars</span> for my ideas. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/slate/slate-tripit.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API docs have become much more than just API documentation, they have become about API discovery, education, expression, collaborations, and interactions, going way beyond just our grandfathers way of documenting an API.  We have the language (Swagger &amp; API Blueprint) to describe our APIs, lets begin providing more meaningful ways to engage with them as well.</p>
<p>If you would like to, or are already building any of these features I&rsquo;m laying out, feel free to connect with me, and I'm happy to provide feedback anywhere during the design, development, and implementation&mdash;just let me know what you need.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m a demanding bitch in the API space, expecting people to do this work for me, but the space needs it. Thanks for building it! ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://docs.dwolla.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dwolla/dwolla-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm liking the new&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.dwolla.com">Dwolla's new API docs</a>&nbsp;that they just launched. They are using an <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">open source API documentation framework called Slate</a>, developed by <a href="https://www.tripit.com">Tripit</a>, for their own API documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoy seeing the different directions that providers take with their API docs.  Slate's approach is a different path than we've been seeing with interactive docs using frameworks like <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, but provides a very intuitive, elegant documentation experience which includes code samples tailored to each API endpoint.</p>
<p>Here are the features Slate lists on the Github repository for the project:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Clean, Intuitive Design - T</strong>he description of your API is on the left side of your documentation, and all the code examples are on the right side. Inspired by Stripe's and Paypal's API docs. Slate is responsive, so it looks great on tablets, phones, and even print.</li>
<li><strong>Everything On A Single Page - </strong>Gone are the days where your users had to search through a million pages to find what they wanted. Slate puts the entire documentation on a single page. We haven't sacrificed link-ability, though. As you scroll, your browser's hash will update to the nearest header, so linking to a particular point in the documentation is still natural and easy.</li>
<li><strong>Slate Is Just Markdown - </strong>When you write docs with Slate, you're just writing Markdown, which makes it simple to edit and understand. Everything is written in Markdown &mdash; even the code samples are just Markdown code blocks!</li>
<li><strong>Write Code Samples In Multiple Languages &mdash;</strong>&nbsp;If your API has bindings in multiple programming languages, you easily put in tabs to switch between them. In your document, you'll distinguish different languages by specifying the language name at the top of each code block, just like with Github Flavored Markdown!</li>
</ul>
<p>Slate provides some pretty interesting tools for any API documentation toolbox. I also really like that they are Github-centric, acknowledging that many API providers will use Github Pages when deploying their docs, adding that <em>"Not only does this mean you get free hosting for your docs with Github Pages, but it also makes it's simple for other developers to make pull requests to your docs if they find typos or other problems.&rdquo; - s</em>omething I thoroughly enjoy across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.dwolla.com"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dwolla/dwolla-api-docs.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>It looks like to me (maybe I&rsquo;m wrong) that the code samples are hand written? Something that could easily be remedied using Swagger. It would be way cool to see a Swagger and API Blueprint generated version of Slate emerge&mdash;merging the Slate experience, with the interactive documentation experience we&rsquo;ve seen evolve over the last couple years. This way your docs would be elegant, interactive, and very utilitarian with the inline code samples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice job <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>!</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/consistent-api-program-domains.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I know that some of my readers are URI experts, URL ninjas, and masters of the domain, but most of my readers are not, and I wanted to share some of the 100K view of what I see across the world of domains, in the API space. I&rsquo;m going through my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a> over the last couple days (continuing this weekend), looking at 800+ companies who have APIs, and after going through roughly half, I&rsquo;m seeing some seriously crazy practices for crafting URIs for APIs programs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the general path to your developer program, I highly recommend providing a simple subdomain, providing access to your APIs &nbsp;in a simple, consistent path like http://developer.example.com--at the very least put it in a consistent folder like http://example.com/developers. When you put your API into your http://example.com/help/bullshit-cms-system/@$~!$(bullshit-guid$#(@)/developer/ location, it really just sends a signal that your API is just a support feature, and something that is&rsquo;t getting the resources it will need for success.</p>
<p>When it comes to identity and access management for your APIs, I recommend working from your root using http://example.com/oauth for authentication and discovering of your APIs. After that I recommend taking a similar approach to the developer program, and use http://api.example.com or http://example.com/api. It really sucks to have to guess the baseURL for any API, and if I have to download your SDK to figure out the baseURL, I may skip using your API all together. I&rsquo;m stilling processing thoughts around the dynamic API subdomains like http://accountname.example.com, giving users a custom base URL for API access.</p>
<p>Whatever you choose when configuring a domain for your API efforts, I probably don&rsquo;t need to see /rest/, /tcp/, or /http/ in the URL structure. I&rsquo;m hoping your API resources are these things, you should not have to declare it. When designing your API resources, work hard to think about the core resources, and how they will be used, not necessarily how they are being transported.</p>
<p>I will get a lot of hate from my linked data friends, restafarian cool iya's, and hypermedia homies, about my simplicity and possible errors, but my goal is to just move things forward, and not necessarily convince everyone of exactly the right way of doing things. I find that taking a pragmatic tone, providing a 100K view of what others are doing across the space, is the most effective way to influence change at a macro level.</p>
<p>If I was highlight an particular implementation I would point to Dwolla. The Dwolla developer program is pretty simple, and consistent. You can get at the developer program at <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">https://developers.dwolla.com/</a>, API documentation at <a href="https://docs.dwolla.com/">https://docs.dwolla.com/</a>, a blog at <a href="http://blog.dwolla.com/">http://blog.dwolla.com/</a>, and support at <a href="http://help.dwolla.com/">http://help.dwolla.com/</a>. You authenticate, and access the Dwolla API at <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/">https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/</a>, and can do the same for a sandbox environment at <a href="https://uat.dwolla.com/oauth/">https://uat.dwolla.com/oauth/</a>.</p>
<p>If I had to emphasize anything, I would say that consistency is the most  important thing when crafting domains for your API program, and emphasis on the fact that your API effort is a priority, not just some sort of whacky side project ran by a single employee. (oh shit, maybe most are?) Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it is fine that your developer API program is run by one crazy person in a company (I fully support this), but you can at least put some work into looking like you are organized, and sane.</p>
<p>This goal of this post is to focus on configuring a sensible base URL for your public API surface, and isn&rsquo;t about how you should craft the path to resources you are making available. In a perfect world every domain would allow /auth from the root, and employ hypermedia across all API design, but in the world we have I think just getting folks to use simple, and consistent base URLs for key areas of public API efforts, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">considerign of the usage of a APIs.json file in the root of your domain</a>,&nbsp;can be a healthy place to start when it comes to API discovery.</p>

<p>APIs came in to existence to satisfy a demand for access to valuable content, data and resources, and the more APis that are developed, the more the appetite for API consumption has grown. APIs enable website, web and mobile applications to build applications, using resources that were completely out of reach in even the recent past. Some API resources, like a simple city look-up by postal code, might be simple enough that a developer could recreate, but other resources such as global satellite imagery is something the average developer does not have the resources, or the time to create&mdash;the more API resources available, the cooler the apps we build,  and the more we hunger for valuable API resources grows.</p>
<p><strong>Starts with a Need</strong><br /> API consumers rarely want to use an API, just to learn about APIs, they have a need, a problem they need to solve. They want to provide a feature in their website, or mobile application. Often times people just want two systems to talk to each other, or be able to analyze and visualize information in a particular way, to accomplish a business or personal objective.</p>
<p><strong>Discovering The APIs You Need</strong><br /> The API savvy technologists are aware of the vast wealth of APis available today, and know to Google for the API they need, visit API directories like <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> or <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a>, and emerging API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br /> Before you can unlock the value of an API, you need to understand how common authentication patterns work for any API. Some API providers use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">basic authentication</a>, which is baked into HTTP, while others use application or developer keys to be able to talk with APIs. <a href="http://oauth.net/">oAuth</a> is fast becoming default for API providers who serve up private users information, allowing platforms to manage identity and access in a way that gives control over to end-users of applications built on top of APIs. Many providers are also using SSL as default for all API communication, protecting API consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Integration</strong><br /> Actual integration between applications and APIs, is ultimately up to API consumers, but API providers and a growing number of API tools and services, are making API integrations easier, and often automated. Most web API resources can be accessed via a simple URL, something anyone, with a basic amount of web knowledge, can integrate API resources into their world.</p>
<p><strong>Monetization</strong><br /> There are plenty of API projects to be had for fun and hobby, but for any project to be sustainable it must generate revenue and be able to sustain itself. There several proven approaches to generating revenue around API integration including application sales, providing premium features, selling content or subscription to the content, advertising, in-app payments, affiliate links, data generation, and through partnership. Of course there is always the independently funded efforts, which make things easier.</p>
<p><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong><br /> The primary motivation for API integration is to provide access to data, content, and other resources available in online Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms. Services like Evernote for notes, Pinboard for links, Flickr for photos, and Youtube for videos, all use APIs to enable integration with other applications, as well as basic data portability for software users.</p>
<p><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong><br /> Like SaaS, its cousin Platform as a Service (PaaS) employ APIs to enable application providers, developers, and hackers with the ability for rapidly deploy applications ranging from Wordpress, to ElasticSearch. Usually if an application is running on PaaS platforms like Heroku, or Google Apps Engine, there is a set of APIs for configuring, monitoring and managing most aspects of the app.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong><br /> The savviest of IT Operations have moved to the cloud, and run all of their infrastructure using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers like Amazon Web Services for everything from server capacity, and storage to DNS and content delivery networks (CDN). Every piece of IT infrastructure that runs in the cloud has an API or CLI interface for it, allowing the management of all IaaS infrastructure programmatically.</p>
<p><strong>Backend as a Service (BaaS)</strong><br /> As if we needed another acronym, but here we go, <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> is an approach for providing web and mobile app developers with a way to connect their applications to backend cloud storage and processing while also providing common features such as user management, push notifications, social networking integration, and other features that mobile users demand from their apps these days. As approaches to API deployment evolve, we are seeing more API deployment platforms emerge that very much resemble earlier goals of BaaS, allowing for the agile deployment, and consumption of valuable resources, via BaaS platform APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable Tools</strong><br /> The popularity of platforms like Twitter and Facebook owe a great deal of their buzz to the fact that there were embeddable buttons, badges, and widgets, allowing for the sharing, syndication, and engagement with their platform using API driven, embeddable tools. The ability to copy and paste a little bit of code, maybe configure a few settings, and be able to publish data, content, media, and other digital resources is the cornerstone of any API integration.</p>
<p><strong>Web Hooks</strong><br /> Webhooks enable API platforms to push data, and notify any other URL of a change or event that has occurred via the platform. Webhooks are how API platforms become a two way street, allowing API consumers to make APIs work for them, and reduce the overhead of application usage when it comes to polling API resources. Webhooks are an API integrators best friend, and always look for them on platforms before considering which resource is best for your application or use case.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong><br /> Everything on the Internet today is guided buy the terms of service of web and mobile applications, and their underlying API platforms. TOS dictate how developers can use APIs, and the end-users can take advantage of services on the platform. Nobody reads TOS before they sign up for online services, but if you are looking to build a business on top of any API, you should read the TOS to see if it is something that will support what you are looking to do.</p>
<p><strong>In Perfect World Everyone Provides and Consumes API</strong><br /> There are over thousands of public APIs available on the open Internet, and if you are building applications, you are most likely consuming APIs, as well as designing, deploying, and managing your own APIs. The best API providers, consume their own APIs, as well as the APIs of other providers. To truly understand what makes a good API, you should be consuming, as well as providing APIs.</p>
<p>In 2014 we are moving well beyond the old days of API mashups, or even applications using just a handful of APis. Applications are depending on entire stack of APIs, employing 10s or 100s of API resources to deliver applications across multiple web and mobile channels. Consuming APIs aren't just for developers, and about building applications, APIs are fueling many new trends that allow even non-developers to consume APIs and put them to use in documents, spreadsheets, and other common tools we depend on everyday for our personal and professional lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/forest-service/department-of-agriculture-forest-service.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I need your help with something. I&rsquo;m in the business of helping start-ups, all the way up to our federal government identify valuable assets, and make them more accessible for use in websites, and mobile devices. As part of this work I&rsquo;m always on the look out for valuable public assets across city, state, and the federal government, and help make sure the conversations around these assets always include APIs, so that we aren&rsquo;t just building websites, mobile applications in silos, and limiting the potential for public access, by individuals, and small businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last couple years I have cultivated a small group of API evangelists in various sectors, who help keep me informed of important government projects, and one of my partners in crime Alyssa Ravasio (<a href="https://twitter.com/alyraz">@alyraz</a>) brought a <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">pre solicitation for an RFP to my attention from the Department of Agriculture, for a &ldquo;Recreation On Stop Support Services&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;to my attention&mdash;a service you can see in action at <a href="http://www.recreation.gov/">Recreation.gov</a>. In short this is an ongoing contract that our federal government engages in with a private sector contractor on, to provide access to our nations campgrounds and campsites at our federal parks.</p>
<p>I would put our national parks and campgrounds at the top of treasured assets that this country possesses, and something that we need to make sure continue to be as accessible to individuals, and small businesses as possible. I want to take the time to respond to the pre-solicitation from the Department of Agriculture, in hopes of helping them craft a better RFP, before this goes out to bid. I also want to encourage others, who are also passionate about camping and our national parks, to submit their own feedback to the Department of Agricultures&rsquo;s solicitation number <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">AG3187S151000--Recreation One Stop Support Services</a></p>
<p>The current incarnation of the one stop service for recreation project has an API...well it has web services as part of the existing <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/RIDBWebSvcManual.pdf">Recreation Information Database (RIDB)</a>, but you also find mentions of API in the proposed RFP, under the&nbsp;<strong>5.3.9 Mapping and Geospatial Capability</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A segment of the user community will not only be accessing and viewing the mapping data through the web interface at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.recreation.gov">www.recreation.gov</a>, but will also have a need to search, retrieve, and download the geospatial data via the RIDB data sharing interface(s), or APIs.&nbsp; The Contractor shall demonstrate utilization of programming languages, formats, data types/conventions/sources, etc. which maximize the portability and usability of maps and map related data by third-parties. This minimizes the need for third-party data consumers to procure expensive and/or proprietary software to utilize, edit or manipulate the mapping data. The contractor shall ensure that all available geospatial data within R1S is incorporated into the user interface to provide users with the most complete mapping solutions available.</em></p>
<p>There is another mention of APIs under&nbsp;<strong>5.3.6 Provide Travel Planning Tools wit</strong>h:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Non Federal reservable inventory may include state and local reservable and non-reservable recreation inventory which may be incorporated into the system or accessed via various application programming interfaces (APIs).&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Then towards the end you see the following needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Sharing and Data Management -</strong> Information originating from within RIDB and imported shall be presented in a manner such that the external origin of the data is transparent to users and consistent with presentation of information originating from within.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Information Sharing -</strong> The Contractor shall deliver automated and manual services for the sharing of the consolidated recreation information described herein. The sharing service shall utilize prevailing industry best practices and technologies to make the consolidated recreation information publicly available to data consumers.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Information Consolidation -</strong> The Contractor shall deliver automated and manual services for collecting of a wide variety of recreation information from a wide range of sources including Federal Government Agencies and Federal Partner organizations such as Historic Hotels of America.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, all of this infers that whoever wins the contract will need to at least maintain what is available via the RIDB, which is nice, but it is just a web service, not a modern web API, and only reflects providing access a small portion of the valuable resource that will need to be made available via Recreation.gov, to partners, and the public at large. We can do better. An API needs to be a first class citizen in this RFP, something that is not just an afterthought, and a connection to the database that just needs to be maintained&mdash;an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">API will be central to deliver the resources</span> needed for a "one stop services for recreation".</p>
<p><strong>Camping Resources<br /></strong>When you look through the requirements for this project you see all the building blocks for allowing individuals to engage with campsites across our nation, inventory, ticketing, lotteries, permitting, day use and group facilities, special events and use, equipment rentals, recreational and pass sales. All of this keeps our national parks accessible to campers.</p>
<p><strong>Mapping and Geospatial Resources<br /></strong>Camping resources are meaningful to us because of where they are located. Mapping and geospatial resources will be vital to enabling users to discover the parks and campsites where they wish to stay on their camping trips. The ability to search, and navigate campsites via modern mapping, providing geospatial resources is central to the one stop service for recreation.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Resources<br /></strong>A third cornerstone of the recreation one stop support services platform are the financial resources. The ability to accept and process credit cards, cancellations, modifications, and refunds will play a role in every engagement on the platform. Access to to all aspects of commerce via the platform will make or break operations at every level for the one stop service for recreation.</p>
<p><strong>User Resources<br /></strong>I&rsquo;d say the fourth corner of the one stop service for recreation platform is the user. Providing secure, seamless access to user profiles, and history throughout the Recreation.gov experience will be critical to it all working. User resources are central to any modern web or mobile application in 2014, and depends on camping, geo, and financial resources to bring it all together.</p>
<p><strong>Recreation.gov Website<br /></strong>All of these resource need to be made available on at Recreation.gov, in the form of fully functioning web application providing a content management system (CMS) for managing the site, complete with a reservation system that allows users to discovery camping resources, via mapping geospatial resources, and pay for their reservations via financial resources&mdash;all via a secure, easy to access user profile.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Planning Tools<br /></strong>Beyond the core public website, and its reservation system the requires call for travel planning tools including point-to-point itinerary planning, field sales and reservations sales, third party sales, and reservable inventory management. While these tools are likely to primarily be web-based, the requirements call for remote sales and management of inventory, which requires a central API solution.</p>
<p><strong>Robust Reporting Solutions&nbsp;<br /></strong>Reporting is prominent through the requirements requiring web analytics, canned reports, customizable reports, monthly performance reporting, and enterprise reporting systems (ERS). In short, reporting will be essential to all aspects of the one stop service for recreation for both the contract winner and operator, as well as all of the agencies involved. I would add in that end-users will also need some views into their own Recreation.gov usage, adding another layer to the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Data Accessibility &amp; Portability<br /></strong>Another element that is present throughout the requirements is data access and portability, of the camping, reservation, customer (user) and resulting financial data. Pretty much everything in system should be accessible right? This definitely goes beyond just what is available va the RIDB, and requiring all aspects of the one stop service for recreation to be accessible for use in any other system, or just as download.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Required Applications &amp; Platforms<br /></strong>As part of the requirements, there is a minimum requirements for browsers, and mobile platforms that the one stop service for recreation should operate on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;"> 
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Apple Safari</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Platforms: &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;"> 
<ul>
<li>Android Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Apple iOS Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Apple Desktop OS</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows Mobile Devices</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows PC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For me this portion of the requirements are extremely vague. I agree that the Recreation.gov and travel planning tools should work in all these browsers, and be responsive on mobile browsing platforms, but these requirements seem to allude to more, without actually going there. In 2014-2016 you can&rsquo;t tell me that native mobile experiences won&rsquo;t be something end users of recreation.gov and the overall system will be demanding? Mobile wills be the gateway to the platforms mapping and geospatial resources, and APIs are how you deliver the resources needed for developing mobile applications on all of the platforms listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A One-Stop Service for Recreation Requires A Multi-Channel Approach<br /></strong>The one stop service for recreation requires a multi-channel approach to deliver the camping, mapping &amp; geo, financial and user resources to the main Recreation.gov website, supporting reservation system, travel planning tools, reporting solutions, and potentially any other web or mobile applications, and round it all off with needing to provide the data accessibility and portability that is demanded of a modern federal government platform.</p>
<p><strong>Transform The RIDB Web Service Into A Modern API And Make The Center<br /></strong>The only way you will engage with users Recreation.gov on the web and mobile locations they will demand, as well as deliver the reservation, travel planning, and reporting solutions, while making sure everything is portable, the RIDB database and supporting web services needs to be brought up to date, and transformed into a modern web API. &nbsp;The&nbsp;RFP_-_Attachment_10_-_Notional_Future_RIDB_Data_Flow_-_Sep._22_2014.pptx even reflects this vision, but the actual RFP severely falls short of describing the role an API will play in the platform.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/forest-service/ridb-api.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p><strong>Making Security A Priority Across All Aspects Of Operations<br /></strong>With a single API layer being the access layer for all web, mobile, reporting, and data accessibility channels, security takes on a whole new meaning. APIs provide single access point for all access to platform resources, allowing security, and auditing to occur in real-time, using modern approaches to API management. APIs use existing web technology, and don&rsquo;t require any special technology, but do provide a single layer to enable, monitor, and deny access to all resources, across the one stop services for recreation.</p>
<p><strong>A Centralized Metrics, Analytics, and Reporting Layer<br /></strong>Married with security, an API centric approach allows for a platform wide analytics layer, that can drive security, but also provide the data points required for the overall platform reporting system. With an API analytics layer this data can be delivered to platform, government, developer, and end-user reporting solutions. A comprehensive metrics, analytics, and reporting strategy is essential to a modern one stop services for recreation platform.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Let In the Sunlight Enforcing Transparency &amp; Accountability<br /></strong>One critical aspects of a modern, API-centric approach is the transparency and accountability it can provides. All database connections, and web or mobile applications are brokered via an API layer, requiring all applications to rely on the same pipes for reading, writing, modifying, and removing data from the system. This approach provides a secure window into all aspects of platform operations, providing the accountability requirements set forth in the proposed RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Some Constructive Criticism For Language in the Proposed RFP<br /></strong>There are some points in the proposed RFP that in my opinion move the conversation backwards rather than looking to the future, and fulfilling a vision of what the "one stop services for recreation platform" could be. One example is <strong>5.3.6.3 Third Party Sales</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Government anticipates that during the potential 10-year period of performance after go-live there may be an interest by commercial travel and recreation planning companies (such as Travelocity, Expedia, etc.) to utilize R1S inventory and availability data to facilitate R1S transactions. The Government may be open to such Third Party Sales arrangements, provided the business, financial and legal terms of the arrangement are in the Government&rsquo;s best interests. At the Government&rsquo;s request, the Contractor shall lead exploratory meetings, including Government and applicable industry representatives, to determine commercial interest in such a service and also explore the technical and fiscal feasibility of such Third Party Sales arrangements. Upon the conclusion of all necessary exploratory meetings, and should the Government decide to implement Third Party Sales, the Government will issue a formal modification to the R1S Support Services contract to incorporate the service. There is no requirement for the contractor to provide Third Party Sales services until a post-award modification is issued requiring them.</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be an interest by commercial travel and recreation planning companies (such as Travelocity, Expedia, etc.)?&rdquo; In the current online environment I am pretty sure that this shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;may&rdquo;, this should be &ldquo;will&rdquo;, and that the pace of business today moves quite a bit faster than this section describes. APIs enable a new approach to business development, that was coined 10 years ago by the co-founder of Flickr, the popular sharing platform. I understand that you will have to certify developers, but this should not get in the way of small business developers experimenting and innovating with the resources available via the platform. Business development via an API has been going on in the private sector for 10 years, and isn't something the Department of Agriculture should be putting off until the next procurement cycle for the platform.</p>
<p>The proposed RFP states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The current contract is a Variable Quantity contract with Fixed Price per-transaction pricing such that the Contractor earns a fixed fee for each transaction processed via the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.recreation.gov">www.recreation.gov</a>&nbsp;website, the telephone customer support line, or in-person at participating Federal recreation locations.&nbsp; The fixed fees under the current contract vary depending on the type of inventory being reserved, the sales channel, etc.<br /></em></p>
<p>In an era where we have over 10K API resources to use in applications, where cloud-based utility pricing is successfully being applied, and you pay for what you use across numerous industries, you can&rsquo;t have a business model like this for a public / private sector partnership, and not put APIs to use, and enabling trusted partners to build a business model around the commerce opportunities available via a platform. Right now this is exclusive to the current contract holder&nbsp;Active Network, d.b.a. ReserveAmerica, and for the next round should not be something that is exclusive to the contract winner--it should be open to the thousands of businesses that serve the parks &amp; recreation space.</p>
<p>Another item I have an issue with is ownership over the source code of the platform:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Government owns all of the inventory, transaction and customer data associated with&nbsp;<a href="http://Recreation.Gov">Recreation.Gov</a>; however the reservation system remains the sole proprietary property of the current service provider.</em></p>
<p>I know this is the current situation, but I strongly urge that for the next relationship, this is not the case. The government should own all of the inventory, transaction, and customer data, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the reservation system should be open source</span>. Period. The chances that there will be innovation via the platform if it remains a proprietary solution is slim, and requiring that the core reservation system, and supporting API platform remain open source will stimulate innovation around Recreation.gov. Any business, including the winner of the contract, can still build proprietary solutions that use the API to deliver specific applications, or end-user solutions, and premium features, but the core software should be open this time.</p>
<p><strong>Some Praise For What Is In The Proposed RFP<br /></strong>I am not one to just criticize, without providing at least some praise, acknowledging where the Department of Agriculture is looking towards the future. One area I have to note is their inclusion of the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a>, where&nbsp;#3 on the checklist for deploying in a flexible hosting environment is "resources are provisioned through an API&rdquo;, and #2 on the checklist for defaulting to open says that you should provide data sets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces). I think the&nbsp;<a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a>&nbsp;should be included with ALL federal government RFPs, and it makes me happy to see it in here.</p>
<p>I also understand the number of agencies involved in the project include the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Department of the Interior (including at least the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service), the National Archives and Records Administration and other potential Federal partners to be determined at a later date.&nbsp; Agencies involved in the trip planning component include the agencies named above, as well as the Department of Transportation; Federal Highway Administration (FHA), the Department of Commerce; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and the Smithsonian Institution. &nbsp;This is a huge undertaking, and commend them on the effort, but can't also help myself in throwing in that this is all the more reason the one stop services for recreation has to have an API. ;-)</p>
<p><strong>In Closing<br /></strong>I think I&rsquo;m finished with my response to the <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">Department of Agricultures&rsquo;s solicitation number AG3187S151000--Recreation One Stop Support Services</a>. I would like to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">request that they extend the deadline for response for another 30 days</span>, to allow me to drum up more feedback, as well as put some more thought into the RFP myself. Following your own lead of including the U.S. Digital Services Playbook, I would also recommend bringing in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a></strong> - Building on the U.S. Digital Services Playbook, 18F has an amazing set of resources to help the Department of Agriculture move forward with this RFP in a way that is in line with other leading platform efforts in the federal government&mdash;please make sure 18F is involved.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Round 3 PIFs -</strong> This is probably already be in the works, but make sure there is someone from the recent round of Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIFs) are on board, helping make sure this project is headed in the right direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately I think all the right parts and pieces are present for this project, but when it comes to &nbsp;finding the right language, and vision for the RFP, it needs a lot of help, and I'm confident that 18F and PIFs can help bring it home. The most important element for me is that <a href="http://ridb.recreation.gov/RIDBWebSvcManual.pdf">web service from the RIDB</a> needs to be transformed into a modern web API, and brought front and center to fuel every aspect of the platform. I&rsquo;m confident that if the RFP speaks the right language, the winning contractor will be able to translate the RFP into the platform it needs to be, and serve the expectations of the modern consumers who will be using the platform in coming years.</p>
<p>If this RFP goes out the door without an API vision, planning of the family camping trip will done in a silo, at Recreation.gov, and not on the mobile phones that are ubiquitous in our everyday life. User do not need a web experience that is translated to function in mobile browsers, they need a web experience when it makes sense, and a native mobile experience, and even offline when necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Planning the family vacation will not happen from just Recreation.gov, it needs to be part of a larger vacation planning experience, occurring via the online platforms we already use in our daily lives. If the Department of Agriculture focuses on an API-first vision for delivering the one stop service for recreation, it will live up to its name&mdash;truly being a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one stop service</span> that can be used for planning your recreation from any platform or device.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://siftscience.com/"><img style="padding: 25px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/1475_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending more time reaching out directly to API providers, in an effort to better understand what they are up to. A couple weeks ago, I asked Sarfaraz Rydhan (<a href="https://twitter.com/safoo">@safoo</a>)&nbsp;from the <a href="https://siftscience.com/">Fraud Detection API platform SiftScience</a>, what is the biggest challenge you face in attracting developers to your system?</p>
<blockquote><em>In many cases, the biggest challenge is developers needing context into the business and operations side of the companies they work for. We offer a machine learning powered fraud detection product to help internet companies in many verticals fight fraud. In an e-commerce integration, for example, a developer may need to know about how users interact with the store, when a customer's credit card is charged, how order information is sent to the warehouse for fulfillment, how operations analysts work within the e-commerce system.</em></blockquote>
<p>Context--something that is so important, and is often lost in translation, or forgotten entirely when APIs are purely an IT or developer led initiative. As a developer I can easily see the many uses of an API, but articulating to someone who is actually living within one of these use-case scenarios, is very difficult&mdash;something that takes a lot of practice.</p>
<p>You can see SiftScience working to provide context to its users via its <a href="https://siftscience.com/">website</a>, <a href="http://blog.siftscience.com/">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/siftscience">twitter</a>, and other <a href="https://siftscience.com/resources/tutorials/integration.html">tutorials and resources</a>. As API providers, this is why we provide essential storytelling building blocks like a blog, tutorials, and other resources&mdash;to provide the critical context someone needs to understand the value that our APIs deliver.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gift.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The world of APIs starts with an individual, company or organization, with some sort of content, data, or other digital resource, wanting to make it available, on the Internet, in a machine readable way, so that others can build sites, and applications around it. Even though APIs use the Internet for communication, it doesn't mean that they are openly accessible to anyone. Providing APIs, is very similar to providing websites, you can control which users have access to it, where they can go, and what they can do&mdash;APIs are just meant for other websites, web applications, and mobile developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solving a Problem</strong><br /> APIs are all about providing solutions, to everyday problems in our increasingly digit worlds, from sharing data with partners, developing mobile applications, to disrupting an entire legacy industry who refuses to change and evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Resources</strong><br /> Providing APIs is about open up access to content, data and other complex objects, or systems that exist within a company or organization, in a way that anyone can use the resulting resources in any programming language or external system.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Solutions</strong><br /> APIs are about the path of least resistance when making content, data, and other resources available, and in the world of APIs you see a lot of initiatives that are born in the shadows of existing company efforts, scraped from existing websites, and are often organized by rogue groups outside of normal business or even IT groups. APIs are about getting things done.</p>
<p><strong>Design First</strong><br /> Providing APIs has evolved beyond just exposing an interface that exactly reflects the content, database or other resource being made available, and establishing a design first approach where you mock, share, and collaborate around the value an API delivers, before any code is even written.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient Deployment</strong><br /> There are many roads an individual or company can take when providing APIs, from DIY approaches using open source API frameworks, to gateways provided by IT that access internal resources, and a new breed of cloud based solutions for deploying APIs from any existing systems. Whichever path a provider takes, deploying APIs is about finding the quickest, most efficient way to making API resources accessible, being used, and moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Managing Operations</strong><br /> Once the API is deployed, the work doesn't stop. Over the last decade, API pioneers have establish some pretty proven ways to manage API operations, by providing documentation, code resources, support, monitoring, communication and other resources that consumers of an API will need to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Service Composition</strong><br /> A single API, is an opportunity to provide multiple internal, external, and public consumers the ability to access resources in a variety of ways. Service composition provides a way that API providers can allow for a wide variety access to resources, to only the groups of consumers they want, charging for services in optimal ways that meet their business goals.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Monetization</strong><br /> API providers have established some new, and innovative ways for monetizing APIs, ranging from API consumers paying for use in a utility style approach, paying API consumers for driving traffic, to other more indirect ways of generating value, while covering operational costs, and monetizing usage beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Available For Discovery</strong><br /> As part of evangelism, there are emerging approaches to ensuring APIs are discoverable, by generating machine readable API definitions, and making sure APis are available to API search engines and directories. Discovery by design, is emerging as the way that API providers reach API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Meaningful Evangelism</strong><br /> There is no &ldquo;build it and they will come&rdquo; in the world of APIs. Even for internally focused APis, it will take a solid amount of evangelism to make consumers aware that an API exists, as well as achieve successful integration into any website, web application, or mobile apps.</p>
<p><strong>Emmbeddable Everywhere</strong><br /> Some APIs lend themselves to driving data, content, and other functionality across web sites, applications, and spreadsheets. JavaScript, plus APIs, are a common way to provide embeddable, API driven functionality that any site owner, social media user, and other Internet user can find API driven solutions to their problems.</p>
<p><strong>Security a Priority</strong><br /> Since APIs employ HTTP, the same communication protocol as the World Wide Web, security becomes a big priority in API operations. Most APIs are NOT publicly available, employing SSL, application keys, and other approaches to securing API access, including new standards like oAuth for handling both identification, and access to valuable API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Web Hook Relationships</strong><br /> APis don&rsquo;t just receive information, they increasingly are making calls to outside URLs, allowing API consumers to receive real-time notifications, when any data, content or other event occurs around the API resources their applications and system deepened on&mdash;making APIs a two way street.</p>
<p><strong>Balanced Terms of Service</strong><br /> In our online, digital worlds, terms of service dictate all relationships, and this is no exception in the world of APis. API terms of service make or break API operations, allowing for adjustments that protect API providers interest, but also enable API consumers to successfully integrate, and put API resources to use. Some API providers have found a balance to API terms of service, while others struggle finding the balance that will bring in API consumers, and keep them integrated.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Baked In</strong><br /> The privacy of everyone involved with providing APIs, consuming APIs, and ultimately the websites, applications, and systems that end-users are depending on is critical. Whether it is purely internal corporate systems, federal government applications, or a publicly available social network application like Facebook, privacy will set the tone for all platform operations.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency As Part Of Your DNA</strong><br /> Finding success with APIs takes a different breed of business and organizations, requiring a certain amount of transparency in operations that some people just aren't ready for. However, many companies and organizations find that by becoming an API provider, they experience a transformation, that teaches them to be more transparent, open to external ideas&mdash;resulting in changing culture.</p>
<p>Providing APIs will be something every company, non-profit organization, and government agency will be doing after 2015. APIs will be how content, data, and resources shared, and consumed in the future. In 1995 every company, organization, and government  agency was faced with the question of whether or not they should have a website, and by 2000 that question was yes. In 2010 every company, organization, and government agency was faced with the question of whether or not they should have an API, and by 2015 that question will be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YES</span></strong>.</p>
<p>The concept of providing APIs is not something exclusive to organizational entities, it is something that is also a reality for the individual. In practice, the Twitter API, enables all Twitter users to have their own API, and platforms are emerging that take this to the next level, and allow users to have content and data storage lockers, and using their own personal APIs to share, and reclaim the content and data they generate across the web each day, both personally and professionally.</p>
<p>Everyone has a website in 2014, everyone will have an API in coming years.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/ada-lovelace/ada-lovelace-1.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I track on the API space, the gender gap becomes increasingly obvious. As with many other guys, I&rsquo;m struggling with coming up with the most constructive way that I can contribute to closing the gender gap in technology. As I do with the rest of the API space, I figured I can work harder to tell more stories about women doing interesting things in the API space, while also working to understand the history of women in the space.</p>
<p>With this in mind I took the opportunity on Ada Lovelace Day, to publish a project dedicated tracking on women doing interesting things in the world of APIs, and as with the other 75+ projects, I will spend time each month moving the project forward. My goal is to find more stories for my blog, more speakers and attendees for API industry events, and make sure women are better represented across my research.</p>
<p>To kick things off, I wanted to showcase notable women in the history of compute, and by spending my day looking beyond just the Wikipedia entry, I was able compile a <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/noteable-women-in-history-of-tech.html">pretty impressive list of women who have made a significant impact on technology</a>. The list I compiled is not complete by any means, but it is far more complete than any one list I have found out there, and the big difference is my list is machine readable--meaning you can pull <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/noteable-women-in-history-of-tech.html">the JSON listing of notable women in compute history</a> and use on any other website, or in mobile applications.</p>
<p>Next up, I want to make an functional web API so anyone can search the listing, as well as provide the ability to add, and update the list via API. I want to also take advantage of the fact that my <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/women-in-tech">women in tech research website is build on Github</a>, and encourage visitors to help me make the list more complete, and extend the reach of the information available here.</p>
<p>If you know someone or something that should be represented here, feel free to reach out via the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/women-in-tech/issues/new">Github issues</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Twitter</a>, or feel free to fork the project and contribute in any way you see fit. Use the <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/updates/">updates</a> and <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> pages to find out what I&rsquo;m working on, and where I am planning to take my research next.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.ou.edu/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/the-university-of-oklahoma.png" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote a story a couple of weeks ago, about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/09/30/where-do-we-start-with-apis-at-the-university-of-oklahoma/">how to kickstart APIs at the University of Oklahoma (OU)</a>. I ended the post, saying I would find some easy targets for generating the initial APIs, and publish a basic developer portal using Github Pages. After some work I think I have enough done to initiate another conversation with my friends at OU.</p>
<p>In any company, organization, government agency, or institution, where you are trying to decide where to start with APIs, the public website is the place to start. If data and content is already published to the website, it should also be available in a machine readable format via an API&mdash;this is the obvious place to start at OU.</p>
<p>To help find the low hanging fruit, when it comes to data and content at OU, I wrote a simple script that would slowly spider every page of the ou.edu website, looking for the opportunities, providing some potential targets for deploying APIs. So far my script has identified 183,094 pages across university sub-domains, and processed 52,281 of these pages looking for any HTML tables on pages, with over 20 rows, as well as .xls spreadsheet files, and XML files.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m running the script slowly in the background, as I don&rsquo;t want to put any burden on OU sites, and just pulling pages every few seconds. To date I&rsquo;ve identified 252 pages that have large HTML tables, 330 spreadsheets, and 68 XML files. While the script will still be running and looking for more, I think this represents a pretty good start when it comes finding the low hanging fruit for open data and content at OU--resources that should be APIs.</p>
<p>As I do with all my projects, <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/">I published my work for the OU API effort on Github, as an open repository</a>. Using this repository, I&rsquo;ve published the low hanging fruit as JSON, and HTML pages to allow for easy browsing:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Tables (252) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-tables.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-tables.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets (330) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-spreadsheets.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-spreadsheets.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>XML Files (68) - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/low-hanging-fruit-xml.html">HTML</a> - <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/data/fruit-xml.json">JSON</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/discussion.html">created another page which is driven from the Github issues for the repository</a>, to help handle discussion around which tables, and files should be targeted. I will put some thought into how to improve the process, better using Github to move the conversation forward. I&rsquo;m not going to be able to do this alone, ultimately we need the students and factuality at OU to get interested in participating, but this will take time&mdash;something which Github is well suited to help manage asynchronously.</p>
<p>The next steps for this project, is to have another conversation with Mark and Adam from OU, and look through some of the low hanging fruit I&rsquo;ve identified. After that I will put together a strategy for using <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a> to help us easily publish APIs from the targets I&rsquo;ve identified. I also suspect that as part of this process there will be a lot of de-duping, and other data janitorial work before we can publish some usable APIs, and move things forward.</p>
<p>You can follow my work on this at the <a href="http://university-of-oklahoma-api.apievangelist.com/">OU API project Github repository</a>, and when it makes sense I will publish stories on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dictionary.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with different ways to compose, and examine collections of APIs. I have a database of over 2500 API that I keep an eye on, and for some of them I&rsquo;ve been generating Swagger specs, and using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to compose them into collections. I did this with 1<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">0 APIs I'm calling my utility stack</a>, because they are some of the fundamental utility style resources I depend on to make the API Evangelist network function.</p>
<p>I generated Swagger specs for the 10 following APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>bitly Data API Search</li>
<li>FullContact Name API</li>
<li>FullContact Location Normalization API</li>
<li>Pinboard All Posts API</li>
<li>AngelList Startup API</li>
<li>Wordnik WordList API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Keyword and Term Extraction</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Text Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Author Extraction API</li>
</ul>
<p>Then using these Swagger definitions, I outputted any parameters that are used for endpoints, as well as the fields for all of the APIs underlying data model. I grouped all of these fields together and created a sort of dictionary for my utility stack API collection. By doing this I&rsquo;m learning a lot about the vocabulary that each of these API providers are using, as well as beginning to see patterns across similar APIs, like text extraction APIs, and URL shortener APIs.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/utility-stack-dictionary.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>In a perfect world, APIs would use commonly established vocabularies like <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>, but in the imperfect API world we are given, I&rsquo;m enjoying taking a look at the sort of API slang that has emerged across the various types of popular APIs we are adopting.  API definition formats like Swagger give me a great way to define the surface are of APIs, and these exercises allow me to push forwards tools and approaches to understanding this new landscape.</p>
<p>The more APIs I generate Swagger definitions for, and the more tools I develop to analyze the landscape, the better I will get at communicating the interesting patterns I&rsquo;m seeing across the API space, and hopefully extract some blueprints that I can follow in my own API design work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://poemofthetimes.laneworks.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/poem-of-the-times/poem-of-the-times.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I first started Poem of the Times back around 2003, and for about five years I harvested a poem each day, from the top headlines across the  top english speaking newspapers around the world.  Sometime in 2008 I stopped generating the poem, but in an effort to showcase the potential of APIs, I thought it would be a good time to revive the project.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 of Poem of the Times used RSS to pull its headlines, and for version 2.0 I want to use APIs. Something that seems impossible when you are faced with the fact that most of the top newspapers do not have APIs, which is very sad. ;-( However in 2014 we can make APIs from any web page using Scraping to API tools like <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>.</p>
<p>Using Kimono Labs I created an APIs for each of top 25 newspapers. I worked my way down a list of top newspapers around the globe, and using Kimono&rsquo;s Chrome add-on I was able to map my API to whatever part of the news homepage featured the latest stories. This was different for each news site, and some of them threw errors when I ran Kimono, but when this happened I quickly moved on until I had 25 successful APIs&mdash;something that took me about an hour and half.</p>
<p>Now that I had 25 separate news APIs I <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/poem-of-the-times/tree/gh-pages/definitions">published a machine readable Swagger definition for each</a>, and then published an <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/poem-of-the-times/blob/gh-pages/apis.json">APIs.json listing all 25 APIs in a single Poem of the Times API collection</a>. Right now this is manual, but I know this is something that is on the Kimono roadmap, introducing the ability to automatically generate Swagger specs, and build APIs.json collections from your Kimono API catalog.</p>
<p>Next I wrote a simple PHP script that pulled the APIs.json, spidered all 25 APIs, made a call to each one, and randomly grabbed a single headline, adding to an overall poem for the day. Once I had collected 25 news stories, I hit shuffle on them again, making sure the poem was in no particular order. After that I published the results to a single HTML, and JSON file, providing a single poem for each day.</p>
<p>As I do with all of my projects, <a href="http://poemofthetimes.laneworks.net/">I published Poem of the Times as standalone Github repository</a>, and I am publishing each poem as a Jekyll blog post, and linking to each days poem JSON file. I have a job setup each day to pull the poem, but the publish to Github will be manual until I get it working 100%. My Poem of the Times projects was a great &nbsp;vehicle for learning more about <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>, while also get to play around with another way to tell stories using APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">Exploring The Possibilities of Being An API Broker</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-broker.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with different ways of building API collections using <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, and building on a concept I saw introduced by <a href="https://medium.com/@cyrilgaillard/i-dont-need-a-business-co-founder-i-need-an-api-broker-c9be536cf8fa">Cyril Gaillard&rsquo;s story titled "I don&rsquo;t need a business co-founder, I need an API broker</a>", something which was expanded on by Patricio Robles (<a href="https://twitter.com/probles">@probles</a>) on <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/would-your-company-benefit-having-api-broker/analysis/2014/09/29">ProgrammableWeb with "would your company benefit from having an API broker</a>?"</p>
<p>The concept of an API broker is interesting. If you had talked to me a year ago, I would have framed my thoughts on API brokering in a more algorithmic way, but after reading these posts, I am looking to merge in my thoughts around API evangelism, taking more of a human approach to API brokering. While I think API brokering in the future might look like more like high speed trading with algorithms doing the heavy lifting, I&rsquo;m thinking for right now it is something we need humans to bridge, bringing a more personal approach during the wild wild west days of APIs.</p>
<p>To push forward my thoughts on API brokering, I&rsquo;m playing around with describing various APIs using <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger 2.0</a>, then building a collection of these APIs using APIs.json, and publishing it all to a Github project&mdash;which for now I&rsquo;m calling the <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">Utility Stack</a>. In this exercise I&rsquo;m organizing 10 separate APIs that provide me with a very useful stack of API resources. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I will be building with all of this, but the current stack reflects what I&rsquo;m already using to manage the API Evangelist network, so I know they are useful.</p>
<p>Here are the 10 APIs I&rsquo;m working with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>AlchemyAPI Author Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Keyword &amp; Term Extraction API</li>
<li>AlchemyAPI Text Extraction API</li>
<li>Angellist Startup API</li>
<li>Bitly URL Data API</li>
<li>FullContact Location Normalization API</li>
<li>FullContact Name Normalization API</li>
<li>Pinboard Bookmark API</li>
<li>Wordnik Word Lists API</li>
<li>Wordnik Words API</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all API resources that provide some very useful elements in my operations. I use them to pull details about blog posts, look-up start-ups, shorten URLs, organize bookmarks, and other very utilitarian functions that I perform across my platform. I use these APIs for my own purposes, but for this project I&rsquo;m looking to assemble them potentially as a collection that can be used in the development of a specific application, or for ongoing development within specific company or group.</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swaggerLogo360.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Swagger version 2.0 to describe these APIs, and publishing all of it to Github, using APIs.json as an index of the collection. This allows me to generate interactive documentation for each API in the collection, which makes the entire stack accessible via a <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">single development portal</a>. I&rsquo;m still working on the authentication across all of these resources, some of which are basic API keys, and other are BasicAuth or oAuth. Its all doable though, and based upon work I&rsquo;ve done before I can easily store API keys, and oAuth credentials in the master branch of the Github repository which I keep as private.</p>
<p>To summarize this exercise, as an API broker I could easily find the resources my clients will need to build a specific web or mobile application, or accomplish a specific system integration. I could setup all of the accounts for each of the resources in a central, private configuration file that can be used by the developer hub I&rsquo;ve setup so developers can explore using interactive documentation, as well as use directly within an application.</p>
<p>Think of this applied to Cyri&rsquo;s vision of needing an API broker, or possibly something that every company would have as Patricio suggests in his ProgrammableWeb post. With this project, I&rsquo;m not deploying any APIs, I&rsquo;m merely aggregating and brokering a machine readable collection across numerous other API resources. This exercise has also shown me that I can easily identify gaps within any stack I&rsquo;m working on, and make suggestions for new APIs that help developers accomplish a specific project objective.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Imagine if I needed to add an image stack, like my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, or my <a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulate API</a>? I could easily added in other features, and resources that developers are needing, allowing them to do what they do best, building applications, and delivering on system integrations. As a broker I can do the legwork of finding the resources they need, and aggregating into a single developer hub.</p>
<p>The fun in all of this is that I have each of these API definitions in a central system, allowing me to orchestrate collections like this <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/">utility stack</a>, or possibly <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/launching-25-apis-to-assemble-a-single-poem-for-each-day/">API stacks like my poem of the times</a> that all work towards a single objective, no matter whether its for developing a specific mobile application, single page application, or any other system integration you can imagine&mdash;even just writing a simple poem each day.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.target.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/developer-target-com-portal.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing my usual monitoring of the API space, and while looking at various developer areas, I stumbled across the <a href="https://developer.target.com/">Target Developer Portal</a>. I find the Target developer portal interesting because it is publicly available, but before you can get any information you have to register or login.</p>
<p>When you land on the landing page for developer.target.com you simple get a page that says:</p>
<blockquote><em>Please Note: Access to the developer portal is restricted to Target employees and trusted third parties that currently have a working relationship with Target Corporation. Registration requests that do not meet these guidelines will be rejected.</em></blockquote>
<p>I would like to see more information about Target&rsquo;s API efforts, which I think they could do without giving away business intelligence, but overall I support the line they are walking with their API efforts. To me, Target is making a statement that they have an API, and if you are <em>"Target employees and trusted third parties"</em>, you can get more access--it is a start, so I'm hopeful.</p>
<p>I'm part of many private API discussions lately, where I&rsquo;m trying to educate companies about the benefits of being more public, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more companies take targets approach to publishing their developer API portal in coming years.</p>
<p>My only hope is that more of them will also share a blog, and other details about what they are up to, and hopefully some day even some publicly available APIs providing access to information that is already available on their website.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="http://api.report/2014/10/07/hacker-news-launches-official-api/">API news story of the day was the release of the Hacker News API</a>. I&rsquo;m only lightly interested in the fact that HN now has an API because, honestly I don't feel like an API at this point in the evolution of tech curation site is something to applaud, but their approach to making their API real-time I think does subtly reflect other currents in the API space.</p>
<p>HN partnered with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> to make sure the tech news curation site doesn't just have an API, it has a real-time API. Meaning you can now get HN links in machine readable way, so that you can build the popular flow of tech information into other web, and mobile applications&mdash;in real-time! HN launching an API&hellip;yawn! HN launch an API with Firebase bkked in, reflects a growing trend from influential APIs. For me this is more about real-time and Firebase, than it is about HN.</p>
<p>You see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/nest-provides-a-realtime-layer-by-default-for-api-consumers/">other API providers like Nest from Google baking in real-time frameworks into their APIs</a>. Real-time isn&rsquo;t something every type of API should be considering as a default feature, but there are definitely areas where the real-time flow of data is not just a nice to have, it is essential to demonstrating the value of APIs. In my experience, I would say that there are several sectors like news, financial, Internet of Things where I'm seeing real-time being present as a fundamental ingredient for the API platform--something I will be keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>As I said before, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">some of the trends I&rsquo;m tracking on are quickly moving from trend to being baked into APIs</a>, going beyond just the release of web APis, and adding additional layers that developers are demanding to deliver the features their end-users are demanding.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/trade-gov/developer-trade-gov.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been a big proponent of APIs in the federal government, and it makes me really happy to see <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> using <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/api.json">APIs.json to provide an inventory of APIs available at the federal agency</a> dedicated to strengthening "the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promotes trade and investment, and ensures fair trade through the rigorous enforcement of our trade laws and agreements".</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, it is the open format that <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist are working on to help make APIs discoverable. You can see APIs.json in action at the <a href="http://apis.io">open source API search engine APIs.io</a>, where the <a href="http://trade.gov/">International Trade Administration (ITA)</a> has submitted their APIs.json file for inclusion. ITA is the first of many federal agencies I will get to adopt the APIs.json format, and help make their valuable API resources much more discoverable, and ultimately more consumable.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a future where <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all global trade</span> is machine readable by default, and there are millions of simple, discoverable APIs available to help stimulate, as well as regulate industry? A future where the Department of Commerce and other relevant agencies are at the center, with the highest quality APIs you can imagine, and the healthiest outreach to not just industry, but also individual business owners.</p>
<p>Trade.gov&rsquo;s impressive entry into the world of APIs with <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.gov</a>, their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/the-speed-of-federal-government-when-it-runs-on-github/">quick responses to feedback</a>, and the publishing of an APIs.json file for the agency, makes me optimistic for this vision of the API economy. If our federal government can do it, then I think industries can follow the lead, ensure that the future of trade and commerce is more real-time, transparent, and accessible to everyone.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/10/06/i-updated-my-apis-to-use-swagger-20/">I Updated My APIs To Use Swagger 2.0</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swaggerLogo360.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent some time this weekend updating a handful of my APIs to the new <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger 2.0 API definition format</a>. I was already using an older version of Swagger, so the migration wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. I have about five new APIs I want to roll out over the next couple weeks, and I wanted them to up to date, using the latest version, so moving forward my knowledge using my existing APIs was the best way to prepare.</p>
<p>I moved forward the five "<a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html">core APIs</a>", as I call them, analysis, APIs, building blocks, curated, and tools, to all use Swagger 2.0. These APIs provide access to my monitoring system I use to keep track of the space. I also migrated two of my "<a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/stack-apis.html">stack APIs</a>", i<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">mage manipulation</a>, and <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture</a>, which are designed to be general purpose, utility APIs &nbsp;I use across my platform.</p>
<p>To support the migration I wrote a Swagger manager for my API monitoring system, which I use to track on 2794 APIs, from 3215 companies, which API Evangelist is one of these companies. Using this new tool I imported my old Swagger 1.2 versions, and after a little touching up in my new editor, I published brand spank&rsquo;n new Swagger 2.0 definitions for all seven my APIs.</p>
<p>The process reminded me of how API definitions really can help you describe, see, understand and ultimately communicate the API surface area you posses. I&rsquo;m going to take this and apply it to a couple of business sectors I&rsquo;m tracking on as part of my API Stack, and see what the process does for me there. After that I&rsquo;m going to get to work on the next five APIs I&rsquo;m designing, and see how Swagger 2.0 contributes to my design of brand new APIs, as well as later on in the life cycle.</p>
<p>I'm using my Swagger API definitions as a central truth for driving server side code, and my documentation. I&rsquo;m eager to continue exploring how it can further generate my client side code libraries, as well as SDKs, and help me better test, and monitor my APIs. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll perfectly automate every step in the API life cycle with Swagger, but it damn sure is making some of the steps much less painful, and following a central design truth, that in this case is a simple Swagger JSON file that I keep in a library, pushing forward my catalog of API resources, at the same time I push forward my own understand of what is possible.</p>
