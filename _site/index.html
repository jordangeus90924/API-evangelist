		<p>API Evangelist is about making sense of the world of application programming interfaces, or simple APIs. APIs have become part of every layer of our Internet connected world over the last 20 years, and this is my research project into understanding what is happening. As of 2019 I am also the Chief Evangelist for Postman, but I still use this site in the same I have since 2010, as a scratch pad for what I am working on, and stories about I see APIs being used.</p>
		<p>This isn't meant to be a blog in the traditional sense of the word, and you should think of it as Kin Lane's personal notebook that he is fine with others reading. If you have any comments about my work feel free to take it to Twitter and engage with me there, or if you feel like you'd like to talk to me personally, feel free to email info@apievangelist.com.</p>

								<h4>Gathering My Thoughts on API Discovery</h4>
								<p>I am working to load up all my API discovery experiences into my head for some upcoming conversations. So I sat down and pulled together a summary of my API discovery research to date to help refresh my memory of what has happened and how we got here. API discovery is the one of the few layers of the API space that I am personally committed to helping move things forward and being able to see all the moving parts together helps me keep doing this. Let’s take a stroll through my memory of the evolution of API discover over the last fifteen years so that I can speak more coherently about all of this with a variety of folks. ProgrammableWeb ProgrammableWeb was the first source of being able to discover API, and in 2020 it is still the place you go to find APIs. Really not much has changed in the last fifteen years with ProgrammableWeb except for the owners and operators, and the look and feel of the site. It is still where you go to look for new and existing APIs, and where you find APIs when Googling. I have fond memories of writing for ProgrammableWeb, and the site is still a great source of information for me, but I am left frustrated that PW hasn’t moved forward the API discovery conversation in any interesting ways over the years. I just think it is a missed opportunity, and reflects much about the API space that I think...</p>

								<h4>API Storytelling with Mike and Aidan</h4>
								<p>If you have followed my work you know that I like telling stories. Stories are the single most important tool in my Chief Evangelist and API Evangelist toolbox. None of the code matters in my opinion, and the stories surrounding the code is what makes the actual impact on our reality. The stories we tell each other, as well as the stories we tell ourselves. Everything in the world of technology and APIs is made up of stories. I am hovering around 5000 stories here on API Evangelist, which reflects everything I am when it comes to API Evangelist. Stories are how I make sense of the API world that has unfolded in the last twenty years. Storytelling is how I work through all of the things I do not understand, moving everything API from a very abstract realm into something that is more tangible, visible, and sometimes more meaningful to me in the real world. I couldn’t have done any of this without stories. Throughout my storytelling as the API Evangelist I have also taught myself to work through my own personal baggage over at kinlane.com. Applying the same methodology to my past and figuring out who I am today. API Evangelist has always been very much a performance, but the storytelling I engaged in as part of the performance went much deeper than being just a business production. Over the years, both of these streams of storytelling (apievangelist.com &amp; kinlane.com) have influenced others in the world, having an...</p>

								<h4>Making Sense of the Different Types of API Testing</h4>
								<p>I have to admit something. I don&rsquo;t fully grasp the entire landscape of API testing. I mean, I have a pretty decent awareness and experience in testing APIs, but I can&rsquo;t close my eyes and coherently break down each layer or type of testing, let alone competently navigate the many different types of services and tooling available on the market for API testing. Like most other dimensions of the API universe the content and guidance on the subject of API testing is all over the place. After a couple of hours Googling and making my way through my bookmarks, I uncovered a pretty expansive dictionary for what I&rsquo;d consider to be under the umbrella of API testing. First off, I have to talk about API testing in the most general sense before I get into the more and less formal API testing approaches. It was a dimension of API testing I hadn&rsquo;t considered before I began working at Postman, but API testing meaning that I am just kicking the tires on a API, learning what it is all about, and how you use it. This is what the majority of Postman&rsquo;s 13 million users are doing when they say they are testing an API with the Postman platform. THis experimental and curious approach to API testing provides a great onramp to the world of API publishing and consumption, but does little to help us articulate what API testing is or isn&rsquo;t. Beyond just &ldquo;testing out&rdquo; an API, from what I...</p>

								<h4>Keeping API Entropy Low is Needed to Continue API Growth and Expansion</h4>
								<p>I love the word entropy. It means so many things to so many different people. In means different things in the physical realm versus the informational or virtual realms. It is one of those big words you can say to confuse people, or actually get yourself in trouble being able to actually defend your position on what entropy means when around smart people. It is said that famed mathematician John Von Neumann had told fellow mathematician and creator of Information Theory that he should use the word entropy instead of information because that no one understands entropy and then you can win arguments about your theory. I also read that Shannon and Norbert Weiner also dueled over the meaning, seeing it in very opposite ways. I like the word for all of these reasons, but mostly because of its relationship to uncertainty.&nbsp; In the realm of physics entropy means, a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system In the more virtual realm of information theory, the entropy of a random variable is the average level of information, surprise, or uncertainty inherent in the variable's possible outcomes. While I could easily use entropy as a metaphor for APIs in the physical sense, it is really the appropriation of it for information theory that really brings it home for me. Entropy in Shannon&rsquo;s time was centered around noise or static in communication,...</p>

								<h4>Examples of Minimum Viable and Complete Landscape APIs.json Index Files</h4>
								<p>&lt;p&gt;I am preparing for the next version of APIs.json and I am taking another pass over what the specification is, but also taking a fresh look at why the specification exists. Part of this fresh look involves assessing what I consider to be the low bar for an APIs.json index, as well as what the entire scope might look like. To help me (and you) understand the scope of what APIs.json or APIs.yaml can do when it comes to indexing our API operations and making them discoverable in a machine readable way.&lt;/p&gt; The most important thing to remember about APIs.json is that it is all about indexing API operations in a way that acknowledges that there are two sides of this API integration game which need to be indexed and made discoverable across an organization. Human Readable - Providing URL references for the aspects of API Operations that human stakeholders will need to understand what is happening with APIs and how to put them to work in applications. Machine Readable - Providing URL references for aspects of API Operations that are system and applications can use to make sense of API Operations, accessing as a machine readable definition. APIs.json is about indexing all of these human and machine readable aspects of our API Operations with an emphasis on evolving human readable elements to also be machine readable so that as much of the surface area of our API operations is indexable by other systems and applications as possible. There is...</p>
