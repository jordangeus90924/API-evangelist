{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of the biggest areas around APIs I think needs attention in 2012 is more tools that focus on developers.There are plenty API services and tools focusing on API owners, but we need to start making sure developers are taken care of.So its nice to see the Mashery’s new Developer Connect, which matches developers with companies looking for specific API development skills.Mashery partnered with Elance to develop the API skill matchmaking service, powered by Elance’s huge network of professional technical talent.There are plenty of developers out there who have polished their skills working with specific APIs, either on production, or hobby development projects, and would love to find freelance work, and make some money of their talent.</p>
