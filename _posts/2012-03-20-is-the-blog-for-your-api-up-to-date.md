{% include JB/setup %}<p>As a building block, a blog is a very valuable tool for building awareness of your API, keeping your developers informed and give a personality to the team beyond an API.My recommendation to API owners is to always have a blog, however one the most damaging things you can do is stop posting to your blog.A blog is a key variable in my API Stack algorithm, of whether or not an API is worth integrating with, and if you havenâ€™t updated your blog anytime in the last year, I immediately step away.If you want people to find your API, have a blog.If you want your existing developers to be educated about what can be done with your API, have blog.</p>
