[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/app-showcase/Appstores.png" alt="" align="right" />][1]When I review a new API, I take a look at the technology they provide, but I tend to focus on the business of their API.

One area I look at, is what tools they use to deliver the [building blocks that make up their API][2]. Did they build it themselves? Did they use [Mashery][3], [Apigee][4] or [3Scale][5]? Are they using other open-source tools or a software as a service (SaaS) provider?

I'm always on the look out for new open-source tools or services providers that can be leveraged for APIs in this way. My goal is to find an open-source solution or service provider for [each one of the building blocks I have defined][6]. Some examples are:

  * [API documentation with SDK Bridge][7]
  * [API forums with Get Satisfaction][8]
  * [Application Showcase with AppStores.com][9]
I like to have an open-source tool available for each building block, but having a solid company that can deliver specialized services for a API, and have them up and running instantly is even better.

Some characteristics I look for in a service provider are:

  * **Self-service** \- Instant registration and activation of services.
  * **Branding** \- The ability to brand and make look like your API area.
  * **Tiered Pricing** \- A pay as you go model allowing small companies to try out first, then grow as needed.
  * **DNS** \- Ability to point subdomain at service, to keep with a single company domain.
  * **Support** \- Quality support from self-service forum to someone you can talk to.
  * **Focus** \- Delivering a high quality service ina single area, and not trying to be everything to everyone.
  * **Data Portability** \- The ability to take **ALL** of your data with you when you are ready to leave is critical.
These are just a few of the key strengths I look for when finding [API tool][10] and [service providers][11].

As an example, take a look at [AppStores.com][12], they have almost everything I look for in a [building block][13] service provider. They are still working on the self-service and tiered pricing aspects, but its at least on their roadmap.

Do you have any open-source tools or software as a service providers that you use to deliver your API?
