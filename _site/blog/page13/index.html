<p>I have been slowly evolving the data core of each of my research projects from JSON to YAML. I'm still providing JSON, and even XML, Atom, CSV, and other machine-readable representations as part of my research, but the core of each project, which lives in the Jekyll _data folder are all YAML moving forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first started using YAML I didn't much care for it. When the OpenAPI Specification introduced the YAML version, in addition to the JSON version, I wasn't all that impressed. It felt like the early days of JSON back in 2008 when I was making the switch from primarily XML to a more JSON-friendly&nbsp;environment. It took me a while to like JSON&nbsp;because I really liked my XML--now it is taking me a while to like YAML&nbsp;because I really like my JSON.</p>
<p>I do not anticipate that JSON will go the same way that XML did for me. I think it will remain a dominant machine-readable format in what I do, but YAML is proving to have more value as the core of my work--especially when it is managed with Jekyll and Github. I am enjoying having been in the industry long enough to see these cycles, and be in a position where I can hopefully think more thoughtfully&nbsp;about each one as it occurs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/d3js-visualizations-using-yaml-and-jekyll/">D3.js Visualizations Using YAML and Jekyll</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://d3.js.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/bar-chart/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://d3.js.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/images/d3-js-bar-chart.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am increasingly using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> as part of my storytelling process. Since all my websites run using Jekyll, and published entirely using Github repositories wich are shared as Github Page sites, it makes sense to standardize how I publish my visualizations.</p>
<p>Jekyll provides a wealth of data management tools, including the ability to manage YAML dta stores in the _data folder. An approach I feel is not very well understand, and lacks real world examples regarding how to use when managing open data--I am looking to change that.</p>
<p>I like my data visualizations beautiful, dynamic, with the data right behind--making <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> the obvious choice. For this work, I took data intended for use as a bar and pie chart&nbsp;and published as YAML to this Github repositories _data folder. This approach to centrally storing machine-readable data, in the simple, more readable YAML format, makes the data behind visualizations much more accessible in my opinion.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/0ee5a0eff2de2038dc3b69b88f563097.js"></script>
<p>The problem with using D3.js visualization&nbsp;is that I need it in JSON format. Thankfully, using Jekyll and Liquid, I can easily establish dynamic versions of my data in JSON, XML, or any other format I need it in. I place these JSON pages in a separate folder I am just calling /data.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/148fd30889a79d324bd21e7c271cbb5b.js"></script>
<p>Now I have the JSON I need to power my D3.js visualizations. To share the actual visualization, I created separate editions for my bar and pie charts, and have the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for each chart, in its own file.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/27a4628dbb9c3f4392b2efb8d7500366.js"></script>
<p>There are two things being accomplished here. 1) I'm decoupling the data source in a way that makes it easier to swap in and out different D3.js visualizations, and 2) I'm centralizing the data management, making it easily managed by even a non-technical operator, who just needs to grasp how Jekyll and YAML works--which dramatically lowers the barriers to entry for managing the data needed for visualizations.</p>
<p>There is definitely a learning curve involved. Jekyll, Github Pages, and YAML take some time to absorb, but the reverse engineerability of this approach lends itself to reuse&nbsp;and reworking by any data curious person that isn't afraid of Github. I'm hoping to keep publishing any new D3.js visualization I create in this way, to provide small, forkable, data-driven visualizations that can be used as part of data storytelling efforts-<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/d3-js-using-yaml-jekyll">everything here is available as a public repo</a>.</p>
<p>As a 25-year data veteran, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2016/08/15/using-github-repos-and-jekyll-as-a-data-store/">I find myself very intrigued with the potential of Jekyll as a data management solution, something that when you combine with the social coding benefits of Github, and Github Pages, can unleash unlimited possibilities</a>. I'm going to keep working to define small, modular examples of how to do this, and publish as individual Github lessons for you to fork and learn from.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/a-trusted-github-authentication-layer-for-api-management/">A Trusted Github Authentication Layer For API Management</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am reworking the management layer for my APIs. For the last couple of years, I had aspirations of running my APIs with a retail layer generating revenue for API Evangelist--something which required a more comprehensive API management layer. In 2016, I'm not really interested in generating revenue from the APIs I operate, I'm just looking to put them to work in my own business, and if others want access I'm happy to open things up and broker some volume deals.</p>
<p>To accomplish this I really do not need heavy security or service composition for my APIs, I'm just needed to limit who has access so they aren't just 100% public, and identify those who are using, and how much they are actually consuming. To facilitate this I am just going to use Github as a trusted layer for authentication. Using an OAuth proxy, I'll let my own applications authenticate using their respective Github user, and identify themselves using a Github OAuth token when making calls to each API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each application I have operating on top of my APIs have its own Github account. Once they do the OAuth dance with my proxy, my system will then have a Github token identifying who they are. I won't need to validate the token is still good with each call, something I'll verify each hour or day, and cache locally to improve API performance. Anytime an unidentified token comes through, I'll just make a call to Github, and get the Github users associated, and check them against a trusted list of Github users who I have approved for accessing my APIs.</p>
<p>I'm not really interested in securing access to all the content, data, and algorithms I'm exposing using APIs. I'm only looking to identify which applications are putting them to work&nbsp;and evaluate their amount of usage each day and month. This way I can monitor my own API consumption, while still opening things up to partners or any other 3rd party developer that I trust--if they are using too much, I can drop them a message to have a conversation about next steps.</p>
<p>I'm still rolling out this system out, but it got me thinking about API access in general, and the possibilities that a trusted list of Github accounts could be used to expedite API registration, application setup, and the obtaining keys. Imagine if as a developer I could just ping any API, do an OAuth dance with my Github credentials, and get back my application id and secret keys for making API calls--all in a single flow. As an API provider I could just maintain a single trusted list of Github users, as well as consult other lists maintained by companies or individuals I trust, and reduce friction when onboarding, or automatically&nbsp;approve developers for higher levels of access and consumption.</p>

<p>APIs come in all different shapes and sizes. I focus on a specific type of APIs that leverage web technology for making data, content, and algorithms available over the Internet. While these APIs are available on the open Internet, who has the ability to discover, and put them to use will vary significantly. APIs have gained in popularity because of successful publicly available APIs like Twitter and Twilio, something that has contributed to these types of APIs being the dominant narrative of what APIs are.</p>
<p>A lack of awareness of what modern approaches to API management can do for securing web APIs as well as the dominance of this narrative that APIs need to be open like Twitter and Twilio tends to set the bar to unrealistic levels for API providers. Who has access to a web API is just one dimension of what APIs are, and sharing content, data, and algorithms securely via the web should be the focus. It's not whether&nbsp;or not we should do public or private APIs--it is about how you will be sharing your resources in a digital economy.</p>
<p>While I encourage ALL companies, institutions, and government agencies to be as transparent as they possibly can regarding the presence of their APIs, its documentation, and other resources--who actually&nbsp;can access them is entirely up to the discretion of each provider. You should treat ALL your APIs like they use public infrastructure (aka the web), secure them appropriately, and get to work making sure all your digital resources are accessible in this way, not being bogged down by useless legacy discussions.</p>
<p>Which is why I support putting the concept of the public API to rest as a dominant narrative around what is an API--you shouldn't hear me talking about public vs private anymore. If you do slap me.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Sep 2016</span>
        <p>The power of Jekyll on Github Pages as a data management solutions is not a very widely held concept. I'm always amazed at how technologists and programmers don't understand <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, let alone how it can be used as a data engine--maybe I can help a little by sharing my own usage. As I develop examples of this in action, I want to publish them as <a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/">Github repositories that anyone can fork and reverse engineer to use in their own work</a>.</p>
<p>While it was not love at first sight for me, I'm increasingly becoming a fan of using YAML for storing and managing a significant portion of the data I use across my business. Part of the reasons I'm using YAML is its readability. The other reasons stem from the augmented benefits of using Jekyll and Github Pages to store and syndicate machine readable YAML for use across my storytelling--when you put YAML data into the _data folder for any Jekyll site, it opens up a new world of possibilities.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/325b2f3ca761b5deaf52666f78117b5d.js"></script>
<p>Any YAML data I put into the _data folder immediately become objects I can work with across any HTML page within a Jekyll site, <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">using Liquid</a>. Where this really starts to impact my world is when I started dynamically generating other formats of data stored as YAML.</p>
<p>First up is JSON. Here is the file I am using to generate a JSON representation of my central YAML file stored in _data folder.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/470db918abe87ac309c373c998e7a1c1.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/data/products.json">Which when I view in my browser, via the Jekyll driven, Github Pages published website&nbsp;I get a separate JSON representation</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/01a280996ba007a6806852ae312ef26b.js"></script>
<p>Next up is XML. Here is the file I am using to generate a XML representation of my central YAML file stored in _data folder.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/37f5a98f29869dce1f243ea5a9a4ba7d.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/data/products.xml">Which when I view in my browser, via the Jekyll driven, Github Pages published website&nbsp;I get a separate XML representation</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/4abec529e89e4b87a558a6e15986d8a3.js"></script>
<p>Next up is Atom. Maybe I may want a feed of the latest products added to the catalog, so here is the file I am using to generate an Atom XML representation of my central YAML file stored in _data folder.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/48fbdd576049d25257b2efafba7e0738.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/data/atom.xml">Which when I view in my browser, via the Jekyll driven, Github Pages published website, I get a separate Atom XML representation</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/c4ecdeadf80622c2b54e040355745f2b.js"></script>
<p>From a single YAML file, I just generated a JSON, XML, and Atom representation of the same list of products. <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/xml-json-using-yaml-jekyll">It is all stored in a Github repository, and published as a Jekyll website hosted using Github Pages</a>. This particular Github repo is meant to just be a demonstration of what is possible using Jekyll, YAML, and Github Pages. I will use this work as a base in a variety of other projects, where I use these various formats to drive web and mobile applications, as well as visualizations and analytics used across my API storytelling.</p>
<p>There are a wealth of reasons why I conduct this type of work. First, it is work I will use in my own research and storytelling, which all operates using Github and Jekyll. Second, doing my work out in the open, using open source tools and definitions, published as Github repositories making my work forkable, and reusable by others. There is a learning curve involved with unpacking what is happening here, but I feel pretty strongly that these are reusable modules that anyone can put to use--not just developers.</p>
<p>I will publish other examples of this in action as I develop them. When I need the Liquid scripts to generate JSON, XML, or Atom feeds in any of my projects I will just visit this repo, and copy / paste. When I develop new ones I will generalize and publish here for everyone to use as well.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-portal.jpg" alt="" width="20%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">I am updating my minimum API portal definition</a>&nbsp;so I can apply to my own API infrastructure, and since I operate 100% on Github using Github Page and Jekyll, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/portal-minimum">I have made it a forkable API portal definition that anyone can put to work as their own API developer portal</a>. This edition of my API portal definition uses Bootstrap for its UI, and Jekyll for the CMS, making it pretty extensible, and remixable once you fork it on Github.</p>
<p>My goal was to make a simple, forkable API portal, that could act as a checklist for API providers looking to quickly set up a presence for their API. I know many companies, institutions, and government agencies do not have the resources&nbsp;to host one, let alone the time to pay attention to all the details--that is my job! To help API providers out, I have included what I feel is a&nbsp;complete API portal in the&nbsp;_config.yml for the Jekyll site.</p>
<p>All you have to do is scroll down the API portal definition and comment out what you don't want, and fill in the areas you do, and the Jekyll site should do the rest. I've included the most common areas I like to see from all API providers in my definition.</p>

<p>This is just the first draft of my forkable API portal definition. I am going to apply to my Kin Lane, and API Evangelist API infrastructure, as well as a handful of independent APIs that I operate. Then I'm going to apply it to a couple of government APIs I want to simplify, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/08/defining-api-surface-area-by-converting-html-forms-to-open-api-specs/">like the USGS Water Services I am working o</a>n, to harden it a little bit. Sometimes all it takes is to better organize the information for an API, to help make it more accessible, and intuitive, reducing the friction when trying to get up and running.</p>
<p>I would wait a couple weeks to fork the API portal definition, until I stabilize it some more against theother APIs, unless you are feeling adventurous. If you aren't afraid of working with YAML, Jekyll, and Liquid driven HTML, the API portal is pretty fun to play with. If nothing else, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/portal-minimum/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml">you can use the&nbsp;_config.yml as a checklist to think about as you review or craft your own API portal</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Sep 2016</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-sketchbook.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I have a vision of an API notebook in my head I desperately want to get out. First of all, I want to come up with another name for it, which is a journey that always starts with playing around with synonyms. Direct synonyms of notebook include a diary, journal, log, workbook, pad, and binder-yes, all of that is relevant to what I would like to see. After that, a few other words resonated, including album, collection, portfolio, and registry.</p>
<p>This isn't just a folder to put my API definitions. It will be the place where I go to find all <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">the definitions of 3rd party API which IÂ depend on</a>, as well as the APIs I'm designing, deploying, and operating as part of my own business. I want to be able to just record ideas, sketches, and thoughts I have as I'm thinking about APIs. I want to be able to annotate APIs that I find, and iterate, remix, and riff off of other API designers and architects work. Maybe an API sketchbook?</p>
<p>An artistic design book is just the beginning. I'd also like it to be my professional sketchbook,Â where my business partners and customers can discover the API I depend on, and share with the world. I want it to be a directory of APIs that are relevant to my business. My sketchbook is where I'm creative, but it is also where I get business done. Maybe acting as an API portfolio? I want it to be fun, but also accommodate my professional existence as well.Â </p>
<p>I just want a place where I can design and evolve the API definitions that impact my world. I want to be able to share them, as well as subscribe to other people's API designs. I want my designs versioned, and be able to play back their evolution, and see a timeline, and possibly the attributions of where I found my API inspiration, or leveraged an existing definition or specification. My API sketchbook / folio should evolve with me, and help me make sense of all the API definitions I use, discovery new ones, and always help me not reinvent the wheel.Â </p>
<p>Crafting my dream API sketchbook / portfolio is easier to write about than it will be to build. Doing it simply and beautifully will be hard. Doing it so it scales, and allows me to manage not just 10s or 100s of APIs, but work from thousands of APIs will be very difficult. I'm hoping it is something that I won't have to build on my own, and is an idea that many will contribute to, helping push forward the converstion around how we craft, store, organize, and collaborate around the APIs that are increasingly playing a central role in our business and personal world.</p>

<p>Leading API providers do not always make me happy with they way they conduct themselves, but it always makes me smile that one of the top API providers consistently over the last five years, continues to do things right, and set a good example that I can write about. I am not delusional to think that everything is perfect behind the Twilio curtain, but a story&nbsp;from Gordon Wintrob (<a href="https://twitter.com/gwintrob">@gwintrob</a>) about how T<a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.wmhz62h57">wilio's distributed team solves developer </a><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.wmhz62h57">evangelism</a>&nbsp;leaves me hopeful (once again) about the potential of APIs.</p>
<p>There are several gems in this post, but one of them that stood out for me, and I think reflects the API potential which more companies should be emulating, is about how Twilio designs, develops&nbsp;and evolves new APIs. I think Gordon tells it the best:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.eigslel5d">We also have a broader concept of our Developer Network, which handles a lot of the coding and writing for our public-facing documentation, blog posts, and our interactions with the community. Typically they&rsquo;ll give feedback on the budding ideas for the new API. This feedback comes long before it goes out to the first beta customers.</a></em></p>
<div><em><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.eigslel5d">The Developer Network brings a fresh set of eyes with less biased perspectives. They&rsquo;ll say things like, &ldquo;You know what? These parts of the API are awesome. This is what I would use it for.&rdquo; or &ldquo;These are the things that need work.&rdquo; That way we know how the API would work for a developer at a hackathon or trying to finish the story points in a sprint. How do we make it as easy as possible for them?</a></em></div>
<p id="fd0b" class="graf--p graf-after--p" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.eigslel5d">Once the API or service comes together, we go to a closed beta process for a small group of customers. If we do a product announcement at all, then we&rsquo;ll have a &ldquo;request access&rdquo; button. We&rsquo;ll use that as a list of people that are really chomping at the bit to get coding. Then, after a period of time, when we have some API stability with people in our private beta process, we&rsquo;ll switch to a public beta. Then it&rsquo;s open to everyone who needs access.</a></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.eigslel5d">We get more feedback before we go fully operational, but there should be no API instability after a public beta period. As an API company, we can&rsquo;t go and change that underlying API once it&rsquo;s in production. That would be a terrible experience. If we really need to change that endpoint API, it should be a new version.</a></em></p>
<p>Forgive me for just copying and pasting this much from your story Gordon, but I think it needs isolation as its own story. This is the approach to designing, developing, and operating APIs that companies need to hear more about. These are the technical product development benefits which being API-first can bring to the table. It's not just about providing data, content, and algorithms available via the web, it is about opening up the conception, design, and iteration of these API resource in a structured, collaborative, and evolutionary lifecycle on the web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what makes Twilio such a great API role model to showcase. I know Gordon is telling pretty stories, originating from Twilio, but like the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">secret to Amazon's success</a>--these stories can have a significant impact on how individuals, companies, institutions, and government gencies approach technology within their own operations. Thanks for such a good story Gordon, providing me with some material to riff on.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">I've been pushing for better API design tooling for some time now</a>, something that significantly overlaps with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">movements I would also like to see around API documentation as well</a>. In my opinion, we have made significant strides with the introduction of Swagger UI, as well as pushed the API documentation conversation to be part of the API design process by Apiary. This is something that was further re-enforced with the evolution of Swagger UI to be part of the Swagger Editor toolkit--where Swagger UI was used in real-time as part of the API design process, not just later down the road as API documentation for consumers.</p>
<p>This demonstrates for me the importance of API documentation, not just in helping API consumers understand what an API does at integration time, but also for API providers at design, mock, test, and any other time during the API lifecycle. Functional, attractive looking, and often interactive documentation that describes what an API does is needed from design to deprecation, and is an area of the API world that I feel is pretty underserved at the moment.</p>
<p>Swagger UI is a 100% client side JavaScript solution, which if you've ever cracked open the code, know that it cannot be used as a base template to move this&nbsp;conversation forward. The more <a href="https://github.com/lord/slate">attractive Slate solution</a> is appealing right up <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">until you realize it doesn't perpetuate the machine readable API core</a> we will need to successfully integrate with every other stop along the API lifecycle. I haven't seen any movement out <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">the efforts to make an OpenAPI Spec driven Slate</a>, but I am pleased with the movements by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/25/a-new-open-source-interactive-api-documentation-from-folks-over-at-lucybot/">Lucybot in their Lucybot Console</a>. These are moving the needle a little bit&nbsp;but won't get us far down the road when it comes to API documentation that can be used across all stops along the lifecycle without friction.</p>
<p>We will need API documentation that can be published in web, mobile, and &nbsp;desktop solutions that are serving the API community. It needs to be easily embeddable, on any platform, and help API designers, architects, consumers, analysts, and anyone else with a stake in the outcome &nbsp;understand what the hell is going on. We need our API documentation to be plug and play in our API portals like Swagger UI has been. We need API documentation to be a driver of the API design and mock conversations like Apiary has injected. We need it to drive other areas of API management like Gelato and Readme are doing, or other areas of the API lifecycle like APIMATIC is doing for helping us managing SDKs.</p>
<p>We need a 100% client-side solution, as well as a diverse range of supercharged server and desktop solutions, that can be used across the API life cycle, whether supporting creation or consumption. We need an open source solution run by a benevolent dictator (not it), who will help ensure its platform agnostic, and has a fully customizable UI and styling, which can be embedded into leading API services and tooling, helping standardize the documentation for each area of the API lifecycle. We need the next steps in the evolution of API documentation, and visualization to be set into motion in 2016.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-openapi-spec.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I feel like we haven't really sat down and studied the success of Swagger UI. I'm not talking about the OpenAPI Spec (fka Swagger Spec), I am only talking about the interactive API documentation that you can find on Github. Aside from the shitshow that was the movement of Swagger to be OpenSpec API, I'm thinking there are some lessons available around just the interactive API documentation itself.</p>
<p>First, we have to acknowledge that many people think Swagger is the documentation, and do not understand the separate nature of the specification, and the UI layer that is meant to be API documentation, and used within API tooling like the Swagger Editor. While there are numerous benefits realized from the concept of the OpenAPI Spec, the number one reason people implement is to deploy the interactive API documentation.</p>
<p>People need documentation for their API to communicate what it does with consumers, as well as other key stakeholders throughout the API life cycle. From what I can tell, this need is not being addressed in any new and innovative ways since the launch of Swagger UI, aside from the small group of API documentation service provider that have emerged. I can get behind paying for additional API lifecycle solutions as part of a service, but API document just seems like it should always be free by default--as well as evolved separately from the concerns of an aspiring startup.Â </p>
<p>Let me try and sum up what made Swagger UI so good. It was forkable. You could fork the repo, make tweaks to the core Swagger JSON file, and if you had it published using Github Pages, you had documentation! I feel like this represents the minimum viable expenditures that API developers are willing to make when it comes to providing API documentation -- WSDL +1 (not very much). If you could understand how to tweak the JSON file, which many just see as a config file for Swagger (UI), you could have good looking (enough) API docs.</p>
<p>Nobody has evolved on this concept. Nobody. I'm sorry, there are some slick implementations within leading API service providers, but nobody has even replicated what is Swagger UI, using the Slate, Lucybot, or other evolved and attractive UI. We need a simple, forkable, OpenAPI Spec driven replacement for Swagger UI--just to compete. Then we need to get to work on a better iteration of it, something that can be used in any web, mobile, or desktop solution. Sadly, API providers don't want to work very hard to publish documentation and other resources, and I'm guessing that if they have to cough up some money, they'll most often just keep looking.</p>
<p>I feel like nobody has stopped to consider the success of Swagger UI. Not even the Swagger team. Nobody is building upon the forkability, and plug and playability that Swagger UI brought to API documentation. You know why? Because everyone is focused on building products. The OG Swagger wasn't a product, it was built to deliver on a need that API providers had. Everyone is focusing on building the next service they can sell, not the next solution API providers will need. I know, we need people building good products and services--I agree. The problem is when EVERYONE is focused on products and services, and nobody is interested delivering the open tooling the community needs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/swagger_ui_petstore.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>A friend of mine was asking where he should get started with upgrading the documentation for an existing API, and was asking for assistance on what tools or services he should be considering. The state of things when it comes to API document shifts and changes, which is why I do my research the way I do, to ensure I have <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">a single static location I can go find the latest for my research in API documentation</a>, when I get questions like this.</p>
<p>Discussing API documentation like many aspects of the API conversation can be difficult, due to a wide range of views on exactly what is API documentation. Some people consider the entire API portal, including the documentation, some include other code libraries, etc, but I define it as specific documentation describing the API surface area (auth &amp; request / response). As I begin my work, at first glance, the world of API documentation seems like it has evolved, but after a quick look through my research, I see it really hasn't evolved that much.</p>
<p><strong>Swagger UI Changing How We Document Our APIs</strong><br />In 2011 how we documented our APIs changed significantly with the introduction of the <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger specification and UI</a>. The simple, visual, interactive documentation which was driven by the now OPenAPI Spec, shifted the conversation for how we provide documentation. All you had to do was generate the machine-readable specification, and the interactive documentation was automatically generated--solving one of the biggest obstacles for API providers.</p>
<p><strong>Apiary Providing Design, Mocking, Testing, and Documentation</strong><br />Building on what Swagger UI provided, the service provider <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io </a>entered the game with their own version of the API documentation but shifted the conversation around documenting APIs earlier on in the life-cycle, during the design portion of the work. I consider Apiary to be first and foremost an API design service provider, but they are also a contender when it comes to API documentation because their solution spans multiple stops along the life cycle including design, mocking, testing, portal, and documentation.</p>
<p>In the last five years, I've watched Swagger play a central role in many of the design, and documentation solutions out there, with providers like Restlet and Apigee following the lead for how we document our APIs--further contributing to the success of OpenAPI Spec as the driving specification. I've also watched Apiary evolve as a service, and adopt OpenAPI Spec as well as yusing their own format API Blueprint, as the driving specification for API documentation--setting the stage for a new breed of API service providers.</p>
<p><strong>API Documentation Service Providers</strong><br />Along the way other services have launched, building on what we've seen from Apiary, but I think taking the API portal, and API documentation conversations in their own direction.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gelato.io/">Gelato.io</a> - An API portal plus documentation service that was now purchased by Mashape.</li>
<li><a href="https://readme.io/">Readme.io</a> - Another API portal plus documentation service, with a wealth of API management resources.</li>
<li><a href="https://api-docs.io/">API Doc</a> - A simple, free OpenAPI Spec and RAML-driven API documentation solution from Stoplight.io team.</li>
<li><a href="https://restunited.com/">Rest United</a> - A pretty robust PI documentation and SDK solution that supports all major API definition formats.</li>
<li><a href="http://apidox.net/">APIDox</a> - An XML driven API documentation solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I like the robustness of Readme.io and REST United, but dig the simplicity, and machine readability of API Doc. Honestly, I don't see the sense for an API documentation service provider that doesn't support ALL the API definition formats. I don't care what stops along the API life cycle you are serving you should speak API definition by default. I believe that these API service providers are playing an important role in moving the conversation forward, but I think it is also something that gets balanced out by a number of open source offerings out there as well.</p>
<p><strong>Some Of The Open Source OpenAPI Spec Options</strong><br />As with API management, the quantity of open source API documentation solutions isn't moving as fast as I'd like, but I'll take whatever I can. A handful of open source API documentation solutions have emerged, each with their own take on what is needed--these are the ones I"m tracking on who have built on the OpenAPI Spec:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lucybot/lucy-console">Lucy Console</a> - Utilizes<span> </span>OpenAPI Spec <span>to generate both static documentation and an interactive API console via Node.js.</span></li>
<li><a href="http://wiredcraft.github.io/carte/">Carte</a> - A simple, static Jekyll edition that can run on Github pages.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aleung/jekyll-swagger-ui/">Jekyll</a> - A more robust Jekyll edition with a ruby plugin delivering functionality.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/marcgibbons/django-rest-swagger/">Django</a> - An OpenAPI Spec driven version for Django in Python.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am the biggest fan of anything that runs 100% client side, and secondarily a fan of Jekyll + Github solutions, which open up the options for folks doing APIs at larger organizations, where they might be able to easily stand up hosting environments. Ultimately I think there should be a diverse range of one-click solutions for every platform out there.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Open Source API Blueprint Solutions</strong><br />API providers should speak all API definition formats fluently, but API Blueprint is mandatory for modern APIs. Apiary provides the primary API documentation solution for the API Blueprint specification, but it shows the health of the community that there are also some open source options that have emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio">Aglio</a> - <span>An API Blueprint renderer with theme support that outputs static HTML</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kirkstrobeck/blueprint-docify">Docify</a> - <span>Autogenerate API blueprint documentation with CI for Github pages.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/peterhellberg/hiro/">Hiro</a> - <span>Generates HTML from API Blueprints using the Snow Crash command line tool Drafter and Iglo.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm regularly monitoring Github, looking for other open source options for API blueprint, as I'm rooting it on as an engine for API documentation, or more importantly I think API narration--telling the story around what an API does.</p>
<p><strong>Other Open Source Approaches To API Documentation</strong><br />Beyond OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint driven efforts there are a handful of other open source API documentation solutions I am keeping an eye on. Serving a variety of platforms, and languages, there are a couple I'm looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lord/slate">Slate</a> - <span>Beautiful static documentation for your API.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mapbox/docbox">DocBox</a> - <span>REST API documentation generator in Markdown for React.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs">DevDocs</a> - Combines<span> multiple API documentations in a fast, organized, and searchable interface.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mpociot/whiteboard">Whiteboard</a> - <span>This project started as a fork of the popular </span><a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate</a><span> API documentation tool, which uses ruby, after finding the initial setup of Slate quite cumbersome, it was developed as a NodeJS based project.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure why someone would develop any API documentation without using OpenAPI Spec or API Blueprint as its machine readable core, but that is my very biased and studied view. I'm happy to see a diverse number of solutions available, but a little concerned about the lack of consistency between them when it comes to its central definition, how its deployed, as well as the UI and styling.</p>
<p>For me, it's a no-brainer to define your API surface area using OpenAPI Specs, API Blueprint, and Postman. Once you've done this, then you can start thinking about API documentation, code samples, SDKs. mocks, testing, and other resources after that. If you are looking to tackle documentation and have a budget for using an API service provider I recommend taking a look at Apiary or Readme. However, if you are on a budget, have some coding expertise, I recommend looking at Swagger UI + OpenAPI Spec. If you are concerned with look &amp; feel, and Swagger UI doesn't do it for you, I recommend taking a look at Lucy Console.</p>
<p>I wish the landscape for API documentation was more open, plug-n-play, and one-click deployable. I get the concept of paying for API docs as part of a wider API lifecycle solution, but I'm thinking we haven't fully learned from the success of Swagger UI and making sure there are an enough static and dynamic, open source, API documentation solutions available--designed for a variety of platforms. Something that would help both the open source tooling market, as well as provide consistency across the API service providers.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not sure I helped with this roundup of API documentation. I did remove a couple of dead projects <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">from my research</a>, and made sure it was refreshed with what I've been seeing lately, but I'm thinking I need to stew on the state of API documentation solutions a little more and try to understand why things are stagnating. There seems to be movement in the area of proprietary services, as well as some movement with individual providers doing slick things with their API docs, but I'm not seeing the level of open, interactive, and forkability that I saw with Swagger UI--which leaves me thinking there are some deficiencies at play.</p>
<p>Anyways, more to come...</p>

<p>Looking through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/numbers/">the numbers for my API Evangelist research</a>, and tallying up what I've learned along the way, I feel like the next opportunity out there will be about API design and definitions. The release of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/api-stylebook-a-collections-of-resources-for-api-designers/">API Stylebook</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/the-new-api-design-and-deployment-solution-materia-is-pretty-slick/">Materia</a> reflect this opportunity--serving the growing appetite for API design knowledge, and tooling being generated as businesses continue waking up to the need for APIs.</p>
<p>The API management landscape has been well defined by pioneers like 3Scale and Apigee, and validated by their acquisitions by Red Hat and Google this summer. What is picking up momentum now, is the world of API design services, tooling, and specification set into motion by early <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/api-design-tooling-from-api-blueprint/">pioneers of API design&nbsp;like Apiary.io</a>. I am guessing it will play out over the next six years or so, taking longer than we expect, similar to the way API management has played out.</p>
<p>This is when pioneers like Apiary will do well, but there will also be a steadily increasing need for new ways to help API providers craft their API designs, and leverage these definitions for use across almost every aspect of the API life cycle. Companies who have a good handle on their API surface area, and schema at play, will more successfully deploy, manage, test, scale, and orchestrate with this infrastructure. When you have all the moving parts well defined, the chances you will have a better handle on things only increases.</p>
<p>Modern approaches to defining your APIs using API Blueprint and OpenAPI Spec are allowing us to better define the fast growing and evolving (almost too fast) layers of API we are developing and operating. API design services like Apiary and Restlet Studio are helping us better work with API definitions across the API life cycle. The API Stylebook is helping us share API design knowledge, and Materia&nbsp;is pushing the API design and deployment conversation forward. This is just the beginning of a wealth of new services, open source tooling and specifications that will emerge to help define this next API life cycle opportunity.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2016</span>
        <p>As I was firing back up API Evangelist after a break this summer, I took the opportunity to add in a couple of new areas to my research, that I've had sitting on the backburner, <a href="http://apievangelist.com">bringing the number of areas of my API lifecycle research up to 66</a>. Each area operates as an <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist">independent Github repository</a>, possessing the JSON, YAML, and HTML for each area of my API industry monitoring, research, and storytelling.</p>
<p>I approach my work this way&nbsp;because the individual repositories allow&nbsp;me to put my blinders on when it comes to each project, while also scaling my work to include as many possible areas that influence what we like to call the API economy. Not all areas are as mature as API management, which has been being defined for well over a decade, but each area plays its own significant role that in my mind makes it worthy enough to be its own separate project.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_lifecycle_66_tag_cloud.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">You can always access the list of API lifecycle research projects from the home page of API Evangelist</a>, and I try to provide a sort of pagination on the home page of each project, allowing for a leisurely&nbsp;stroll through all 66 areas of research. Each area will at least have some news I've curated, with some of the more mature areas also having companies, tools, and blog posts that I've written over the years.</p>
<p>As I scroll down the list on the home page I can really see the API life cycle maturing and coming into focus. We still have decades of work ahead of us when it comes to properly designing, defining, and making our API discoverable, but I can see it all coming into focus. The problem is that I can also see the deficient areas like terms of service, privacy policies, patents, and copyright lacking in attention and discussion amidst each wave of growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is why I list the areas of concern right alongside the growing opportunities emerging across the API lifecycle.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://octopart.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/datasheets_electronic_parts_components_search__octopart.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://octopart.com/">Octopart is the products company that I regularly use as a reference for how product-focused companies should be doing APIs</a>. Octopart's is an electronic parts company who have a physical, product centered company which is easy for people to understand, that also happens to do APIs well. Octopart doesn't do APIs just because they are cool, they do APIs because it enables the purchasing of their products in other systems.</p>
<p>When you land on the Octopart website you are given a product catalog search, allowing humans to browse their virtual electronic parts warehouse, but as soon as you scroll below the fold you also see a link to their API. The Octopart API is nothing fancy, but it has all the essentials, including <a href="https://octopart.com/api/home">a simple REST API for accessing /brands, /categories, /parts, and /sellers in their&nbsp;virtual electronic parts warehouse</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can tell Octopart API integrations often center around the spreadsheets, an Octoparts showcases with their bill of material (BOM) solution, as well as open source Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet add-ons, but when you <a href="https://octopart.com/api/app-gallery">browse their application gallery</a> you&nbsp;can find other types of integrations with their catalog as well. Their approach to doing APIs seems like it should be a default for any company with a wealth of products to sell in an online environment.</p>
<p>When browsing through the Octoparts API you don't feel like it is something that was launched as a momentary trendy idea, and it is something that gets just as much emphasis as the HTML edition of the product catalog. The API is keeping spreadsheet editions of the catalog in sync, as well as providing sync capabilities for their BOM-driven order workflow. In my opinion, it has all the characteristics a commerce API provider should possess in a modern digital business environment.</p>
<p>While evangelizing APIs I often find I have to help unwind some of the miseducation companies have received about APIs from vendors trying to sell them external solutions. I find that companies with online product catalogs often see an API as something separate from their website, a separate software solution they needed to buy, where in reality the API is just the wholesale version of the product catalog for use in other web properties, mobile applications, spreadsheets, and systems--something that should be present alongside the HTML edition of your product catalog, and not buried in some help or feature section.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/enterprise">While reviewing the details of Twilio's new enterprise plan</a>, the one thing that stood out for me was the strong emphasis of the security and legal elements within this level of business integration. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/security-will-increasingly-be-used-as-component-of-tiered-api-planning/">I've talked out security being included as part of plan details </a><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/security-will-increasingly-be-used-as-component-of-tiered-api-planning/">before</a>, and is something I will keep talking about as leading providers continue to bring it front and center as part of API plans and operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/enterprise">Advanced security is the focal point for Twilio's new enterprise plan</a>, providing audit events, and public key client validation, but shortly after showcasing these security features, the next section is all about providing finer grain access management including customizable role-based access control (RBAC), and Single Sing-On (SSO). Demonstrating how important security is overall to the average enterprise customer.</p>
<p>From what I'm seeing across API providers, security is definitely the number one concern, and something that I'm guessing will keep showing up as part of <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API pricing and pricing tiers</a>. Every time I come across this practice in the wild I will record which elements are being included, and try to do a write up showcasing and sharing the approach. Good security practices and features won't be cheap, and as more companies tightene&nbsp;their belts, I am guessing it will keep bubbling up as paid features in the upper tiers of API access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the same note, the second area of growth I'm seeing, which is also present in TWilio's approach to their enterprise plan, is greater control over accounts, billing, and systems usage--something that includes API access, allowing API consumers to automate. Security is top of mind, but efficiently&nbsp;managing usage&nbsp;and dialing in revenue seems to be just as important to businesses looking looking to optimize their integrations with 3rd party API resources.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2016</span>
        <p>I don't spend a lot of time worrying about the website traffic numbers for API Evangelist. Once a week I'll take a look at my Google Analytics or CloudFlare dashboards. I don't write for page views, but I do like to know which of my areas of research is of interest to the public, and generally what people are clicking on.</p>
<p>To help me visit my numbers each week, I started publishing them to <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist">the API Evangelist </a><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist">repo</a>, and sharing via a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/numbers/">new numbers section</a> on the site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to start with seeing the page views across all of my API research projects, giving me an idea of the interest levels in each area:</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/views/2016-08/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_evangelist_views.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Next, I wanted to see the page views that each guide or white paper was getting in the top left corner of my site:</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/feature/2016-08/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_evangelist_document_views.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>After the views, I wanted to get a better understanding of what people were clicking on when it came to&nbsp;these guides &amp; white papers:</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/clicks/2016-08/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_evangelist_guide_clicks.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I also wanted to see which of the sponsor logos I include on the left-hand navigation were being clicked on by my readers:</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/clicks/2016-08/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_evangelist_sponsor_logo_clicks.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Numbers do not drive what I do. I research and write about what grabs my attention, not based upon what drives traffic. However, I do like sharing these basic numbers with my partners, and readers, so that they can get a feel for my reach, and what areas of my research are of interest to the public.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/numbers/">The numbers reports are simple static views of activity across my sites</a>. I will publish the JSON that drives the reports each week, along with the rest of my industry monitoring each week. Once I get enough data published to do some quarterly reports I will work to slice and dice, and see what I can come up with when it comes to visualizations. I'm enjoying playing with D3.js as a visual layer to the JSON data that I'm publishing to Github, across my API industry research--the problem is that I can get lost for hours doing this.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-press-apis.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Press releases continue to be one of the best ways for me to discover companies who have embarked on their API journey. From what I can tell, even with the shrinkage around funding for startups, the number companies offering up APIs is increasing. The big difference in the current wave of companies doing APIs. is these are just regular businesses, using APIs to provide access to resources in web, mobile, device, and partner integrations--a more business usage of APIs, as opposed to startups where the product is an API.</p>
<p>This class of SMB, and SME API provider tend not to be so good at sharing the documentation, code, and other resources for their API operations via their sites, but do see the value in pointing it out when issuing a press release. The reasons vary for why they showcase their APIs, often times it is just in the little "about" paragraph, but sometimes it is the center&nbsp;of a partnership, an acquisition was made possible, or the focus of a new product or service. I wish companies were more into being public about it, but I'll take what I can get--I am guessing many just haven't thought about it, or don't have the resources to do it right.</p>
<p>I'd say press releases are the number one way I discover companies who are doing APIs, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/02/api-patent-search-as-way-to-discover-companies-who-are-doing-apis/">patent filings as a close second or third</a>. After I publish eachpress release to <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, I have a CRON job running that extracts any URLs referenced in the page, spiders them looking for blog feeds, and Twitter or Github accounts, and makes sure they are entered into my monitoring system. If you are an API service provider looking for interesting leads of companies who are doing APIs let me know--I'm looking to formalize the list of companies I extract from press releases each week. I'm thinking about providing this list as a new API Evangelist service, and subsidize my research with new sources of information about APIs, as well as some potential revenue that can help&nbsp;me keep the lights on.</p>

<p>I am trying to get better at showcasing the early stories I find about APIs making their moves into new industries. It helps to have a post to reference when I add an area as an official research project, and begin tracking on companies more closely in the industry. I'm sure I've seen mortgage-related&nbsp;API rhetoric before, but a post in the <a href="http://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/">National Mortgage </a><a href="http://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/">News</a>, provides a pretty clear mark in the sand&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/technology/to-redefine-mortgage-technology-focus-on-connectivity-1086186-1.html">to begin building the case for redefining the mortgage industry using APIs</a>.</p>
<p>The description of the mortgage industry sounds like other industries where many disparate systems and players exist, with a minefield of technical, business, and politic considerations littering the landscape. One reason I cherry picked this article out of the hundreds of posts I tune into each week, is the focus on a new area like mortgages, but also because it focuses on the reality on the ground, and acknowledges there is no single end-to-end solution that will fix what is going--despite many vendor claims.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"No one actually has an end-to-end solution. And with anyone who claims to be an end-to-end solution, their customers are using other services to round out their capabilities."</em></p>
<p>People will always seek out solutions to their integration issues, this is what shadow IT has shown us in recent history. It is clear the mortgage industry is facing what many other industries are facing, and that they are using many disparate systems, many operating in the cloud, and the need move things around more efficiently is becoming critical. There is no silver bullet in this environment, and APIs are increasingly providing the connectivity that is needed to 3rd party systems, as well as opening up and providing access to internal system resources.</p>
<p>This post provides me with an early line in the sand, showing where I started tuning into the mortgage industry closer. I've added a couple of new keyword search phrases to my API monitoring, and if I keep coming up with conversations around how APIs are being applied in this industry, I will add a mortgage API research area to my work, and begin aggregating the players in the space, along with the tools, services, and processes that are being applied on the ground.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-data-retention.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading<a href="http://blog.bronto.com/product/rules-retention-long-bronto-save-data/">&nbsp;the rules of retention, and how long does Bronto save data</a>. Their clarity around offering a <a href="https://helpdocs.bronto.com/bmp/#concept/c_bmp_data_retention_policy.html">data retention policy</a> grabbed my attention, but I also found the ability to pay for longer storage, increasing data retention worth highlighting as well. If longer storage is an option for inclusion in API plans, it might also make sense to charge for shorter periods? IDK--maybe pay for something to go away sooner, with a shorter overall time to live (TTL).</p>
<p>Before I can see the Bronto data retention policy I have to create an account, so it won't happen today. I will make sure and get in there to document&nbsp;the moving parts of their policy as I am&nbsp;curious how much detail they get into. After that, I"d bee keen on finding any other API provider who provides a data retention policy, and help&nbsp;highlight those who do, while also assembling a list of the common moving parts.</p>
<p>Providing details on what data is being collected is something I'd like to see all platforms do by default, but I'd also like to see increased detail on how long data is stored like Bronto is offering, and possibly some day even see it in a machine-readable format. This blog post is meant to serve as a reminder for me to add data retention to my <a href="http://terms-of-service.apievangelist.com/">API terms of service research</a>, as well as an element to consider when crafting <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans</a>, and an&nbsp;<a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a> strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm thinking I will have to push pretty hard to get providers to even share what data they are collecting, let alone offer up the details of how long it is being stored. By highlighting providers like Bronto, maybe I can convince other API providers of the value of this type of transparency--until it is seen as a standard business practice.</p>

Staritng with the basics, what is the <a href="https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs">GBFS Open Data Standard</a>?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>General Bikeshare Feed Specification, known as GBFS, is the open data standard for bikeshare. GBFS will make real-time data feeds publicly available online in a uniform format so that map and transportation based apps can easily incorporate this data into their platforms.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md">Documentation is available on Github, including JSON definitions for the bikeshare data model</a>. All it needs now is an <a href="https://openapis.org/specification">OpenAPI Spec generated for it,</a> providing one possible API definition for the GBFS specification (you know you want to build it). Then people could put the definitions to use in generating open source server and client side API tooling for&nbsp;bikeshare programs to deploy.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv">I was impressed to see 49 separate bikeshare programs are supporting the specification</a>. I am always looking to add open data specifications to my <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition research</a>, even if they are just the data model--maybe with a little nudging I can stimulate some investment in at least the API definitions, if not supporting code, and other tools and resources.</p>
<p>I'll take the list of bikeshare&nbsp;services who are currently using the standard and see if any of them have an API, and maybe aggregate the common patterns already in use on the ground. If nothing else, hopefully, I can shine some SEO on the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md">General Bikeshare Feed Specification</a> and prevent at least one developer from reinventing the wheel.</p>

<p>As I was reading <a href="https://medium.com/@katecrawford/artificial-intelligence-is-hard-to-see-a71e74f386db#.rmv7mf65l">artificial intelligence is hard to see</a> by Kate Crawford (<a href="https://twitter.com/katecrawford">@katecrawford</a>), my brain once again begins crunching the different ways APIs can be applied to help us "see" the algorithms evolving around us. API all by themselves do not move things forward much, but when you combine with modern approaches to applying&nbsp;<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a>, introduce the <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com">access and authentication benefits of OAuth</a>, employ <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com">sensible and robust logging practices</a>, and work to develop <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">API driven visualization</a> layers for algorithms--I'm thinking we can really begin to move the conversation forward.</p>
<p><strong>Defining the Algorithmic Surface Area With An API And API Definition</strong><br />Leading API specifications formats like <a href="https://openapis.org/specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a> are allowing API providers and architects to define the request and response model for web APIs. Many APIs are serving up data and content, but for the algorithmic&nbsp;variety, API definitions allow for the description the inputs and outputs for the algorithm--giving us an important way to describe what an algorithm actually does.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Opening Up Access To Algorithmic Resources Using OAuth</strong><br />It is common for OAuth to be used to help manage authentication and access to data, content, and algorithms being made available via APIs. OAuth is used to securely open up access to the proper 3rd party developers, or in this scenario regulators, journalists, and researchers, in a way that defines the scope of what they have access to, whether they can just read, as well as write via an API. OAuth could easily be applied, and evolved to meet the needs of algorithmic transparency and auditing, giving us access to the levers and controls that are driving decisions behind the algorithmic curtain.</p>
<p><strong>Record And Measure Algorithmic Responses Across A Variety Of Uses</strong><br />Logging is used to measure almost every layer of the Internet today, from the server and database backends, all the way up to the web and mobile applications that are driving our front ends. API management providers have applied logging to the API layer, carefully recording how data, content, and algorithms are being accessed, and the system, application, or user who is accessing them. Logging could be used to record how algorithms are performing across a wide variety of auditing and test scenarios, providing a possible baseline for determining what an algorithm does, and how it can be improved upon--in a open, but secure and controlled environment.</p>
<p><strong>Using An API Driven Visualization Layer To Help Us See Algorithms</strong><br />Using API definitions that give us a way to quantify the inputs and outputs of algorithmic resources, along with the logging of a range of requests, and resulting responses, it is then possible to <a href="http://d3js.org/">craft visualizations using open libraries like D3.js</a>, to help us "see" an algorithm. We can see what goes in, what comes out, and how this works across a variety of scenarios. While visualizations will only be as good as the API itself, and the sampling of requests made, they give&nbsp;us the tools we will need to begin seeing and understanding the impact algorithms are making in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs do not equal transparency, and understanding of how algorithms work, but they can help us define and communicate around what they do, and open up access to researchers, regulators, and journalists looking to validate and make sense of what an algorithm does, or does not do. An API for Facebook or Twitter censorship algorithms will not ensure they are fair and balanced, but they can give us the tools to evaluate, and potentially course correct these algorithms out in the open, as they evolve.</p>
<p>I'm seeing a steady build in the number of questions being asked about how algorithms work or don't work, and are impacting our lives. I do not think it is unreasonable to ask owners and operators of these algorithms to open up their solutions for review by trusted 3rd party researchers, regulators, and journalists. We are going to have to get to work opening up this technical infrastructure, as well as developing the API talent that will be needed for reviewing algorithms in this way. I understand that many companies will be resistant to this, but if your algorithm is impacting our lives, we deserve to understand how they work.</p>
<p>I will keep writing on this subject whenever possible, and hopefully, begin to evolve a more coherent approach to employing modern API infrastructure in the service of "seeing algorithms". We tend to think of using APIs for developing web, mobile, and increasingly device-based apps, but increasingly they are also being used to migrate our bits and bytes around the Internet using what is called Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS), and I see no reason why we can begin to evolve API infrastructure specifically for enabling algorithmic transparency.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_09_12_at_11.03.07_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p style="white-space: normal;">I am preparing for my hangout with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?q=%23TC1019">#TC1019</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://kenscourses.com/tc1019fall2016/">Fundamentals of Software Engineering</a> (3rd-semester course) out of the Tecnol&oacute;gico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara. In my own style, I didn't just want to prepare for the discussion, I wanted to publish it on my blog, providing an outline that students to walk away with, but hopefully is something that can also live on as part of my API research.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;">Where do I start? Well, it is a fundamental of software engineering course, so let's look at how the modern API movement can influence and impact the modern software engineer. I may be biased but I think APIs are significantly changing how we develop software, in some pretty important ways--let's explore.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>History of Modern Web APIs</strong><br />I always recommend anyone interested in learning more about APIs to pause for a moment and&nbsp;consider the history of modern web APIs, even if you think you know the API world already. In my opinion, many technologists take for granted some of the most common platforms out there, and haven't' taken the&nbsp;time to learn more about a specific API, and in many cases do not know that an API already exists for common platforms we use every day.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">History of APIs, a Primer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/27/some-milestones-from-the-last-15-years-of-web-api-history/">Some Milestones From The Last 15 Years Of API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The more we understand the short history of web APIs, and why they are working, the more we can borrow from what is already working. Whether you are looking to provide API resources, consume APIs, or ideally do both--spend some time browsing through the history I've organized above.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Focus On HTTP &amp; HTTP/2 In Modern Programming<br /></strong>The technology driving the web is low cost and ubiquitous, making it perfect for usage to deliver not just HTML to websites, but JSON that can be used in other systems, mobile applications, as well as device-based applications. There are some important standards being applied as part of the current API movement that impact software engineering fundamentals, here are a handful of the core elements.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webconcepts.info/">Web Concepts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You don't have to be a master of everything I've listed--I am far from being up to speed on everything here. However, I recommend spending as much time as you can, on a regular basis, absorbing the concepts at play when it comes to Internet technology&nbsp;and consider how existing API providers are putting them to work in their operations.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><span><strong>Next Step In The Evolution Of The Web</strong><br />It is import to see modern APIs as just the next step in how data, content, and algorithmic resources are made available using Internet technology. One concept at play here, which is included above in the HTTP &amp; HTTP/2 resource is what is called content negotiation--I recommend starting here, and I've included a simple tool to help bring it home.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation">Content Negotiation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://website.apievangelist.com/">Simple Demonstration</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><span>API is not a specific vendor solution&nbsp;or even an open source code base--it is an approach to leverage existing web technology to achieve objectives around operating in a web and mobile, and now Internet of Things (IoT) landscape. APIs are not just about delivering JSON, it is about delivering the resources necessary to get the job done, negotiating exactly the format that is needed.</span></p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><span><strong>Wealth Of Resources Available Via Diverse Number of API Providers</strong><br />I track on many companies doing interesting things with APIs, but I always start with learning about the companies who are selling services, and developing tools that API providers are putting to work. You can browse these API life cycle providers as part of my ongoing research:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://theapistack.com/lifecycle/">API Life Cycle Providers</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="white-space: normal;">These companies don't just sell services to API providers, if they are doing it right they also have APIs themselves. When every step along the life of an API, also has an API, the concept of the programmable web becomes more realistic.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Wealth of API Resources Available To Help Manage The API Life Cycle</strong><br />After the API service providers, I keep an eye on companies who are delivering API resources in specific business verticals, which I call my stack APIs. These areas contain many of the common APIs that developers&nbsp;are using, but also some you hopefully may not know already about.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://theapistack.com/stack/">API Stack Providers</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="white-space: normal;">I am adding to this stack as fast as I possibly can. I'm constantly having to prioritize which APIs and add and remove from this list of API resources. Hopefully, as a software engineer you can find some interesting APIs amongst these stacks.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Making Digital Resources Available In Any Programming Language</strong><br />One of the most common mistakes I see from aPI providers are references to, and dogma from their preferred programming language. Modern web APIs employ REST, employing the HTTP &amp; HTTP/2 pipes, and leave the specifics of individual programming languages behind the API, and within client solutions. To help guide yoru learning I recommend taking a look at the API design best practices of API pioneers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/api-stylebook-a-collections-of-resources-for-api-designers/">API Stylebook</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="white-space: normal;">Successful API designers, architects, and operators transcend any single API programming languages, learning to craft an interface that speaks to as wide as possible audience, allowing the software you build to acomplish more.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><span><strong>Focus On API Definitions, Media Types, And Schemas Over Code</strong><br />When focusing on APIs, I strongly recommend favoring API definitions, media types, and schemas over keeping to much code around. Things move fast in the workd of APIs, and the surface of an API will change, and there are many ways API architects are mitigating change, and remaining agile--I recommending speaking fluent:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openapis.org/specification">OpenAPI Spec</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a></li>
<li><a href="http://webconcepts.info/concepts/media-types">Media Types</a></li>
<li><a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><span>If you speak in these formats, as an API architect you will be able to focus on delivering more standardized, and flexible API resource, helping you as a software&nbsp;engineer, be agile and potentially more distributed--truly embracing what makes the web work, and is the fuel for the growth in API usage when it comes to developing software.</span></p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><span>That is where I recommend starting with the world of APIs&nbsp;when it comes to their impact on the fundamentals of software engineering. As a software engineer, HTTP is the core of what you should be studying and including in your toolbox. I've included a wealth of resources here, for use in our classroom discussion, but also hopefully something the students will be able to study as part of their ongoing API education.</span></p>

<p>Building on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/10/investing-in-your-api-community-like-amazon-and-slack/">my earlier coverage of how API providers are investing in their API community like Amazon and Slack</a>, I wanted to document the <a href="https://developer.box.com/incubator">incubator over at Box</a>. Acknowledging that <em>"the enterprise applications of the future will be cloud-based and massively scalable"</em>, and to <em>"support the development of these applications, Box Platform and Amazon Web Services are teaming up to provide you with everything you need to build and scale your business."</em> Providing yet with another (AWS-powered) partnership and API community investment blueprint to put on the shelf.</p>
<p>Examples like this are why I kicked off my <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">API partner research</a> but also reflects why I expanded to keep an eye on <a href="http://investment.apievangelist.com/">investment that is occurring&nbsp;in the space</a>. I don't want API investment to simply mean VC-led investment when there are such a diverse number of other approaches available for how API providers can invest in their platforms, and API communities. <a href="https://developer.box.com/incubator">The Box incubator</a> offers up&nbsp;free and promotional credits, marketing, and training opportunities as part of the program that opens October 1st, 2016--something I'll work to expand on once they go live.</p>
<p>Eventually, I'd like to have an assortment of blueprints to show how API providers are investing in partners, developers, and the potential businesses that are being built on top of platform APIs. I refuse to accept that VC investment of public APIs is the only way forward, and the dominant narrative for what API investment looks like. Hopefully by sharing other examples from successful API providers will help diversify perspectives and narratives around API investment, incubation, and partnering.</p>

<p>One of the popular narratives for why companies should be doing APIs emerged out of the last couple waves of startup investments, which encouraged investment in public APIs so that developers could build the next big web&nbsp;or mobile app (if you build it they will come). This narrative proved to not be true for many APIs, leaving API providers often feeling unsuccessful. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/07/the-netflix-public-api-was-the-most-successful-api-failure-ever/">The API providers like Netflix who were able to evolve and iterate until they found success with their </a><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/07/the-netflix-public-api-was-the-most-successful-api-failure-ever/">APIs</a> are the examples we should be following, not a single narrative around public API access.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/08/are-you-being-transparent-with-your-api-infrastructure-to-attract-top-talent-like-netflix-is/">Netflix talks about their API, and open sources their API technology to attract the attention of developer talent</a>. This is just one of many reasons why companies are doing APIs in 2016, a subject I want to contribute to through brainstorming about "what is API success". One idea I am working on at the moment is about using APIs to help reduce friction when it comes t working with 3rd party contractors who are developing and operating&nbsp;web and mobile applications, or system to system integrations for companies--a real world scenario that I think many people might not be considering when thinking about APIs.</p>
<p>Modern API management solutions allow us to decide who has access to an API, and dial in how much they can use. APIs can have their documentation and other resources publicly available without allowing for public access to the API resource itself--this access can be granted on an invite only, or as part of a wider approval process. This is something that makes having well-defined APIs for all internal resources in place, complete with a modern API management registration, access, and service composition workflow a&nbsp;critical enabler of efficiency&nbsp;when working with 3rd party developers, agencies, and other service providers.</p>
<p>Having API documentation, SDKs, and other resources publicly available reduces the time required to share this information with developers. The ability to offer self-service registration, which also includes a manual approval process, makes it easy to turn, or off 3rd party contractors access to internal data, content, and other algorithmic resources. This just makes good business sense--every company out there wants to be able to reduce friction when it comes to working with the outside developers who are helping deliver essential web, mobile and device applications.</p>

I'm a big fan when any company has a dedicated page driving their <a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com/">API branding strategy</a>, as it makes it easy for me to find logos, and understand how a company wants to be presented in my stories.Â </p>
<p>Spotify provides a range of design resources including logos, icons, display rules, minimum size, logo misuse, colors, fonts, and restrictions--all elements I'll consider adding as branding building blocks for API providers. I also thought that Spotify's quick description of their design resources is worthy of showcasing:</p>
<p class="text-description" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Welcome to our hub for partner guidelines and assets. We want to make it easy for you to integrate Spotify in your app while respecting our brand and legal/licensing restrictions.</em></p>
<p>Their design resources page for the API developer portal simple, and describes the important balance between API provider and consumer when it comes to a company and platform's brand. I'm adding Spotify's design resources to my listing of branding page for API providers--it provides a healthy reference of how it can be done in the music industry.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think the closing page for the Spotify design resources page has a couple more lessons:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If you are having trouble with anything in this guide, you are missing brand elements from the brand package, or you are unsure if your communication best represents the Spotify brand, please contact the Spotify design team. </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>I would add contact information, and suggestions, as two new elements to consider when crafting a branding page. I have a handful of other branding pages from the API providers to review. I'll continue posting stories about each one (if worthy), as I mine them for other helpful elements that API providers might want toÂ think about when crafting their own page.</em></p>

<p>I was playing around <a href="https://github.com/prose/gatekeeper">Prose.io's Gatekeep solution</a>,&nbsp;<span>a proxy for enabling the client-side application&nbsp;dance OAuth with GitHub. I tend to use Oauth.io for all of my oAuth dancing, especially client-side on Github Pages, but for the current application I am working on, I wanted a server-side proxy where I could work some other magic--which led me playing with Prose's Gateway.</span></p>
<p>When you scroll down the page for the oAuth gateway, you'll find two deploy buttons, one for Heroku, and one for Azure--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/23/push-button-api-deployment-with-the-heroku-button/">I want all APIs, and all API solutions that support API operations (like Prose's Gateway) to be deployed like this.</a>&nbsp; True open API solutions should operate this way, offering up server-side solutions in a Github repository, with one-click buttons for deploying in your infrastructure of choice.</p>
<p>As I write this I realize in addition to a deploy to Heroku, and Azure buttons, there should be deploy to AWS and Google buttons as well. There are <a href="https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/application-management/post/Tx33XKAKURCCW83/Automatically-Deploy-from-GitHub-Using-AWS-CodeDeploy">deploy instructions for AWS</a>, but not a branded button. They also have <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/button/">the "phystical" IoT Button</a>, but alas no "virtual" deploy to AWS. There is also <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-marketplace/listing">deploy instructions for Google</a>, but again no organized branded button effort. While I'm sure AWS and Google will eventually do this, it smells like an opportunity for a sort of aggregate API deployment service provider.</p>
<p>Just like the wealth of website templates available out there, from the WordPress to the Jekyll, we need to start building up our inventory of API solutions, which might also serve up HTML, but more importantly be serving up the JSON we need for syndication, and in mobile and device-based applications. Businesses shouldn't have to hand-craft the most common of API design patterns out there, they should be able to just click one button and have deployed in their cloud infrastructure of choice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://getmateria.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/materia_screen_entities.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was playing with a new API design and deployment solution, from some of my favorite developers out there this weekend called <a href="https://getmateria.com/">Materia</a>, which bills itself as <em>"a modern development environment to build advanced mobile and web applications"</em>--I would add, <em>"with an API heart"</em>.</p>
<p>Materia&nbsp;is slick. it is modern. While very simple, it is also very complete--allowing you to define your underlying data model or entities, design and deploy APIs, and then publish a single page applications (SPA) for use on the web, or mobile devices. Even though I'm one of those back to land, hand-crafted API folks, I could see myself using Materia to quickly design and deploy APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I say this in the most positive light imaginable, but Materia reminds me of the Microsoft Access for APIs. Partly its the diagramming interface for the entities, but it is also the fact that it bridges the backend to the frontend, allowing you to not just design and deploy the database and APIs, but also the resulting user interface that will put them to work.</p>
<p>I know they are just getting going with developing Materia, but I can't help but share a couple things I'd like to see, that would make it continue to be the modern API driven application it is striving to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Specs or Blueprints - </strong>Allow users to import, export, and manage my APIs in the popular API definition format my choice.</li>
<li><strong>Schema.org - </strong>Provide users with a wealth of existing entity&nbsp;models to choose from, so they do not reinvent the wheel.</li>
<li><strong>Github - </strong>Allow for the publishing of projects, and importing of them to and from Github, allowing for the sharing of server design and deployment patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of other things I'd like to see, but I'm sensitive to the fact that they are just getting started. These three areas would significantly widen the initial audience for Materia beyond the developer class, which is who the application solution should be targeting. Like I said, it has the potential to be the Microsoft Access of APIs for small businesses, which isn't quite the Microsoft Excel of APIs, but a close second. ;-)</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/google-acquired-apigee/">Google Acquired Apigee</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/09/Google-to-acquire-apigee.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_09_12_at_9.18.25_am.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The news came in late last week that <a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/09/Google-to-acquire-apigee.html">Google was acquiring API management pioneer Apigee</a>. The news caught me by surprise. I thought if there was still going to be an acquisition of Apigee that it would come from their flagship client AT&amp;T or from other giants like IBM. While it was surprising, seconds after hearing it, the acquisition made total sense, and I think it just reflects the increased usage of APIs by businesses of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>As I wrote about last week, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/09/prepare-for-the-more-boring-and-very-business-age-of-apis/">we are entering a very boring and business age of APIs</a>. My point is not that it will all be boring (as some of Twitter folks responded without reading), it is that it will be too boring for the Silicon Valley hype machine. It is like 2003 for the web, where all businesses were realizing that serving up HTML on the web was essential, but in 2016 it is now also about serving up JSON for use in&nbsp;web, mobile, and device-based applications--Google is wisely looking for a piece of this action.</p>
<p>The leading cloud providers (AWS, Microsoft, and Google) all have API management solutions now, acknowledging that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/10/history-of-apis-mashery/">a decade after Mashery first standardized API management as a service</a>, serving up content, data, and algorithms in an organized, managed way is essential to doing business in a digital age. In the Google announcement, I also saw echoes of modern approaches to deploying APIs using containers and other virtualization approaches, which I feel reflects the decisions we saw in Red Hat buying 3Scale, and the API-led container and serverless rhetoric we are hearing out of AWS.</p>
<p>I was already preparing for a deeper dive into the convergence of Google's API efforts, including its cloud computing and container offerings, as well as its <a href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/">existing API cloud endpoint solution</a>--the Apigee acquisition only helps me prioritize this mapping of the existing API landscape over at Google for me. Google has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to offering up API solutions that specifically target API providers, but with their experience as a provider of over a 100 APIs, I'm fairly confident they'll have the experience to pick up the momentum pretty quickly.</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/12/21/business-of-google-apis-2011/">I propsoed a little early that Google would play in this game</a>, but I'm getting used to the fact that nothing happens as fast as I'd like to see in the world of APIs.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/linkedin/the_hypothesis_api_the_hypothesis_annotation_framework.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been playing around with different ways to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/07/a-web-concepts-and-specifications-javascript-library-for-api-providers/">craft a web concepts and specification JavaScript library for API providers</a>, and one of the approaches I've been considering is out of the <a href="https://hypothes.is/">annotation platform Hypothes.is</a>. Their <em>"mission is to bring a new layer to the web"</em> allowing anyone to <em>"discuss, collaborate, organize your research, or take personal notes"--</em>while I'm looking to bring a new layer to the world of APIs, allowing API providers to weave in important web concepts and specifications across their API portals and documentation.</p>
<p><a href="http://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/">Hypothes.is has a simple API, allowing you to search, read, create, update, and delete annotations on any HTML page available at a public URL</a>. This is exactly what I'd like to see done for any OpenAPI Spec JSON files, with my earlier<a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/"> APIs.json&nbsp;Annotation work</a>. While I am envisioning this new JavaScript API library existing more as a&nbsp;<a href="http://darsa.in/tooltip/">tooltip</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://introjs.com/">introduction</a>, I also like the approach Hypothes.is takes for annotation, and would like to figure when and where I might be able to weave it in.</p>
<p>As I was learning about the Hypothes.is API I noticed that there were annotated elements within the API documentation, which when I clicked on, popped up out my Hypothes.is browser toolbar, and displayed a discussion around the API documentation. Eventually I'd like to see&nbsp;<a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/">annotation discussions around the API design itself like I did with my annotation tool</a>, about important web concepts and specs like available in <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">webconcepts.info</a>, as well as references to the API design guidelines like we see within the <a href="http://apistylebook.com/">API Stylebook</a>.</p>
<p>In theory, an API provider should just be able to embed a JavaScript library and provide key concepts and specs used across their API design, with references to the constraints defined by the platform's API guidelines, while also opening up a discussion around each available API path. While this is something that should be API provider induced, it might also be applied like Hypothes.is does. and injected into the browser layer, and controlled by the API community, as well as the provider. IDK</p>
<p>Anyhoo....just some considerations as I consider how the Hypothes.is API could be used to widen the API life cycle discussion, while also significantly contribute to web literacy and the sharing of healthy API design&nbsp;practices.</p>

<p>My friend&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnaudlauret/">Arnaud Lauret</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/arno_di_loreto">@arno_di_loreto</a>)<span>, the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apihandyman.io/">API Handyman</a>, has released a very cool new project called the&nbsp;<a href="http://apistylebook.com/">API Stylebook--a collections of resources for API designers</a>. It is a brilliant aggregation of twelve API design guides from Atlassian, Cisco, Cloud Foundry, Haufe, Heroku, Microsoft, PayPal, Red Hat, The White House, Zalando.</p>
<p>I think the API Stylebook purpose describes it well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The API Stylebook aims to help API Designers to solve API design matters and build their API design guidelines by providing quick and easy access to selected and categorized resources.</em><br /><br /><em>In this first </em>version<em>, the API Stylebook provides direct links to specific topics within publicly available API Design Guidelines. Instead of reinventing the wheel or searching google for hours, API Designers quickly can find solutions and inspiration from these existing guidelines.</em></p>
<p>The API Stylebook isn't just a list of API design guidelines from these companies, it is a <a href="https://github.com/arno-di-loreto/apistylebook-data/tree/master/design/guidelines">machine readable distillation of the twelve API design guides</a> into a master list of <a href="http://apistylebook.com/design/topics/">API design topics</a> you can consider when crafting your own API design guide. It is slick. I like Arnaud's approach to analyzing the existing API design patterns across API platforms who have shared their guides. I also really like <a href="https://github.com/arno-di-loreto/apistylebook-data/tree/master/design/guidelines">the approach to breaking things down as YAML</a>, and publish as a very good looking website using Github, and Github Pages.</p>
<p>I'm hoping it is something that will&nbsp;stimulate other API providers to craft and share their own API design guide. If you do, I'm sure Arnaud would add to his work, especially if you use his work as a blueprint for your design guide--keeping things as standardized as possible. Projects like this are critical to the growth of the space, and a lack of resources like API Stylebook, and <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">Webconcepts.info</a> have seriously slowed the consistency and interoperability across the world of APIs.</p>

<p>As I listened to the news about flooding coming out of Louisiana, and the impending hurricane headed up the east coast, I'm momentarily distracted from my monitoring of the API space. As I switch back to my work, I can't help but think about the stack of open APIs we will need to tackle future disasters (global climate change). No, APIs are not the silver bullet solution, but if the networking, storage, database, messaging, and any other gear in the disaster relief machine had a wealth available open API definitions, and open source software--the disaster relief machine could potentially be more efficient, scalable, and decentralized.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure what the current emergency response stack looks like, something I'm sure looks very different at the municipal, county, state, and federal levels. As I do with the other <a href="http://apievangelist.com">areas of research in my API work</a>, I will add an emergency response API project, where I will continue to aggregate news, stories, companies, agencies, and individuals doing interesting things in this area. It will take time to build up enough research on the current state of API usage when it comes to emergency response, but once I generate enough awareness around it, I will blog more about it here on API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I'm guessing there is a wealth of information already out there, as well as proprietary services, and open tooling to choose from. Like many other areas of our society which I see APIs touching upon, I find lots of isolated, disparate solutions, but I see very few groups truly leveraging the interoperability that is possible when you employ APIs, as well as the increase community effects when you are sharing your API definitions, open source server software, as well as the web and mobile client solutions developed on top. We will see how much time I have for this area of research in coming months, but I'm hoping to get in a couple hours each week. Luckily, like most of my work, you will be able to find this work on Github, and fork to take in the different direction, or submit a pull request or issue sharing anything you feel should be included.</p>

<p>I am working on taking the&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/06/a-json-feed-of-critical-web-concepts-to-integrate-into-api-design-service-and-tooling/">JSON feed of web concepts and specs</a>&nbsp;and developing a simple<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/07/a-web-concepts-and-specifications-javascript-library-for-api-providers/"> website JavaScript tooltip library</a>&nbsp;that API providers can employ to inject web literacy into their API developer portals and documentation. I have settled in on using an existing&nbsp;<a href="http://darsa.in/tooltip/">JavaScript tooltip library</a>&nbsp;for the core functionality and have put <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/08/a-dictionary-to-lookup-web-concepts-and-specs-for-the-javascript-tooltip/">some thought into a basic dictionary lookup that can be used in web and API literacy tooling</a>.</p>
<p>As I was brainstorming on what is possible within a basic dictionary which could be used to map specific keywords and phrases to the <a href="http://webconcepts.info/concepts/concepts.json">web concepts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/specs.json">specs</a> that Erik Wilde (@dret) has showcased in his <a href="http://webconcepts.info">webconcepts.info</a> work, it occurred to me that there should also be a regex layer to this dictionary lookup. I purposely left it out of my brainstorming on the dictionary, because I wanted to keep simple for usage within API portals and documentation, leaving my thoughts around how this could be applied wth in API design services and tooling, as well as potentially within IDEs (Atom, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.).</p>
<p>I am envisioning regular expressions that could be applied to data, text within API definitions like <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>. When you are editing or have placed your cursor in a data field, a tooltip could pop&nbsp;up, or display in the help tooling with information about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO 8601</a> or <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339">RFC 3339</a>. When you are working with headers, as part of the API design process, <a href="http://webconcepts.info/concepts/http-headers">information regarding HTTP headers could be auto-completed</a>, and shown in tooltips and other help solutions.</p>
<p>In short, the basic dictionary would handle keywords and phrases, where the regex layer could be used for more structured considerations within the API design process. It would take time to build up a wealth of regular expressions that could be assigned to each available <a href="http://webconcepts.info/concepts/concepts.json">web concepts</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/specs.json">spec</a>, however once the heavy lifting is done, we would be injecting web literacy, and the common building blocks of the Internet earlier on in the API lifecycle, at design time, before things get too much more expensive down the road.</p>

<p>I like Postman's approach to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCocudCGVb3MmhWQ1aoIgUQw">using Youtube for providing walk-through's for specific actions users will want to take in their API client service</a>. All of their video walk-throughs are very simple, straightforward, and seem to speak to specific things that users are going to want to tackle when design, developing, or even integrating with an API.</p>
<p>Another thing I wanted to highlight, is that I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCocudCGVb3MmhWQ1aoIgUQw">Postman's Youtube Account</a> because I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/postmanclient">@postmanclient</a> tweet a link in response to a specific question, from a user about a specific need they had. This demonstrates for me, the importance of weaving video walk-throughs with your regular feedback loop and FAQ's, making sure you have video answers to the things your users are most asking about most--a great way to scale your support, while also increasing your SEO and SMM reach. #winwin</p>
<p>I am not a big video watcher. I have lists of videos I should be watching, and rarely ever do, but I do know quite a few people who are, and having easily available video how-to resources, can score big points. Especially if you have a well thought out catalog of videos that match the common questions users are asking right at your fingertips--allowing you to Tweet, post to Facebook and LinkedIn, or use as part of conversations around integration on Github, in the moment.</p>

<p>I just went through all the APIs in my monitoring system looking for a diverse set of them to showcase in an API economy story I'm working on, and while I can point to some pretty exciting milestones along the history of APIs, I predict the future will be very boring. Think about the web between the first dot.com bubble burst and the web 2.0 years, that kind of boring--less money going around, but everybody is doing it.</p>
<p>While looking through APIs there are so many robust, powerful, yet very yawn-worthy APIs in my book when it comes to accounting, marking, sales, and advertising. There are slow moving, the universe expanding API offerings coming out of mapping, satellite, and drone APIs. Banking, healthcare, insurance, and other similar areas are steadily talking about the benefits of APIs. On, and on, and on, across almost every industry.</p>
<p>I can't keep pace with the number of companies publishing press releases that mention their APIs, as well as the increased volume of patents which mention APIs--almost all of which do not showcase their APIs publicly on their websites. Everybody seems to be doing APIs, but the singular grand vision of public APIs that many people still seem to associate with the concept has failed by the measure of the tech blogosphere and the VC in-crowd. Everybody is doing APIs, will be doing APIs, and it is becoming too widespread to have a properly hyped conversation about--it is just something you do.</p>
<p>Thankfully I am pretty ADD / OCD, and love sifting through the mundane, the yawn-worthy, looking for the gems that are worth showcasing. Every once in a while I'll find some ground shaking movement and tremors, and the occasionally&nbsp;critical API initiatives, but most of it will just be the very boring, business as usual, like we saw after the early days of the web--remember, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/31/why-apis-are-just-the-next-step-of-the-web-and-not-the-latest-trend/">APIs are just the next step in the evolution of the web</a>.</p>

<p>I was working through some thoughts around programming language dependencies, looking through a service I came across called <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>, and found myself thinking about API dependencies (go figure, man I have a problem), and the <a href="http://reliability.apievangelist.com/">reliability of the APIs </a>we are building on top of. Anyways, when it comes to the latest trends in programming languages in a production environment, I'm out of the mainstream current, and when I'm in over my head like this I usually turn to my API Evangelist Slack group for answers.</p>
<p>I asked the group for any random thoughts about programming language dependencies vs. API dependencies. There weren't that many thoughts, except&nbsp;a single profound one from the king of making sure <a href="http://runscope.com">everything is 200 OK</a>, John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>)--who said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Everything is fragile!</em></strong></p>
<p>Deep shit, and so very true. As I was pondering the weight of these thoughts, I also came across a page within the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/08/when-working-with-our-api-make-sure-you-build-faultresistance-into-your-code/">USGS water service APIs that was dedicated to helping developers craft fault-resistance code</a>. I think we are just getting started in our understanding of just how fragile the web is, making services like <a href="http://runscope.com">Runscope pretty critical</a>, but also makes having this conversation within your API portal, with your API consumers, like USGS is doing, pretty critical as well. I will also selfishly add that we should be talking more about good practices for API providers, as well as API consumers, in industry blogs that speak to the API sector.</p>
<p>If I've learned anything in six years as the API Evangelist, it is: Everything is fragile. Everything will break. Everything will change. Everything will eventually go away. This applies the to the tech, business, and politics of APIs. This can be a bad thing, or a good thing, depending on how we manage the design, deployment, management, and communicating around our API operations. I'm going to continue to look for other examples of what API providers are doing to help their developers deal with <a href="http://reliability.apievangelist.com/">API reliability</a>. I am also going to continue to showcase other successful API design, deployment, and management patterns that are helping us stabilize&nbsp;things, and yes that includes <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a>.</p>

<p>As I was working my way through <a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/">the USGS water services APIs</a>, I came across their <a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/docs/portable_code.html">page for writing fault-resistant code</a>. There are many things going on in the USGS developer portal I think are worth talking about, and the reminder for developers to write more resilient code is one that I feel needs constant discussion, from many different angles. I know that this is one area I will get comments about hypermedia as a solution, but for right now I want to think through what is coming out of existing API efforts on the ground like USGS.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/docs/portable_code.html">USGS provides 13 separate pieces of advice to help you achieve more fault-tolerant code</a> as you integrate with their water APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join the Water Data System Notification Service</li>
<li>Check HTTP error codes</li>
<li>If your application is server-based, acquire data in XML if the format exists</li>
<li>If your application is browser-based or client-based (such as a native app), acquire data in the JSON format if available</li>
<li>If a service offers a version number, request that version of the service</li>
<li>Write your queries efficiently</li>
<li>Why you should avoid tab-delimited (RDB) files</li>
<li>Parse XML using an XML parser</li>
<li>Use standard libraries</li>
<li>Consider using curl or wget to acquire data</li>
<li>Use scheduled tasks to automate data collection</li>
<li>Guidance on how often you should fetch data</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not sure all of these apply universally, but I like the idea of API providers sharing their view of how developers can write better code when integrating with their APIs, based on their own experiences. I also like that their list begins with acknowledging that you need to stay in tune with the feedback loops which are in place, acknowledging that this is important for both API provider and consumer stability.</p>
<p>Having a page dedicated to helping API developers develop more fault-resistant code, just seems like a good building block to add to any ecosystem. I'm guessing it is good from a provider perspective as well, by helping you think through design considerations that would impact a developer's ability to build in fault resistance, as well as being an important educational resource for them. I personally like it because it is yet another building block that I think helps developers, but also provides me with a great window into how API providers see the web API universe.</p>

<p>I come across a lot of really bad ideas for startups and APIs, as well as many badly behaved companies with great API implementations. With so much money flowing around space, the incentives for behaving badly have increased, and it seems like people's appetite for it, and willingness to even defend it, seems to only grow. When I come across this activity, historically I allow my feathers to get pretty ruffled, but going forward I'm trying to adapt and evolve in different ways.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://kinlane.com/2016/08/23/fine-tuning-my-real-time-for-maximum-efficiency/">I work to dial in my "real time" for maximum efficiency</a>, and acknowledge that <a href="http://kinlane.com/2016/09/01/real-time-is-often-more-about-what-they-desire-than-what-we-want/">real time is often in service of what "they" want and not what I want</a>, I'm finding new ways to respond the stupidity in the space--one that is healthier for me, and minimizes my service to the machine. The machine enjoys putting out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/27/the-api-for-absurdity/">bullshit stories that get people worked up</a>, which people then, in turn, respond with <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/headlines-condemn-apis-are-written-clicks-not-reality/analysis/2016/08/31">very emotional, and often lengthy responses</a>--all in service of page views and clicks. None of this helps the community, moves forward conversations, it is the service of the domains that participate--often in the form of advertising, and perceived relevance.</p>
<p>When you are down in the weeds, watching the revolution&nbsp;of each gear within this machine, it all seems normal, but we do not see the emotional and intelligence tax involved with this behavior. As I work to fire back up API Evangelist after a summer break, I am working to minimize this tax on my professional and personal self, and I have come up with a new way to respond when I come across things that are just dumb, emotional, and add no value to the world--I will work on water data and APIs.</p>
<p>Opening up water related data using APIs is the ultimate image I have in my head of a focus on APIs that will truly matter now&nbsp;and in the future. Instead of allowing the emotional bur from these "real time" social media events to attach, or at least build up and get underneath my clothing, I'm training myself to take a different path. When I come across dumb API, link bait blog post, badly behaved companies&nbsp;or charged forum and Twitter conversation, I'm going to pick up my water API research, and move it forward an inch or two.</p>
<p>If a topic keeps popping up&nbsp;and it continues to seem important to me, I will add to my writer's notebook and eventually craft something--which will occasionally be ranty, and possess click bait&nbsp;titles. ;-) This is just one of many new tools in my toolbox for helping me stay emotionally sane while immersed in this digital landscape, but more importantly keep my energy reserves full for working on the projects that actually matter. #NoToInternetTax</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/GW-Levels-Test-Tool.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/USGS_Groundwater_Levels_REST_Web_Service_URL_Generation_Tool.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm investing some time learning about the <a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/">USGS Water Services</a>. They have some pretty interesting APIs, providing access to a wealth of data about water table levels, river flows, and other key points across all USGS sites. While their developer area has a wealth of information available, it is also pretty verbose and tough to absorb.</p>
<p>I wanted to help make the information more accessible, filterable, and remixable by turning it into an OpenAPI Spec. It is A LOT OF WORK to craft a complete OpenAPI Spec for a robust API like the six that are available from the USGS. One way I help alleviate this work is to scrape API documentation. As I was preparing to do this I noticed they also have testing tools for 5 out of the 6 APIs, which are just HTML forms containing a definition of the surface area for each API.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Test-Tool.html">Instantaneous Values (IV) Web Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Site-Test-Tool.html">Site Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/DV-Test-Tool.html">Daily Values (DV) Web Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/GW-Levels-Test-Tool.html">Groundwater Levels Web Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Statistics-Service-Test-Tool.html">Statistics Web Service</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The HTML forms provide me with a slightly more structured definition of each API so I will start here. Once I've ingested these, I will write a scrape script for the HTML API documentation, and link the two up. Once I'm done with this I will be able to generate an OpenAPI Spec that is halfway complete (with just the surface area). Once I have this I can load up in my Postman client, turn on Charles Proxy and my internal API monitoring system will fill in the remaining definitions for the Open API Spec--now I have the request and response model, in a machine readable format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I write the code to tackle this, I'm thinking about what a great approach HTML forms are to helping both technical, and semi-technical HTML craftspeople define the surface area of an API. Then I think about my friend Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) and <a href="http://alps.io/">his work on ALPS</a>, and I smile, and I'm reminded of how much work we have ahead of us when it comes to both <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">web literacy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alps-io/profiles">establishing more meaningful, reusable design patterns across the API space</a>(that repo should be full).</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> Is there a better tool out there for turning HTML Forms into OpenAPI Spec or at least JSON or YAML?<br /></em><em><strong>P.S.S.</strong> If you wanna create an API that I can pass any web page with a form in it, and get back an OpenAPI Spec, you are a good person.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/07/the-netflix-public-api-was-the-most-successful-api-failure-ever/">I consider Netflix to be the most successful API failure ever</a>. Even though their public is completely private, exclusively for internal and partner uses, they are still very transparent and open with how they operate&nbsp;and open up the&nbsp;code behind. The reason behind this is simple, and self-serving, but is one that I can get behind 100%--making sure they are hiring the best developer talent, that reflects the company culture.</p>
<p>You see always see these motivations present in the closing paragraphs of their blog posts: "<em>If you are interested in helping us tackle this and other equally interesting challenges, come join us! We are <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/860912">hiring</a> for <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/860577">several</a> different <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/860522">roles</a></em><em>.</em>" I've also had this discussion with&nbsp;Daniel Jacobson (<a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), the VP of Edge Engineering at Netflix (responsible for API and Playback), where he was pretty clear about preferring the type of developer who isn't afraid that the story of what their building will be public on the blog, and their code published openly to Github.</p>
<p>When you think about this a little, it is such an important way to set the stage when it comes to API talent searches, and for your HR operations. An API-centric company regularly publishes overviews of their architecture, with supporting stories of the challenges and triumphs along the way, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/netflix/">open sourcing of as much of your code as possible on Github</a>. Now, as an API-centric developer looking for my next role, I can review the history of the companies architecture, look through and even fire up and use a significant portion of the code behind this architecture--all before I sit down for my first interview. #Brilliant</p>
<p>The transparency that APIs can bring to the table for companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies can come in many shapes and sizes--sometimes good, and sometimes bad. Using a public API as a developer talent honeypot is nothing new--API providers have been doing this for a while. However, there aren't many examples publicly traded companies who are sharing stories and code of their internal API operations as a way to attract, and potentially pre-qualify / filter top talent. Just one more thing to consider as you are planning your API strategy this year.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dictionary-popup.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am working on taking the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/06/a-json-feed-of-critical-web-concepts-to-integrate-into-api-design-service-and-tooling/">JSON feed of web concepts and specs</a> and developing a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/07/a-web-concepts-and-specifications-javascript-library-for-api-providers/">simple website JavaScript tooltip library</a> that API providers can employ to inject web literacy into their API developer portals and documentation. I have settled in on using an existing <a href="http://darsa.in/tooltip/">JavaScript tooltip library</a> for the functionality but I needed to brainstorm what I'd like to see as the dictionary lookup for web and API literacy tooling.</p>
<p>First, I want the JavaScript library to be able to copy and paste into an API developer portal HTML&nbsp;header&nbsp;and just work. By default, it should spider the body, look for any words that are already in the <a href="http://webconcepts.info/concepts/concepts.json">web concepts</a> and <a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/specs.json">specs</a> JSON feeds provided by Erik Wilde's (@dret)&nbsp;<a href="http://webconcepts.info">webconcepts.info</a> work, and turn into a tooltip + link. However, I want API providers to easily be able to add to the dictionary for each web concept or spec, and allow it to find special words, and variations of words, and map to a specific web concept or spec as well.</p>
<p>I picture API providers learning from this tool as they work to craft the content for their API portals, and the documentation for their APIs. I'm picturing a little popup icon for each page where this tool is embedded, allowing&nbsp;you to authenticate and highlight words which you would like added to the dictionary, while also search and autocomplete concept and spec definitions that exist, which you may not have known about (in line education). Ideally, these concepts are injected API design time tools and services, but for right now I want to work on the scope of use at API documentation time.</p>
<p>When I cache the JSON for Erik's web concepts and specs, I will augment with a dictionary array for each entry, so that I can add keywords and phrases, providing the mapping for use in the JavaScript library as it spiders the content of the API portal and documentation page. Replacing out common references to common things like <a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF/RFC/6713">RFC 6713: gzip</a>, and <a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/W3C/TR/cors">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</a>, and beyond. I want this dictionary to be manageable for API providers, and performing most of the heavy lifting when mapping and converting keywords and phrases in API content and documentation--making web literacy more of a default state across API portals, both in the planning stages, as well as consumption by developers.</p>
<p>Now for the work of actually coding the dictionary, alongside the tooltip library, after I pull in the JSON feeds for&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http://webconcepts.info/concepts/concepts.json">web concepts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/specs.json">specs</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am spending a lot of time reviewing <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">patents that mention application programming interface or API in their title, abstract, or in the detail of the patent</a>. Many of the patents lightly reference providing or consuming of APIs, but there are some of them that are directly looking to patent the API itself--which in my opinion just shows how broken the concept of the patent is when applied in a digital world.</p>
<p>One patent that stood out in my reading this week was <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/EP2498213A3?cl=en&amp;dq=Open+API+video+system+and+method+of+making+and+using+same&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGkvu_0O_OAhVE1GMKHddaCzEQ6AEIHDAA">patent #EP20120170800 for "open API video system and method of making and using same"</a>--which is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">video</span>&nbsp;player unit,&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">system</span>&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">and</span>&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">method</span>,&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">and</span>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">video</span>&nbsp;hierarchy. Included are at least one memory device, a plurality&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">of</span>&nbsp;communication access points for receiving at least one program play, an&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">open</span>&nbsp;application programming interface associated with the at least one memory device, wherein a plurality&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">of</span>applications correspondent to the&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">open</span>&nbsp;application programming interface allow a user to manipulate metadata associated with ones&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">of</span>&nbsp;the programs plays, wherein the metadata relates to interframe interactivity with detailed aspects&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">of</span>the ones&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">of</span>&nbsp;the program plays,&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">and</span>&nbsp;at least one correlation engine in communication with the&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">open</span>&nbsp;application programming interface, wherein the at least one correlation engine provides for correlation among at least for the interframes&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">of</span>&nbsp;the program play to ones&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">of</span>&nbsp;the interframes&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">of</span>&nbsp;other ones&nbsp;<span class="patent-text-highlight">of</span>&nbsp;the program plays.</em></p>
<p>The word "open" is used once in the title, and three times in the abstract each time the API is referenced. Directly patenting an API goes against what an API is and does--making data, content, and algorithms accessible on the Internet. When patenting an API, you are asking people to integrate your patented thing into their web, mobile, system, and device applications, wherever they may operate on the Internet--how is this open?</p>
<p>The web is about delivering content, data, and algorithms to humans using HTML, and APIs is about delivering&nbsp;content, data, and algorithms to other systems using JSON or XML. Does someone have the same patent above, but for "open web page video system and method of making and using same"? I sure hope not, otherwise, successful platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, Flickr, and Instagram would not be able to do what they do cost effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patent #EP20120170800 for "open API video system and method of making and using same" is a sign of how broken things are both with the private sector's views on patents, the USPTO's awareness&nbsp;of the nuances involved with delivering algorithms using the Internet technology. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/02/after-looking-through-23414-api-patents-i-think-it-will-just-come-down-to-who-litigates/">I know this will all end up playing out in courts,</a> which is why many people I know do patents--to provide a defense.&nbsp;However, it is more like they will come into play behind closed doors in the backroom dealings between business power brokers, as deals are made, and valuation of companies are established--which itself is antithetical to the benefits that APIs bring to the table as well.</p>
<p>This lack of understanding of what the Internet is, and what open is left me pretty depressed about the future. Maybe this patent will never be leveraged against companies, but the fact that someone thought it was a good idea in the first place, and is investing money and time into this, and not investing these same resources into web technology, is just blind and greedy, and we can do better.</p>

<p>I have written about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/02/the-continuing-netflix-api-story/">continuing Netflix API story over the years</a>, which despite shuttering their public API, is an API effort that just keeps giving to the public. It is an API story that better reflects the reality of APIs, not the bullshit version you often get from the tech sector, and in my opinion is the most successful public API failure of all times--definitely one of the API stories I'll catalog in my <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Netflix's recent story about the <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/08/engineering-trade-offs-and-netflix-api.html">engineering trade-offs and the Netflix API re-architecture</a> was just the latest reminder of how transparent Netflix is with their API operations, even though they do not have a public API--shifting the traditional discussions around open vs. closed APIs. Netflix has been sharing the story of their API operations like they were available to the public, even going as far as&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">open sourcing much of the technology behind their operations</a>.</p>
<p>There are many layers to the definition of what is an open API. There are many incentives for why you would want to be transparent with your APIs. I don't expect that all companies have fully public APIs, it's just not in the DNA of every company, or possible in all industries. However, I do think that companies should be as transparent as possible, especially if they are a publicly traded company. Netflix's reasons are always evident in the last sentence of their posts, "we are <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/860912">hiring</a> for <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/860577">several</a> different <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/860522">roles</a>", but that is another story.</p>

<p>The USGS water services APIs documentation are about 30% education about common web concepts, and specifications like gzip, CORS,&nbsp;ISO-8601 Duration format, SO-8601 Date format, what is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and much more. I see this approach often with API efforts that offer both REST and SOAP services, where the education of developers around key web concepts is much more necessary, but it also depends on how much the API providers actually&nbsp;care about their developers being literate--I guess USGS cares&nbsp;more than many other more commercial providers.</p>
<p>I fully support API providers educating their developer around the web technologies in use. However I feel like it shouldn't be a burden on them, and they should have a wealth of resources available to plug in and do the work for them, so they can spend their time making their APIs better. This is why I'm working with Erik Wilde (<a href="http://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>) to make his <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">important showcase of essential web concepts and specification as machine readable</a>, and as accessible as possible so that we can get to work making more resources available to API providers&nbsp;when it comes to web literacy.</p>
<p>Ideally, web&nbsp;literacy is default amongst developers, but until that is a reality, we should be assisting all API providers in educating their API consumers within their developer portals, and in line with their existing documentation. Ideally, we should be doing this in a more structured approach, and begin evolving Eriks' work into a kind of forkable, embeddable, plug and play curriculum that API providers like the USGS can put to work with as little effort as possible.</p>

<p>The response on Twitter and via email to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/31/enterprise-does-not-know-care-how-big-and-destructive-it-is-to-apis/">my post about how the enterprise does not know(care) how big and destructive it is to APIs</a>, is usual to this type of post, which I usually write about every six months to shake the enterprise trees. My enterprise readers rarely ever favorite or share posts, and engage in conversation on social media, and writing the occasional&nbsp;anti-enterprise posts is a sort of roll call for some of them--who I would never know exist unless I ruffle their feathers (thanks for sharing your thoughts).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I strongly believe that the enterprise (machine) does not care about APIs, but this doesn't mean that the enterprise (individual) does not care about APIs, and can't find meaningful success by employing APIs. It is one of the reasons I bad mouth the enterprise (machine) in this way, to help you see it as a separate beast than from what you are trying to accomplish with APIs within your group.</p>
<p>I have worked in the enterprise, as well as government bureaucracy and know the struggles. I am super thankful for people who have the fortitude to work in these environments, as I do not. Not all change can be inflicted from the outside-in, and the whole API thing requires folks who are embedded, entrenched, and willing to take on the mundane, micro-struggles that exist within the enterprise (machine).</p>
<p>While I do not believe in the enterprise (machine) and APIs, I do believe in you the enterprise (individual) and APIs. You need to keep trying&nbsp;to do API, no matter how many times they fail, or how uphill of a battle it might be. Now that I shook a handful of you out of the trees, feel free to keep sending me messages from within, and I'm happy to keep sharing stories that hopefully will help you in your struggle.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://darsa.in/tooltip/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tooltip-js-for-web-api-concepts.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the prototypes I am going to build on top of Erik Wilde's (@dret) <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">WebConcepts.info work</a>, is a simple JavaScript library that you can embed on any API documentation page, and point at the body, or any other element on the page and it will find and replace any keywords or phrases with popup &nbsp;showing a definition, with a link to Erik's work and the standard(s) home page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm reminded of the need for something like this as I'm looking through the <a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/">USGS Water Services site</a>. There are little web literacy nuggets all over the documentation for the <a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/">USGS's six APIs</a>, and I'd like to see this approach get standardized by building on Erik's work to make web concepts and specs for accessible to API designers and developers, in a consistent way.</p>
<p>A web concepts and specs JavaScript tooltip library for API developer portals wouldn't have to be that sophisticated, it could just look up based upon web concepts available in the <a href="http://webconcepts.info/concepts/concepts.json">JSON for the concepts</a>, and eventually for the related specs. I'll brainstorm more on what the lookup mechanisms might look like. I'd like there to be a dictionary of sorts, that API providers can reference when crafting their documentation, and even add to--then when specific words or phrases appear on the&nbsp;page, the library just swaps it out with a tooltip plus link referencing the web concept or spec.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my prototype, I am going to use <a href="http://darsa.in/tooltip/">the Tooltip JavaScript library</a>, and avoid reinventing the wheel. Next, I'll get to work brainstorming the lookup mechanism, and the dictionary that drives it. Ideally, I'd like for this library to work for both websites, and web applications, and provide context relevant web concepts and specs to API providers, API service providers, and consumers alike. If you have any suggestions for this prototype let me know, or even better, if you want to help build a prototype--that would rock as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I usually don't have to look very far to find good examples of <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">API evangelism</a> in the field, because the best technology providers are usually pretty consistent and vocal about their practices--allowing me to just pluck from my feeds, and rework as a story for my API provider readership. One of the consistent sources for me out there is from the Docker community, and from what they like to call <a href="https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains">Docker Captains</a>.</p>
<p>One of the things I see regularly from this Docker community leadership is the <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2016/09/docker-online-meetup-42-docker-captains-share-tips-tricks-using-docker-1-12/">sharing of their platform tips and tricks and in-person and online meetups</a>. This is definitely something I recommend other API providers do when possible, but I would also recommend working to integrate the concept into your regular evangelism activities like blogging, weekly newsletter, and Tweeting.</p>
<p>Maybe it is something you could also open up to the rest of the community. Allowing your trusted partners, and your favorite developers to share what their tips &amp; tricks are around API integration and usage are. The idea of tips and tricks is a pretty basic thing, but if you are working to stay creative in producing content, while also keeping things in the realm of actually helping your API developers be successful--it is one that can go a long way each week at meetups, on your blog, newsletter, Twitter, and across all the other channels you are already using to reach developers.</p>

<p>I was doing some maintenance on my <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/">bots and APIs research</a>, and processing the information for the&nbsp;<a href="https://botlytics.co/">bot analytics provider Botlytics</a>, and as I was going <a href="http://botlytics.api-docs.io/v1/messages">through their API</a> I noticed the prominent placement and availability of OpenAPI Specs for the API.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/31/please-do-not-hide-your-api-definitions-from-consumers/">Making your API definitions as prominent as possible is something I have been advocating for some time now</a>, something I reinforced again <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/29/add-a-prominent-icon-link-to-your-api-definition-on-your-documentation-page/">recently by asking API providers to make sure and show as an icon</a>, or other very visual element. This is a very important part of the API life cycle, that when also supported as a default feature by API service providers, just keeps giving to the API community, and helps makes it truly more open, consistent, while also helping it be more machine readable. (shouldn't everything API be machine readable? *cough* hypermedia *cough*)</p>
<p>When <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/31/please-do-not-hide-your-api-definitions-from-consumers/">Apiary introduced this feature to their API customers by default I wrote about it</a>, and I also wanted to take the time and give a nod to the Stoplight.io team for doing this with their API Docs--making OpenAPI Spec definitions available in such a prominent location by default. API providers don't always have the time to think of all the little details (which is why I write about things on API Evangelist), so it is super critical that API providers help raise the bar like this when possible.</p>
<p>If you are looking for the quickest way to deploy machine readable API definitions + API docs for your API I recommend <a href="http://stoplight.io/prism/">downloading Stoplight's Prism</a>, fire up your API in <a href="http://getpostman.com">Postman</a>, make calls to all your API endpoints, and <a href="http://stoplight.io/prism/">Prism</a>, <a href="http://stoplight.io/">Stoplight</a>, and <a href="https://api-docs.io/">API Docs</a> will do the heavy lifting for you</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-cybersecurity.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm back wallowing through <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">my API patent work</a>, which I'm sure a portion of my readership is like, "oh gawd, hurry up and move on", which is the same way I feel, but the shit is so deep in this area of my API research I find myself often getting stuck. I just do not know enough about the law, intellectual property, and the patenting algorithms to argue coherently against API focused patents, but in my heart, I know that the API itself should be&nbsp;excluded from the process that is being defined.</p>
<p>I know that many folks think I'm anti-patent. This is the default stance of intellectual&nbsp;property believers. I am not. I get the concept in many circumstances, but when it comes to the Internet, and web technology I think the concept needs an overhaul. The USPTO is woefully ill-equipped to process the patents for such abstract concepts, and companies are rushing to file patents that exploit this--get em' in while you can! The number of growing mentions for API in patent applications shows that there really is no&nbsp;gate&nbsp;when it comes to filing your abstract idea, and locking up your very piece of the digital frontier.</p>
<p>Unable to make a coherent argument against, I'm left thinking about the web, and APIs and what the world would look like if Tim Berners-Lee or Roy Fielding had felt the need to patent their work. With this in mind, I just can't see the interface for your intellectual property being something that should be included as part of the patent language. Go ahead and lay your claim to your algorithmic intellectual property (I guess), but the interface for it, the piece you are going to use the web to provide access to&nbsp;and expect that other businesses&nbsp;integrate into their web, mobile, system, and device-based applications--leave it out.</p>
<p>I do not have a legal argument&nbsp;against you putting API technology in your patents, but I can make a philosophical one, and plead with you to consider the future of technology you would like to see. If you have trouble envisioning this, think of what the Internet would look like if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> had patented his work, and what APIs would have looked like if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding">Roy T. Fielding</a> had patented his work. I'm guessing the Internet would look very, very different, and I'm guessing APIs would never have been a thing.</p>
<p>Ok, last patent story until I make it through all of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lawrence-Lessig/e/B001HCW3ZK/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1">Lawrence Lessig's books</a>.</p>

<p>As I'm spending time learning more about what my DNS provider CloudFlare offers when it comes to securing my APIs. To facilitate this, I am playing around with how I can utilize my Apache log files, to help me better drive the definition of <a href="https://api.cloudflare.com/#page-rules-for-a-zone-create-a-page-rule">DNS security using the CloudfFare API</a>. I guess this is kind of a real time reactive, but also hopefully eventually a proactive solution to quantifying and defining the frontline of my API operations.</p>
<p>I originally embarked on this endeavor to help me manage some of the shift in the API Evangelist network&nbsp;and help mitigate 404 errors across my network of API research. I had recently migrated what I call my API Stack research to a new domain (stack.network), and I am anticipating quite a few broken links in stories over the years that reference this area of my work. I have been trying to attack this from the content level by rewriting links as I find them, but I'm thinking I could automate this using my Apache log files&nbsp;and <a href="https://api.cloudflare.com/#page-rules-for-a-zone-create-a-page-rule">setting up PageRules using CloudFlareAPIs</a>&nbsp;as well.</p>
<p>Once I started sifting through the Apache&nbsp;log files I began to see other traffic patterns that were more in the area of security, then with the stability of my platform and its linkages. As with any type of log file, it is taking some time for all of this to come into focus for me. I will have to spend a great deal of time evaluating traffic from specific IP ranges, user agents, etc., but I know I should be able to quickly establish some rules at the DNS level that will better help me lock down the front line of my API traffic.</p>
<p>Right now I am just keeping my Apache log files backed up to Amazon&nbsp;S3 to help alleviate server load, and keep around for historical purposes. I have built a log file viewer for sifting through my API traffic, and at the moment I'm manually creating page rules in CloudFlare, but it is something I hope to automate via the CloudFlare API once I have established an awareness of the common types of rules I will be creating. Once I evolve to this point I will write about again, and hopefully talk more about how <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com">API access to the logging for my API traffic</a>, in conjunction with how&nbsp;<a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com">API at the DNS level for my API</a> is helping me better define and secure the frontline of my API operations.</p>

<p>I created a JSON feed of the web concepts and specs over at Erik Wilde's (<a href="https://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>) site <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">WebConcepts.info</a>, so that I could <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/01/making-web-concepts-and-specs-present-as-real-time-help-in-api-design-tooling/">easily import the specs into my Twitter and LinkedIn scheduling tools</a>. I want to be able to schedule a tweet a day&nbsp;until I've exhausted all of the critical web concepts and supporting specs that Erik is showcasing in his work. Digital literacy, when it comes to these concepts, and proficiency&nbsp;at applying the specifications across the APIs that are driving growth in the sector is super important, so I want to help.</p>
<p>After I created the JSON file, <a href="http://webconcepts.info/update/2016/09/02/json-concepts.html">Erik went ahead and crafted an official one derived from mine,</a> but he did a nicer, and more complete job than I did. He initially only did the <a href="http://webconcepts.info/concepts/concepts.json">web concepts</a>, but right before I was ready to publish this he did the <a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/specs.json">specs edition</a> as well.

<p>I am going to get to work on some proof of concepts, and prototypes to demonstrate how I'd like to see these web concepts and specs be integrated with API design tooling&nbsp;and API developer portals. I'm just getting started with these thoughts but I would like to see auto-complete, tool tips, and other design time HTTP literacy solutions emerge and evolve. I hate to admit it, but many API developers and architects are probably not looking past their API design tooling and services, and the integrated development environments (IDEs) they depend on each day when it comes to their web literacy. <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">Erik's hard work to showcase these building blocks of the web</a> is a great start, and I hope provides us all with some essential curriculum that we can deliver straight to developers, where they are already working.</p>

<p>I wrote a post the other day sharing my thoughts around&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/30/graphql-seems-like-we-do-not-want-to-do-the-hard-work-of-api-design/">GraphQL seeming like we were avoiding the hard work of API design</a>. Shortly after publishing&nbsp;Sashko Stubailo (<a href="https://twitter.com/stubailo">@stubailo</a>) from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apollostack.com/">Apollo, a GraphQL solution provider</a>, wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/apollo-stack/graphql-the-next-generation-of-api-design-f24b1689756a#.ph8196t2j">very thoughtful response to me comments and questions about GraphQL</a>. First I wanted to say that I really dig this approach to responding to other people's blog posts, with a blog post of your own, within your own personal or company domain.</p>
<p>I don't think Sashko has convinced me 100% that GraphQL is the solution we are looking for, but he has convinced me that I should be learning more about it, keeping a closer eye on the technology, and better understand how people are putting it to use.</p>
<p>Regarding my primary question regarding <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how&nbsp;</span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GraphQL could benefit non-technical folks&nbsp;and end-users</span></span>--I would say he answered it 50% of the way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I&rsquo;m a frontend developer. GraphQL makes my life easy.</em></p>
<p>It doesn't touch on whether or not non-technical users will be able to reverse engineer and put it to work for them, but that's ok for now. One thing that Sashko touched on for me, that move GraphQL closer to being simple enough for non-technical users, is he helped differentiate GraphQL from SQL:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>GraphQL is a query language, like SQL? While GraphQL looks like a query language at first, I think its name might be one of the things that </em>gets<em> people off on the wrong foot. GraphQL is not at all like SQL...So GraphQL is a &ldquo;query language&rdquo; just like URLs are the &ldquo;query language&rdquo; of REST&mdash;it&rsquo;s a contract that describes how to tell the API server what you&rsquo;re looking for.</em></p>
<p>I like the separation from "structured" query language, and moving us to something that augments HTTP and the URL, and doesn't just tunnel into the backend database. This has the potential to move REST forward, not drag the database out front for me--which leaves me more hopeful.</p>
<p>Another area Sashko answered for me was regarding GraphQL seeming like it was too hard:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This is a very real concern whenever a new technology is introduced. Is this going to make stuff more complicated for everyone who isn&rsquo;t in the know?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Fair enough. Makes me happy to hear this from a service provider who is leading the charge when it comes to GraphQL. His stance seems like it is pragmatic, and aware of the importance that GraphQL needs to be accessible to as wide as possible audience as we can--building on the momentum REST has in this area.</p>
<p>What really pushed away my concern, and got me more interested in paying more attention to GraphQL was when Sashko talked about this just being the beginning:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The most exciting thing to me is that GraphQL has been publicly available for barely more than a year, and already a huge number of people I respect for their technical abilities and design thinking are trying to figure out ways to add it to their architecture.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Ok. Now I want to see where this goes. I've been tracking on GraphQL as a subset of my data API research, but will spend some extra cycles each week keeping an eye who is doing anything interesting with GraphQL. I've added <a href="http://www.apollostack.com/">Apollo</a> to my research, and I will work on a roundup of other providers, and any open source tooling I can find out there. I also wanted to thank&nbsp;Sashko for taking the time to answer some of my questions, and respond to my uncertainty around GraphQL. I dig it when API service providers and API providers provide responses to my storytelling on API Evangelist--makes for good conversation in the API community.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Sep 2016</span>

<p>I see an increasing number of job postings on LinkedIn and other job websites from companies who are&nbsp;actively seeking an API rockstar, ninja, lead, owner, or product manager, and because of my connections in the space I know that some of the intent behind them are less than sincere. Don't get me wrong, I think ALL companies should be embarking on their API journey, and if that means bringing in outside talent--get it done!</p>
<p>My motivation in writing this post is to help companies be more realistic during their talent search, and hiring process, as well as internally with their teams. As an IT and lead developer veteran, I have been brought in to take the reins on a number of teams&nbsp;and I have seen a wide range of toxic situations. I understand the internal struggles exist in all companies, but the companies that were the worst for me, were the ones where I was blindsided by the depth of the entrenchment and struggle with leadership and internal teams, either because they were in denial or were straight up bullshitting me--in hopes I might be able to wave my magic wand and just fix everything.</p>
<p>I've confidentially heard many stories from API product leads, and evangelists after exiting a company, or sometimes while they are still in their positions, about how entrenched internal leadership is when it comes to "innovation" and "change"--all while putting on a good show that APIs are truly the priority. I understand that companies want to look innovative, hip, agile, flexible, and all the things often associated with APIs, but bringing in API talent, only to let them hit a brick wall because they were unprepared just isn't good business.</p>
<p>If you are going to say that you are doing APIs, and issuing press releases, and promising your customers, partners, and internal stakeholders that you are going to do APIs, make sure you properly prepare any talent you are looking to lead the charge. I'm not saying the API journey will be easy, and you shouldn't be embarking on this journey. I am just recommending that do not go around hiring API talent, only to blindside them upon entry with entrenched, unwilling to evolve internal actors...or if this is the case just make sure you set the stage properly during the hiring process.</p>

<p>I have been pulling all the patent applications from the USPTO for a while now. As I work to fire API Evangelist back up, I'm working to be more regular about processing these files, and track on which companies who are including the phrase "application programming interface" in their title, abstract, or full description. So far I have&nbsp;<a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents/?filter=2016">23,414 API related patents from between 2005 and present day from 4,283 companies</a>--not all of these APIs are "web APIs", but there are many that directly reference being a method for providing and consuming an API for whatever process is being defined.</p>

<p>I will be added all 4,283 of these companies to my API monitoring system, keeping an eye out on their website, blog, and their Twitter and Github profiles for anything API. Along with process press releases for API.report, I am thinking that patent applications will become a fruitful way for finding companies who are doing APIs, but might not be that good at actually showcasing it on their sites. It seems that many companies feel that APIs are important enough to mention in a press release, and file patents for, but don't always see them as valuable enough to showcase on their website.</p>
<p>Many of these APIs are hardware, networking, and non-web APIs, but with the way the Internet of Things is going, if these companies are doing APIs of any shape or size, it is likely they will be doing web APIs as well. It is kind of a dark way to keep a pulse on the API space, and not the way I'd prefer to be doing it, but I want to make sure I am aware of all things APIs, especially the shit that is going on in the shadows.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-legal.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>After looking through <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents/?filter=2016">the 23,414 API related patents from between 2005 and present day from 4,283 companies</a>, it is clear that the API patent game will be all about which companies decide to litigate using their "intellectual property". There is definitely a lot of education that could occur across all industries where these patents will be put to work, and hopefully we can see some reforms at the USPTO regarding how important it is to the economy that the APIs themselves to remain open and reusable, but I think that ultimately the world of API patents will be hammered out in courts across the United States, and other countries around the world.</p>
<p>While I'm not a fan of the concept of the patent, especially when they are applied to algorithms and abstract ideas, I cannot intelligently argue for companies to not patent the "process that occurs behind the API" (at the moment), however I feel pretty strongly that it is pretty critical that the concept of the API should be left out of the process. At the moment I'm just not knowledgeable enough on the whole software patent world to know what the hell I am talking about, which is why I have my <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">API patent research</a>&nbsp;to help me evolve my awareness and understanding and strengthen my position.</p>
<p>To compliment my patent research, I am going to start pulling any court cases for the 4,283 companies who have filed API related patents across <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/jurisdictions/">471 jurisdictions&nbsp;in the United States</a> using the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/">CourtListener API</a>, so that I can identify any potential litigation that involves their patent portfolio. Like the other <a href="http://apievangelist.com">75 areas of the API universe</a> that I keep an eye on, I'll just keep watching the patent applications, profiling the companies who are filing them, and see who has the most API patents, and most importantly the ones who are actually using these patents in a court of law.</p>

        <p>I am working to organize the&nbsp;<a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents/?filter=2016">23,414 API related patents from between 2005 and present day</a>, submitted by 4,283 companies--present in my API patent research. Not all of these APIs are "web APIs", but I think each companies portfolio tells a lot of what they are doing with APIs, their motivations behind, and is also a reflection on the overall state of the industry.</p>
<p>To help me better understand the growth in API related patents I'm slicing and dicing the data, and publishing in different ways--I recently dumped the <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/charts/bar/">number of patents by year&nbsp;and published as a D3.js bar chart</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/charts/bar/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/number-of-api-patents-years.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>It is pretty depressing to see the growth in patent applications that mention "application programming interface". I'm not sure what this means, but I know it can't be good for making the web work. I'll keep slicing and dicing things, and see if I can keep deriving any meaning from it all. I'm thinking I will publish each companies patent portfolio by itself, as I work to profile each company to see what they are up to with APIs.</p>

<p>When processing the news for <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the over 150 areas of my API industry research</a>, I spend a good deal of time looking for images to represent my stories, and the companies I'm covering. When looking for an image to best represent a company I always search google for "[company name] logo branding", and look for an official branding and logo guidelines page for a company--secondarily I switch over the image search if there is no official page available.</p>
<p>After a blog post, news piece, or research update goes live, I will sometimes receive a DM or email from a company asking me to update the logo, to a newer option than what I found via a Google search. I'm always happy to update the logo, and since my images are centrally stored on Amazon S3 it is pretty easy to do so. What I find interesting is that every company who actively polices their brand in this way never have an easy to find <a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com/">branding and logo area for their company&nbsp;and API operations</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I fully understand the need to police your brand&nbsp;and make sure your company's logo is represented in the best light, but what I don't understand is why they don't have a <a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com/">self-service branding are</a>a to help empower folks like me to do this on their own. It just seems like a lot of extra work that is unecessary&nbsp;or at least is something that you could minimize by providing a dedicated page where folks like me can find the most recent copy of your logo.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-banking-stories.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>After monitoring the tech space, and specifically the API space for six years now I really have feel for how stories are used try incite change in a variety of industries. There are many different waves of storytelling out of companies and tech blogs, which in the moment might seem like reality, but if you wait a month or two the topics run out of steam and go away--very few are sustained unless there is something really there there.</p>
<p>Many companies are just throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what will resonate with the tech blogs, and their readers. Unless you monitor ALL the blogs like I do, you most often won't see these trends as being seeded by specific companies, VCs, and those looking to see what sticks. I've seen topics like quantified-self evolve into wearables, waves of database to API solutions come and go, check-in API platforms like Foursquare lose their allure, and concepts like BaaS and open government data fall from grace.</p>
<p>It can be hard to tell if these things were just momentary trends&nbsp;if they were propped up through investment and storytelling, or like open government data, BaaS, and database to API solutions, continue their usage, but just aren't cool for tech blogs and other folks to talk about anymore. One of these areas I can't quite figure out is in the area of banking APIs, which seems to have legs, but most of the time it just seems like a sustained API storytelling assault on the banking industry from outside forces.</p>
<p>There are usually 3-5 stories a week that I come across talking about the importance of API transformation in the banking industries and how banks face becoming irrelevant if they don't embrace--clearly stories from those trying to change the industry. I see evidence of roots developing, because of the regulation put in motion by the UK, but I see still don't see much evidence that banks really give a shit about any of this.</p>
<p>When I look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks_in_the_United_States">list of largest banks in the United States on Wikipedia</a>, the only one doing APIs in an organized way, that stands out for me, is <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">Capital&nbsp;One</a>. At this point, I'm guessing the sustained assault on the industry is coming from the waves of banking and fintech startups? IDK. If this is all seeded by the banking layer to the fintech&nbsp;(r)evolution, it seems more sustained than other industries I've tracked on--usually, they run out of steam after a couple of months. I'd be curious to hear people's thoughts on the API evolution in the banking industry. Are banks actually giving a nod to the concept? Or are they just going to be weathering this assault, knowing they have the resources to do business on their terms?</p>

<p>Profiling the social media footprint of API related companies is what I do for a living. If you are doing something mildly interesting with an API I will add your Twitter, and Github accounts to my database. I will also go through Twitter, LinkedIn, and Github looking for all your employees and profile them. This is how I monitor the world of APIs, by profiling, and staying in tune with the companies, and what their employees are up to.</p>
<p>While immersed in some "<a href="http://www.darkreading.com/analytics/anatomy-of-a-social-media-attack/a/d-id/1326680?_mc=RSS_DR_EDT">dark reading</a>" I was pleasantly surprised to see "identify your organization&rsquo;s social media footprint (companies, accounts, and key individuals)", as the top item on the list of things you can do to "<span>shore up their social media and network defenses". This concept is a no-brainer for me, but I wonder how many companies actually have an up to date map of their companies social media footprint? If they are savvy they have this in place, as well as established for all of their competitors. #SmartStrategy</span></p>
<p><span>It is easy to think of security in purely a technical sense, DNS, servers, and software, but as the world of shadow IT and social media has become common in every company, institution, and government agency, how many companies are actively mapping out this landscape, and proactively working to secure it? As a tech professional who runs my own business I actively work to define ALL the online services I use, not just the social media ones--it just makes good business sense.</span></p>

<p>I took the <a href="https://github.com/dret/webconcepts">Github repository</a> for Erik Wilde's (<a href="https://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>) <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">Web Concepts</a> work and forked it, then generated some JSON which I could use to import into my API monitoring system. I've been manually adding specs to my Tweet and LinkedIn scheduling system, but I keep forgetting to go back to the site and add more entries. So I wanted to go ahead and import all the concepts and specs, and schedule out the tweets and LinkedIn posts for everything, over the next couple months.</p>
<p>First I generated the JSON for the concepts:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7991563ae174b9d185a928bccf1f19bd.js"></script>
<p>Then I generated the JSON for the specs:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/d2df0730e75a3a353b999f6b591252e5.js"></script>
<p>I left out the relationships between the concepts and specs, as I will just be linking to Web Concepts, and let people explore for themselves. As I was looking through the JSON I got me thinking about why these concepts and specs aren't available in API design tooling, as helpers and tooltips, so that API designers and architects can learn from them and be reminded in real time--as they are crafting their APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like there should be autocomplete for HTTP header fields, and for HTTP status codes, and other relevant items as they are needed. There is a wealth of web literacy available in Erik's work, and across the web concepts and specs he has organized, it seems like these should be available by default within API design services and tooling, and start being baked into IDEs like Atom, Eclipse, and Visual Studio--maybe they already are, and I'm just unaware.</p>

<p>It is hard for me to track on everything&nbsp;in the API space as a one man show, but one thing I keep an eye on, but rarely add to my research (yet) are the increasing number of job postings I come across that have an API focus. An interesting one this week, which follows a new vein in the API space that I'm mining, is out of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.battelle.org/careers">the applied science technology research organization Battelle</a>.</p>
<p>They have an interesting <a href="http://jobs.militarytimes.com/jobs/Cyber-Computer-Scientist-II/J3J2PL717Z5R8TS0JMJ">job posting for a cyber computer scientist</a> with Battelle&rsquo;s Cyber Innovation Unit (CIU) providing "a broad range of products and services including Cyber Intelligence and Counter Intelligence, Cyber Research and Development and Fundamental Science, On&shy;site Advisory Services, and Mission Focused tools including Embedded Systems Reverse Engineering."&nbsp;</p>
<p>What brought the job posting up on my radar is one of the responsibilities being for "data APIs", and a requirement (mentioned twice) for having API design skills. The role APIs are playing in the areas of cyber security, cyber intelligence, and apparently "cyber innovation" is why <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/30/why-i-added-cybersecurity-to-my-api-monitoring-research/">I recently added cybersecurity as a research area to my API monitoring stack</a>. It's not that&nbsp;APIs are being hacked, it is that they are being used for research, analysis, collaboration, communication, and other layers of the <a href="http://cybersecurity.theater">cybersecurity theater</a>.</p>
<p><span>If I keep coming across interesting job postings like this I may have to start tracking on API jobs more, as the overall volume of API jobs that are coming across my radar is increasing, but also the interestingness&nbsp;is also trending upward significantly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I am always amazed at the amount of hype, rhetoric, and FUD that is stirred up by analysts, vendors, and the tech blogosphere when it comes to APIs. APIs are the next big wave in vendor solutions! APIs are going away because of bots! People love to build them up to be something they are not, something which I mostly blame vendors, venture capital investment, and the analysts and tech blogosphere for stirring this pot to meet their objectives.</p>
<p>To help cut through the BS, I like to always have a basic demonstration of what an API is handy, and its relationship to the web, in hopes that I will educate the muggles (my new word--thanks <a href="http://mce_host/admin/blog/@caseysoftware">@caseysoftware</a>), and balance the BS scales a bit as we go along. To help do this I wanted to provide you with three types of common resources that you find on the web, each with four basic ways of representing them using web&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>All three of these resources are available at a demonstration website I have set up at <a href="http://website.apievangelist.com">website.apievangelist.com</a>, with each resource available in their respective folders /blog, /products, and /services. Using the links below you can click on the different representations of each on, and the results should show in the text area below.</p>

<p>The only technology driving this is the basic website setup on a simple Linux (Fedora) web server, running Apache to deliver the website--nothing else. The only difference between a website and API is that a website returns HTML meant for humans, and API (representations) return XML, JSON, RSS, meant for other applications and systems--that is ALL. There is no vendor voodoo, it is just about returning the same information, but meant for use in other websites, mobile applications, systems integrations, and increasingly device based solutions.</p>
<p>The FUD I hear about APIs going away, or just being a trend always make me chuckle. These claims always sound just like the folks who used to tell me in 1998 and 1999 about the web being a fad--what do these claims sound like in 2016? Is delivering HTML to humans going away, any more so than delivering JSON to mobile devices, or IoT devices? What will go away and change are people's delusions around open APIs, and specific vendor and VC centric views on what is API--not delivering machine-readable representations of data, content, media, and algorithms that are already driving the human web experience.</p>
<p>Once you realize that an API is just the next step in the evolution of the web, and is about negotiating exactly the representation of a digital resource that you desire--you will begin to see things a little differently. When you see APIs as the web, and not as any particular API provider, or service providers vision of API, you will find the world looks a lot different, and that APIs aren't going anywhere--no matter what they are called in future iterations. The will always be programmatic interfaces meant for other applications.</p>

<p>I get a number of eager new entrepreneurs contacting me, looking for wisdom and insight about the API space. I've always worked to make myself accessible to people who are looking for knowledge around what is possible with APIs, and what is happening across the API space. Sadly, after six years and watching many companies come and go, I'm slowly changing this practice when it comes to startups.</p>
<p>I have always been open with my knowledge on the space, and happy to schedule time for a gHangout or Skype call with each wave of new API startups, but after watching many of them grow up, get more funding, find their exits, acquisitions, and failures--I just can't keep doing it in good conscious. In my experience, only about 5% of these companies actually care about the space, their customers, and the rest are only focused on their own success&nbsp;and the success of their investors.</p>
<p>Most of these entrepreneurs&nbsp;do not understand the damage to the wider community that their selfish focus brings. My requests to give back to the community in the form of open API designs patterns, open source software, storytelling, and supporting conversations like <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a> often go right over their head. Usually, they talk with me 2 or 3 times, get what they need, and go away without ever giving back. Why would they give back to the community, if I'm so willing to just give it away--extract maximum value, and give nothing back is their belief system.</p>
<p>I'm sorry but <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/05/reconciling-how-reliable-apis-are-while-also-embracing-tone-set-by-vc-investment/">APIs aren't failing us, our startup and funding models are failing us</a>. I do not anticipate this getting any better with the recent shifts in the funding landscape, and the increased amount of attention paid by, and to the enterprise. I will continue giving via my blog, but will become much more picky about who I jump on the phone, skype, or gHangout with. I'm sorry, but if you want this to be different, you can start by working to set a different tone in the API space by giving back, sharing, and invest&nbsp;more in the community, and open web technologies--not just focusing on getting rich, your proprietary&nbsp;tech, locking up resources, profiting off your users data, and leaving everyone behind once you get yours.</p>

<p>Overall I am pretty underwhelmed by the Internet of Things. Most of the ways in which devices are being connected to the Internet are not very interesting, if not just a bad idea. Even with the overwhelming ways in which I am being underwhelmed by IoT, there are a handful of areas that I do find interesting, <a href="http://industrial.apievangelist.com">like industrial implementations</a>, drones, and the general potential of the concept when you do it thoughtfully and securely.</p>
<p>One of the differences between IoT and the other areas that are fueling APIs in 2016 is that they can be both an API provider, as well as an API consumer. While mobile applications have historically been the biggest driver of API development, they are just API consumers, as are most websites. There is a handful of API aggregation and integration as a service providers who consumer APIs, then also provide APIs who pay this forward (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/05/api-integration-service-providers-should-have-an-api-so-that-their-actions-are-embeddable/">sadly not all API service providers do this</a>), but in the end, most endpoints are just consumers.</p>
<p>When it comes to IoT devices, this is where it gets interesting to me. These Internet-enabled devices can be both API consumers, and API providers--which I think everyone should be, but that is another dimension to this conversation. Deploying Linux, virtualized containers like Docker, and a web server on Raspberry Pi&nbsp;and other popular IoT devices is pretty trivial. This opens up the ability to not just send and receive data to the cloud via APIs, but also a number of&nbsp;possibilities for redefining the network--where APIs are not just about the current incarnation of cloud APIs.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that all implementations of IoT devices in this way will be interesting, but It does evolve the definition of what is possible when it comes APIs, especially when you couple this with the expanding definition of what is the network (ie. cellular, mesh, SDN, etc.). However, it does also continue expanding the attack surface area when it comes to IoT security, but I'm sure everyone is thinking deeply on this subject&nbsp;when it comes to evaluating whether or not a device should be connected to the network at all. ;-)</p>

<p>I feel like the enterprise has successfully rounded up the escaped experiment that is API, and got it under control. With its size and scope it didn't really even notice APIs until 2012 or so, and once it did it quickly joined the "conversation" to make sure it wasn't left out of what the cool kids were doing. Now in 2016, if you want to get the funding you have to have enterprise customers already, and if you are doing APIs and selling to the enterprise you have to speak in their terms "microservices"--as the concept of APIs never actually got approved by legal--microservices has.</p>
<p>It seems like the simplicity, low cost, and user-centricity of APIs will be paved over at every turn, replacing the web in API with more vendor-friendly solutions with an HTTP facade that smiles like it's the web. The enterprise&nbsp;does not care about open standards, except for making sure they have joined&nbsp;and are sitting at the table, talking over everyone, and making sure their way of doing business is baked in--making standards less about community&nbsp;and more about the industry, like web services are.</p>
<p>I said it before, and I'll say it again. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/the-enterprise-will-make-the-same-mistakes-with-api-and-microservices-that-they-did-with-soa-because-essential-api-concepts-go-right-over-their-head/">The enterprise will never get API</a> because of the simplicity of them, the getting to know your resources, your community, and end-users&nbsp;does not fit with the scope and scale at which the enterprise operates. I know. I know. To get the price down, you have to do things at scale. I think this was a much truer statement before the Internet. The web can operate at "web scale", as many small nodes all working together--it doesn't require a single massive entity to operate.</p>
<p>I am sorry sharing and playing nicely with others isn't part of the equation at your enterprise. I would prefer it if you'd go back to your SOA ways and just leave us alone, but I understand that this will never happen now--we can never go back. You will never understand, and will never see how destructive your belief system is to this little experiment, or maybe that is the point--you want to just kill it, so you can get back to your way of doing things.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about the Twilio IPO a lot lately, as it seems to be well received by the market. I am trying to be realistic about this, and work to understand how much the API thing actually has anything to do with how well investors have received the company which we all love to showcase in the API space. I would like to think the "muggles", as my friend Keith Casey (<a href="https://twitter.com/caseysoftware">@caseysoftware</a>) calls them, understand the competitive advantage an API brings, but I just can't quite sell myself on the fact that this is the reality.</p>
<p>As I'm mulling over this I am also working to get my <a href="http://api.report">API.Report news</a> channel back up and running after taking a break this summer, and I'm noticing more companies are showcasing the existence of an API when talking about acquisitions, partnerships, and other market-related events. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/19/when-your-api-consumption-influences-the-acquisition-of-your-startup/">I blogged about this the previous week when FullContact acquired a company</a>, partly due to the fact they were using their API, but it is also interesting to see APIs be wielded to also influence wider markets, not in acquisition scenarios.</p>
<p>I guess the increased usage of APIs as a competitive&nbsp;advantage for courting would-be buyers, and the wooing of general markets is a good thing. Each time it is wielded, more muggles get exposed to what an API is. The problem comes in when this is wielded for companies who do not live up to market hype or expectations, or the API really isn't even a thing--it is just wielded to make a company sound cool. I'm a little mixed on this one, and it will have to be something I will keep watching, and trying to understand what it actually means for the API space, as I generally could care less about the market performance of companies--except Twilio, I &lt;3 Twilio.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://cybersecurity.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-cybersecurity.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently added a <a href="http://cybersecurity.apievangelist.com/">new area of research to API Evangelist focused on cybersecurity</a>. I added this area of research not because APIs are being used to hack systems, which does happen occasionally. I did this because I wanted to better tune into this area because APIs are being applied by all sides (are there sides?) to communicate, evaluate cybersecurity events, and spread their message--which is a significant part of what is cybersecurity.</p>
<p>When APIs aren't properly secured, and a breach occurs, I consider this a security topic&nbsp;and file it under <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">my API security research</a>. If something occurs in the wider global security theater, I file it under my cybersecurity research. This research doesn't always directly touch on APIs, but in <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-twitter-was-the-platform-of-choice-for-ripping-apart-the-nsa-dump">many cases like the recent DNC hacks APIs are being used to analyze, study, share stories, and communicate around these often ongoing cybesecurity events</a>.</p>
<p>I am seeing APIs often being used as part of the levers pulled when it comes to the theater of cybersecurity, whether its anonymous bitcoin ransom payments, <a href="https://twitter.com/guccifer_2">Guccifer 2.0 spreading the story of a recent breach of Twitter</a>, or researchers doing their forensic studies. As with other areas of my API monitoring, establishing a dedicated research project helps me tune in closer to what is going on, identify key actors, and better understand the role of APIs in the fast-growing world of cybersecurity.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2016</span>

<p>I am using Twitter more like an RSS feed these days. I pull the Tweets of the companies I track on once a day, and I scan / read them (when I have time), and either curate them or mark as read. I'm not happy with the Twitter algorithm, and I'm looking to get information straight from the horse's mouth, when I want, on my terms. I cringe at the fact I'm using Twitter as an RSS / Atom feed, but it is working well for me.</p>
<p>I'm seeing several benefits of this approach, but one of them is getting a feel for some of the common patterns around how API providers are putting Twitter to work. So far I am seeing some pretty distinct approaches emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not At All -</strong> They have a Twitter account, but they rarely ever Tweet anything.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing Their Blog Posts -</strong> They only tweet out blog posts, and often do not have RSS / Atom for their blog (grrrrrrrrr!!).</li>
<li><strong>Sharing Other Blog Posts &nbsp;-</strong> Only use Twitter as a syndication engine for what they read in the space.</li>
<li><strong>Supporting Developers -</strong> Many Twitter accounts are just streams of support responses for the community.</li>
<li><strong>Communication -</strong> Using it to communicate with partners, and developers, engaging in conversation with their community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the API providers I monitor only operate in one or two of these areas, with only a few who are hitting in all of these areas. I'm going to start ranking the Twitter accounts of the APIs out there, and identify the ones who are doing it well. Then I will start showcasing more of them, as the leading accounts to emulate when API providers are trying to figure out their own rhythm.</p>
<p>I am not perfect when it comes to Twitter and delivering in all of these areas. Recently I've stepped away from being too conversational, and I mostly share my blog posts, and those of others, more than actually engaging in conversation. This is just my personality, and also reflects the brand I'm trying to evolve into over next five years of my operations--it is helping me scale things. I do not think there will be one formula that works across the board, but if we can identify what the healthy patterns are, I think API providers will have more to consider when crafting their own strategy, and finding their own voice.</p>

<p>Maybe with the current funding priority shifts in the tech world, and some of the push back on the startup way of life, we could pause a little bit and just let everyone catch up with their API strategy, before moving on to the next big thing. I get emails, DMs, and the occasional&nbsp;phone call from journalists looking for wisdom on what is next for the API space, where my answer is always, "more of what we have been doing". Sadly, my quote(s) never see the light of day--I am ok with that.</p>
<p>Before companies look at doing bots, internet of Things, or begin playing with any of the new shiny objects on the landscape, we should just focus on doing APIs, doing them well, and realizing the fundamental benefits they bring to the table before getting distracted (yet again). I'm guessing that all of the resource available on your websites, and in your web applications, aren't all exposed as simple APIs in a coherent way. I'm guessing there are numerous sub-projects within your API ecosystem that you could be working on to improve integrations and performance. I'm sure there are numerous&nbsp;things you could be doing to support, and engage your developers better.</p>
<p>One of the downsides of the whole tech rat race, is we are always looking to stand out by doing the next cool thing. Truly getting to know the digital resources we are exposing, rolling up our sleeves to define them better using hypermedia (invest in hypermedia!), and reaching out to our consumers isn't always the cool thing to be doing that will get us written up in Techcrunch, but they are the things that will matter in the future. Maybe we could learn from the crazy pace of the last decade&nbsp;and take a break in 2017, and just work on getting our house in order before we focus on anything new?&nbsp;</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github-api.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was just getting started evolving upon my API definition discovery tools before I left this summer, and is something I am just picking up again, now that I am back at it. Historically there are three ways in which I find API definitions like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint for APIs:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Behind API Document</strong> - When I come across API documentation deployed using Swagger UI or Apiary, I know that behind them there is an API definition -- sadly they are usually obfuscated rather than proudly shared with an icon + link.</li>
<li><strong>Website Harvesting</strong> - When I find a company who is doing things with APIs either because they have a public API portal, or have issued a press release, I add their URL to my crawler and I suck down their entire site and sift through the results for API definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Using the Github API I am regularly searching the social coding platform using a variety of search terms which have been proven to produce results for OpenAPI Specs and API Blueprints, which are used in API related operations. Many are just for prototypes or from people playing around, but many often yield some pretty interesting results about API operations I couldn't find any other way.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Out of all three of these approaches, I would say that Github holds the most promise for actually improving the world of API discovery, allowing me to find APIs in the wild. Ideally, APIs would employ hypermedia, or use solutions like <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-02">JSON Home</a> and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, but in the meantime, if y'all could use Github to host your API definitions, that would be awesome.</p>
<p>Remember, Github provides other benefits for your hosting your JSON, YAML, and Markdown API definitions like hosting your documentation, helping you manage the versions, and providing other ways to display using Jekyll and Liquid. It also helps developers and API analysts like me find your APIs, adding to your existing marketing and evangelism efforts.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-graphql.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>We were talking about GraphQL in the API Evangelist Slack channel the other day, and the consensus seemed to be that GraphQL is a way to avoid the hard work involved with properly getting to know your API resources, and it is just opening up a technical window to the often messy backend of our database-driven worlds.</p>
<p>As an old database guy (1980s) I love me some SQL, but I am also a believer in what the API design, deployment, and the management life cycle can bring to the table. APIs are about taking often very technically defined resources, and making them accessible, and more intuitive (not always) to the people who are consuming and putting API resources to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technologists love their new shiny toys that reflect their tech ideology, and this is what GraphQL seems like to me on the surface. I get the reasons behind doing it, and why developers like it, but I think it's missing the important aspects of why we are doing APIs. Sure, you won't know every possible scenario a developer will want to query using your API, but this is why we have feedback loops associated with API operations.</p>
<p>It seems like you would attract 5 very technical API developers who would love it, but then exclude 5 non-technical users. Why not just make a simple and limited API, and have a conversation with all 10 users about what they need, and come up with an agile way to design, deploy, and manage new paths, and additional parameters to your existing paths. GraphQL seems like the numerous TEXTAREAS I've deployed behind the firewall to allow trusted users to write SQL to get at the database--which is just poking a hole, not very evolutionary at all.</p>
<p>GraphQL feels like the DBAs coming out from behind the firewall and rather than adjusting to the world, they are implementing their way of doing things on everyone--which is classic IT / backend behavior. No average user will ever use GraphQL interfaces, where they will copy / paste a URL and put it to work for them--if it is intuitive. Like the TEXTAREA solution, GraphQL feels like a quick fix to me and not one that looks to the future--I think my friend Mehdi Medjaoui (<a href="https://twitter.com/medjawii">@medjawii</a>) says it well with:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"When the wise man shows the moon, the idiot looks at the finger&rdquo; s/moon/REST/ | s/finger/GraphQL/"</em></p>
<p>Us developers and IT class are always looking for the quick fix that fits with our ideology, and are resistance to change, and solutions that look outwards and to the future. I am not being critical of GraphQL just to be mean, I'm just asking if it is the forward-looking solution, the simplicity that we need to do this at scale. I feel like GraphQL is just another tech solution, that will have to be executed by tech people in the know, and not a solution that everyone will be able to implement. If you disagree with me, maybe you could help me learn more about the reason behind GraphQL, and understand how this benefits non-technical folks&nbsp;and end-users.</p>

<p>It is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_ec2_beta/">the 10th anniversary of the launch of Amazon EC2 this month</a>, and I think it is a good time to revisit what this has meant to the API space. If you have heard any of my keynote talks where I visit the <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs</a> and share my story of how I became the API Evangelist, you have heard this before, but is something I feel is worth repeating so that my new readers can play catch up.</p>
<p><a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">In March of 2006 Amazon launched their new Amazon S3 service, and in August of 2006 they followed up with their launch of Amazon EC2</a>. The Amazon S3 release interested me and I signed up right away, but the Amazon EC2 release is when the lightbulb went on for me when it came to the potential of web APIs--which eventually led to me launching API Evangelist in July of 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to 2006 APIs were being used for what is considered very non-business activities, like publishing and sharing photos, videos, and of web links. S3 opened up storage in a new way, but the potential for deploying server infrastructure around the globe using web APIs was a serious game changer (I do not use this phrase often). With the release of EC2 web APIs weren't just for fun and games anymore, or just a "hobby toy" as my SAP IT directors in Germany liked to tell me--you could now do real world business things with them.</p>
<p>It would take a couple more years for me to realize this potential while I was running events for SAP and for Google, as the VP of Technology&nbsp;at WebEvents global, but by 2010 I had been touched by the holy API spirit. I then quit my nice six figure job, fired up a blog, and hit the road spreading the gospel of how web APIs could make digital, and increasingly physical resources more accessible to not just business, but also individuals, government agencies, and beyond.</p>

<p>I have monitored the Github accounts and organizations for individuals and companies doing interesting things with APIs for some time now. However, recently this channel is increasingly being the way that I discover truly interesting companies, individuals, specifications, tools, and even services. The most interesting people and companies doing things with APIs usually understand the importance of being transparent and aren't afraid of publishing their work on Github.</p>
<p>Developers are often very poor at blogging, tweeting, and sharing their work, but because Github allows me to follow their work, and provides additional ways to surface things using <a href="https://github.com/trending">Github trending</a>, I'm able to find things often before they'll show up on other common channels like Twitter, LinkedIn, etc--if they do at all. You can subscribe to the changes for a Github user, and organization using RSS, or you can do like I do, and use the API to dial in what you are following, and identify some pretty interesting relationships and patterns.</p>
<p>The interesting things I'm discovering&nbsp;aren't always directly code&nbsp;related either. With the increased usage of Github for publishing API portals, documentation, and other resources, I am increasingly finding&nbsp;valuable security guides, white papers, presentations, and much more. All of this makes Github an important place to discover what is going, while also helping ensure what you are working on around your API is being discovered. I'm thinking it is time for a refresh of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">my Github guide for API management</a>, which I published a couple years back, and provide a fresh look at how the successful API providers are using Github.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/769658220159836160">I was included in a conversation the other day on Twitter about runtime API discovery</a>&nbsp;which reminded me of some thoughts I was processing before I walked away from work this summer, and before I dive back into the technical work, I wanted to refresh these thoughts and bring them to the surface. Blogging on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, and other channels which I publish my work on is how I work through these ideas out in the open, something that saves me expensive time and research bandwidth while I'm down in the trenches doing the coding and API definition work.</p>
<p><strong>The Wider Considerations Of What Is API Discovery</strong><br />Like APIs themselves, the concept of API discovery means a lot of different things to different people. I find that broadly it means actually&nbsp;finding an API (ie. searching on Google or ProgrammableWeb), but once you talk to a more technical API crowd, it often means the programmatic discovery of APIs. Ideally, this is something that is done using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">hypermedia suupported discovery</a>, but can also apply <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-02">a standard like JSON Home</a>, or <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. There are also many folks who are thinking about programmatic API discovery using OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and other common API specification formats.</p>
<p><strong>Some Thoughts On API Discovery At Runtime Today</strong><br />The conversation I was pulled into was between some of the leading minds in the area of not just defining what APIs are, but also how we truly can scale, and conduct API discovery, consumption, and evolution of our resources in a logical way. This discussion is pushing forward how our web, mobile, and other systems can discover, put to work, and roll with the changes that occur around critical API resources. How a human finds a single API for their use&nbsp;is one thing, but how a system and application finds a single API and puts it to work at runtime is a whole other conversation.</p>
<p><strong>The Hard Work To Define Runtime Discovery of APIs</strong><br />Separating out the human and programmatic discussions around what is involved with the runtime discovery of APIs is just the first&nbsp;line of challenges&nbsp;we face. The second layer of challenges is often about cutting through dogma and ideology&nbsp;around specific approaches to defining an API. The third layer I'd say is that this is just hard work of separating out the numerous differences between APIs, each often possessing their own nuances&nbsp;and differing approaches to authentication. As with every other aspect of APIs, the challenges are both technical, and human-centered, which slows expectations around the progress we make, but I trust the community will ultimately execute on this properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Even Harder Work To Define Runtime Discovery Of Many APIs</strong><br />While I'm actively participating in the current discussions around runtime API discovery using both hypermedia, as well as other approaches, I can't help but keep an eye our for the future of how we are going to do the same thing across many APIs--this is what I do as the API Evangelist. We have a lot of work ahead of us to make each individual API is discoverable at runtime, but we also have a significant amount of work to harmonize this at web scale across ALL APIs--which is why so many hypermedia evangelists are so passionate about their work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Technical Considerations Of API Discovery At Runtime</strong><br />98% of the discussions around API discovery at runtime focus on the technical--as it should be at this phase. Hypermedia design constraints, leading API definition specifications like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint,&nbsp;and API discovery formats like JSON Home and APIs.json are providing us with vehicles for moving this technical discussion forward. Ideally, our APIs should reflect the web, and when you land on the "home page" of an API, you should be presented with a wealth of links reflecting what the possibilities are (does your API have a navigation). Secondarily, if hypermedia is not desired or feasible, JSON Home and APIs.json should be considered, providing a machine readable index of what APIs are available within any domain, as well as additional details on what is possible using OpenAPISpec and API Blueprint.</p>
<p><strong>The Business Considerations of API Discovery At Runtime</strong><br />As technologists, we often fail when it comes to considering the business implications of our solutions, ranging from making sure to make money to keep them operational, all the way to industry-wide influences we should be aware of. I see many discussions amongst API specialists fall short in this area, which is why I started API Evangelist in the first place, and which is why I'm pushing these thoughts forward, and sharing with the public, even before they are fully baked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At runtime, the technical considerations of where an API is, how to authenticate, and what parameters and other details need to be clear. However, when you elevate this process to operate across many APIs, important business criteria also become important--things like what plans are available, what do API resources cost, and are there volume options available. The example I like to use in this scenario is from the world of SMS, and making runtime business decisions&nbsp;<a href="http://sms.stack.network/apis.json">across nine separate SMS APIs</a>.</p>
<p>At runtime, I may have different business concerns with each execution, even after I know where the APIs exist. Some SMS blasts I may want to use the cheapest provider, while in other campaigns I may choose to use a higher priced, more trusted provider. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/06/numerous-challenges-when-it-comes-to-comparing-even-similar-api-plans/">These considerations made by a human in 2016 can be difficult</a>, let alone having what we need to do in a programmatic way at runtime--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">something I've spent some cycles developing schemas and tools</a> to help me sort through the mess. I have been able to establish patterns across some of the more mature API areas like SMS, email, search, and compute, but we are going to have to wait for other areas to evolve before this is even feasible.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/why-i-labeled-my-research-api-plans-instead-of-api-pricing/">There is a reason why I call my research in this area API plans and not simple API pricing</a>. I feel this label reflects the future of business decisions we will have to make at runtime, which won't always be simply about pricing, and hopefully reflect our overall business plans--which are executed in real time at runtime in milliseconds. Sadly old ways of doing business by the enterprise continue to cast a shadow on this area, with companies hiding their pricing page behind firewalls, and not sharing the algorithm behind pricing decisions, let alone looking outward and following common industry patterns--beliefs around intellectual property and what is secret sauce will continue to hinder this all moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>The Political Considerations of API Discovery At Runtime</strong><br />Another area I have found myself paying attention to as the API Evangelist, beyond just the technology and business of APIs, is what I call&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">the politics of APIs</a>. Alongside the technical and business considerations, these often politically charged areas will have to be considered at runtime. Which API have the terms of service and privacy policies that reflect my companies strategy? Which API is the most reliable and stable? Can I get support if something fails? Is the long-term strategy of an API in alignment with our long-term strategy, or will they be gone within months due to funding and investment decisions (or lack of)? There are many political considerations that will have to be made at the programmatic level and included in runtime discovery and decision making around API integration(s).</p>
<p>Similar to the business considerations I have also invested some cycles into understanding the variability some providers are applying when it comes to the politics of APIs, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/customizable-terms-of-service-as-part-of-your-api-plans/">like variability in terms of service and pricing</a>, and how <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/after-combining-my-api-plans-pricing-and-rating-research-i-see-hints-of-an-api-industry-economic-engine/">pricing, plan availability, availability, stability, and other ranking criteria can be made more machine readable and applied at runtime</a>. As with the business concerns around API integration, there are many obstacles present when we are trying to make sense of the political impact at runtime. As more API providers emerge which are not resistant to sharing their API plans, I am able to document the variables at play in these algorithms, and share&nbsp;with the wider industry, but alas, many companies are holding these elements too close to their chest for the conversation to move forward in a healthy manner.</p>
<p>It is easy to think about the political runtime decisions that need to be made around APIs as purely being about terms of service, but there are much more grander considerations emerging, like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/your-api-access-replicated-into-multiple-regions-around-the-globe-for-additional-charge/">which country and region we deploy into</a>, and r<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/27/politics-of-apis-talk-of-api-driven-regulation-is-increasing/">egulatory considerations that will have to be followed</a>&nbsp;when putting API resources to work, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/02/direct-government-connection-into-internet-of-things-devices-like-we-are-seeing-with-drones/">possibly injected at runtime like we are seeing within the drone space</a>. Like terms of service are guiding almost everything we do online today, the politics of APIs will govern the runtime decisions that are made in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Discovery And Considering The Technical, Business And Political Decisions Needed At Runtime</strong><br />This is just a glimpse at the long road we have ahead of us when it comes to truly reaching the API economy we all like to talk about in the sector. Unfortunately, there are also many obstacles in the way of us getting to this possible future. We have to increase our investment in hypermedia and web-centric API solutions, and not just vendor-driven API solutions if we are going to move down this road. We have to be more transparent about our API plans, pricing, and the variables that go into the human and algorithmic business decisions that are driving our API platforms. We also have to start having honest discussions about the terms of service, privacy policies, service level agreements, and regulation that are increasingly defining the API space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am optimistic that we can move forward on all of this, but current beliefs around what is intellectual property, something that is fueled by venture capital, and further set back by legal struggles like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/22/what-we-can-do-to-make-a-difference-in-the-wake-of-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case/">the Oracle v Google API copyright case</a> are seriously hurting us. The definition of your API is not IP or secret sauce. Your pricing and plan variables are not your secret sauce, and should not be hidden behind the firewall in the Internet age--regardless of your enterprise sales belief. The only way that we are going to continue meaningful automation of the growing number of resources being made available via APIs using Internet technology, is to share vital metadata out in the open, so we can make sure we are all making proper, consistent decisions at runtime--not just technically, but also the right business and political decisions that will make the API economy go round.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-life-line-rescue.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>In the Silicon Valley rat race users often become collateral damage amidst the entrepreneurial&nbsp;quest to get rich building the next killer startup. I've heard many startups like Snapchat and Pinterest state the reason they don't want to do APIs, is they don't want developers building unwanted&nbsp;applications&nbsp;on their services, something that stems from a mix of not understanding modern approaches to API management, and not really thinking about their end-users needs (both these companies now have APIs but for different reasons).</p>
<p>I am sure that these platforms are often more concerned with locking in their userbase, then allowing them to be able to migrate their data, content, and other media off the platform for their own interests and protection. As companies race forward towards their exits, or in many cases their&nbsp;implosions, users often lose everything that they have published on a platform, many times even if they've been paying for the service.</p>
<p>An API is not always meant just for developers to build the next killer&nbsp;website&nbsp;and mobile applications integration on top of an API that benefits themselves, and the platform. Sometimes these applications are focused on providing data portability, syncing, and important backup solutions for users--allowing them to minimize the damage in their personal and professional worlds when things go wrong with startups. While data portability and data dumps can alleviate some of this, often times what they produce is unusable, and an API often allows for more usable real world possibilities.</p>
<p>As an API provider, you do not have to approve every developer and application that requests access. If an application is in direct competition or does not benefit your platform, and its users--you can say no. I encourage ALL platforms to have a public presence for their APIs (you know you have them) and incentivize developers to build data portability, syncing, and backup solutions for users. APIs are not just for encouraging developers to build the next killer startup, sometimes they will just help protect your users from when things go wrong with your startup vision--make sure and think beyond just your desires&nbsp;and remember that there are people who depend on your service.</p>

<p>In an effort to help folks understand the many layers of just exactly what is an API and how people are using them, I'm going to emphasize (again) the importance of sharing your API definition publicly. I'm not going to talk about why you should have an API definition for your API, if you need a reason, <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/news/">go look at the growing number of ways that API definitions are driving a modern API life cycle-</a>-this post is about making sure you are sharing it properly once you have one crafted.</p>
<p>I'm increasingly stumbling across OpenAPI Spec-driven Swagger UI documentation for APIs which I then have to fire up my Chrome developer tools to reverse engineer the path of the OpenAPI Spec--this is dumb. If you have an API definition available for your API, make sure it is available in a prominent location within your API portal, preferably&nbsp;using an easy-to-find icon and supporting link.</p>
<p>Your API definition isn't just driving your API documentation. They are being used for <a href="http://apis.io">API discovery search engines like APIs.io</a>, to get up and running in API clients like Postman, and to help me monitor, test, and troubleshoot my API integrations using Runscope. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please stop hiding them!</span>&nbsp;I know many of you think this is some secret sauce, but it isn't. You should be proudly sharing your definitions, and making them available to your consumers with one click, so they can more quickly integrate, as well as successfully manage their ongoing integration.</p>

<p>I was going through some of the Twitter feeds of the APIs that I track on&nbsp;and noticed Spotify's team providing support to some of their API users with quick links / anchors to the answers in their API user guide available at&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.spotify.com">developer.spotify.com</a>. This might sound trivial, but having an arsenal of these links, so you can tweet out like Spotify does can be a real time saver.</p>

<p>This is pretty easy to do with a well-planned API portal&nbsp;and developer resources&nbsp;but is something you can rapidly add / change to using a frequently asked questions page for your API. The trick is to make sure you have anchors to the specific areas you are looking to reference when providing support for your community.</p>
<p>Another benefit of doing this beyond just developer support is in the name of marketing and evangelism. I'm often looking for specific concepts and topics to link to in my stories, and if an API doesn't have a dedicated page&nbsp;or an anchor for it, I won't link it--I do not want my readers to have to dig for anything. The trick here is you need to think like your consumers, and not just wear your provider's hat all the time.</p>
<p>When crafting your API portal, and supporting resources make sure you provide anchors for the most requested resources and other information related to API operations, and keep the links handy so you can use across all your support and marketing channels.</p>

<p>I am blessed to have people in the space who have supported what I do for the last six years. Companies like 3Scale, Restlet, WSO2, Cloud Elements, and others have consistently helped me make ends meet. Numerous individuals stepped up in May to help me make it through the summer--expecting nothing in return, except that I continue being the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I do API Evangelist because I enjoy staying in tune with the fast-growing landscape of industries being touched by APIs. I believe in what is possible when individuals, companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies embark on their API journey (aka digital transformation). I do not operate as the API Evangelist to sell you a product, service, or to get rich. Don't get me wrong, I do ok, but I definitely am not getting rich--all I got is the domain, Twitter account, and my stories.</p>
<p>The prioritization of sales and profits over what is really important in the space always blows my mind, but rarely ever surprises me. I find myself regularly worrying about the companies and individuals&nbsp;who focus on sales over actual transformation, but I have to admit my friend&nbsp;<a href="http://dev.haufe.com/state-of-our-api-strategy/">Holger Reinhardt's post about the motivations behind their Wicked (cool) open source API management</a>&nbsp;made me chuckle. Their API management work was in response to a sales lead that <em>"felt that our focus on &lsquo;just enough API management&rsquo; was too narrow and not addressing the larger needs (and bigger deal) of the &lsquo;Digital Transformation&rsquo; of the </em>Haufe<em> Group."</em> &lt;&lt; I LOVE IT!!!</p>
<p>I've been through hundreds of enterprise sales pitches, sitting on both sides of the table, and experiencing this bullshit song and dance over and over was one of the catalysts for leaving working with SAP in 2010 and starting API Evangelist. I just wanted to tell honest, real stories about the impact technology could make--not scam someone into signing a two or three-year contract, or be duped by a vendor into doing the same. Granted, not all sales people are scammers, but if you are in the business, you know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>All I can say is I am very glad I do not have to live in a sales deal-driven world&nbsp;and I refuse to go back. To brag a little, I know that a significant portion of my readers are enterprise. People who work at IBM, SAP, Oracle, SalesForce, Microsoft, Capital One, and on, and on read my blog, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I want you all to know:</span>&nbsp;That NONE of your deal sizes are too big, or too small to be reading my blog--I give a shit about all of you. However, maybe you could let me know what your expected budget might be? ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://stripe.com/docs">I am digging Stripes new documentation release, and specifically their interactive API documentation walkthrough</a>. The new "try now" section of their documentation provides an evolve look at what is possible when it comes to providing your API consumers the documentation they need to get up and running.</p>
<p>The new documentation provides not just a code example of processing a credit card charge, they walk you through accepting a credit card, creating a new customer, charge the card, establish a recurring plan, and establishing a recurring customer subscription.</p>
<p><a href="https://stripe.com/docs"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/stripe-interactive-documentation.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>The walkthrough is simple, informative, and helpful. It helps you understand the concepts at play when integrating with the Stripe API, in a language agnostic way. I was super impressed with the ability to copy, paste, and run the curl commands at the command line, and when I came back to the browser--it had moved to the next step in the walkthrough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Stripe API documentation walkthrough is the most sophisticated movement forward in API documentation I've seen since Swagger UI. It isn't just documentation, in an interactive way--it walks you through each step, bordering on what I'd consider API curriculum. All without needing an actual live token--I wasn't even logged in. Additionally, Stripe made sure <a href="https://twitter.com/stripe/status/766303730949959680">they Tweeted out the changes&nbsp;and included a slick GIF to demonstrate the new interactive capabilities of their documentation</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Aug 2016</span>
        <p>I am always amazed at how difficult it can be to obtain the API keys, or fire up an initial set of oAuth tokens when kicking the tires on a new API. I would also say that I am also regularly impressed the distance API providers will go to help API consumers obtain the keys they need to make a successful API call.</p>
<p>One example of this is present in the <a href="https://stripe.com/docs">new Stripe API documentation</a>. Their new code samples give you a slick little alert every time you see a demo key and mouse over. The alert gives you a quick link to log in and obtain the keys you need to make an actual call.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/stripe-document-keys.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>While I like this approach, I also &nbsp;like the way Twitter does this&nbsp;and gives me a dropdown listing all of my applications, allowing me to choose from any of my current apps I have registered--maybe it is something that could be merged?</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/GET_statuses_mentions_timeline_twitter_developers.png" alt="" width="75%" /></p>
<p>Both are great examples of API providers going the extra distance to make sure you understand how to authenticate with an API, and get your API keys and OAuth tokens. If you know of other good examples of how API providers are working to make sure authentication is as frictionless as possible, making API keys and oAuth tokens more accessible directly within API docs--let me know.</p>
<p>This is an area I think interactive documentation has made significantly easier, but things have seemed to stagnate in this area. It is definitely an area I'd like to see move forward, eventually providing cross-API provider solutions that developers can put to use.</p>

<p>I was just learning about <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/announcing-password-breach-detection/">Auth0's new password breach detection service</a>, adding to the numerous reasons why you'd use their authentication service, instead of going at it on your own. It's an important concept I wanted to write about so that it was added to my research, and present in my thinking around API <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com">authentication</a> and <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">security</a> going forward.</p>
<p>Keeping an eye out for important identity and authentication related information used as part of my API consumption is a lot of work--it is something that I'd love to see more platforms assist me with. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/07/time-to-remove-or-rotate-your-api-access-keys/">I've written about AWS communicating with me around my API keys</a>, and I could see an API key and token management solution be built on top of their&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/kms/">AWS Key Management Service</a>. I've also received emails from Github about my OAuth token that show up in a public repo (happened once ;-( ).</p>
<p>Many application developers do not have the discipline to always manage API keys &amp; tokens in a safe and secure way (guilty). It seems like something that could become default for API providers--if you issue keys and tokens, then maybe you should be helping consumers keep an eye out for them on the open Internet &lt;&lt; Which smells like an opportunity for some API-focused security startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you seen any other API providers provide key and token monitoring services? Is there anything that you do as an API consumer to keep an eye out for your own keys and tokens? Search for them on Github via the API? Manually search on Google? I am curious to learn more about what people are doing to manage their API keys and tokens.</p>

<p>Every API provider will have slightly different needs, but there are definitely some common patterns which providers should be considering as they are kicking off their API presence, or looking to expand an existing platform. While there are some dissenting opinions on this subject, many API providers provide a range of specific language, mobile, and platform SDKs for their developers to put to use when integrating with their platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A common approach I see from API providers when it comes to managing their SDKs is to break out their mobile SDKs into their own section, which <a href="http://ap.bandwidth.com/">the communications API platform Bandwidth has a good example of</a>. Bandwidth provides iOS and Android SDKs&nbsp;and provides a <a href="http://ap.bandwidth.com/docs/mobile-sdk/mobile-quickstart-guide/">mobile SDK quick start guide</a>, to help developers get up and going. This approach provides their mobile developers a dedicated page to get at available SDKs, as well as other mobile-focused resources that will make integration as frictionless as possible.</p>
<p>Unless your anti-SDK, you should at least have a dedicated page for all your available&nbsp;SDK. I would also consider putting all of them on Github, where you will gain the network effect brought by managing your SDKs on the social coding platform. Then when it makes sense, also consider breaking out a dedicated mobile SDK page like Bandwidth--I will also work on a roundup of other providers who have similar pages,&nbsp;to help understand a wide variety of approaches when it comes to mobile SDK management.</p>

<p>Definitely, something to consider. In the current online environment, it might become quite a pain in the ass to maintain an anonymous app, as John points out. This is one reason I work to publish <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/24/excel-and-csv-conversion-to-json-and-xml-in-javascript-that-runs-100-on-github/">my API tooling as standalone JavaScript applications</a>, which run 100% on Github. First off they run on Github infrastructure, and use Github's bandwidth. Second, this type of app is forkable, and people can choose to run them wherever they desire--on Github, or any other site they wish.</p>
<p>I'll keep an eye out for other anonymous apps built on top of API service providers, or individual APIs--maybe there are other successful models out there, or maybe there is also some other cautionary tales we should hear.</p>

<p>I am going through all of my&nbsp;online accounts changing passwords, and one of the things I do along the way is check which applications have access to my digital self. Increasingly my accounts have two dimensions of applications: 1) apps I have created to allow me to make API calls for my system(s) 2) apps I have given access to any account using OAuth. This is a process that can take quite a bit of time, something that is only going to grow in coming years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quickest example of this in the wild is Twitter. I have <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/applications">authorized 3rd party applications to access my account</a>, and I have also <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/">developed my own applications</a>, which have various types of access to my profile--this is how I automate my Tweets, profiling of the space, etc. I'm regularly deleting apps from both of these dimensions, which I tend to add as I test new services, and build prototypes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really wish the platforms I depend on would allow me to manage my internal and 3rd party applications via an API. If I could aggregate applications across all the accounts I depend on, manage the details of these applications (including keys &amp; tokens), and add and remove them as I need--that would be awesome! If nothing else, maybe this will put the bug in your ear to consider this for your own world, and you can help put the pressure on existing API providers to open up oAuth and app management APIs for us to help automate our operations.</p>

Even with this unfinished status, there are some unfinished or broken elements that are just unacceptable--one of these is the lack of an Atom feed for my blog.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/CloudFlare_-_The_web_performance___security_company.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I see a lot of companies doing things with APIs, and I often find myself struggling to find companies who are doing important things that benefit the community, have a coherent business model, and providing clear value via their services. In the drive to obtain VC funding, or after several&nbsp;rounds of funding, many companies seem to forget who they are, slowly stop doing anything important (ie. research, open source, etc.) with their platform, and seem to just focus on just making money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One phrase I hear a lot from folks in the space is, "it's just business", and that I should stop expecting altruistic behavior around APIs, and within the business sectors which they are impacting--APIs are about making money, and building businesses hippie! Often times I begin to fall for the gaslighting I experience from some in the API space, then I engage with services like CloudFlare.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">I use CloudFlare for all my DNS</a>, but I also stay in tune with their operations because of what they do to lead the&nbsp;DNS space, and because of their <a href="https://api.cloudflare.com/">DNS API</a>. I was going to craft this post after reading their blog post on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-cuban-cdn/">the Cuban CDN</a>, then I read their post on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/evenly-distributed-future/">an evenly distributed future</a>, and I'm renewed with hope that the web just might be ok--things might not be as dark as they feel sometimes.</p>
<p>I follow what CloudFlare is doing because their work represents the frontline of the API sector--<a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com">DNS</a>. This makes it not just about DNS, it also becomes about security, and potentially one of the most frightening layers of security--the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS). CloudFlare clearly get DNS, and care so much that they have become super passionate about understanding the web as it exists (as messy as it is), and pushing the conversation forward when it comes to DNS, performance, and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CloudFlare makes DNS accessible for me, and for other less-technical professionals like my partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), who also uses CloudFlare to manage her DNS, with no assistance from me. I operated my own DNS servers from 1998 until 2013, and it is something that I will never do again, as long as CloudFlare exists. CloudFlare knows their stuff&nbsp;and they help me keep the frontline of my domains healthy and secure.</p>
<p>There are a number of companies I look up to in the space, and <a href="http://cloudflare.com">CloudFlare</a> is one of them. For me, they prove that you can build a real business, do important work that moves the web forward, be passionate about what you do, while also&nbsp;being transparent&nbsp;along the way. Knowing this is possible keeps me going forward with my own research, and optimistic that this experiment we call the web might actually survive.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Aug 2016</span>

<p>I have long been a proponent of using <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a>, not just because you can deploy interactive API documentation, but because they open up almost every other stop along the API life cycle. Meaning, if you have an OpenAPI Spec definition for your API you can also generate SDKs using APIMATIC, and API monitors using Runscope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the examples I reference often is the <a href="https://getsandbox.com">API Sandbox solution appropriately named Sandbox</a>. One of the reasons I use Sandbox in this way is that API mocking using API definitions is a pretty easy concept for developers to wrap their heads around, but also because their home page is pretty clear in articulating the opportunities opened up for your API when you have machine-readable definitions available.</p>
<p>Their opening text says it well, helping you understand that because you have API definitions you can "accelerate application development",&nbsp;and provide "quick and easy mock RESTful API and SOAP webservices". The presence of common API definition icons including API Blueprint, OpenAPI Spec, RAML, and WSDL then provide a visual re-enforcement for the concept.</p>
<p>Sandbox opens up mocking and sandbox capabilities, which I lump together under one umbrella which I call <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">API virtualization</a>. You can easily <a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview">create, manage, and destroy sandboxes for your APIs using their API, and your API definitions</a>. I envision API providers following <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/19/providing-multiple-types-of-api-sandboxes-to-develop-against/">Cisco's lead and having any number of different types of sandboxes running for developers to put to work, using server virtualization</a>&nbsp;(virtualization on virtualization).</p>
<p>With the evolution of API definition-driven solutions like Sandbox for providing virtualized instances of your APIs, there really isn't any excuse for not having a sandbox for your API. For device focused APIs, a sandbox is essential, but even for web and mobile-focused APIs you should be providing places for your API consumers to play, and not requiring them to code against production environments by default.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Aug 2016</span>
        <p>Having quotes from your customers on your company website is a no-brainer. Finding the best examples of brands and companies putting your valuable service, or tool to work demonstrates it has value, and that people are using it.</p>
<p>While playing around with a new chrome add-on reverse engineering tool called&nbsp;<a href="http://crxextractor.com/">CRX Extractor</a>, I noticed the quote at the bottom of their page:</p>
<p><a href="http://crxextractor.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Get__CRX_Chrome_Extension_file__it_s_source_code_and_download__CRX_to_your_computer_.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>They win in my book for having a funny, but also pretty realistic endorsement for why you should be using a product. I'm using the tool to better understand how browser add-ons are putting APIs to work&nbsp;and evolve my own creations as well, but I can see reverse engineering them to make sure they are secure is a pretty important aspect of operating your company securely online.</p>
<p>When it comes to marketing your API, make sure you have quotes from smart people, as well as brands that people know, makes sense, but I would also add that making them funny, and allowing ourselves to laugh along the way can make a significant impact with the right people as well</p>

<p>One of the reasons why crafting API definitions like <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> for our APIs, and openly sharing them on the web, is so that the pattern will get used, and reused by other API providers. That might sound scary to some companies, but really that is what you want--your API design used across an industry. Your API definition is not your IP, it is the magic behind your API, and the way you approach all the supporting elements around your API operations.</p>
<p>There are numerous industries where I'd like to see a common API definition emerge, and get reused, and one of the more obvious ones is in the area of building permits. <a href="http://www.openpermit.org/docs/index.html">Open Permit</a> has shared their API definition, by <a href="http://www.openpermit.org/docs/index.html">publishing the OpenAPI Spec to drive their Swagger UI documentation</a>. This is a great example of an API definition that should be emulated across the industry&nbsp;because the money to be made is not around the API design, but the portion of our economy that the API will fuel when it is in operation.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if all cities, contractors, and vendors who service the construction industry could put APIs to use, and even better, put common patterns to use? If you have ever tried to build something residential or commercial&nbsp;and had to pull a permit, you understand. This is one industry where APIs need to be unleashed, and we need to make sure we share all possible API definitions&nbsp;so that they can get used, and we aren't ever re-inventing the wheel.</p>

<p>I was introduced to a new <a href="http://wicked.haufe.io/index.html">open source, Dockerized API operations solution called Wicked</a>, that was developed by the integrated cloud and desktop solutions provider, the <a href="http://haufe.com">Haufe Group</a>. There are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">a number of open source API management solutions out there</a>, and an even greater number of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/tools/framework/">API frameworks that can help you deploy your APIs</a>, but Wicked is the first to span several areas of the API life cycle including <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com">DNS</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com">containers</a>, <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com">authentication</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">documentation</a>,</p>
<p><strong>Built On Existing Open Source API Gateway</strong><br />The Haufe Group built the core of Wicked on top of an existing open source API management solution, further augmenting, evolving, and improving on an existing solution:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Mashape/kong">Kong API Gateway</a></strong> - Use Mashape Kong to protect and proxy your backend APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>Why reinvent the wheel? It makes sense to build on existing solutions for API management, developing on top of what is already being used by API architects and developers.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simple Developer Onboarding<br /></strong>Wicked employs the latest approaches to allowing developers to onboard with an API, sticking to what is already working for API providers, and what developers expect:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authenticate with email and password - </strong>Let your users sign up with their email address and a password. Email addresses will be automatically validated by sending out verification emails.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication with GitHub or Google - </strong>You may also configure signup and login using OAuth2 with GitHub and/or Google. These identities will be treated as 'verified' automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like that they let you use Github or Google on top of the standard email and password setup. I've been aggregating all my personal API developer accounts under my single @kinlane Github account, and when I set up a business account I authenticate using my @apievangelist Github account--more API providers should offer this, to help us all organize our accounts.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using Modern API Authentication<br /></strong>There are a handful of proven approaches out there for allowing developers to authenticate against an API, and Wicked allows for two of the most common&nbsp;approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Key or OAuth 2 -</strong> Out of the box, wicked enables fast securing of your API using API Key authentication or OAuth 2 Client Credentials Flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allowing for either API key or OAuth will cover 75% of the use cases companies are looking for when securing their digital resources. Most public resources will just need an API key which acts as the identifier, but for personally identifiable information, OAuth is essential.</p>
<p><strong>Enabling API Service Composition<br /></strong>Every successful API provider knows that you don't provide the same access for all developers, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/03/what-is-api-service-composition/">service composition</a> is an essential way to approach this--Wicked provides the essentials in this area:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implement Rate Limiting -</strong> Using Mashape Kong's rich functionality, implement rate limiting for your APIs, wherever needed.</li>
<li><strong>Subscription Plans - </strong>API definitions can be associated with subscription plans, which can carry additional settings, e.g. different rate limits for different users.</li>
<li><strong>Group based rights to APIs -</strong> Define custom user groups and assign those groups to users in order to limit access to specific APIs to specific groups. The Admin group can also be assigned.</li>
<li><strong>Group based rights to custom content -</strong> The content section also supports group-based access, e.g. to How-tos or tutorials.</li>
<li><strong>Subscription Approval Workflow - </strong>API Plans can be configured to require an approval of subscription; you will be sent an email to a predefined email address to the approval request.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://wicked.haufe.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/wicked-architecture-components.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While I am not a big fan of API approval workflows, as I prefer resources to be self-service, I was intrigued by the email approval feature, allowing for a (hopefully) frictionless onboarding flow that can add an additional layer of security for our most valuable of API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Providing The Necessary Application Mangement<br /></strong>APIs are all about developing applications, and Wicked allows for the identification of apps, and the incorporation of these apps into the service composition workflow:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Concept -</strong> In order to subscribe to an API, a user needs to create an application (which is the client of the API); APIs are coupled with applications, not users.</li>
<li><strong>Application Owner Roles -</strong> Applications can be shared among users, using different roles on the application: Admin/Owner, Collaborator, and Reader.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users may have one or many apps which integrate with one or many APIs. This many to many relationships provide a robust way to manage API consumers, and potentially the multiple applications which they will develop.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interactive API Documentation<br /></strong>No API in 2016 is complete unless it has interactive documentation, and Wicked sticks with what works in this area and provides documentation for APIs using <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swagger UI Integration </strong>- In order to view the APIs in more detail, wicked has integrated Swagger UI, with configurable direct access to the backend services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using open API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, as well as providing up-to-date interactive API documentation is pretty much much the new baseline for APIs these days, and Wicked keeps up.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist-site/blog/docker-swarm-hero2.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Scalable Deployment<br /></strong>Next, as if that wasn't enough, you get te scalable deployment of APIs using Docker. Wicked weaves together the DNS, deployment, and management of your APIs, and allows for modular deploy with Docker, and scaling with Docker Compose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker Deployment -</strong> The entire APIm solution is deployed using docker; everything runs in docker, enabling deployments to whatever infrastructure supports it.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling With Docker Compose -</strong> By using docker-compose, the deployment of your API Management solution can be easily scaled to use multiple instances of Kong, behind a powerful HAproxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This type of API deployment is how all APIs will be deployed in the future. We have a lot of work ahead of us when it comes to decoupling our legacy infrastructure, but Wicked gives us the tools we need to get this done--providing a fuller open source stack which we can more confidently bake into our infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>There are two things that stand out for me about Wicked. 1) It spans deployment and management in a scalable way 2) It is built using the best of breed open source tooling, specifications, and standards available out there right now--Kong, HAproxy, OpenAPI Spec, Swagger UI, and Docker.</p>
<p>I'm just getting going with Wicked. It makes me happy to see API operations solutions like this come together. I'm just getting going reviewing the stack, and <a href="http://dev.haufe.com/state-of-our-api-strategy/">I am really liking the&nbsp;motivations behind why they did it</a>, and how they are doing it--more to come.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/aggregation-trend.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are two distinct types of APIs I keep an eye on. One is what I call my life cycle APIs, which are the APIs of the service providers who are selling services and tools to API providers and developers. The second category is what I call my stack network, and these are the individual API providers, who offer a wide range of API resources--<a href="http://apievangelist.com">you can find both of these types on the home page of API Evangelist</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 50+ life cycle APIs I track on can be used by companies to manage almost every stop along a modern API life cycle. In theory, all of these service providers have APIs. In reality, they do, but they do not practice what they preach&nbsp;and often do not make their APIs easily discoverable. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/27/which-api-service-providers-across-the-20-areas-i-track-on-have-apis/">I have said it a thousand times before--if you sell online services to API providers, you should have an API</a>. Period.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, I will have profiled all of the companies included in my API life cycle research, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/04/look-across-my-api-monitoring-api-methods-by-grouping-them-using-tag/">like I did for API monitoring</a>, and be able to provide a comprehensive API stack across all the providers for all stops along the life cycle. Ideally, each provider would have their own OpenAPI spec, but I'm still getting many of them to make their APIs public, convincing them of the importance of also having an API definition for their API will come next. Then I'll <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/14/modern-api-service-providers-need-to-speak-common-api-definition-formats/">continue pushing on them to allow for the import / export of API definitions</a>, so their customers can more easily get up and running with their services--if you need an example of this in the wild, <a href="https://getsandbox.com/">take a look at Sandbox</a>, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/08/example-of-api-service-providers-making-onboarding-with-services-easier-using-api-definitions/">over at API Metrics</a>.</p>
<p>I'd love to see someone take this idea and run with it beyond what I'm able to do as a one-man act. There are <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">numerous API aggregation solutions already out there</a> for financial, healthcare, images, documents, and more. What about an aggregated API across providers in the name of DevOps or microservices orchestration? An aggregated solution would allow you to automate defining of your APIs in multiple formats with API Transformer, deploy them using Docker or Heroku APIs, manage with 3Scale APIs, deploy sandboxes with Sandbox, monitor with Runscope, and almost every other stop along the life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure I've written this one up before, but I couldn't find it, so I wanted to get a fresh post up on the subject. With all the agile, orchestration, DevOps, microservices, continuous integration goingz on, having a coherent, cross-vendor API stack, and a suite of the usual analytics, billing, and other vital middleware services just makes sense. Let me know when you get up and running, and I'll send over my bank account information for the royalty payments. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-layers-opening.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wrote the other day <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/08/overlay-api-data-on-satellite-imagery-then-make-available-again-via-api/">about the interesting opportunity opening up within the satellite imagery API layer</a>, and earlier about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/05/airmap-is-positioning-itself-to-be-a-critical-api-broker-for-the-drone-industry/">similar opportunity that is being expanded within the fast growing dimension of our world being opened up with drones</a>. Layers within maps are nothing new, and is something that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/20/history-of-apis/">Google has pushed forward early on in the history of APIs with Google Maps</a>, but I feel is further being expanding on as APIs open new dimensions like satellites and drones. Then being further expanded on by adding API access to each layer for augmenting, and injecting other valuable API resources into these newly created API dimensions.</p>
<p>Let's see if I can successful describe the multiple API dimensions being opened up here. APIs are providing access to maps of our physical world, whether it is on the ground, from the air with drones, or from space with satellites, and these API-driven maps have layers, which are also made available via APIs, allowing other API driven resources like weather, forest fires, restricted spaces, and temporary or permanent elements are being injected. Once injected, these API-driven mapping resources with API injected resources are also being made available via APIs, providing entirely new, and specialized resources--that is a lot of APIs!</p>
<p>I am not even touching on the physical devices who put these maps to work also possessing APIs, like the drones, GPS units, cars, etc. This is just the expanding layer that is opening up via the multitude of API driven mapping resources&nbsp;and is further expanded when you look at the video layer which drones, mobile phones, automobiles, security cameras, and other Internet-connected devices are opening up. Drones, automobiles, and others will share layers with the mapping resources, but other video resources also will possess their own layers for augmenting the experience on the web, mobile, and television.</p>
<p>The part of this that is really striking to me isn't just the overlapping layers between mapping, video, and other channels, it is the overlap between our physical and virtual worlds. Think what Pokemon Go has done for gaming, but now consider drones, consumer automobiles, as well as commercial fleets. It can be very difficult to wrap your mind around the different dimensions&nbsp;of opportunities opening up, but it doesn't take much imagination to understand that there is a growing opportunity for APIs to thrive in this expanding universe.</p>

<p>Sharing your platform's road map with the public, and your community is an often overlooked aspect of API operations&nbsp;but is one that can go a long way to communicate your plans for the future with your community. This is why <a href="http://road-map.apievangelist.com/">I carved the concept out into its own research area, to help me better understand how the successful API providers</a>, as well as API service providers are publishing, sharing, and communicating around their road map.</p>
<p>One example of this recently is out of the API documentation service provider Readme.io, who didn't just <a href="http://readme.io/roadmap/">publish a nice, simple, and clean road map for their platform</a>, they also <a href="https://blog.readme.io/our-new-public-product-roadmap/">told the story of the process</a>. This is a great way to announce that you have a road map for the platform but is also something you should repeat as often as possible, telling the story of what you just added to the road map and as much detail on why.</p>
<p>Sharing your road map, and the story behind goes a long way in lowering the anxiety around what the future holds for your API consumers, something that lets them know that you care about them enough to share what you have planned. In my opinion, a road map for an API platform shows that you have empathy for your community, and is something I like to encourage and support, by showcasing the process of your road map storytelling here on my blog when I can.</p>

<p>I was reading the post from <a href="https://socrata.com">open data service provider Socrata</a> about "<a href="https://socrata.com/blog/putting-citizens-first/">putting citizens first</a>"&nbsp;when it comes to opening up city, county, state, and federal government data. One of the headlines they showcased was <em>"Texas overhauls open data portal, prioritizes commonly requested info"</em>--which is a pretty sensible thing to consider for not just government, but also companies thinking about what to open next.</p>
<p>First, let me emphasize that I am talking about open data that is already published on the web in another format (or should be). What the State of Texas is doing is <a href="http://low.hanging.fruit.apievangelist.com/">what I call the low-hanging fruit for API deployment</a>--if it is on your website, it should also be available in a machine-readable&nbsp;format. Ideally, you offer HTML, as well as JSON, XML, and other relevant formats side by side within a single domain using <a href="http://restlet.com/blog/2015/12/10/understanding-http-content-negotiation/">content negotiation</a>, but no matter how you accomplish it, the priority is making sure that commonly requested information is accessible to those who need it.</p>
<p>It is a shame that Texas is only now considering this with the latest revision of their portal, ideally government agencies and companies would be applying this way of thinking by default. If it is on your website as HTML, most likely it has already been deemed important, which is why it was made self-service on the open web in the first place. If you are planning on deploying an API or open data portal, and you are just wondering where you should start, make sure to learn from the State of Texas, and prioritize the commonly requested information.</p>

<p>I am coming across more API providers who have carved off specific "skills" derived from their API, and offering up as part of the latest&nbsp;push to acquire new users on Slack or Facebook. Services like Github, Heroku, and Runscope that API providers&nbsp;and developers are putting to work increasingly have bots they employ, extending their API driven solutions to Slack and Facebook.</p>
<p>Alongside having an application gallery, and having an iPaaS solution showcase, maybe it's time to start having a dedicated page to showcase the bot solutions that are built on your API. Of course, these would start with your own bot solutions, but like application galleries, you could have bots that were built within your community as well.</p>
<p>I'm not going to add a dedicated&nbsp;bot showcase page until I've seen at least a handful in the wild, but I like documenting these things as I think of them. It gives me some dates to better understand at which point did certain things in the API universe begin expanding (or not). Also if you are doing a lot of bot development around your API, or maybe your community is, it might be the little nudge you need to be one of the first APIs out there with a dedicated bot showcase page.</p>

<p>I'm pretty skeptical about many of the reasons behind why companies are connecting devices to the Internet using APIs--I am just not convinced this is the best idea when we already have so many security issues with the standard, and mobile web. Regardless, I'm constantly working to understand the motivation behind a company's motivation to do APIs, as well as what they are telling their customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each of the industrial controllers "includes&nbsp;an HTTP/HTTPS server and RESTful API, compatible with any programming language that supports JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)". In my opinion, this reflects the wider API space that is serving the web and mobile objectives, allowing for integration using any programming language, as well as opening up the devices to API orchestration solutions using <a href="http://ipaas.apievangelist.com">iPaaS</a>, and the variety of other API service provider solutions available in the market.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think using web technology is inexpensive, and avoids the usage of proprietary, vendor specific solutions. As the ability to offer up a web server on any physical object becomes easier and cheaper, the usage of web APIs to interact, integrate, and orchestrate around physical objects will only increase, for better or worse.</p>

<p>The APIs which have seen the greatest adoption across the API space, always provide the functionality that developers are needed in their applications. It is either because the platform is already in use by their users (ie. Twitter, Facebook), or just provides the core feature that is required (ie. SMS, Email). There are an unprecedented number of high-value APIs out there, but I think many API providers still struggle when it comes to defining them in a way that speaks to the needs that web, mobile, and device app developers will be needing.</p>
<p>I have explored this topic before, discussing the importance of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/23/exposing-the-meaningful-skills-our-apis-possess-for-use-in-the-next-gen-messaging-and-voice-apps/">exposing the meaningful skills our APIs possess for use in the next generation of messaging and voice apps</a>, as well as asking <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/14/do-my-apis-have-the-skills-they-need-to-compete-in-a-voice-and-bot-enabled-world/">whether or not our APIs have the skills they need in a voice and bot enabled world</a>. I am not 100% behind the concept that voice and bots are the future, but I am 100% behind defining our API resources in a way that immediately delivers value&nbsp;like they are doing in these environments.</p>
<p>The approach used by Alexa, when it comes to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit">developing "skills"</a> is an important concept for other API providers to consider. Even if you aren't targeting voice enablement with your APIs, the model provides many positive characteristics you should be emulating in your API design, helping you deliver more meaningful APIs. For me, thinking in terms of the skills that your APIs should be enabling, better reflects the API journey, where we move beyond just database and other very technical resources, and providing the meaningful skills developers need for success, and end-users (aka humans) are desiring.</p>

<p>My "fellow"&nbsp;<a href="https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/fellows">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>&nbsp;Mollie Ruskin (<a href="https://twitter.com/mollieruskin">@mollieruskin</a>), was doing some work with veterans recently and stumbled across a pretty disturbing example of how racial bias is being baked into the algorithms that are driving our online, and increasingly offline worlds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This morning I was searching #&lrm;Google for images of #&lrm;Veterans for a project. I stumbled upon a photographer who had taken hundreds of beautiful photographs of Veterans all in the same style.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I clicked on a few striking portraits...I quickly noticed something very troubling.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When doing image searches, I often use the 'related images' feature to uncover more pictures relevant to what I'm hunting for, as was the </em>case this time<em> around. Where most of the photos returned related images of other veterans, one photo of a smiling black male vet in his uniform fatigues, garnered a series of related images that were all mugshots of CRIMINALS.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The tools we use to fuel our </em>21st century<em> lives are not the seemingly neutral blank slates we imagine them to be. They are architected and shaped by people, informed by our conscious and unconscious biases. Whether this is reflecting back a dark mirror on what people click on or surfacing a careless design in an algorithm, this random search result shines a little more light on the more subtle and insidious ways racism is baked into our modern lives.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>For my friends who work at the big tech giants which are increasingly the infrastructure to our lives, please help make sure your institutions are addressing this stuff. (And thanks to those of you who already have been.)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>#&lrm;BlackLivesMatter</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>PS: Recently saw a great talk about this idea of 'oppression' in our algorithms. Def worth a watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRVZozEEWlE</em></p>
<p>This isn't some edge weird case, this is what happens when we craft algorithms using development teams that lack diversity. Racial bias continues to get baked into our algorithms because we refuse to admit we have a problem, or unwilling to actually do anything about it. Sadly, this is just one of many layers in which bias being built into our algorithms, which are increasingly deciding what shows up on your Facebook wall, all the way to which criminals will commit crimes in the future.</p>
<p>You will hear more stories like this on API Evangelist as I push forward my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">APIs and algorithm research</a>, working to identify ways we can use open source, and open APIs to make these often black box algorithms&nbsp;more transparent, so we can potentially identify the&nbsp;bias&nbsp;inside. Even with this type of effort, we are still left with having to do the hard work change the culture that perpetuates this--I am just focusing on how we crack things open, and more easily identify the illness inside.</p>

<p>Technology evangelists are nothing new, but are something I think is continuing to expand as the Internet continues to crack open more of the core areas of the tech sector. I specifically chose the term API Evangelist to define what I did evangelizing for all APIs, but all I was really doing is following the lead of evangelism pioneers like Amazon, Google, and even Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has long been discussion around evangelism vs advocates, and I've seen companies also choose to adopt an ambassador format. I have also been interested to see the evolution of <a href="https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains">Docker's Captain's</a>&nbsp;program--who are "<span>Docker experts and leaders in their communities who demonstrate a commitment to sharing their Docker knowledge with others".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I also stumbled across a post out of the <a href="https://www.compose.com/articles/compose-view-say-hello-to-the-database-advocate/">MongoDB as a service provider Compose showcasing what they call the database advocate</a>, whose "<span>job is not to guard the database from the world but to advocate the best ways to use it and offering the tools to optimize that usage". In their view, the outdated DBA is going away, with the database advocate emerging as a much more friendly, outward facing, pragmatic gatekeeper for databases within the enterprise.</span></p>
<p>It makes me happy to see the open ethos brought to the table by web APIs spreading to all the layers of the tech stack, making the world of virtualization and containers more accessible. As an old database guy, it makes me really, really happy to see it also spread to the world of databases--I am hoping that it is something that continues to spread to all layers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/REST_API_Documentation_-_Sandbox.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been talking with&nbsp;Nick Houghton over at <a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview">Sandbox</a>&nbsp;about the state of OpenAPI Spec driven API documentation, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">the lack of a machine-readable core when you deployed Slate driven documentation</a>. He was wanting the same thing--a good looking, dynamic API documentation that was OpenAPI Spec driven.</p>
<p>He recently got back to me&nbsp;and found a solution that worked for them: <em>"<a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview">Ended up just templating the Swagger JSON myself rather than relying on Slate etc to do it. So model/resources are Swagger annotated, CI pushes out Swagger JSON and Angular UI </a></em><a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview">parses</a><em><a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview"> in the browser, works quite well I think</a>".</em></p>
<p>Nick is on a similar path that I am, as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/08/playing-with-concepts-around-simplifying-the-api-docs-that-are-generated-using-api-definitions/">I work to simply API documentation using OpenAPI Spec</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/09/providing-specialized-views-of-an-api-surface-area-dynamically-with-openapi-spec-and-liquid/">provide specialized views of APIs using Liquid</a>. We are looking for the simplicity, control, and beauty of Slate, but the machine readable core of OpenAPI Spec--allowing us to keep the core specification for the API up to date, and the documentation is always the latest.</p>
<p>They are going to write up their journey on their blog (as all API service providers should), and share with us. I'll probably&nbsp;do another write-up once I get more details on how they created the templated API docs using OpenAPI Spec and Angular. I also like how they have the OpenAPI Spec JSON pushed out as part of the CI life-cycle--something I'll cover more as part of my <a href="http://orchestration.apievangelist.com/">API life-cycle orchestration research</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/blog/fullcontact-acquires-conspire/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/conspire_blogHeader.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I saw that the <a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/blog/fullcontact-acquires-conspire/">contact API solution FullContact recently purchased the professional network management solution Conspire</a>. Thankfully FullContact is good about blogging about the move, and the details of the motivations behind their decision -- without this type of storytelling I wouldn't even have known it happened.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed in the blog post was that <em>"Paul, Alex, and the entire&nbsp;<a href="https://www.conspire.com/">Conspire</a>&nbsp;team have been fabulous partners with FullContact, having utilized our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/developer/person-api/">Person API</a></em><span><em>&nbsp;as a part of the Conspire offering"</em>. Acquisitions from within an API ecosystem is not new. It is why many companies do APIs in the first place, to help identify talent within their ecosystem like Paypal does, and complimentary companies and teams like FullContact has done.</span></p>
<p>There are many mating rituals you can perform as a startup these days, and building an interesting product, service, and company on top of an API is a pretty cool way to accomplish this. Obviously, it is easier said that done, but if you can identify a real-world business problem, and develop a solution to solve this problem on top of an API, and get some real traction--it can lead to some pretty interesting outcomes.</p>
