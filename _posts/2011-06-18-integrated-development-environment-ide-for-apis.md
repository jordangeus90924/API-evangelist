{% include JB/setup %}<p>I recently moved my IDE off my desktop and onto the web.Im test driving two separate web-based integrated development environments (IDE): Akshell - I like environment, its smooth and has Github integration.But its primarily a JavaScript IDE.I met the developers and like where they are going with it.ShiftEdit - This is the one Im using the most, because I work 70% of the time in PHP.</p>
