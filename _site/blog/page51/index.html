        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/audrey-kin-paris.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've had the joy of watching a lot of you bash on my girlfriend, from the misogynistic douche bags telling her to get back in the kitchen because she questions their technology startup, to the recent <a href="https://twitter.com/FakeAudryWattrs">@FakeAudreyWatters</a> Twitter account spending a good portion of their day mocking her.</p>
<p>Audrey and I are very different personalities when it comes to expressing ourselves in an online environment, but we share one common thing--a passion for helping encourage meaningful dialogue about where we are going with this whole technology roller coaster.</p>
<p>Audrey is extremely passionate about education and where we are going with the education of our kids, and how we are applying technology in the classroom.  If she is critical of your startup, idea or otherwise, you may not like it, but there might actually be a reason behind it--why don't you engage her in dialogue about it?</p>
<p>She spends at least 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, researching, writing and stressing over her work(unpaid). I spend every moment with her and I see how much thought she puts into all of this. She is a very positive person, and extremely intellectually stimulating to be around, which is why I'm with her. Together, as a team we have achieved some amazing things in the last three years.</p>
<p>I strongly believe Audrey and I have positively impacted the online world by helping folks think critically about education, and across numerous other industries through analysis of APis. I depend on Audrey to bounce ideas off, ranging from oAuth to API terms of use. API Evangelist <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would not exist</span> without her.</p>
<p>When I was first with Audrey she often frustrated me with her confrontational approach, but over the course of four years, I have found it to be essential to what I do. She battles me on ideas, sometimes to the point where we both stomp off, but in every case, I've been able to apply her critical feedback and make my work more polished as a result.</p>
<p>What I hope is, that you can learn to do the same. If she says something that bothers you, have a dialogue with her and either change her mind, or I bet she'll change yours. If you don't like what she is saying, come to DC and sit with us and talk it out over a couple pints or bottle of wine.</p>
<p>If not, I think secretly you have more problems than just Audrey. You are probably insecure, greedy, sad sack o shit like the creator @FakeAudreyWatters. Someone who could be spending their time actually contributing to the education space, but they are actually working hard to suck value from their space, just like the company you work at. Something that is just unacceptable, c'mon these are our kids asshole, get a fuck'n life.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/08/22/delivering-value-for-developers-is-first-when-it-comes-to-the-census-bureau-apis/">Delivering Value For Developers Is First When It Comes To The Census Bureau APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.census.gov/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/digital-strategy/logos/census.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote a piece about <a title="providing a full download vs. API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">providing a full download vs. API</a> last month, where I used the <a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/" target="_blank">Census Bureau API</a> as an example. The post got the attention of the folks at the Census, and they invited me out for a discussion yesterday about their API strategy.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau API team asked me what I thought of their <a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/" target="_blank">API developer area</a>, and while I have lots of suggestions of where they could do, I first focused on what they have already delivered.</p>
<p>I don't know if you understand the size of the census, but it is a massive undertaking, resulting in data at a scope that we are only seeing matched in the last few years, with the Google's and Twitters of the world--the only difference is the census has been going on since 1790. it gives you an ideas of the serious big data potential behind the Census Bureau API.</p>
<p>Faced with data at this scope, I understand that delivering a simple, web API is not easy. I was impressed with the teams efforts before I came to D.C., but now I'm really impressed that such a simple, web API could be delivered out of such a large government entity. Many other agencies are still trying to even learn what an API is, and even if they do attempt at delivering APIs, the result is often the much more technical cousin of web APIs, SOAP web services.</p>
<p>I totally respect the simple start to the Census Bureau API. The current API landing gives you brief introduction to the API, shows you how to access the data via the URL endpoints, gives you example responses, error codes and addresses what you need to use the APIs in JavaScript.  They also give you quick access to getting API keys, a developer forum, application gallery and of course you still get full access to Census downloads.</p>
<p>What a great start. So simple. Giving developers exactly what they need to get going.</p>
<p>Then before I gave my feedback on where they could go next with the APis, the Census team gave me a quick overview of the API road-map, to make sure I wasn't going to suggest anything they were already working on.</p>
<p>I was pleased to hear the Census Bureau API road-map centered around making sure all the public survey data at the Census was accessible via the API for developers. After that, the focus was on making it easier for developers to access, filter and work with all data via the APIs. One of the biggest challenges is that there are hundreds of thousands of fields developers can use when querying the API, and potentially millions of fields when all of it is made available. Opening up the question, how do you educate users that these fields exist, let alone put these fields to use.</p>
<p>I think the Census Bureau API road-map reflects the mission of the Census Bureau, with a focus on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Complete Data Downloads</li>
<li>Simple API Interfaces</li>
<li>Access to All Public Data</li>
<li>Usability for Developers</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach totally satisfies my number one requirement for all APIs--deliver value. If you focus on delivering value, the rest will work out. Developers will come, and build on that value.  The Census team is on the right track with their road-map, dovetailing with any feedback I had brought with me to the meeting:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Value</strong> - Keep focusing on providing value to developers. Make the data they desire available, make it as easy to access as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - The key to success will be to keep building on the simple interfaces you've created. Complexity will slow API adoption for developers.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong> - Look at Swagger, I/O Docs and API Blueprint for approaches to make learning about Census APIs interactive, exploratory and hands-on for developers.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - Keep up the good work on providing JavaScript resources for integrating with the developers, this will help encourage embeddable tools, single page apps and meaningful visualizations.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> - Consider providing spreadsheet integration resources for using Census APIs in Excel and Google Spreadsheets, allowing spreadsheet packages complete with built in graphs, charts and other visualizations. This is a growing trend in the API space and will meet the needs of non-developer users, which will mean massive new adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Landing Page -</strong> Keep the home page simple, but consider surfacing other valuable resources, making everything a developer needs to get started is one click away.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not want to overload the Census team with too many ideas, I want to keep my feedback as simple as their initial approach to their API. I had feedback loop on my list before arriving, but the team walked me through their existing feedback loop of partners, advisory groups, conferences, forums, list serves and Twitter. Add me coming by the office regularly, I think they have the feedback loop covered! :-)</p>
<p>In 2013, we are all excited about the potential of big data. I'm excited to see the OG Big Data provider, stepping up to the plate in such a meaningful way. There are some seriously smart people at the Census, and I'm really excited to see what they have coming down the pipeline, and I'm honored that they respect my opinions enough to have me out to the office.</p>

<p><a title="Time Tracking Platform Harvest" href="http://www.getharvest.com/" target="_blank">Time Tracking API platform Harvest</a> has embraced Github as part of their API ecosystem. I'm always on the hunt for examples of API providers using Github, so I figured I'd showcase Harvest's creative use of the social coding platform.</p>
<p>Starting with their documentation, the Harvest team has moved the <a href="https://github.com/harvesthq/api">API documentation to a Github repository</a>, allowing developers to "watch" the API, get updates when changes are made, asks questions or even contribute to the API docs by submitting a pull request.</p>
<p>Harvest is also using the wiki portion of their Github repo for a developer application gallery they are calling <a href="https://github.com/harvesthq/api/wiki/Community-Creations-&amp;-Hacks">Community Creations and Hacks</a>, where they showcase innovative uses of the Harvest API--currently displaying 20 integrations by Harvest users.</p>

<p>As I immerse myself in the federal government, I have left my private sector world where web APIs have become commonplace. Sure I still worked hard to get outside of Silicon Valley and reach out further into land of "normals", helping spread the API gospel, but in Washington D.C. I seriously have my work cut out for me.</p>
<p>I have a great support system within the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp">Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) at the White House</a>, but as I go deeper within specific agencies I see fewer web APIs, and fewer people who understand them. When I do come across a web service, it makes me hopeful, but still these SOAP driven services may get the job done for programmers, but lack the simplicity needed to get wider adoption.</p>
<p>This is only my second week in DC, I'm spending a lot of time going through websites, getting to know the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies, and recognize there is a lot of web talent, even though much is probably contracted, within the Federal Government.  I can't help but think how CMS platforms like Wordpress, Drupal and others have helped our government publish valuable information and resources via the web, but we still are lacking a complimentary web API movement.</p>
<p>The value of websites has been accepted across federal government, what can we do to get web APIs to the same level? Web services are embraced, but they are still a very black box, developer centric tool, something out of reach of the common gov worker. But web APIs aren't much different than the websites being produced, they just trade their HTML output for data formats like XML and JSON--I'm looking to change this.</p>
<p>In 2013 and 2014 I want to pose the question in within government, why aren't open data and API skills part of the federal government's web developer toolbox, alongside the skills you already posses. You can increase the productivity of government 10x with this little change. Every time you publish web content via HTML, simultaneously publish an XML and JSON version of the same information. This little change will transform how our federal government works, much like it did when website development was adopted in the 90's.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I spend time in Washington DC, I get a lot of questions regarding API design, deployment and management. It is quite likely my writing will evolve here at API Evangelist during the next year. You will see me quickly scrub answers that I'm giving to questions that I receive from any number of federal agencies.</p>
<p>One question I received today was a classic one: what are some good examples of API docs? But in this particular case it wasn't just for an API, there is also a full download of data available as well.</p>
<p>First, regardless of whether or not it is data download (CSV, XML, JSON) or API you need to provide a wrapper area, or portal, that will onboard users and helps them understand what you are delivering, enabling them to go from 0-60 with as little friction as possible.</p>
<p>This is what I have studied for the last 3 years. After looking at thousands of APIs areas, you start to see patterns. You will find&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">my research in the form of "building blocks" on a section of my site</a>. Even though most of my research is focused on APIs, these patterns can apply universally to data download or API delivery.</p>
<p>But specifically to question of what API documentation I like? I also recommend looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">Stripe</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest">Twilio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.parse.com/docs/rest">Parse</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fullcontact.com/developer/docs/person/">Full Contact</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developers.box.com/docs/#folders">Box</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/dev/docs">Dwolla</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When looking through these make sure and take notice of how&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">Dwolla separates their intro page, between non-devs and devs</a>. This is a very significant concept for delivering onboarding materials for users where not everyone will be a developer.</p>
<p>Beyond those suggestions for API docs, here are&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/08/thirty-apis-to-look-at-when-planning-your-api/">Thirty APIs To Look At When Planning Your AP</a>I, if you are looking for more examples of quality API areas + documentation.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider when actually deploying specifically an API, is making your API documentation "interactive". There are several solutions for doing this right now, but the leading solution (in my opinion) is called&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>. This is a evolution from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">WADL</a>, but has come a long ways since just describing a web API in XML.</p>
<p>Swagger is developed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, and you can view the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html">documentation in action on their developer site</a>. In my examples above, Full Contact uses swagger to deliver their documentation in a very elegant way. Why Swagger is important, is the fact that it doesn't just deliver elegant documentation, it makes it interactive and learning about an API a hands on experience, which increases the potential for adoption. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of Swagger only begin with interactive documentation, it will also&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen">generate code samples in Java, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Ruby</a>&nbsp;automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just some thoughts. I hope it helps. Remember, open data and APIs only start with the download or interface. The success of your implementation really depends on the richness of the area around your data download and API.</p>

<p>This is from a question I answered on the <a title="API Craft Forum" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/api-craft">API Craft Forum</a> tonight titled: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/api-craft/IgPZ5mWAsVE">SOA vs API</a>?</p>
<p><em>I happened to look at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/apigee/apis-inside-enterprise-soa-displacement">slide and also related video</a> but unfortunately still do not have&nbsp;&nbsp;a crystal clear view.</em><br /><br /><em>Is my understanding correct?</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>SOA and API are complementary paradigms/technologies. APIs are a facade to SOA to expose them to the outside world?</em></li>
<li><em>SOA was aimed to provide an integration mechanism/guidelines for enterprise while APIs are generally aimed to make the backend systems public? Also, APIs can be internal to the organization.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>My response:</p>
<p><span>Your understanding is in the ballpark.&nbsp;&nbsp;APIs were one tool in the SOA toolbox. Except you are seeing APIs as just technology.</span><br /> <br /> <span>APIs have jumped out of the enterprise toolbox, and found success in the richer oxygen environment of the Internet, escaping from the claustrophobic environment of the restrictive enterprise network in which strict governance was imposed, and technologists decided everything.</span><br /> <br /> <span>After going outside the firewall, APIs became about the simplicity of REST + JSON over HTTP, putting these resources closer to actual problem owners--flipping the governance of SOA on its head, making APIs more about partnering, collaboration, transparency and openness, and not just about control. After escaping the governance and the bottleneck of traditional IT, this new breed of APIs allowed for new types of innovation, business models and opportunities amongst not just open developers, but actual business owners.

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Public Media Platform" href="http://publicmediaplatform.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/public-media-platform/public-media-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are just a handful of API platforms that I feel have greatly impacted the world of APIs and were significant in leading the space in important ways. These platforms include, but are not limited to Amazon Web Services, EBay, Salesforce, Google Maps and Twitter. All of these companies have changed the way we build applications and conduct business, by using APIs.</p>
<p>In 2013, as we watch 50-100 public APIs launch each week, it can be difficult to see any sign of meaningful impementations in each wave of new API deployments. Just as I'm getting completely depressed about this lack of true API innovation, I was introduced to a new <a title="Public Media Platform" href="http://publicmediaplatform.org/">Public Media Platform</a> that is pushing forward the tech, business and politics of APIs.</p>
<p>The Public Media Platform (PMP) is a non-profit organization formed by public media's leading organizations, APM, NPR, PBS, PRI and PRX, to establish digital content repository and distribution system that will enable users to easily discover and interact with the news, information, cultural and educational content that is produced across the public media landscape.</p>
<p>PMP has come together to develop a completely API driven platform, that will empower producers of public media to store and share text, digital video, audio, images and related meta data. This approach to media delivery will increase the distribution and reach, lower operating costs, while also handling the business rules, rights management necessary for media delivery in an online and mobile world.</p>
<p>By lowering these barriers of entry, and simplifying operations and distribution, PMP will open up opportunities for these leading players to get their work in front of the large public media audience. However, this isn't just about benefiting these existing players, who are investing in the platform, once deployed, the platform will be opened up to any media producer. With this newly developed ecosystem, any developer will be able to build tools and applications that will help public media stations and producers deliver content in new ways that will serve a growing audience--opening up entirely new opportunities for collaboration, distribution and innovation.</p>
<p>PMP is an important project, something that doesn't occur in the commercial space. With this approach to building an API platform, you have what could be perceived as competitors, who are working together to define a common API and data standards, while also defining best practices, then leveraging open source tools and approaches to establish a shared platform that is not just beneficial to these founding partners, but ultimately other independent, lesser known producers--establishing the groundwork for a true API ecosystem.</p>
<p>You just don't see this happening in the commercial space. You might see API providers like Twilio and SendGrid who work together, but trust me, as someone who has organized an <a title="API industry conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php">API industry conference</a>, where I work hard to bring API providers and service providers together--it can be like herding cats to even get them all in the same room, let alone collaborate on a common platform or standards. Something that seems counter to the underlying philosophy of the API space, in my opinion.</p>
<p>The PMP team is heads down in the build phase of the project, and will be launching pilot deployments in the fall, with full deployment planned for the beginning of 2014. I've been fortunate to have a chance to look at the technology behind the platform, and I'm seriously impressed with the PMP team's forward leaning approach to the platform's design.</p>
<p>I have crafted a 15 story series based upon the PMP platform, which I will be releasing in tune with the PMP roadmap, so make sure and tune in over the next six months. With the lack of commercial constraints, the PMP team is going to lead in not just the public media space, but deliver a platform model, API design definition and suite of open source tools that can be applied across numerous industries, and show many commercial API platforms a whole new world of API possibilities.</p>

<p>Securely accessing API with oAuth can be one of the bigger pains in the ass for developers. Poor understanding of how oAuth works and often lack of good client libraries, can make API authentication a hurdle developers can't jump over.</p>
<p>Now developers don't have to stress out over oAuth. The tech savvy team over at <a title="Webshell.io" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell.io</a> has created a dead simple oAuth solution that allows you to integrate with over 70 of the common API providers, with just three lines of JavaScript, called <a href="https://oauth.io/" target="_blank">oAuth.io</a>.</p>
<p>What I like about oAuth.io the most, is that it is a true client side oAuth solution. With as many pure client-side, JavaScript, <a title="Single Page Apps" href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">Single Page Apps</a> I'm building, this type of oAuth solution just rocks!</p>
<p>I really enjoy dead simple solutions like oAuth.io, that take powerful, but complex things and abstracts away the complexity, making it something anyone can use. I recommend taking a look at oAuth.io and saving yourself the overhead of API integration using oAuth.</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough, It gets even better. They have also open sourced the oAuth.io core under the name&nbsp;<a href="https://oauth.io/#/docs/oauthd">oAuthd</a>.</p>
<p>Nice work Webshell.io team!</p>

<p>In this computer driven business world its easy to end up with a mess of documents across a company's network.  No matter how much you try to organize, name and add metadata to documents, providing a quality search mechanism can be tough. Let alone one that you can use in web portals, web sites and even mobile and tablet applications.</p>
<p>One common way to to solve this problem historically has been using the Lucene Java Search Library, but in the age of web and mobile having an added API for integrating across all the place you will need search, is even better.  One of the quickest ways to deploy a document search API is using <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank">Apache Solr</a> which is built on top of the Lucene Java Search Library.</p>
<p>Apache Solr delivers a full-text search server that provides a REST-like API, where you put documents in it via XML, JSON or CSV, and then you can query it via API and receive XML, JSON, CSV results, which enables you to deliver a quick, cost effective, open source API driven search for your documents.</p>
<p>There are many types of APIs, from data to programmatic resources--when it comes to document search APIs for knowledge bases, catalogs and other document stores, Apache Solr is a solid option.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, will be my first official day in Washington D.C. as a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/round-2-fellows">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>. I'm super excited, yet also very calm about what is happening.  It seems like it is so meant to be, that I don't have any questions or reservations, I just want to get to work.</p>
<p>I was not in the realm, where I would take a job from anyone.  I was doing very well, educating the masses about APIs as THE API Evangelist.  However when the I got the call to be a Presidential Innovation Fellow, I did not hesitate.  Yes.  Of course I would take the role.</p>
<p>As a Presidential Innovation Fellow I will be assigned to the "VA Modernization Team", along with two other very talented individuals, Molly Ruskin (<a href="https://twitter.com/mollieruskin">@mollieruskin</a>) and Ben Willman (<a href="/admin/blog/benwillman">@benwillman)</a>. While we are working together as a team, I will be specifically assigned to the Digits-2-Digits (D2D) project which is:</p>
<blockquote><em>An enterprise Digits-to-Digits Electronic Claims Submission Service that will provide a common access point to standardize, centralize, and integrate the universal collection of Benefits Claim Forms and supporting evidence data to produce a streamlined, paperless Veteran/Service member-centric claims process.</em></blockquote>

<p>I couldn't think of a more meaningful project to be part of. I've gone through the project and begun to acquaint myself with its inner workings, and I'm impressed with the amount of work and detail that has gone on so far, in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>I'm really thankful for this opportunity, to really put APIs, and my experience to use for such a meaningful cause. I'm looking forward to the talented folks I will be working with over the next year, and the amount that I will learn on this new adventure in my life and career.</p>

<p>In closing wanted to give a quick shout out to my father Jim Bignall (top photo) who I never got to know, and my step-father John Ronald Kehoe (bottom photo) who impacted my life in so many ways. Both have passed on now, but both were Vietnam Veterans and left significant marks on who I am, and contributed so much to prepare me for the next year of service.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2013</span>
        <h1>Overview of API Integration</h1>
<p>Integrating with a single API can be tough, let alone multiple APIs. I see integration being about on-boarding, exploration, education, authentication, code samples, testing and sand-boxing of APIs--pretty much everything between the discovery of APIs and going into production.</p>
<p>The goal is to identify building blocks, tools, services and other knowledge that will help developers integrate APIs into their web, mobile and internet of things applications. API Evangelist as always been about the business of APIs from the API provider perspective, but now I'm looking to evolve it, and include the business of API consumption.</p>
<p>Some of the companies included in this research span other areas like API discovery or management, but they are also providing valuable tools and services that help ensure developers will be successful. Once I get, what I feel are the key areas of both deploying and consuming APIs up, I will work on the overlaps, and interoperability between these areas.</p>
<p>API integration tools and services are proving to be a very critical area to the space, one that will help stabilize the world of APIs and balance out much of the inconsistency that developers face when building apps that span multiple API providers or even depend on aggregate APis.</p>
<p>This area of API evangelist is brand new and will be evolving as I continue my research. &nbsp;If you have tools or approaches to development of apps using APIs, please let me know. I'd love to hear more about how you approach integration. As with all of my projects, this is a continuous work in progress, so stay tuned.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Runscope" href="http://runscope.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/runscope/runscope-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The word "open" gets thrown around a lot in the API space. So much in fact, the term has lost just about any meaning. We don't say "open API" anymore, we identify an API as public, partner or private, evolving to a time where open APIs have merged with open source, and success means building community.</p>
<p>In 2013, successful application development centers around community, which includes not just a healthy selection of valuable, stable API resources, but also a strong assortment of open source tools and cloud services that are community driven, and benefit all.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/02/the-continuing-netflix-api-story/">strong example of this evolution can be seen in the Netflix ecosystem</a>, where <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">a "public" API has been largely considered a failure</a>, but a strong API driven community of device vendors has flourished, as well as the release of a suite of open source API and cloud tooling from the online movie and TV streaming platform.</p>
<p>Another examples can be seen from the new <a title="Runscope" href="http://runscope.com/" target="_blank">API testing and integration provider Runscope</a>.  In addition to providing a suite of services for developers to use when developing API driven applications, Runscope also actively maintains four separate community projects:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Digest" href="http://apidigest.com">API Digest (apidigest.com)</a></li>
<li><a title="API Jobs" href="http://api-jobs.com">API Jobs (api-jobs.com)</a></li>
<li><a title="API Changelog" href="http://apichangelog.com">API Changelog (apichangelog.com)</a></li>
<li><a title="RequestBin" href="http://requestb.in">RequestBin (requestb.in)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>API Digest and API Jobs were pet projects of Runscope founder John Sheehan, prior to starting the company, but he has continued the same approach in a more formal manner, in which Sheehan calls the Runscope 'Community Projects' model, and adding API Changelog and most recently acquiring RequestBin.</p>
<p>All of these Runscope projects are "free-forever open to the community sites that I hope are valuable resources related to what we're doing", according to Sheehan. "our overriding philosophy for all this is this: the more tools the better. We obviously benefit from the links, etc. but the bigger picture is we're working in a nascent area of dev tools and we benefit more from general exposure to the ideas we're working on than trying to capture all the attention directly. Whatever we need to do to encourage devs to keep trying new ways to solve these problems, we're going to do it."</p>
<p>In addition to these core community projects at Runscope, they also sponsor four other open source software (OSS) projects, including <a title="LocalTunnel" href="http://localtunnel.com">localtunnel.com</a>, <a title="httpbin.org" href="http://httpbin.org">httpbin.org</a>, <a title="foauth.org" href="http://foauth.org">foauth.org</a>, and <a title="mocky.io" href="http://mocky.io">mocky.io</a>.  Sheehan says that, "some of these 'compete' with us, but we're more concerned with keeping them available".</p>
<p>Runscope's 'Community Project' model makes me happy. This approach is not just about providing paid services for developers who are building applications that use APIs, but truly providing the news, tools and other resources the space needs to be healthy.</p>
<p>Companies that are looking to provide APIs or API related services need to follow Runscope's lead, and evolve beyond just the concept of 'open API' or just 'open source', and adopt a community driven model where you acknowledge its not just about selling your services, but aso helping contribute the resources that will ensure the entire space is healthy and vibrant--a world where we all win!</p>

<p>Using this new approach, Repustate is targeting the 5% of their user base who do not wish to transmit their data across the Internet, possibly because of legal or security concerns, and providing them with an on-premise version of their API, configured as a portable virtual appliance.</p>
<p>While the concept of on-premise vs cloud is nothing new, packaging up your API as a virtual appliance that can run anywhere is not that common.

<p>During my monitoring of the API space this week, I came across an interesting blog post from data platform <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>, <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2013/08/06/a-developers-smorgasbord/">showcasing the tools they provide for developers</a> who are putting their real-time data platform to use.</p>
<p>Splunk has an amazing smorgasbord of developer tools, but there are a handful that I feel need highlighting, so that other data API providers can consider as part of their own offerings:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Command Line Interface (CLI) -</strong> Monitor, configure and search Splunk via a terminal/shell interface or wrapping the commands in a shell script</li>
<li><strong>REST API -</strong> Most of the functionality in Splunk exposed as a suite of REST endpoints Software Development Kits (SDK) - Development kits for accelerating integration with the Splunk API in six different languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, C#</li>
<li><strong>Apps and Add-ons -</strong> Packaging up of the various configurations, searches, knowledge objects, UI components and customizations, inputs, role definitions, field extractions etc. that you might typically create via Splunk on the web</li>
<li>Scripted inputs - Out of the box, Splunk has simple generic input options available for getting data from a file or receiving data over TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Modular Inputs -</strong> Modular Inputs build upon Scripted Inputs by elevating the creation of custom input add-ons to first class citizen status in Splunk</li>
Custom search commands - Splunk&rsquo;s Search language is incredibly powerful and extensive for deriving a wide range of analytical insights from your indexed data
<li><strong>Custom alert scripts -</strong> Splunk alerting channels provided by defaults are Email and RSS. But let&rsquo;s say for example that you wanted to send alerts via SMS, to a Messaging Queue, as an SNMP or directly to a trouble ticket system</li>
<li><strong>Custom REST endpoints -</strong> Splunk&rsquo;s REST API is very thorough, but this can also be extended with your own custom REST endpoints that you could then integrate with programmatically</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously Splunk is a big data platform, so the idea of custom search and other building blocks, may not work for all API providers. Regardless this list provides some thought provoking implementations that other data API providers should look as part of their own roadmap.</p>
<p>Make sure and head over to the <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2013/08/06/a-developers-smorgasbord/">blog post that sparked this story,</a> they have other goodies like App Frameworks, and specific connectors for Apache, Spring, Flurry and a long-tail of API integration building blocks.</p>

<p>While creating, yet another API management solution may not seem like the best idea at first, I can see why federal agencies would do it. Because of terms of use, costs and vendor lock-in with proprietary solutions, they are just seeking a simpler, cost effective alternative to solutions available in the private sector.</p>
<p>I'd love to see a blueprint established for the features available in API Umbrella, the current implementation for the gatekeeper is in Node.js and the web interface is in Ruby--it would be nice to have an open blueprint which would allow for others to contribute PHP, Python and other iterations of the same model. Providing a way for organizations to choose an option that fits with the resources they have available, while still providing interoperability.</p>
<p>It would also be great to see other city, county and state organizations adopt, deploy and evolve API Umbrella, providing a solution for other types of government organizations. I'm not intimate with the various needs of different types of government, but I'm sure there are some nuances that might make a difference.</p>
<p>As I ramp up my time working in DC this year I will spend more time getting intimate with <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/">API Umbrella</a>, as well as other open data portal solutions like <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, and hopefully provide more resources on putting these solutions to use in the real world.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-padlock.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get a lot of questions from folks about the why, when and how of securing an API. And in keeping in sync with my audience, I wanted to provide a plain english story of securing your API, avoiding &nbsp;the often enterprise, service oriented architecture (SOA) jargon, which can confuse the situation for many who are just getting their feet wet.</p>
<p>So, you have created a basic API from your data or other resource, that returns XML or JSON for users--now you want to secure it. The reasons for securing your API will vary on a case by case basis. Your might be releasing data that you only want a handful of select people to access, or you might be looking to reduce the amount of server and bandwidth resources it takes to support an API, or you might just want to intimately understand who accesses an API and why and how they are using it. Or D) All The Above!</p>
<p>There are a handful of approaches to providing access to your API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Open</strong> - Just keeping your API wide open, accessible to anyone who has the URL. Obviously this isn't secured, but provides contrast for other options</li>
<li><strong>BasicAuth</strong> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">Basic authentication</a> is a native part of HTTP and the Internet, which employs a username / password combination that is passed when accessing an API, which the server then authenticates allowing or denying access</li>
<li><strong>Key</strong> - Requiring an application or user key which is usually a combination of alpha and numeric characters, which is obtained by each developers through a API registration process, providing a unique access key for each consumer</li>
<li><strong>oAuth</strong> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">oAuth</a> is an open authorization standard, that is usually employed when there is more sensitive, user specific data available via an API. oAuth is considered to be standard approach to securing API access, but increases the technical learning curve for API users</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm also investigating <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/2013/07/29/an-alternative-to-required-api-keys">another approach that is an alternative to API keys</a>, which addresses the concerns around server and bandwidth overhead of open API access. Once I have more understanding, I will include as part of my educational materials.</p>
<p>If you are looking to just make sure you have some level of control over who accesses your API, a simple API key approach is recommended.  An API key limits who has access, while also giving you a way to track the ways each user is interacting with your API.  There are currently around <a title="20 API management providers" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">20 API management providers</a> who specialize in providing API key solutions for API providers, as well as oAuth and Basic Authentication options. If you are looking for more help on securing your API, reach out to these providers.</p>
<p>If you are deploying an API for the federal government in the United States, <a href="http://api.data.gov/about/">there is also a new option from Data.gov,</a> which provides you with a solution to the most common needs of API providers including API keys, rate limiting and analytics. I'm still working on adding this solution to my API management resources, and will have more analysis in the future.</p>
<p>This post is meant to be a very simple, non-technical overview of securing your API. If you are looking to do this on a tight budget, I recommend looking at <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>. They have a self-service, easy to implement process for getting going, but can also provide the support needed for scaling and evolving your solution.</p>
<p>When securing your API, make sure and remember that securing is not just about preventing unwanted access and abuse, but also provide you with insight into who and how developers and other users are accessing and using your data. This type of insight is critical to evolving your API strategy, so make sure you are not just securing, but also measuring and analyzing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://octopart.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/octoparts/octopart-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been an advocate for non-developers being one of the most important audiences for your API, since I started API Evangelist. I know us developers love to believe we are the primary force behind the success of APIs like Twitter--it is partially true, we are. But we also had the assistance of the power Twitter user in getting the good word out. Tech savvy journalists, marketing and other folks who get the platform, API, and value that lies within, while also possessing a large or very influential audience.</p>
<p>Another example of this dynamic I'm seeing unfold in slow motion is from web APIs that are driving the Excel spreadsheet. I've posted before about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/11/twitter-api-is-not-just-for-developers/">using Google Spreadsheets in conjunction with APIs</a>, and I just saw a another <a href="http://octopart.com/blog/archives/2013/7/octopart-in-excel">great example of using Microsoft Excel from the electronics parts provider Octoparts</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://octopart.com/blog/archives/2013/7/octopart-in-excel"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/octoparts/octopart-excel.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Octoparts walks us through an API to Microsoft Excel solution, that has some pretty obvioius potential, by providing a direct connection between their product catalog to customers and partners via their API and an Excel spreadsheet.  The particular approach requires the usage of <a href="https://datanitro.com/">DataNitro</a>, a plugin for Excel that allow you to run Python functions within your spreadsheets. Once installed, you can import products using the Ocotoparts APIs, complete with functions for filtering by manufacture, SKU, price and other key catalog fields.</p>
<p>This is a pretty significant example of how APIs can be used by non-developers, and specifically power Excel users. I don't know about your experience, but pretty much every industry I've worked in, is being run by Excel wielding business and marketing power users. This isn't some small group of niche developers, this group of users represents the engine of business in our everyday world.</p>
<p>Think of the potential, when we educate these everyday users about APIs, then provide them with simple API usage examples, allowing them to access the valuable resources they need within an organization or externally from partners, government and other public sources of information.</p>
<p>Much like mobile has emerged as a focus area for API providers, I predict Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet connectors will become commonplace in API ecosystems. So make sure your products and other valuable corporate resources are accessible via API for the power spreadsheet users in your supply chain.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jul 2013</span>
        <p>This is my first blog post, following a very nice week, offline in Maine. I have purposely setup the API Evangelist network to be a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">mesh network of API research project nodes</a>, allowing anyone to to start from ground zero and work their way through the different aspects of the API universe.  The dirty little secret, is I set this up to benefit me first, then you, the reader.  After I get back to the world from time off, I'm very disoriented and I need a way to start over and work my way back through all of my projects.</p>
<p>Each time I pick my research up, I need to work my way through it, refresh my memory, and hopefully constantly realign my view of the universe, not just after vacations, but on a week to week basis. So this morning I started with the 100K view of providing APIs.</p>
<p>When I started API Evangelist, I acknowledged that the technology of APIs was being worked out, and the business of APIs was something that needed researching. Now in 2013, I'm seeing the same theme emerge around the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>This venn diagram is a rough, 100K view of what I consider to reflect a healthy strategy for an API provider. Depending on each company's goals, they may give more attention to any of these building blocks.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/technology-business-politics-apis.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" /></p>
<p>If you are coming from the enterprise you will see much of this as SOA governance, which I have spoken about in the past being the legacy inverse of API management, and will continue to articulate in future stories as I can.</p>
<p>Now that I'm warmed up with the 100K view of the API space, I'm ready to finish work on my API management, discovery and integration white papers I was working on before I left, as well as my weekly API monitoring and analysis.</p>

<p>Since 2010 I have had a page on this site dedicated to "API Management". In 2013 the API universe expanded, and I've broken my work in this area into three separate, open source API research projects.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><strong>Design</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><strong>Deployment</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><strong>Management</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm grouping these projects under a single umbrella, I'm now calling "<a title="providing APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/provide/">providing APIs</a>".  If you are a company or organization looking to provide API driven resources to partners, the public or even use them for internal operations, this section is for you.</p>
<p>I will be adding several other API research areas in the near future, including:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Monetization</li>
<li>Evangelism</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Embeddable</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the projects you will find building blocks, companies, tools, news and analysis. All projects stick to my new <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format, making sure my research is open, distributable and machine readable.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-analytics-2.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm going through all of my bulding blocks and tools for <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a>, as I'm updating and expanding this area of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>. After doing this work, I'm surprised that are aren't any open source or even independent analytics solutions that serve both the API provider and consumer.</p>
<p>Generally analytics for API providers and consumers are provided by one of the numerous API management providers.But what I'm looking for is stand alone analytics solutions that API providers could deploy on their own, or even an API integrator could put to use to track their own API usage across multiple APIs.</p>
<p>I learned about using <a title="StatsD" href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/">StatsD</a> and <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a> from the <a href="http://www.infochimps.com/">InfoChimps</a> team, and I've discussed the potential of using Google Analytics API as a layer of your API deployment or integration. There are also a lot of mobile analytics packages, but there is no straightforward solution for API providers and consumers.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-analytics-4.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Maybe it is because API management providers are meeting the needs of API providers, and I think the new breed of API integration providers like Runscope and TheRightAPI will be addressing the consumer side of the demand.  Or maybe I'm just not looking hard enough, and there is another solution out there.</p>
<p>At first thought, it seems logical to use Google Analytics, and track your API alongside your website operations.  It could be that these two are connected?  Regardless, with the number of public and open APIs, as well as the growing number of APIs it seems that a focused solution would emerge, and possibly an open source solution.</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm just missing some existing analytics that could be easily converted and applied to server side APIs. If you have an existing and are not using an API management solution, how do you track the usage of your API resources? I'd love to understand this more.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/KinLane-04-2012-Headshot-3-250.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I turned 41 in June. As I retool, reboot and readjust during what I guess could be called "vacation", I'm reflecting on the last year and the major shift that has gone on in my world.</p>
<p>First off, turning 40 was hard. Usually birthdays come and go without any concern, but 40 was not easy for me. I'll spare you the details, but the first half of 2012 was a very trying period, and by the time my birthday came around in June I was not a happy camper.</p>
<p>With this in mind, looking back at the last 12 months, I can see it was about transition, and preparing for the period of my life. While the first part of 2012 was an uphill drive, during the second half things seem to fall into place, allowing me to shift gears, pick up speed, setting a significantly new pace for what I see as the next decade of my life.</p>
<p>In 2010, I realized my career trajectory, after achieving a VP level position, working on SAP and Google events was not satisfying for me, and I needed a course correction. I wanted to make sure I was doing something meaningful, but spoke to my experience in architecting distributed, data driven sites and applications.</p>
<p>I had just had a very meaningful experiences in scaling architecture for SAP and Google, powered by application programming interfaces (API) and the cloud. I seen the potential of APIs, in not just designing distributed apps, but make them scalable, portable, collaborative and modular--opening up not just a new way to design web applications, but mobile applications, while also introducing companies to new, more transparent ways of conducting business.</p>
<p>Its been 3 years since I made the decision to do API Evangelist, dedicating my world to studying not just the technical, but the business and politics of providing and consuming APIs. While studying the space, I've worked hard to tell the story of my research, finding a unique voice that was informative, while also establishing enough credibility, so that people would find my research and stories something worth listening to, sharing and re-using.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/audrey-kin-paris-2.JPG" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I strongly believe there is a some amazing changes going on in business, government and our personal lives--changes that are being powered via APIs. We can make meaningful change in our world through opening up data and resources via APIs, but at the same time, the potential for great damage to privacy, markets and other negative influences exist. This intersection of the good and the bad of APIs is where I want to exist. Not being dogmatic about any particular technology or approach, but openly showcasing and discussing how APIs are being used wisely, and where APIs are being used in potentially harmful ways.</p>
<p>After two years of studying and telling stories at this intersection, last summer things started shifting. An awakening had occurred around APIs, with government taking notice, the enterprise and some of the largest global companies suddenly seeing there was something important happening here. APIs weren't just for mashups, they could truly provide the data and resources for the growing demand for web, mobile and even an Internet of things--where common objects around us are connected to the web in real-time.</p>
<p>Now in the summer of 2013, I don't feel like I need to be a cheerleader for APIs anymore, and I am allowed to evolve my approach. I want to maintain my research and monitoring of both providing and consuming APIs, keeping an eye on trends and being a champion of the priorities like government, education and healthcare. To support this, over the last year I've successfully migrated my research and storytelling to a new, agile way of reading, curating, organizing and writing of short and long form stories from the API space--while staying true to the intersection of technology, business and politics.</p>

<p>While not perfect, my website(s) API Evangelist, API Voice, API Stack, Hacker Storytelling and Kin Lane make me happy in their current state. Also while not perfect, I'm happy with the financial side of my world. I don't make a lot of money, but I find enough support to make ends meet, while staying focused on what is important and staying independent of any single company or product.</p>
<p>I have spent the last 3 weeks, enjoying time with my daughter Kaia, and my partner in crime Audrey in one of our favorite places on earth, Hermosa Beach.  While I've been reading, writing and doing some coding, I've been soaking in the sun and relaxing, making sure all my projects are wrapped up, allowing my platform to go into a maintenance mode, with no new work being added.  I will just maintain the current level of monitoring, curation and publishing I've done to date. Nothing more.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, I'm getting on a plane to Boston, then driving to Maine and spend a week relaxing with Audrey's family. I'm really looking forward to this time with not just Kaia and Audrey, but also with her family in such a beautiful place, during such a perfect time of year. I couldn't be more content.</p>
<p>Once done in Maine I will come back to LA, pick up a friend of Kaia's from San Diego, and help another friend caravan to Oregon. This will end an amazing summer with Kaia.  While in Oregon I will see family, friends as well as the continued business conversations I can't help but have. Then return to Los Angeles the first week in August.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-lane-apistrat-chair.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>Just days after I return, I will move to Washington D.C., and begin my one year as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, working the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>I'm finding it hard to relax, and thoroughly enjoy my time with Kaia this summer, but I will do it.  I'm super excited about the opportunity in front of me. My 40th year was pretty stellar, but now my 41st year will be spent in our nations capital, learning how our government works and tackling some of the biggest and in my opinion, some of the most meaningful challenges we face today--supporting our veterans.</p>
<p>In contrast to last summer, this July I'm extremely grateful for the last 12 months, and I'm not just optimistic for the next year, I'm totally psyched for the wild ride that is just getting started. The momentum Audrey and I have successfully achieved over the last three years with API Evangelist and Hack Education, and now we will spend the next year in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>I can tell is going to make for a seriously wild ride for the next decade, and most definitely beyond.</p>

<p>I received an email from Flickr today about a planned API outage later this month. I'm an afficinado of the interesting ways API providers communicate around maintenance and outages within their ecosystem, and wanted to share:</p>
<blockquote><em>We see that you own an active API key for the Flickr API, and wanted to let you know that Flickr is scheduling a maintenance outage for Thursday, July 25th, from 4 to 10pm PDT.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>During the outage window, the Flickr API will be unavailable. As such, you may want to adjust your app to gracefully handle the error that will result when it calls our API during the outage. (If your app is not yet public, this will only impact your personal use of the API.)</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>Specifically, a call to the Flickr API will result in the following error: 105: Service currently unavailable (Site Disabled). Here are example responses to expect: </em><br /> <br /><em>XML (REST): <!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?--> </em><br /><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?--> <br /><em>JSONP: jsonFlickrApi({ "stat": "fail", "code": "105", "message": "Service currently unavailable (Site Disabled)" }) </em><br /><br /><em>JSON: { "stat": "fail", "code": "105", "message": "Service currently unavailable (Site Disabled)" } </em><br /></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>We hope this helps, and thank you for being a member of our API community,</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The Flickreenos</em></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to communication around your API, it can be more art, than science. I don't think there is a precise formula for keeping people informed of what is coming down the pipes with your API. But if you keep it active, personal and informative--you can do alright.</p>
<p>While the Flickr API might not be in the limelight all the time, they've been doing it a while, and I can't help but cheer for the image and photo API pioneer.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dump-truck.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have a long, winding history of database administration in my past. I've been managing databases since my first job working on school district databases in the State of Oregon in 1988.  So I've been that database administrator you are asking for data access from, and I've personally managed and interacted with too many of these DBAs to keep track.</p>
<p>I was discussing strategies for getting access to your organizations central database today, and realized I don't have enough of these data acquisition stories on API Evangelist.</p>
<p>This data access quest will start with a burning need to build a website, mobile app or provide access to a 3rd party partner to some data. You know that this data is in your organizations database, all you need is access to make your project come to life.</p>
<p>In many organizations this can be easier said than done. There could be numerous reasons why this will be difficult ranging from technical to political, and be fuly prepared for it to often be political, masked as technical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Database access bottlenecks can range from security concerns to cranky, unfriendly DBAs or possibly just that the central database system has been in operation for many years and cannot handle large number of additional requests.</p>
<p>Unwinding the politics of database access can often be more time consuming than the technical side of database access.  In many organizations your time is better spent just getting what you need and moving on.  Make it only about access, and not looking to change the legacy process.</p>
<p>This legacy is why the most common way of getting at your organizations data will be a data dump to a network or FTP location, in a CSV, XML or JSON format. If your database administrator offers this to you, take it.  You can make use of this, design the application you need need, without the headache of battling to change things or getting direct access.</p>
<p>A data dump is a great for DBA's to give you the data you requested, but offload the processing and responsibility to someone else. So take it, if it will meet your minimal requirements.</p>
<p>Once you get your data dump, build your applications datastore, API and site or application. Then at a later date, you can take your blueprint and sell it back to your database administrator, IT or further up the management chain, on how things can be done better.</p>
<p>While a data dump may not be optimal, it might be all you can get for now. A great deal of education of IT and database folks is needed, to help them understand that APIs are not all publicly available like Twitter, and they actually provide much granular level security and access than traditional IT access levels.  But we have many years of education to occur before we will change the tides.</p>
<p>So take that data dump, build your own API and application and make evolving IT a separate battle from your project goals.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/download.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've had so many discussions on this topic, I felt like I had written a post on it, but when the topic came up again today, I realized I hadn't.  This is a regular conversation I get into with open data folks, regarding whether you should deploy open data as download vs an API.</p>
<p>I'll spare you having to read my entire rant, the answer is if you can, both. You should always provide a full data download, and additionally API access when the resources are available. There is no versus argument, there are scenarios where both are valuable and offer benefits over the other.</p>
<p>As a developer, I just want quick, complete access to data. I'm always in a hurry to just get to work, and I have the skills to parse, store, transform this data for whatever reason I will need. So let's just get to work.  Give me a download and get the hell out of my way. Pretty straight forward logic.  This is all true, but it is a very short-sighted, narrowly focused perspective and shouldn't impede larger, long term goals around data acquisition, management and access.</p>
<p>Taking your data, keying it up, and asking users to request a key and access via an API, might be a wall for the eager alpha dev, but there are many that could benefit from well thought out API end points, search &amp; filtering tools and the ability to offload all operations to someone else. Not all developers will be equipped to deal with the overhead of a full download.</p>
<p>Looking at it from a different vantage point, as a steward of data, an API can provide you with some very granular analytics on how people are using your data or even, not properly using your data. This valuable insight can provide an extreme amount of value in the future of how you gather your data, organize and make accessible. This is something you will never get from a single bulk download.</p>
<p>Many data folks argue that you can just rely on forums, IRC, Twitter to get feedback on this, no API needed.  Again this is the single perspective from an alpha developer who will actively participate in these channels and offer insight. In reality, this is a small percentage of any ecosystem, and in my experience users don't usually offer feedback.</p>
<p>Secondarily if you are dealing with large datasets and large user bases, dealing with human feedback channels are expensive, something that can also done with API analytics in a cost effective, scalable way. And don't think I'm arguing for not using these channels, I'm saying don't overburden them unnecessarily. They are still very important.</p>
<p>The best example of this, that I use in the wild, is with U.S. Census Data. A couple years ago I had conversations with database folk at the Census, and asked them their thoughts on how innovators like Google are using census data for flu tracking, and news outlets are merging with their data to track on politics, immigration and other relevant issues. The response was, "we are familiar with some of this, but honestly haven't heard of many of these usage scenarios".</p>
<p>I asked why they don't launch an API alongside of downloads, require developers to get a key, then utilize API analytics to provide insight into other use cases around census data. You still don't have visibility into all use cases, but you'd get another group of interesting integrations.</p>
<p>The response was quickly, NO! The Census has to balance the trust of being gatherers and keepers of this data, we can't lock it up or apply any interpretation on top of the data. We need to remain a neutral party. (They now have an API, but that is another story)</p>
<p>Ok. I get that.  But don't you want to make the census a more efficient process? Possibly completely digital? Or be able to gather new data points that could help people better understand health, educational, race or other issues that are reflected in our society?  An API isn't always about control (it can be), an API can be about understanding and empower sensible stewardship of data, providing the insight you might need to make the process better.</p>
<p>Every person I've had this discussion with is coming from an alpha developers perspective, who quickly wants access to data and has the skills and resources to get it done. They are not thinking about the rest of developers, or the stewards of this data and the lifelong process that goes into making data acquisition, transformation and publishing better for everyone involved.</p>
<p>So when you are thinking about data download vs. API, remember, if you have the resources, you should do both. A download is a great place to start, but the overall health of your data will be better off if you can introduce the more granular level access and the measurement that an API can deliver.</p>

<p>I'm rapidly expanding the areas I track on in the world of APIs, trying to understand the myriad ways APIs are influencing <a title="interoperability between companies and platforms" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">interoperability between companies and platforms</a>, being <a title="applied alongside voice" href="http://voice.apievangelist.com">applied alongside voice</a> or used in <a title="automobiles" href="http://automobile.apievangelist.com/">automobiles</a>,&nbsp;our <a title="homes" href="http://home.apievangelist.com">homes</a>, and beyond.</p>
<p>One area I'm currently researching, is on API usage in the very hyped world of data. I'm wading through numerous startups, looking for innovative approaches to data + APIs. One specific area of this research, that I'm hoping to have published soon is around API driven data analytics.</p>
<p>To provide a quick glimpse into what I mean when I talk about the future of data analytic APIs, I wanted to showcase two startups that resemble what I see coming down the pipes:</p>

</table>
<p>While these companies are providing pretty straightforward analytic solutions that run in the cloud, what I find innovative is their flexible data sources. Much like <a title="reciprocity providers are evolving ETL (Extract Transfer Load)" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">reciprocity providers are evolving ETL (Extract Transfer Load)</a>, moving beyond just internal data sources, to API driven cloud sources--this new breed of analytics providers are allowing you to visualize your data, directly from the cloud platforms where the data is generated and stored.</p>
<p>As more of our personal and professional lives move into the clouds, we are going to need new ways to visualize and find insight across the huge amounts of data we are generating daily, directly from these sources. This new breed of API driven analytic companies are going to help us get there.</p>
<p>Look for more research published on this in the near future.</p>

<p>As an evangelist, your responsibility is to get the word out about an API, and provide users with the resources they will need to be successful.</p>
<p>While executing on your evangelism strategy, there are numerous ways to generate stories for your blog, but one of my favorite approaches is to cherry pick the best issues on your Github repositories.</p>
<p>If you are like me, your <a title="using Github repos to manage everything from documentation and code samples to presentations and terms of use" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">using Github repos to manage everything from documentation and code samples to presentations and terms of use</a>. One of the perks of using Github, is you immediately gain the benefits of the Github issue management system.</p>
<p>While many of the issues submitted on your Github repos will be mundane and not very story-worthy. Always keep an eye out for ones that are ripe for picking and turning into an actual stories for your blog and social media accounts.</p>
<p>Earlier today, I received some great feedback via the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist/issues">issue management system on the API Evangelist repo</a>.  Ben Balter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@benbalter</a>) from Github recommended that I <a title="use a permalink frontmatter to simplify my file structure" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/2013/07/17/jekyll-use-permalink-frontmatter-to-simplify-file-structure/">use a permalink frontmatter to simplify my file structure</a>. In my migration from a PHP blog to using Jekyll on Github Pages, I hadn't considered this, and when I learn something new, I want to share it by crafting into a story and posting it on the blog.</p>
<p>Not only will this Github issue become a story, providing much needed SEO and education for my users, I will also turn this into a more structured resource, and provide as part of future educational content.</p>
<p>Pulling stories and educational content from relevant Github issues can be a great way to generate valuable content for your platform, and if it is done in real-time it isn't really that much work.</p>

<p>Our federal government is working on the next iteration of <a title="Data.gov" href="http://data.gov">Data.gov</a>, and just published a first look at what is being called <a href="http://next.data.gov/">Next.Data.Gov</a>. This next version is meant to build off the momentum of the recent <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/">open data policy</a>, which is looking to embed open data practices across our federal government, changing the way it operates.</p>
<p>To plan for the next iteration of Data.gov, the General Services Administration (GSA), a handful of Presidential Innovation Fellows, and OSTP staff studied usage patterns from the last version, and discovered that people were hungry for more examples of how government data is used. Equipped with this understanding, they are making sure the next version included a communication stream that will enable each data community to communicate how datasets are being used and making an impact.</p>
<p>The Data.Gov team also updated the search, adding data visualizations using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, used  open source fonts and implemented a responsive design for Next.Data.Gov.  Next.Data.Gov is also built on top of both Wordpress and CKAN, delivering the CMS and data management capabilities, using proven open source tools.</p>
<p>Beyond the approach to requirements gather, responsive design and adopting open source tools, what I think is the most important aspect of Next.Data.Gov is that the planning, design and deployment process is open and collaborative--which has the potential to alter how our government conducts business on a daily business.</p>
<p>The next iteration of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OUR</span></strong> federal government data portal is being planned publicly using Github, Quora and Twitter. Historically much of our government planning process is done behind closed doors, by government agencies, with the assistance of contractors. The innovation I'm seeing come from washington in the form of <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/">Open Data Policy</a>, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/healthcaregov-code-developed-by-the-people-and-for-the-people-released-back-to-the-people/277295/">Healthcare.gov</a> and now Next.Data.Gov makes me very optimistic for the future of how our government works, and I am honored to be going to DC to help.</p>
<p>If we can tackle the process of opening up government, agency by agency, project by project, make the process as open and collaborative as possible, we will be able to tackle this together. These sites, applications and platforms are not just using open data, open APIs and open source--the process for planning, deployment and management is an open, collaborative process between government, private sector and the public.</p>
<p>Make sure and get involved, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is up to all of us</span> to make sure this works.</p>

<p>When I first started API Evangelist, I quickly saw that there was more to this whole API game, beyond just the technology. Simple, logical, technological solutions like REST and JSON are essential, but there was more to the success of an API than just the tech behind.</p>
<p>After looking at hundreds of the most successful APIs, one pattern for success consistently emerged, storytelling. The most successful API platforms like Amazon, Twitter and Twilio all had one thing in common, stories were told about how their APIs were being used, and the value that was created.</p>
<p>While reading the story <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/16/the-next-iteration-of-government-data/">around the Federal Government redesign of Data.gov</a> I was happy to see a major revelation that came from requirements gathering for the next iteration called <a title="Next.Data.Gov" href="http://Next.Data.Gov">Next.Data.Gov</a>. Where after studying usage patterns around <a href="http://data.gov">Data.gov</a>, the redesign team found that many visitors were hungry for stories of how government data was being used, looking for clear examples of the potential of open government data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storytelling is essential for any open data or API platform. Consumers need examples of how data and resources are currently being used. A process that will stimulate the imagination and increase the potential for new ideas and development.</p>
<p>I can't stress enough the importance of storytelling. If you do not have the resources to tell your own stories, make sure there are ways that the community can tell their own stories.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter how solid your technological implementation is, if there aren't stories for users to discover and learn about the potential of open data and API resources, even the best platform implementation will fail.</p>
<p>So go forth and tell the stories of your API, and the value it has created.</p>

This is an evolution of earlier thoughts I've had around <a title="virtualized API stacks" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.docker.io/">Docker - The Linux Container Engine</a></strong><br />Docker is an open-source engine which automates the deployment of applications as highly portable, self-sufficient containers. Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic, allowing them to run anywhere, freeing you from having to use a particular language, framework or packaging system--making them great building blocks for deploying and scaling web apps, databases and backend services without depending on a particular stack or provider.</p>
<p><a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/heroku/heroku-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/7/10/heroku-pipelines-beta">Heroku - Application Instances with Portable Features and Dependencies</a></strong><br />Heroku fork lets you create unique, running instances of existing applications in a single command, making it fast and simple to set up homogenous development, staging and production environments. Heroku pipelines then lets you define the relationship between apps and easily promote  from one app to another using what is known as a "slug". On Heroku, a slug is a bundle of your source, fetched dependencies, the language runtime, and compiled/generated output of the build system, ready for execution in development or production environments.</p>
<p><a href="http://stackmob.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/stackmob/stackmob-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://blog.stackmob.com/2013/07/ready-set-deploy-with-stackmob-apps/">StackMob - BaaS Development and Production Workflows</a></strong><br /> StackMob has its own unique approach application development workflow which includes use integrated SDKs, and custom configuration for establishing an applications separate development and production environments. Then using this separate environment, Stackmob offers multiple concurrent APIs in production through the use of API snapshots which ensures backwards compatibility of your app over time.</p>
<p>Docker, definitely offers the widest opportunity for what I'm talking about because it is an open source container solution. But it is interesting to see how Heroku is applying this concept to app management at the PaaS level, and how Stackmob is providing a very portable, flexible and backwards compatible API stack for use at the BaaS level.</p>
<p>While we have a long way to go, I think we are getting closer to being able to easily define, meaningful stacks of API resources. I envision a future where I can set out to build an app, bring together exactly the API driven resources I will need from private and public resources, into a single virtualized stack.</p>
<table cellpadding="5" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/docker/lego_docker.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://docker.io">Borrowed from Docker Site</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As a developer I will be able to deploy this stack in development or production environments, take advantage of single application authentication approach without having to go out to each API and get separate application tokens.</p>
<p>Virtualized API resource stacks will have all the monitoring, versioning, scalability I will need allowing me to run them in any environment, helping me keep track of changes and evolution not just in the stack of resources, but also my applications.</p>
<p>These virtualized stacks can be designed for web, mobile or tablets as well as any Internet of Things implementation providing me with instant, secure, modular backends for home, car, sensor and any Internet connected object we can dream up in the future.</p>

<p>I was working my way through all the Dropbox news that came out of the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/dbx">DBX Conference</a> over the weekend. There was some pretty savvy moves by the cloud storage provider, continuing its evolution towards being the default storage for web and mobile applications.</p>
<p>After reading this weekend, I have three key stories still open in tabs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/blog/43/the-datastore-api-a-new-way-to-store-and-sync-app-data">The Datastore API: a new way to store and sync app data</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Dropbox is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/24/dropbox-as-your-apps-default-file-system/">already the preferred choice for app storage system</a> for many developers, but with the introduction of the datastore API, they will definitely be stepping up the integration of Dropbox into future apps.</p>
<p>For the end users, the ability to save files to dropbox and choose files from their mobile devices will only increase their demand for native Dropbox functionality in web and mobile apps--feeding the cycle.</p>
<p>The combination of making developers lives easier, while also providing the features that end users needs will continue to establish Dropbox as a default file system API for application developers.</p>
<p>Makes you consider how other APIs can emulate some of what Dropbox is dish'n.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/07/14/simple-api-example-company-listing/">Simple API Example: Company Listing</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2013</span>
        <p>I'm always looking for dead simple examples of what an API is to help average folk understand what APIs are, and how they can be applied in their worlds.</p>
<p>My current research on <a title="BaaS" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">backend as a service providers (BaaS)</a> providers a great example. On my research site i provide listing of BaaS providers for my readers:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/baas/example-api-baas.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>This listing of companies is a pretty common occurence on the web. As a web developer, if I want to show this listing I use HTML, which is markup that provides a visual formatting for this listing:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/baas/example-api-baas-html.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>HTML makes content presentable for humans. Now if I want to make this same content available for other web sites and applications, instead of using HTML, I will use another open format called JSON, which is easy for other computers and applications to consume.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/baas/example-api-baas-json.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>In this particular case, I provide an HTML listing of BaaS providers, as well as a JSON listing. I actually use the JSON file to display the HTML, using a JavaScript templating library called <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to a static HTML and JSON listing of BaaS providers, I also provide an API which returns the same content as the JSON file, but allows you to do queries and get only the BaaS companies you are looking for. All of my data works this wa by providing:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hacker-storytelling/machine-readable-toolbar.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>HTML</strong> - An HTML listing meant for humans to view.</li>
<li><strong>JSON</strong> - A JSON listing meant for developers to use in other sites and apps.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong> - An API allowing querying, filtering and other dynamic access.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process always starts with API driven data, and I produce the HTML from my APIs. This is the beauty of API first. You can generate your web content from it, being the first user of all your APIs. Then encourage others to syndicate content by providing them with simple scripts for displaying HTML listings, driven from JSON and / or your API.</p>
<p>The only difference between web site content and an API is the resulting output, if it is a website--we use HTML. If its an API--we use JSON. Both websites and APIs using the same mechanisms of the web, specifically HTTP to deliver this data.</p>
<p>To provide machine readable JSON version of your content, or even more dynamic representations via APIs, you don't need special technology or skills. If you are developing websites, you have the skills to make the same content machine readable and potentially much more syndicatable, re-usable and accessible with APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hacker-storytelling/open-machine-readable.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>The primary reason I'm switching all of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/01/the-expanding-api-evangelist-network/">35+ research projects</a> in the API space to my new <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format, is to make everything I do open and machine readable by default.</p>
<p>Every project I'm working on is a Github project, with the public side of the research always available via an API Evangelist subdomain and pointed at a Github page. I publish a series of static pages, wrapped in an API evangelist template, combined with a blog to help organize my curated news and analysis in a chronological way.</p>
<p>Along with all the pages and blog I make all data available as JSON files, which I display across the research project using JavaScript templates.  My goal is to make every bit of my research machine readable by default, and ensure the widest possible re-use and distribution.</p>
<p>One active example of this in the wild, is my r<a title="Backend as a service" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">esearch around backend as a service</a>, also known as Baas. I've been monitoring all the providers in the space for the last year, and tracking on some of the common building blocks they use, much like I have been doing with APIs for last three years.</p>
<p>As part of my BaaS research I've published two datasets:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="BaaS Providers" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/companies.html">BaaS Providers</a></li>
<li><a title="Common Building Blocks of BaaS Providers" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">Building Blocks</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hacker-storytelling/machine-readable-toolbar.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>You can view the data on the website, using JavaScript templates that display the JSON data on HTML pages. When you view the page that lists the BaaS providers or the common BaaS building blocks, you can choose to get at the data behind the display as JSON, via API, as well as being able to grab the script I use to display the JSON data.</p>
<p>All of my research is ongoing, and I publish news, analysis and new companies and research on a regular basis. My goal with this evolving approach, is to remove machine readable from being after thought, making it default in all my work.</p>
<p>With data available via JSON and API, everything published publicly via Github, in lightweight formats like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON, combined with a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY licensing</a>, everything in my world is open and machine readable by default.</p>

<p>At API Evangelist I define things in terms of building blocks, meant to establish, easy to understand modules you can pick and choose from as part of any strategy, including API management. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2010 I started API Evangelist as a research project to look at how the top 250 popular APIs were doing business. I spent the summer of 2010 looking at these API providers and established a list of building blocks I found each provider using to manage their API operations.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining this list for 3 years now, looking at over 9,000 APIs and assessing the building blocks used by the top 2,000 APIs. I've tried to standardize these and establish a potential list that any API provider could consider when planning their own API management strategy.</p>
<p>These are the most common examples of API management building blocks.</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-voice/Tag-Cloud-API-Voice.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I started API Voice because I believe the politics of APIs is one of the most important areas that will make or break the API space.  APIs are not just technical.  There are a wide range of political issues facing companies when it comes to APIs.</p>
<p>The politics of APIs can range from terms of service issues to potential government regulation.  We are seeing the politics of APIs play out in the Twitter ecosystem and in the U.S. legal system with Oracle vs. Google.</p>
<p>My understanding of the politics of APIs still evolving.  I started API Voice in May 2012 to help me understand it more.  I&rsquo;m still trying to quantify all the areas, but so far the politics of APIs can include terms of use, data portability, branding, privacy, business models, service level agreements (SLA), acquisitions, copyright, regulation, patent and the ubiquitous, magical term &ldquo;open&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When I started <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I wanted to provide a platform for research into the business of APIs.  Over two years I&rsquo;ve begun to solidify some perspective on the space, and form clear opinions around potential best practices.  With API Voice, I want to do the same for the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>At this point, all I can do is write about things as they unfold--as APIs are acquired and as they make the terms of service changes that impact developers.  API Voice is in its infancy, and I will be working to cover as many of what unfolds in 2013 as I can.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel that 2013 is going to be a big year when it comes to the politics of APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/openi/openi-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with an important group in the European Union called <a title="OPENi" href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/">OPENi</a>, which is aiming to be an open-source, web-based, framework for integrating applications with cloud-based services via APIs. Straight from the organization's mouth:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi aims at inspiring innovation in the European mobile applications industry, by radically improving the interoperability of cloud-based services and trust in personal cloud storage through the development of a consumer-centric, open source mobile cloud applications platform.</em></blockquote>
<p>I will be providing feedback and guidance as a member of the group's user advisory board. While on the call today, there was a mention of concerns around being seen as the usual, heavy handed EU entity that is too focused on user privacy and ownership, which could prevent the group from being well received, but also ignore the economic opportunities APIs and interoperability afford businesses, developers and end users.</p>
<p>This is a reminder for me of how EU tech companies, and the countries where they reside, are often perceived around the globe and here in the US. But also stands in stark contrast to the illness I see from the Silicon Valley, and U.S side of the discussion. In a world where everything is about economic opportunity, and the data in these API pipes are the new oil, aka the new resource, that is meant to be extracted, with little or no concern for privacy and ownership of the end-users.</p>
<p>In 2014, there is a huge opportunity for all of us to meet in the middle, acknowledging that there is great economic opportunity around APIs, cloud services, interoperability and the data that flows between platforms. But there is even greater economic opportunity if we acknowledge and respect the privacy, ownership of users of the web, mobile and Internet of Things we develop in the cloud.</p>
<p>I would also add a 3rd dimension to this discussion. That there is also a massive non-commercial opportunity for APIs, interoperability and cloud services. When it comes to more efficient government, healthcare, education, journalism, media  and other aspects of our society, if we can better educate end-users, developers and platform owners while also improve technological approaches by honing concepts like hypermedia, licensing and ownership models defined on top of oAuth--everyone in the game will benefit.</p>
<p>There is a lot at stake right now. <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/06/27/i-dont-see-things-as-black-or-white/">It isn't black or white, but many, may shades of gray</a>. It is not all about privacy and ownership, or all about making money. APIs enable interoperability, data portability, transparency and openness that can really benefit society as well as open up opportunities for economic growth for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Even after 3 years doing this, I still get very hopeful for the potential of APIs on the global landscape. I predict 2014 will be a critical year.</p>

<p>The world of API management is expanding, and to support this growth I've broke up my research into three separate buckets: <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, <a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a> and <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a>.</p>
<p>Zooming in on API deployment, one of the ares I'm looking to educate the masses about, is quick and dirty API deployment using existing PaaS. Providing ways for companies, and their internal problem owners to rapidly deploy APIs via their existing tools and services.</p>
<p>One great example I recently found is from Jeff Douglas (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeffdonthemic">@jeffdonthemic</a>), Platform Architect <a title="Cloudspokes" href="https://twitter.com/CloudSpokes">@CloudSpokes</a> &amp; Sr. Tech. Consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/Appirio">@Appirio</a>, on <a href="http://blog.jeffdouglas.com/2013/07/02/build-a-public-api-on-force-com/">using Heroku to deploy an API from your Salesforce organization</a>. Jeff's walkthrough is a little choppy, but it is full of extremely valuable nuggets of information, and he says he's working on a more polished version of it to present.</p>
<p>The approach is pretty straightforward. You are simply deploying an API on Heroku, that uses code to make calls to your Salesforce account via the Salesforce Apex API.  The API you launch on the Heroku PaaS platform will abstract away your custom code that you use to pull specific Salesforce resources, allowing you to scale and securely deliver existing data in your Salesforce platform, and ultimately use Saleforce as an administrative interface for your API(s).</p>
<p>Jeff gives examples of how you can do this in Ruby, Node.js and even Java, and talks about approaches to versioning the API and providing documentation.  He also recommends that for higher traffic APIs you should look at existing <a title="API management companies" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API management companies</a> to help you secure, meter, develop service packages, and provide you with billing and analytics options.</p>
<p>I'd like to see starter kits developed in PHP, Python, Ruby, Node and Java that allow for quick API deployment using data from Saleforce on not just Heroku, but other popular PaaS platforms like Amazon and Google.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies who use Salesforce to manage vital resources, and providing the business and marketing folks within these organizations with blueprints to quickly make these resources available via APIs, is important to equipping them to solve the big data and mobile challenges they are facing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/forkme-right-red.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Simple, embeddable tools can be one of the most powerful tool in an API evangelists toolbox.  While there was a wide variety of forces that were at play in the social API evolution, contributing to the success of Twitter and Facebook, embeddable buttons, badgers widgets definitely played a leading role.</p>
<p>One embeddable implementation that will go down in history alongside the Twitter share button and Facebook like button, is the <a href="https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons">Github Ribbon</a>. The Github Ribbon is the thin little ribbon you are increasingly seeing on projects, sites and applications (notice them rolling out across the <a title="API Evangelist Network" href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>), letting you know you that a site's source is available on Github, and available for you to download or fork.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons">Github has created a simple page where you can find an assortment of embeddable Github Ribbons</a>, in multiple colors and positioning. If you are not satisfied with the colors, they also provide the PSD and even the original font that is used. A complete, fully branded, embeddable tool that encourages use.</p>
<p>While I actually prefer the simplicity of the Github Ribbons, my only suggestion to Github would be to either provide JavaScript version or tracking image version, that would allow each Github Ribbon to ping home. You could also integrate with the Github API to offer tighter repository integration. Think of the network visualizations you could create, mapping out the distributed world of Github implementations across languages, countries, etc.</p>
<p>Even without the tracking and API integration, Github Ribbons is an extremely powerful approach to branding, and great example of using embeddable tools in the wild.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2013</span>
        <p>APIs are providing much needed access and visibility into the backend technology that is increasingly driving our desktops, laptops, mobile phones and beginning its migration into our homes, cars and our personal self. APIs aren't just something for developers to play with, they crack open the often black box of IT and technology, making it accessible to everyone.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-transparency-1.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Without APIs, none of this happens. APIs provide visibility into what many businesses would like to keep hidden from us, taking away our privacy, ownership and ability to hold companies, government and developers accountable for what they do with our personal and private data, and ultimately how they extract value for our world.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-transparency-2.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>APIs are not perfect, they can be used for bad, and just because a company has an API, doesn't mean everything is on the up and up. However APIs introduce the ability for us to have 3 legged conversations, where platforms, 3rd parties and end users can have conversations about how are worlds are being connected and accessed in real-time.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-three-legged-v2.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>These conversations are critical to how our increasingly technology driven world will evolve. Technology can be good when it is applied in sensible, safe wayss, taking into consideration all parties involved. Without the oxygen and sunlight introduced by APIs, infections can be introduced that can prove bad for users, developers and even deadly to the overall platform.</p>
<p>I am all for APIs being used in our desktop, laptop and mobile computing and within the Internet of Things that is taking hold of our cars, homes and even our bodies. But let's make sure we do it in a way that promotes the healthiest ecosystems for everyone involved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We will all be better off for it!</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-square.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have <a title="Netflix API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">written about the well publicized failure of the Netflix public API</a>&nbsp;before, and how in the API space things are often not what they seem. By my measurement Netflix is a massive API success story, it is just not the classsic open API success story we all really want to be true.</p>
<p>In the end the experiment that was the Netflix API didn't pan out, but that is ok.  Netflix has found success with APIs internally, something I think will be the case with the majority of companies embarking on an API odyssey. And with Netflix continuing to tell the story of their successes and failures, everyone can learn from their hard work.</p>
<p>As I continue to follow the Netflix API story, I'm seeing new narrative emerge, one that is equally about open source software, than about open APIs. When I do my monitoring I am constantly seeing new blog posts coming from the Netflix tech blog, announcing the latest OSS release from the Netflix tech team.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/netflix/netflix-open-source-center.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Netflix is up to 34 public repositories currently, and before you dig into the details of their releases, Netflix also wins in the presentation of their Github open source site. Nice job!!</p>
<p>I wish someone would dive deeper into everything Netflix is releasing.  At first glance it looks like like everything I have been asking for when it comes to open source software for the API management space. Netflix isn't in the space of offering API management as a service, but they run one of the biggest API platforms out there--resulting in some serious skills, experience and technology.</p>
<p>If I had more time I'd go through the Netflix Open Source Center and see how it all applies to the larger API picture. As with the rest of the Netflix story, I'm sure there are some great lessons in what they are producing.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/07/02/api-evangelist-healthcaregov-and-hacker-storytelling/">API Evangelist, Healthcare.gov and Hacker Storytelling</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://github.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been slowly evolving API Evangelist from a single site, into an interconnected network of individual API projects.  API Evangelist started as a research project back in July 2010, making its shift to be a network of smaller, inter-connected research projects is fitting.</p>
<p>While API Evangelist currently still runs on my home brew CMS, shortly it will finish the migration to completely run on Github, making it merely a "hollywood front" for what is c<a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/07/01/the-expanding-api-evangelist-network/">urrently 37+ API related, living research projects</a> of mine.</p>
<p>I call my evolving approach to projects, <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>. I made up the name, but the approach is borrowed from several other philosophies which starts with concept of data journalism, but then has also evolved from conversations last year in Washington DC from very smart folks including Ben Balter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a>), Gray Brooks (<a href="https://twitter.com/gbinal">@gbinal)</a>, and the very forward thinking work of the <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a> team.  Then of course I add my own style and approach to what I've learned.</p>
<p>As I move my own network of research projects to run on Github, using this new approach, I'm also seeing other positive signs coming out of Washington on the same front.  First the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/">White House Open Data Policy</a> released in May was created and published on Github, but then I just finished reading <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/healthcaregov-code-developed-by-the-people-and-for-the-people-released-back-to-the-people/277295/">Healthcare.gov: Code Developed by the People and for the People, Released Back to the People</a>, by Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>). His post outlines how the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)launched Healthcare.gov to support the Affordable Care Act -- AKA "Obamacare".  The website was built iteratively, in public, over the last couple months and it was completely done using Github, using a similar approach to my Hacker Storytelling.  Seeing all of this, really makes me hopeful for my next year in Washington.</p>
<p>Alex does an amazing job of telling the story behind Healthcare.gov, I highly recommend reading his post. After reading, I wanted take a fresh walk through my approach, and talk about the importance of this new approach managing my projects, that I think will change the web, how we govern and conduct business.</p>
<p>My personal approach is derived from a need to quickly turn research into public stories, allowing people to take my work and put it to use in their worlds. Since my mission is to educate the masses of the benefits of APIs, and reach the largest audience possible, I needed a new approach that was fast, efficient and scaled--the result is Hacker Storytelling.</p>
<p>To manage my projects and tell my stories, I'm using a handful of building blocks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blog Posts</li>
<li>Static Pages </li>
<li>Widgets</li>
<li>Open Data</li>
<li>Presentations</li>
</ul>
<p>The best part about these building blocks is that they only use, lightweight, open protocols:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>JSON</li>
</ul>
<p>Each project becomes an open source repository, that I host at Github. Some projects start as private repositories, but if possible <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EVERYTHING</strong></span> becomes public.  If you are unfamiliar with how Github and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> works, Github is a cloud service that provides version control for code. However since code is usually just files, you can apply the same open source code process to web site or documents you can build with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.</p>
<p>I don't know about you. But I can build some pretty fast websites, prototype applications and even full blown production apps in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.  If you want to see the extreme version of what I'm doing, head over to <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a> and see what they are up to.  They are producing some mind blowing projects, using this approach</p>
<p>The really powerful thing about all of this, is this can run anywhere. You can run the <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2011/08/Jekyll-amazon-s3.html">same configuration of site on Amazon S3</a>, Dropbox, or anywhere you can setup hosting. This isn't just something for alpha geeks, look closer at the Amazon S3 example, that is the CTO of Amazon running his blog using this approach.</p>
<p><strong><em>So why am I doing this?</em></strong> There are so many reason, and to help me wrap my head further around them, I thought I would take a crack at listing as many as I could.</p>
<p><strong>Decoupling</strong> <br />This approach to my research and storytelling has allowed me to decouple the individuals pieces of my original API Evangelist work, which after three years has become very bloated.  I have a lot of content and structured data about the API industry. This has allowed me to decouple one very big project into 35 smaller projects, with the potential for many more in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Planning</strong> <br />When I kick off a new project, I start off the planning process with a new Github repository, with a fresh README file.  Then using the native Github features I can make the project public or private and invite other people to join me in the planning process.  The README quickly becomes an outline, giving a backbone to my project.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong> <br />Once a project has been kicked off, I kick of researching and publishing all notes, bookmarks and other relevant assets to Github after each session.  Pretty soon there is a wealth of knowledge located within the repository, with every step of the way versioned, allowing me to manage additions, removals and potential conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong> <br />Github has made the process of developing open source software, a social adventure.  You can create repositories within individual Github accounts or underneath the umbrella of an organization.  You can invite any other Github user to participate in the process, using open source software process, built into Github. Once you make public, you can also add <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and solicit public comments, if if so desired.</p>
<p><strong>Versioned</strong> <br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> is the central core of Github. Git was developed by Linus Torvalds to help him manage the developed of the open source operating system, Linux. Every document that is submitted to a Git(hub) repository, is versioned, allowing you to manage changes, accept contributions and even roll back to earlier versions when necessary. Git is well suited to open source, collaborative software development, but also works well for many other types of projects as well.</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling</strong> <br />My approach, that of <a href="http://Healthcare.gov">Healthcare.gov</a>, and Development Seed all uses <a href="/admin/blog/design.apievangelist.com">Jekyll</a> alongside each project deployment.  Jekyll is a simple, blog aware static site framework that runs very well on Github. Jekyll gives you a very simple, but powerful way to manage your pages as well as maintain a blog.  This has changed my view of what a blog is for, making it as simple as four chronological journal entries for a single project or powering the 800+ blog entries of API Evangelist.  Jekyll was actually developed by Tom Preston-Warner, the founder of Github, but the framework is so univeral it can run anywhere such as Amazon S3 and Dropbox.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong> <br />While this approach is not for everyone. I enjoy making projects open by default from birth to death. Hosting on Github, allowing it to be licensed openly and allowing collaboration and public input makes for a healthier overall project.  Transparency can let the sunlight into any process, providing a sort of disinfectant to the overall process. Something I feel is essential in all my work.</p>
<p><strong>Living Projects </strong><br />Most of the projects I embark on will be living, allowing me to keep updated weekly, monthly or as often as necessary.  Because I can open up projects to collaborators and public feedback, it opens up my work to even live beyond the attention I can give the project.  I can even transfer ownership and administration of a project to someone else, or they can fork my work and take in an entirely new direction, breathing life into my work I could never imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Portable</strong> <br />Each Github repository can be forked or downloaded as a zip file.  Allowing the entire project to be moved, unpacked and setup at a new location--not in hours but often in minutes. This type of portability is essential in this crazy, cloud based world we've created for ourselves.  It also allows me to easily deploy a project within the firewall of a company or government agency.</p>
<p><strong>Syndication</strong> <br />Github possesses one of the most powerful syndication tools, which is called "forking". Any Github user can fork one of my projects and set to work making it their own. Adding to it, cleaning it up and when appropriate make "pull requests" back to the original project, which allows me potentially to accept their work back into the central copy. After I add common social sharing tools, and you consider the native social features built into Github, this approach offers unlimited potential for syndication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics</strong> <br />Each project I fire up, gets Google Analytics added. Allowing me to track all traffic and usage of my projects. Beyond the page views, visits and other common metrics, Github gives me a whole other layer of metrics for tracking how many favorites, forks, downloads, commits and other vital data about how projects are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Common Formats </strong><br />Every project I build uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON. All of these common formats can be opened by simple text editors and do not require any proprietary software to create, access or edit. HTML and CSS is very accessible to many, and depending on how tech savvy you are, JavaScript and JSON are pretty easy to wield, with a little training.</p>
<p><strong>Open By Default </strong><br />Everything is open by default. Publicly available, collaboration, open formats and open licenses go a long way in setting the right tone for a project. Open by default takes away a lot of stress for me, and opens projects up for the widest possible collaboration, re-use, distribution and ultimately attribution to me and my work.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Readable By Default </strong><br />All data is stored via simple, lightweight JSON files. Every listing, chart, graph within a project has a JSON data source. The entire contents of a project can have a simple JSON manifest, allowing programmatic indexing of a project's content and data sources.  Machine readable by default, using JSON has changed the way I look at data management.</p>
<p><strong>Scalable</strong> <br />I do not have to scale the infrastructure for any my projects. I've run IT infrastructure for years and very capable in doing this for myself, but I don't have time. All projects automatically are scaled as needed, to meet, not just my projects demands, but everyone on the platform. For me, the backend has been reduced to my internal systems and a handful of APIs. Everything that is public is automatically scaled in the clouds.</p>
<p><strong>Speed</strong> <br />The usage of simple, light-weight open formats like HTML, CSS, JavaSCript and JSON. Plus all the benefits of the Github platform. Equal a pretty sweet opportunity for fast loading web pages. Everything is easily cached, providing for very fast page loads in addition to scalability. If projects are hosted on Amazon S3, there are additional opportunities for caching and distribution of content to regions around the globe using CloudFront.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong> <br />Along with the need to run back-end infrastructure, much of the concern with securing sites and applications goes away. I'm pretty confident that Github, Amazon and Dropbox have fairly decent security teams and with all projects being static sites and apps, using open formats, much of the opportunity for exploitation has been removed.</p>
<p><strong>Low Cost </strong><br />Github repositories are free, if they are public. Another incentive for being open by default. Even if you pay for repositories with Github, the costs are dollars each month. Amazon and Dropbox are both extremely affordable, further evolving past models for web hosting or rolling out costly infrastructure for projects. The cloud has enabled entirely new approaches deploying web sites, applications, as well as content and data oriented projects.</p>
<p><strong>Lifecycle</strong> <br />The entire life cycle of my projects has changed for the positive. I can start new projects, on a whim. Fire up new repository and generate an outline during planning stages, invite all participants and have a public site up in minutes. Some projects I work on for hours each week, others I give just minutes a month to make sure they have my latest research published. I can easily walk away from projects, passing the torch and potentially keeping a project alive.  Projects can be forked, downloaded and evolved, adding layers to the lifecycle that are totally out of my control. The potential for my research and stories to reach a larger audience has grown significantly, extending both the reach and the life of my work.</p>
<p><strong>Web Literacy </strong><br />When this approach is employed, each individual involved receives a healthy dose of web literacy. Introducing them to essential building blocks of our growing digital world, like DNS, HTML, CSS, JSON, Git and more.  The portability of this approach allows you to truly own your projects, enabling you to deploy them wherever you choose. Web literacy is critical in this day and age, for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering</strong>&nbsp;<br />For me, Hacker Storytelling has empowered me to do more research, tell more stories and reach a wider audience. I've only been doing it for six months. At first, all of this can seem daunting to learn, but once you get a grasp of all the building blocks at play, it can be very empowering.  It is something non-developers can employ to solve the problems they face everyday, in a way that encourages collaboration and even programmatic integration with other systems or projects.  It has the potential to empower each of us to innovate and work together in new ways.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> <br />Hacker Storytelling is my version of this new way to build sites and apps. Development Seed and the HHS are developing their own approach as well. While there are lot of common building blocks, each individual or organization can develop their own style and set of tools and building blocks that work best for them.</p>
<p>That is 21 reasons I'm moving my projects to this new approach to publishing sites and applications on the Internet.  I'm choosing to do this because it makes me more efficient at my research and storytelling, which is essential to my career.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to share my approach with as many people as I can.  I'm watching my girlfriend Audrey discover how easy it is to setup new projects, and publish her work there. Setting everything I listed above into motion for her world, developer her own approach.</p>
<p>I don't think this methodology is for everyone, but if you are interested I'm happy to share.  I will be adding more widgets and tools to my <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storyteling</a> project.  While also point you to other similar implementations like <a href="http://HealthCare.gov">HealthCare.gov</a>, and people who are innovating with this approach like <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>.</p>

<p>As the API universe expands, I'm trying my best to stay in tune with where its going and try to help people understand the space, whether you are a newbie or API veteran--I want you to find what you are looking for at API Evangelist.</p>
<p>To support the fast moving space, as well as my ADHD working style, I've broken up API Evangelist into individual projects. Each project runs using my <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format, which in short means each projects lives as a Githb repository, allowing me to publish the research, data, short form and long form content to an open source repository that anyone can browse, fork and download.</p>
<p>To help you (and me) see the entire API Evangelist network, i wanted to publish an outline of all 37 projects I'm curently working on:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">My goal with this new format that I've rolled out over the last six months, is to give me specific project areas to do research within, each week. Some projects will get love an attention, while others will simmer in the background--moving everything forward in small chunks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All of these projects are accessible via landing pages on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, which I will be keeping as the main portal for the business of APIs. &nbsp;You can also find my work on the politics of APIs at <a href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a>, and you can keep up with my weekly monitoring via <a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a>, which is the seed for all of these projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Each project is meant to produce the following output:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog Posts</strong> - Stories and analysis from each area of the API space</li>
<li><strong>Research Data</strong> - Lists of companies, individuals, APIs, tools and building blocks</li>
<li><strong>Research Links</strong> - Curated links to important work by others in the space</li>
<li><strong>Presentation / Talks</strong> - Presentations and talks I've given around the world</li>
<li><strong>White Papers</strong> - Long form, summary white papers providing overview of individual projects</li>
<li><strong>Blue Prints </strong>- Specific blue prints of how to execute specific campaigns within the API space</li>
</ul>
<p>The research for some of these projects is funded by my partner network, while much of it is done on my own steam. If you are interested in making sure specific projects happen, please <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">feel free to reach out and get involved</a>.</p>
<p>I will be adding projects in the future, and you may see some of the existing projects stagnate from time to time, when I run out of time, or it might be possible the space is not producing new work. Based upon page views, funding, time and other variables projects will rise to the top.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who supports what I'm doing, its been an amazing 3 years so far. I look forward to the next 3 years.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/06/29/trends-in-api-aggregation/">Trends in API Aggregation</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2013</span>
        <p>One trend in API usage I'm closely watching is the <a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">aggregation of APIs by a new wave of startups</a>. As the world adopts more cloud services, the need to aggregate content across multiple APIs is growing.</p>
<p>I'm currently tracking on <a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">15 API aggregators</a>, who focus on bringing together data and content in 10 areas:</p>
<p><a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/aggregation-trend.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>

<li>Financial</li>
<li>Government</li>
<li>Invoicing</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Notifications</li>
<li>Personal</li>
<li>Social</li>
</ul>
<p>The companies I'm watching on may provide other services, such as integration or automation between cloud services.  However I focus on the aggregation of content and data, and the creation of new, aggregated APIs across multiple services.</p>
<p>Some comapnies also provide entirely new APIs with data, features and functionality that can only be uncovered by aggregating across multiple services.</p>
<p>In 2013 we will continue seeing API aggregation providers emerge, providing a new layer on top of the most popular API services that we are quickly growing dependent on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webscript/webscript-io-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/06/23/a-great-time-at-api-days-san-francisco/">I was at API Days this weekend in San Francisco</a>, I managed to catch a handful of talks Saturday afternoon after I landed at OAK. While listening to each talk, I kept hearing one technical API building block, over and over--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">webhook</a>.</p>
<p>Webhooks are a common way for API providers to make API integration a two ways street for consumer. Developers, or even non-developers, can setup webhooks via common API platforms, and receive notifications about different events and activities that occur.</p>
<p>Webhooks are also a common tool for <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API automation and reciprocity platforms</a> like <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=38">Zapier</a> and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=39">IFTTT</a>.  Users can setup webhooks, that respond to just about any action across multiple, API driven platforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webscript/webscripts-io-webhook-script-example.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>After hearing webhooks mentioned so often, I wondered if anyone out there is offering web hook as a service (WHaaS) (LOL).  Sure enough, John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) pointed me to <a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank">webscript.io</a>.</p>
<p>Webscripts are short scripts, written in Lua, that run in the cloud servers, and can respond to any HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Exactly what I was looking for. I had heard of webscript.io before, but for some reason it didn't stick in my mind.  It is precisely the simple approach I was looking for, and has many common examples like sending emails, counters, parsing RSS and Tweeting.</p>
<p>I really like dead simple implementations like <a href="https://webscript.io/" target="_blank">webscript.io</a>, that solve real world problems in such granular, yet powerful ways.  Nice work <a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/instructurecon-2013/instructurecon-keynote-utah.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had several important things happen over the last week. One of them was sharing the stage for the first time with my partner in crime, Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>).</p>
<p>Although I spent most of the week in Washington DC, Tuesday night I flew out to Park City, UT and shared the stage Wednesday morning for a keynote with Audrey at <a title="InstructureCon" href="http://www.instructure.com/instructurecon">InstructureCon</a>, put on by the LMS platform <a title="LMS by Instructure" href="http://www.instructure.com/">Instructure</a>.</p>
<p>Audrey and I delivered a talk on education, the LMS and data portability.  Audrey opened up and closed out the talk, you can read <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/06/19/the-lms-as-portal-instructurecon/">her perspective on Hack Education</a>, but I wanted to make sure and provide the overview of my section, as described by Audrey as&nbsp;<em>[Kin spoke here about the history of APIs and what APIs do.]</em></p>
<p>To help understand how mainstream Internet technology has influenced the LMS and education portal history Audrey has laid out, I wanted to bring the history of the web API to the table, helping people understand what APIs do:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs allow computers to talk to each other, and applications to inter-operate </li>
<li>Websites deliver HTML for humans to read, and APIs deliver JSON for other applications to use</li>
</ul>
<p>The earliest approaches to APIs on the Internet, can be seen from providers starting in 2000, as <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Roy Fielding publishes his dissertation on REST</a>.</p>
<p>The early API pioneers were looking to enable commerce around their products, sales efforts and auctions using early web enabled APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of Salesforce API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">2000 - Salesforce</a></strong> - The CRM and sales management provider Salesforce was the first pioneer to begin using web APIs to start developing an ecosystem of integration providers, planting the seeds of what we'd later call Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Ebay API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">2000 - Ebay</a></strong> - Ebay identified early on, the role web APIs could play in expanding its auction marketplace, allowing business and individual to manage their online auctions via a programmatic interface</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Amazon E-Commerce API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">2002 - Amazon</a></strong> - Early on the fast growing bookseller identified the potential of APIs in expanding its ecosystem of e-commerce storefronts, delivering on the commerce vision of early API pioneers</li>
</ul>
<p>After this wave of commerce APIs, a new approach to interacting, collaborating and building relationships on the web emerged, introducing a new flavor of API driven platforms:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of Flickr API" href="/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">2004 - Flickr</a> </strong>- The founders of Flickr identified APIs a potential new approach to handling business development. Allowing partners a self-service way to integrate with the photo sharing platforms, allowing Flickr to use the API as a filter to help establish which companies they should partner with</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Delicious API" href="/2013/06/09/history-of-apis-del-icio-us/">2004 - Delicious</a></strong> - The social bookmarking platform Delicious introduced the world to a simpler way to bookmark documents on the web, social sharing, tagging, a new way to organize your online world.  Delicious was the the first to introduce an approach to APIs that used HTTP to deliver XML responses alongside common HTML pages</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Facebook API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-facebook-development-platform/">2006 - Facebook</a></strong> - Following the lead of social API pioneers like Flickr and Delicious, Facebook deployed its developer platform, providing programmatic access to the social network, setting off a wave of social application development across sectors from events to online gaming</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-twitter/">2006 - Twitter</a></strong> - The social API evolution continued with the launch of an API by fast growing micro-blogging platform Twitter.  The social microblogging network relied on its API and developer community to deliver every aspect of the platform from mobile applications to analytics, as well as embeddable buttons and widgets</li>
</ul>
<p>As the social API phase continue to evolve with the introduction of platforms from Facebook and Twitter, an earlier API pioneer Amazon <a href="/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">put APIs to use in a way that would change the way would develop software forever</a>.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/12/history-of-apis-amazon-s3/">2006 - Amazon Web Services</a></strong> - After Amazon found success with its e-commerce APIs, the company adopted APIs internally, an approach that would eventually evolve into a new type of API driven service we now know as cloud computing.  AWS started with basic  resources like storage and compute, but would rapidly to evolve and deliver a suite of API resources for companies to use in building all types of applications</li>
</ul>
<p>There was one more ingredient necessary, before APIs would open up web portals that were established in the early days of the world wide web. A new type of phone was being developed, one that was smarter than earlier feature phones.  The new generation of smart phones, led by Apple and its iPhone would legitimize APIs as the preferred channel for delivering the distributed resources that developers of web and mobile apps would need.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of Foursquare APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/11/history-of-apis-foursquare-api/">2009 - Foursquare</a></strong> - The location-based social networking website for mobile devices emerged on the landscape providing developers with a set of APIs that they would need to build the localized apps for smart phones.  Foursquare has made applications locally aware, and allowing mobile users to discover and checking to the local world around them</li>
<li><strong><a title="History of Instagram API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/11/history-of-apis-instagram-api/">2011 - Instagram</a></strong> - After a rogue API was deployed on top of the fast growing photo platform, Instagram responded with an official API launch, providing read and write access to the rich media content, which soon would attract the attention of earlier social API pioneer, Facebook</li>
</ul>
<p>While APIs provided essential ingredients for web and mobile applications development like commerce, social and cloud it is also providing some other essential elements that deliver value to end-users.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="API Integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">Integration</a></strong> - APIs allow for integration between the multiple platforms and services we have adopted as part of our online, digital worlds.  Integration in an online world is critical aspect of user adoption and the future growth of any online platform</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Reciprocity" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">Reciprocity</a></strong> - Beyond integration, APIs allow for reciprocity, not just delivering bits and bytes between platforms and services, it protects the interests of the companies behind these systems as well as acting on behalf of the end-users of applications built on top of these API driven systems</li>
<li><strong><a title="Real-Time APIs" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">Real-Time</a></strong> - Web and mobile phones have connected us, and users now desire more and more of our information, data and relationships in real-time.  APIs provide the ability to be the real-time channel developers need allowing self-service, instant access to resources, but also open up a two street that pushes information back to web and mobile applications via API technologies like Web Hooks and Websockets</li>
</ul>
<p>As this new approach to developing platforms has evovled, one that challenges earlier portals and platforms like AOL, other patterns emerge that are identified as successful ingredients of all next generation platforms.  These are elements that aren't necessarily technical, but are critical components that allow often very technical resources to be accessed and used in a safe and secure way.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Visibility</strong> - APIs provide partners, developers and end-users who are key stakeholders in a platform or portal the visibility they need to be educated and informed, providing a healthy base for any online community</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - APIs let the sunlight in to companies, organizations, government agencies or even individuals who expose their resources via the web. Embracing transparency is an essential aspect of any successful API strategy</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - As with any website, security is an important part of planning, deploying and managing API resources.  Security is primary concern for any API effort and its community</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use</strong> - Silently the terms of use for each API driven platform or service is defining interactions, relationships and the health of anything we do on the web and in the cloud.  Terms of use are definitely one of the single most important aspects of portals and online services, providing a single point of failure or exploitation of users, as well as potentially providing a wealth of opportunities for some thoughtful platforms and developers</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Privacy of any platform and service is defined via the availability of an API. Opening up access to a companies, platform or services resources via an API must consider privacy of its users.  Privacy is not an after thought in education, it mandatory</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs will provide the essential access, transparency and data portability that will be necessary for the platforms and services we are depending on across the education space. Every company listed above has affected how the world works, and provide blueprints for platforms and services that are targeting just about any business sector, including education.</p>
<p>APIs are necessary to enable 3-legged conversations in the education space, elminating the education walled garden.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://tech.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/PresidentialInnovationFellows.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The news is finally out.  I will be <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/24/new-round-innovators-joins-us-government-tackle-big-challenges">heading to Washington DC to spend a year as a White House Innovation Fellow</a>. APIs, open data and our government has been a passion of mine for my whole career, something that has escalated over the last year with my work on the White House Digital Strategy and Open Data Policy.</p>
<p>Now my passion for APIs+Government is being taken to a whole new level, and &nbsp;I will be heading to Washington DC, to<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/round-2-fellows"> join 41 very talented individuals from the private sector</a>, to tackle some of the biggest challenges in our federal government.  I will be enjoying the full backing of the White House, to employ APIs to help stimulate innovation within government.</p>
<p>I will be specifically working on the Veterans Affiars</p>
<p>(VA) modernization team with two other very talented individuals, Mollie Ruskin (<a href="https://twitter.com/mollieruskin">@mollieruskin</a>) and Ben Willman (<a href="https://twitter.com/benwillman">@benwillman</a>).  We will be working on various projects, with the overall goal of streamlining the VA claims process.</p>
<p>When I received the call from the VA, asking me to come to Washington and help, I could not say no.  I'm pretty mission driven, when it comes to APIs, but helping out veterans and using APIs is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ultimate</span> mission for me.</p>
<p>I have not one, but two dads who were Vietnam Veterans.  Both are passed on now, but I have personal experience seeing the VA process in operation.  I couldn't think of a more important mission for me to embark on, but to help streamline this process.</p>
<p>I will be keeping API Evangelist alive during my time in DC, but will not be taking on any new speaking engagements or projects. I will be dedicating myself 100% to my work at the VA.  However I would do the agency a disservice if I did not maintain my awareness of the overall API space.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who assisted in making this possible, and I look forward to this next step in my career.</p>

<p>I went to <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days SF</a> yesterday. Unfortunately, due to an unexpected obligation on the other coast I was unable to make it in time for the Friday kick-off.  But after my plane landed at OAK yesterday I headed over to enjoy the last few talks, participate in a panel and network with everyone in attendance.</p>
<p>I really like the API Days format.  I've done all 3 of the events now including Paris, Madrid and now San Francisco.  Each event is an intimate mix of API experts, craftspeople and the API curious.</p>
<p>You can easily rub elbows with everyone and learn from everyone there.  All speakers are accessible, and the spaces are always small enough that you have some amazing conversations, while enjoying good food and drink.</p>

<p>I'd love to see more API Days pop up around the world, I really think it is a great format for introducing APIs into new region and spread the API best practices, knowledge and wisdom we often take for granted here in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://apidays.io/2013/06/09/fork-my-conference-it-aint-a-franchise-its-open-source/">API Days event model is an open source approach to throwing API events</a>, so if you think you'd like to throw your own API Days gathering in your city, you can!  The community is extremely supportive and we will do what we can to help make sure you are successful, you just have to provide the local ingredients.</p>
<p>I know there is another, original API Days Paris planned for the end of the year, but I'd love to see the format spread to other locations around the globe.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Jun 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-2015.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>APIs are quickly moving into the mainstream.  In 2012, companies, organizations and government agencies all took notice of the need for deploying and consuming APIs.  In 2013 there is still a lot of evangelism to be done, to make people aware of what an APIs is, and why their company should have one, but I think we are approaching the phase where APIs will be the default for any company.</p>
<p>If you frequent the tech conferences like I do, you've heard folks like John Musser say that in 1995 we were asking, "Do we need a website?", and by 2000 website was becoming the default. Fastforward to 2010, and we were asking, "Do we need an API?", and I believe by 2015 APIs will be default for companies, just like websites in 2000.</p>
<p>APIs are built on HTTP just like our websites. They are not just a new technology trend. Your website is a critical part of your company, telling the world about your company, and the products and services you provide.  If you are a company without a website in this century, you probably are pretty irrelevant in your industry.</p>
<p>By 2015 if your company's products and services are not available in both HTML and JSON on the web, you will not be accessible via web and mobile applications, including voice enabled platforms such as Siri. Resulting in pretty much the same irrelevance as not having a website.</p>
<p>I'm not saying there isn't a lot of work to be done, in educated folks about what APIs are, and why they are important.  But as I leave Washington DC this week, and I'm seeing our federal government solidly on track to institutionalize APIs and open data into their culture and operations. Government is known for always being several years behind the mainstream when it comes to technology.  So if your company is behind the government on APIs, you are seriously behind and may not be able to catch up to your competition.</p>

<p>I went to Spain at the beginning of the month to <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/06/04/apidays-mediterranea-is-a-wrap/">speak at API Days</a>.  While there I had the pleasure of connecting with the team from <a href="http://www.apicultur.com/en/">Apicultur</a>.  If you are not familiar with Apicultur, they are a platform for linguistic APIs, providing resources ranging from word frequency, synonyms and sentiment analysis to word games.</p>
<p>Apicultur is relevant because language APIs <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WILL</strong></span> be central to evolution of not just mobile, but also the Internet of Things. Also, Apicultur isn't just trying to build the best linguistics API in the world, they are working to assemble a <a href="https://store.apicultur.com/">marketplace of the worlds linguistic API resources</a>.</p>
<p>The value of the API resources Apicultur is developing attracted me to them, but then I learned more about their overall business model, and was really hooked.  They want you to hang your valuable linguistics API in their marketplace, side by side with the ones they develop.  They truly want to build the most valuable marketplace of API driven, language resources from around the world.</p>
<p>The Apicultur team is in San Francisco this weekend for <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">API Days</a>, if you are a complimentary API I recommend you connecting with them. Also if you have a business that could use the resources they offer, I also recommend reaching out.  You can ping them @apicultur or feel free to contact me, and I'll hook you up. Or maybe just head down to API Days at Parisoma.</p>
<p>What Apicultur is doing, reflects the next iteration of APIs from an all the APIs directory like ProgrammableWeb, to niche marketplaces of valuable resources developers will be needing to build the next generation of applications.</p>
