There was a lot of buzz in the API space over the last two weeks. I'm not a big on being first with news from the world of APIs, I leave this approach to the tech blogs like Techcrunch, RWW, GigaOm, The Next Web and others. I'd rather simmer on things for a bit, think beyond the press release, and craft a post that offers value beyond the initial announcement and the [churnalism][1].

To get everyone up to speed, four major things happened in the API space over the last two weeks:

  * [Intel Buys Mashery][2]
  * [Computer Associates Buys Layer 7 Technologies][3]
  * [MuleSoft Acquires ProgrammableWeb][4]
  * [3Scale gets $4.2M in Funding][5]

There is no arguing that these are some pretty significant signs the API industry is picking up the pace, especially when you have companies like Intel and Computer Associates taking notice and making investments. I've been tracking on the space for 3 years now, with round-ups of API service providers in [2011][6] and [2012][7]. For 2010, 2011 it was all an uphill battle, but in 2012 I started seeing things heat up with the [introduction of several new API service providers][7],Â then really stepping up in November 2012 with the [acquisition of Vordel by Axway][8]. But, the last couple of weeks are pretty outstanding, with not just acquisition of two separate API service providers, but also the fact that one of them is API pioneer Mashery, being purchased by chipmaker Intel. Love or hate Mashery, they help define the space and have been at it a while a while, and we all have an industry, partly due to their work.

###  VC Cycles More Than API Cycles

Personally I feel the recent acquisitions are indeed positive signals for the industry, but I think they are also just part of the natural cycle that is set in motion by the types of businesses, companies like Mashery and Layer 7 are looking to build. These are companies that are designed for an exit, an with Mashery raising almost $40M, after multiple rounds, as well as Layer7 at $20M, with just a handful of rounds. I don't do predictions, but I would say that Apigee is next with their $70M, in a Series E round. Any takers IBM? AT
