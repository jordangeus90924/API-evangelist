<p>There are a growing number of API providers who have published <a href="http://apisjson.org">an APIs.jso</a>n for their API operations, providing a machine-readable index of not just their API, but for their API entire operations. My favorite example to use in my talks and conversations when I’m showcasing the API discovery format is the one for <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/">the International Trade Administration at developer.trade.gov</a>.

<p><a href="https://trade.gov/">The International Trade Administration (ITA)</a> is the government agency that “strengthens the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promotes trade and investment, and ensures fair trade through the rigorous enforcement of our trade laws and agreements”, provides an index of where you can find their developer portal, documentation, terms of service, as well as a machine readable OpenAPI for their trade APIs.

<p>I couldn’t think of a more shining example of APIs when it comes to talking about the API economy. I am pleased to have helped influenced their API efforts and helping them see the importance of providing a machine readable index of their API operations with APIs.json, as well as their APIs using OpenAPI. <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/apis.json">If you need a well maintained, and meaningful example of how APIs.json works head over to developer.trade.gov and take a look</a>.
