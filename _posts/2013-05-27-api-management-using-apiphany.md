{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im working my way through all the API management providers, making sure Im up to speed on what service each provider is offering these days.As part of this work Ive been playing with the Apiphany platform, using a demo site the Apiphany team was so kind to setup for me.Using Apiphany I can manage my APIs, and launch a portal which allows me to hang all my APIs, then manage all aspects of their operations.Apiphany focuses on the three main components of API deployment &amp; consumption: APIs - API resources and their operations youve deployed and would like to hang and manage via your Apiphany portal Products - Virtual products you create, which allow access to various combinations of API resources and operations Apps - Applications that are registered with the platform, and consuming APIs via various product subscriptions The way Apiphany sets up the systems is very intuitive, giving you quick, administrative control over the systems you will need to execute on either a very simple, or even a very complex API strategy.APIs Apiphany provides all the basics for API management, allowing you to add to endpoints, manage the title, description and manage operations for each endpoint, allowing you to define service operations to enable service documentation, interactive API console, per operation limits, request/response validation, and operation-level statistics.</p>
