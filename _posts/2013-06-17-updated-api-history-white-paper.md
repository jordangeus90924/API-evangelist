Understanding our history is critical to understanding where we are going.  I have been studying the [history of web APIs][2] for the last three years. Even though I have been through the API strategies of pioneers like Salesforce and Amazon several times, each time I go back through, I learn more.  

In May I went back through the history of APIs and added several stories that I feel are key to introducing people to the API space, as well as helping developers and people who already work with APIs, about why this has all worked.

I break the history of APIs into 5 phases:

  * Commerce
  * Social
  * Business
