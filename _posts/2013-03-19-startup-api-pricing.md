{% include JB/setup %}<p>I wrote about the web to API service Import.io earlier today, and before I close the Evernote for this story, I wanted to highlight something else I thought they did interesting, on their pricing page.  I thought they provide a very honest peak into how they are pricing their services. First off, they admit that they are a young company, which is cool, but they also lay out some pretty interesting points around their business philosophy:: We are a free service.We will always provide a free-to-use tool We will introduce premium features.</p>
