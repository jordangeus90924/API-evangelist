title: The API Resource Timeline
width: small

I wanted to take my API industry timeline, or at least the last 20+ years and look at it differently. I wanted to generalize the digital resources that these companies were providing. Rather than just the moment in time, I wanted to consider how the accumulation of resources were making different things possible. I think I will go through and add a few other ones that maybe didn't make the cut for my history, and think more about how we got here from a digital transformation point of view.
