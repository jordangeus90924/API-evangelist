[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/OAuth.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />][1][Layer 7 Technologies][2] introduced a new [OAuth Toolkit][3], ageneralized framework for handling a broad range of OAuth scenarios across cloud, web and mobile applications.

[OAuth][1] is a simple way to publish and interact with protected data, and is a popular method to allow secure API authorization, enabling websites to provide a more streamlined user login experience with the additional benefits of enhanced privacy and security.

The Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit is the first solution of its kind that enables enterprises to control policy and identity aspects of many different OAuth token operations, a capability that is particularly important as enterprises increasingly use OAuth to authorize access to APIs in cloud settings, said Phil Walston, vice president of products at Layer 7 Technologies. By allowing enterprises to seamlessly manage their OAuth implementations as the standard evolves, the toolkit simplifies operations while providing rigorous security and control.[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/layer7-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][2]

Features of the Layer 7 OAuth Toolkit are:

  * Policy and identity controls to handle HMAC-SHA1 or RSA-SHA1 signature methods, SAML and OAuth WRAP
  * Mix and match implementations of OAuth with SAML
  * Ability to drop in new signature and credential methods without changing APIs
Layer 7's new OAuth Toolkit supports a variety of standards, including OAuth 1a, OAuth 2.0, SAML 1.1, SAML 2.0, WS-Trust, [REST][4] and [JSON][5].

Layer 7 will be demonstrating its OAuth Toolkit at the Layer 7 Hospitality Suite at [Gartner's Catalyst Conference][6] at the San Diego Hilton Bayfront, Aqua Room 311, from 6:00 - 9:00 p.m., July 26-29.
