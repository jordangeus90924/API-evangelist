        <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-micro-definition.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am evolving <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">my own personal microservices definition</a>, something that is constantly changing, as I work on my infrastructure, read other people&rsquo;s own definitions (no shortage these lately), and continuing having conversations with smart folks across the space. I had the pleasure of having Mike Amundsen over the other night for dinner, and after having some interesting discussions about community, and potential micro services design, I&rsquo;m adding a couple of elements to my microservice definition list.</p>
<p>In my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">last post</a>&nbsp;on this, I listed seven criteria I congress as part of my micro services definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal surface</li>
<li>minimal on disk</li>
<li>minimal compute</li>
<li>minimal message</li>
<li>minimal network</li>
<li>minimal time to rebuild</li>
<li>minimal time to throw away</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to add two elements to my list, considering some of the other elements I&rsquo;ve noticed at play when it comes to API bloat:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal ownership</li>
<li>minimal dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimal owners is a pretty easy one for me, as I&rsquo;m the owner of all my microservices&mdash;the buck always stops with me. However, It is a good reminder to make sure all of my services have a vCard applied to their <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son file index</a>. It is important to easily known who is responsible for any public or private API, and with APIs.son and Swagger, this is easy to do.</p>
<p>When it comes to minimal dependencies, this gets a little tougher for me. My world isn&rsquo;t too bad, because my systems are small, and I&rsquo;ve been the only developer.  The down side is I&rsquo;ve been the only developer, and I&rsquo;ve bee lazy about how many dependencies an API might have, and also been fairly sloppy about how I integrate with 3rd party APIs. Adding this item to my list will help me keep an eye on how I establish dependencies between services, keeping them minimal, and well documented.</p>
<p>That is it, I just wanted to add ownership and dependencies to my list of considerations&mdash;I just like making a production out of everything.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://3drobotics.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/3d-robotics-dronekit.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are many areas I track on as part of my research. Things that do not show up on my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/23/weekly-apireport-for-march-23rd-2015/">weekly API.Reports</a>, or in my analysis on API Evangelist. One of these is the area of drones. I&rsquo;m fascinated by this potential area in the area of Internet of Things, but until now it was more of a side note, or one possible path for APIs and the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>Amongst the numerous drone stories I curate, I'm seeing more shift in the space towards a developer focus. It isn't just about the drone itself, its about customizing, developing and using the drone as a platform. One recent story I noticed was <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/26/drone-maker-3d-robotics-debuts-open-source-development-platform-to-advance-public-app-innovation/">3D Robotics (3DR), one of North America's largest consumer drone manufacturer, announcing the release of a new DroneKit, which includes an API for drone app development</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://dronekit.io/">DroneKit</a> has a <a href="https://developer.3drobotics.com/docs">web API defined using Swagger</a>, which is the first Drone API I have actually added to my system. I am sure there are more out there, and now that I&rsquo;m tracking on closer, I'm sure I'll find them. The number of drone related stories that flow through my feeds is getting pretty out of control, and I'm thinking the space needs some standard approaches to APIs identified, to help develop better drone solutions, but also potentially inject some transparency into this growing layer of IoT.</p>
<p><a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/"> </a></p>
<p><a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/"></a><a href="http://3drobotics.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/drone-kit-air-ground-cloud.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>Now that I have an API blueprint for a drone API, in Swagger too! ;-) I will be able to start thinking about what some of the API patterns for drones might look like, and what some of the common building blocks might be for managing the technical, but also business, and political side of drone operation. I&rsquo;m thinking that when it comes to drone operations, APIs might not just be a nice to have, they might be something that becomes mandatory in trying to bring this fast growing, not well defined space, under some control.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whatsapp/whatsapp-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There was a quick post from Mashable the other day about a conversation with <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> cofounder Brian Acton, called WhatsApp cofounder: <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/03/25/whatsapp-developers-api/">Sorry developers, no API for you</a>. Its pretty common argument you hear from business leaders, regarding why they won&rsquo;t open up APIs. It has been a while since I railed on this line of thinking, so I am taking the opportunity to share why this is such an un-informed, short-sighted view of APIs.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t at the conference, so I a completely dependent on Mashable for this, but apparently someone in the audience asked:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We have done a lot of transactional messaging using traditional email and SMS, and we've recently moved into the international market," the engineer explained to the audience, who clapped and hollered. "We're desperate to communicate with our members where WhatsApp would be a wonderful platform. We're good developers."</em></blockquote>
<p>Acton stated that they had no current plans to, adding:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We don't want to inundate users with messages they don't want," Acton explained of the choice. "I am very empathetic to your cause. I receive emails on a regular basis from people who want to run their business or want to run something using WhatsApp as the backbone for communication, but we're balancing that with the user experience."</em></blockquote>
<p>Before I point out how narrow this thinking, let&rsquo;s focused on why I use the word un-informed to describe this perspective. Let&rsquo;s say the motivation for not opening up an API at WhatsApp is purely about UX, let&rsquo;s explore some of the options on the table, for API providers to strike the balance they are looking for in this area.</p>
<p><strong>API Management Service Composition</strong> <br />With modern API management services, you have a critical concept called "service composition", where you the API provider, can carve up different levels of access to valuable API resources, deciding exactly who has access to what. API do not equal firehose to the public, where anyone can build whatever they want. If you still see APIs in this way, spend some time playing with the more successful APIs out there like Twilio, SendGrid, and expand your definition of just exactly what an API is, and the role service composition plays.</p>
<p><strong>oAuth For Platform Access &amp; End User Control </strong><br />oAuth is a pretty proven way for managing who is accessing API resources, in a way that the end-user has a say in operations. An API does not automatically open access to all users, when a developers signs up for API access. In the beginning, you have access to your own account as a developer, that is it. It is up to end-users to find these applications, and using oAuth, give (or revoke) access to whatever application they choose. As a platform owner you should consider giving end-users oversight, via oAuth, into how you the platform provider is accessing their data, and require <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL</strong></span> partners to follow this path. If you need example of this in action go look at your Google Account profile, you&rsquo;ll see Google Apps in the oAuth list.</p>
<p><strong>Branding And Design Guidelines</strong><br />What are the official internal branding and design guidelines you use to direct your own WhatsAp development teams&mdash;you have them right? So share these with developers, and give them a chance to share in your master UX vision of how the WhatsApp UX vision, is the one to rule them all. You should be able to articulate the platform UX vision as a set of professionally crafted, publicly shared, design guides, that everyone can see, and use to understand the vision--you never know maybe here would be someone out there in the world that could iterate on them in a meaningful way, that even you might even agree with.</p>
<p><strong>Starter Kits and UX Frameworks<br /></strong>Additionally, go beyond just design guides, and provide developers with HTML, CSS, Images, and JavaScript goodies that will demonstrate how visionary the WhatsApp UX vision is. Think <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.  I&rsquo;m not saying that Twitter nailed it on this front. They did well, but their overall timing and execution left a lot to be desired. As a platform provider who possesses a UX vision that works, open up the platform, provide developers with the proper starter kit, or UX framework that they need to succeed. As a developer, I fail to deliver on your UX vision, it is more a failure of your platform to provide me with proper tooling, than it is my fault as a dev.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Sandbox &amp; Simulation Environments </strong><br />A common approach to managing developer on-boarding, and overall quality control through an API and resulting app lifecycle, is done by providing developers with a sandbox. When nothing is live, and developers do not have any access to actual end-users, what harm is done? What harm to the overall UX experience is there, when developers are only building in sandbox and simulation environments? Until they prove themselves, no developer should move to a production environment, until their solutions is proven to meet WhatsApp strict UX guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Application &amp; Developer Certification</strong><br />Now let&rsquo;s talk about how WhatsApp could certify developers, giving them access to more resources, or possibly investment from the WhatsApp platform. Many leading platforms require developers to get certified, and / or their applications certified before they get full access to production environments, and end-users. How you craft your developer and application certification is a reflection of your overall UX requirements, and platform goals.</p>
<p><strong>Application Showcase</strong> <br />When you have proper branding and design guidelines, starter kits and supporting UI / UX frameworks, proper developer environments, and official application and developer certification, you should end up with a handful of apps worth showcasing. Maybe its not just a single, competing application, it could be integration with an existing platform (SalesForce, ZendDesk, etc.), or just providing access to valuable messages and conversations. With proper API ecosystem management, an application showcase provides an incentive for developers to build applications that work properly, and reflect the well defined UX vision of WhatsApp.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Program </strong><br />With a robust ecosystem of certified developers, and applications that meet the strict UX guidelines of WhatsApp, surely there will be the cream on top of what is developed on the APIs. Which apps, and platform integrations are the best designed, and provide the most value to WhatsApp end-users? These are the ones that WhatsApp should be investing in, bringing them closer to internal operations, and providing them with additional access to resources, investment when it makes sense. What does the WhatsApp partner program look like currently? I'm sure there is one, just not a formal approach, which includes any transparency, or public involvement.</p>
<p><strong>Zooming Back Out </strong><br />That represents just a handful of the common API management building blocks that are commonly put to work by API providers to help manage their API ecosystems. It doesn&rsquo;t just take technology to make APIs work, it takes a healthy business, and political approach to make sure any API actually works as an ecosystem. I could go on for days about how proper support, communication, and other proven elements, could also be used by WhatsApp to strike the API developer balance system they are looking for, and even possibly create a positive feedback loop with the community, that could be applied to the roadmap.</p>
<p>Now that we are paused, and zoomed out a little bit, let&rsquo;s talk about the narrow perception demonstrated by WhatsApp current stance on APIs. If you open up APIs, developers will just come and mess with your UX version. Nothing else will happen? This is where we shift from being educated about common building blocks, to the limited perceptions that results from this lack of awareness&mdash;you just don't know, what you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><strong>You Have APIs, You Just Aren&rsquo;t Open </strong><br />WhatsApp uses APIs. This is how the mobile app works. The company just does not want to share these resources with developers, because they fear losing control over the UX experience. I guarantee that WhatsApp is sharing data and resources with 3rd party provider, they are just very picky about who these are, and they don't have a formal process for doing so, so they keep their cards very close to their chest&mdash;aka, not open.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore the darker side of the WhatsApp API conversation. I&rsquo;m not alluding that WhatsApp has less than honorable intentions, my goal is to shine a line into the dark areas that exist, regardless of WhatsApp lack of education of modern API practices, and missing the wider picture of how APIs are actually put to work. This moves into the area of responsibility I feel that platforms assume, when they step up and invite end-users to sign up, depend on, and stay engage with any online, public, API driven web, mobile, or device based application.</p>
<p><strong>Data Access &amp; Portability </strong><br />WhatsApp end-user deserve access to their accounts, and their messages. APIs are not just about developers building the cool app that will compete with WhatsApp, or mess up the WhatsApp UX vision. APIs provide basic data access and portability to the information end-users generate via the WhatsApp platform. Platforms that do not empower end-user data portability, do not operate in the best interest of their own customers, removing from the overall user experience. Something you don't see, because your UX vision is so narrowly aligned with your business goals, not widely aligned with your end-users needs.</p>
<p><strong>Platform Reciprocity </strong><br />Using services like IFTTT and Zapier, API driven platforms are enabling users to to migrate their information between the services they depend on, and add to their own user experience on each platform they depend on, and most importantly between them. APIs, and oAuth enable the flow of information between cloud platforms in a way that protects the interests of users, as well as that of the platforms. APIs aren't just about developers building apps, they are also about users enhancing their own overall experience, on their terms&mdash;moving beyond the platform owners single UX vision.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity &amp; Platform Balance</strong> <br />I just can't imagine any single company, in 2015, thinking they have single UX vision, and nobody could possibly contribute to that, from an outside perspective. As a product owner, I would love to get as much input from my community regarding the next generation UX, because in the end, it is ultimately up to me what I incorporate into the roadmap, what are best practices in the API community, and ultimately which apps get certified, showcased in the application gallery, and pushed to end-users. When you operate a global platform like WhatsApp you can't address the diverse needs of end-users over time, around the globe, without the help of users augmenting and evolving exactly what is the WhatsApp UX vision. When you are a white dude in the U.S., you just aren't going to understand the UX for women of color in Africa, I don't care how much vision you think you have.</p>
<p><strong>In Conclusion, Just Shy of Innovation </strong><br />I&rsquo;m going to end this there. I&rsquo;m not even going to pull out the innovation card and talk about all the potential for new ideas, a WhatsApp API could generate. I&rsquo;ll stick with talking about a handful of common building blocks used across the space to mitigate the UX concerns that API driven platform providers have, and pointing out how narrow the UX concerns are. There are plenty of other reasons for having an API, beyond just developers building apps, that will mess with your UX vision.</p>
<p>Users should have a choice to use their preferred messaging channel (WhatsApp) in any platform they depend on, and be able to manage their experience using 3rd party services of their choice. With an informed&nbsp;approach to API management, you can do all of this, giving end-users more, without compromising the overall WhatsApp UX&mdash;you can carefully craft and evolve it, with the help of your community. As it stands, WhatsApp has an API, it is what the mobile app uses, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that WhatsApp does provide access to 3rd party partners of their choice, they just don't open that up to public knowledge&mdash;they are already doing what they say they don't do, they just aren't open and transparent about the process.</p>
<p>It doesn't take much to launch a proper developer portal, with the essential building blocks like documentation, code samples, and self-service registration. You don&rsquo;t have to give production access to every new developers&mdash;make them build something cool, and prove themselves first. That way you only deliver only the best to WhatsApp users. People are already building unsanctioned apps on WhatsApp (just Google WhatsApp API), not having an API isn&rsquo;t stopping these potentially bad seeds from entering the UX paradigm, there is just no sanctioned place for users to go, when they are looking to extend, augment, or make their WhatsApp work with other services they use, or assume control over their own account and data.</p>
<p>Alright, I'll stop ranting there. I know I&rsquo;m biased, but if you have a popular public mobile application in 2015, there is no reason you shouldn't have at least a public face of your developer program, to answer these question. In the end you are just hurting your own operations, as well as the overall experience for your users. Additionally, I just can't see how the leading position of any mobile is defensible for very long without an API. Things are just too volatile, and end-users are just too picky, someone will always come along and disrupt you, unless you can shift to deliver the UX consumers are demanding.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/27/politics-of-apis-talk-of-api-driven-regulation-is-increasing/">Politics of APIs: Talk Of API Driven Regulation Is Increasing</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I started API Evangelist, I was all about the Business of APIs, something I still focus on, but increasingly over the last couple years I am focusing more on what I call the politics of APIs. In my opinion, the politics of APIs can be anything from terms of service and privacy policies, to rate limits, pricing, and security, all the way up to court cases, <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com">patents</a>, and government regulation.</p>
<p>Today I want to focus on the very top of that spectrum&mdash;government regulation. The government isn't just getting into the API game, by deploying their own APIs, they are going to also increasingly be getting more involved with private sector APIs. In my weekly monitoring I'm seeing more chatter across several industries, like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/382327/44695_Accessible.pdf">the UK treasury getting involved in banking API standards</a>, and <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/03/25/the-final-stage-of-meaningful-use-rules-will-ehrs-finally-pay-off/">a push in the healthcare industry for more interoperability via APIs</a>--just to highlight two recent stories.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t anything new, governments been defining API standards and pitching them to industries for a while now. I personally have been involved in healthcare and energy related standards, as part of Blue Button and Green Button data services. In coming years, what is going to increase, is the number of industries that the government is helping define standard, as well as beginning to get a little more heavy handed about mandating APIs as part of the regulatory process..</p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of government regulation, something I feel gets abused on both sides of the tracks, but I understand it is a necessary actor when it comes to balance in markets. To help address some of the abuse that occurs, I think APIs could significantly help bring much needed transparency, and self-service access to the process, for both the public and private sector. I feel the conversation in coming years will move beyond the government just defining industry API standards, but also pushing for real-time interoperability, and execution by companies who operate in heavily regulated industries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to keep track of the patterns I see emerging when it comes to API driven regulation, and try to stay informed regarding what is coming down the pipes across business sectors. At various points along the way, I&rsquo;ll do roundups of regulator related news, analysis, and API definitions, or platforms that focus on industry regulation. When it comes to API driven regulation, there will be no black or white, just high a high frequency blur, which will need transparency, and a machine readable interface to make any sense of.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/24/reflecting-on-api-management-and-the-apigee-ipo/">reflecting on API management and the Apigee IPO</a>, I&rsquo;m thinking deeper on how the API space has come to be a &ldquo;thing". To kick off this story, you have to start with the API itself, something very abstract, hard to see, let alone convey to the average person. A single API is difficult to quantify, let alone an entire sector, or the companies rising up to service this perceived sector&mdash;think of the argument from early API management service providers like Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee had to make to their VCs.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the API space has always been a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; to me, but along the road from 2010-2015, there has been plenty times, where I question the way things are. I have to give it to Mashery, they saw it early on, then 3Scale and Apigee joined in, and in 2015 we have a real industry, with <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">35 API management service providers</a>, in addition to the expanding number of service providers catering to API design, deployment, management, discovery, integration, and other evolving layers of the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>In 2015, I feel like the API sector is a real thing. Not because 3Scale is still growing, Mashery was acquired by Intel, Apigee is IPOing, or that there is over 35 API management service providers, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">including a number of open source solutions</a>. The API sector is a real thing because there are many other companies, in many supporting area who have emerged, and the overall awareness around the potential of API, by business leaders has grown significantly. How did this happen? It happened because people were telling the story of APIs, whether it was marketing for their products services, or stories on ProgrammableWeb and API Evangelist&mdash;working in concert to create an industry (something).</p>
<p>Within the same thought, I try to grasp how it was that I created API Evangelist. There sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t any strategy to do it. Early on I had a vision in my mind, but five years later, that vision is radically different. I did what I had to do, when the time came, and told the stories that mattered (at least I tried). I am not trying to connect API Evangelist to the overall existence of the API management space, I&rsquo;m trying to work through the details how you define something to a wide audience, in this very abstract world of APIs. I think this applies at the highest levels of industry like API management, to the lowest levels, at the microservice level (soon to be nanoservice, trust me it will be something ;-)&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t something, until it is something, and people believe.</p>
<p>I know. All of this sounds like bullshit. If you think about it though, it begins to make sense (hopefully). Web APIs weren&rsquo;t a thing until John Musser aggregated them together into a directory in 2005. API management wasn&rsquo;t a thing until Mashery, 3Scale, and APigee made it into something. API evangelism wasn&rsquo;t a thing until API providers like Twilio and Sendgrid started sending out armies of evangelists to hackathons. API design wasn&rsquo;t a thing until Tony Tam gave us Swagger to help us visualize our APIs, and Jakub Nesetril of <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a> allowed us to design, mock, and collaborate around an API Blueprint. None of these things were things, until people stepped up and worked really hard to convince others, that they were a thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working hard to understand this in action across the API space. The Apigee IPO, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/26/swagger-shifts-hands-from-reverb-to-smartbear/">Swagger changing hands</a>, and other shifts in the landscape are making me think a little deeper about how we got where we are at.  How did we all build momentum in API management, design, or now apply to world of API discovery? How do you make government APIs a thing? How do we ensure hypermedia becomes / is a thing? I mean, not just one possible design constraint, but well understood by all developers, and when it makes most sense to put to use. How has Swagger evolved? What is next for Swagger?  These are all things that make me curious for what the future holds, and how I can help get us there safely, with as few scratches as possible.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/26/swagger-shifts-hands-from-reverb-to-smartbear/">Swagger Shifts Hands From Reverb to SmartBear</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-highway-open.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><!--,p--></p>
<p>The news came out yesterday that <a href="http://smartbear.com">SmartBear</a> was taking over ownership of <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, from Reverb. Swagger has been outgrowing its home at  Reverb for some time now, becoming much more than I think even Tony originally imagined. You can find the <a href="http://smartbear.com/news/news-releases/">official announcement from SmartBear on their site</a>, and <a href="http://blog.helloreverb.com/swagger-smartbear/">Tony&rsquo;s thoughts over on the Reverb blog</a>. No need for me to recap, but I did want to provide some of my personal thoughts on the shift in this very important project.</p>
<p>I feel like we are embarking on the next stage in the evolution of Swagger. Over the last couple of years, the Swagger community has see growth, adoption, and investment at an unprecedented pace, culminating in version 2.0 of the spec and now its transfer SmartBear. The scope and passion of the Swagger community and the investment that Tony Tam specifically and also the API community have made -- these have all brought us to this moment.</p>
<p>I've known the SmartBear team for years, and after speaking with them about this transition of the Swagger specification, I believe SmartBear is the right steward for Swagger, during its next stage of its evolution. SmartBear understands the gravity of what they are now taking charge of: the Swagger specification representing a central truth throughout the entire API lifecycle.</p>
<p>SmartBear fully understands too that it was organic growth that made Swagger the force that it has become, and SmartBear is aware that a unique balance of leadership, open governance, and a strong community pull will be just as essential during the next stage of growth. I look forward to working with the Swagger community and SmartBear team to ensure Swagger continues playing a vital role across the API space, meeting the demands of the fast-growing API economy.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I see Swagger as a central truth in the API economy, something I&rsquo;m invested in beyond just my own IT infrastructure, as Swagger is also the cornerstone of the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a>, that Steven Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I created to assist in the next generation of API discovery. I am behind Swagger because I believe in Tony&rsquo;s vision, and I also believe that the Swagger community will make this transition more about shifting gears for the Swagger spec and tooling, than it is about who is in charge of the project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tuned into the Swagger community since its inception, and the community support, contributions, and chatter has become pretty loud over the last year. I trust that SmartBear has experienced this scope as well, and understands the importance of Swagger having an open governance model, which would make this current transition all about shifting Swagger into 2nd gear,  and setting up of open governance representing about shifting into 3rd gear, putting the ability to shift into 4th and 5th gear up to the Swagger community itself.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to what SmartBear and the Swagger community can achieve out on the open API highway!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/24/reflecting-on-api-management-and-the-apigee-ipo/">Reflecting On API Management And The Apigee IPO</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apigee-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>It has been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/12/23/api-management-service-provider-roundup-for-2011/">a little over three years since I published my first roundup of API management providers</a>. I&rsquo;ve been tracking on this new breed of companies long before I started API Evangelist, but in 2011 I started formalizing how I monitored what these companies were up to. In 2015, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">I now track on over 35 API management service providers</a>, offering everything from simple proxies, to the full API management infrastructure stack you get from 3Scale.</p>
<p>I have met most of the API management providers, and after 5 years of covering them, it is no secret I have my favorites (you know who you are ;-). The business side of being an API management service provider has never really excited me, so I tend to stay away from the investment and acquisition stories, or speculating to much on who is winning the cash game. With that said, <a href="http://apigee.com/about/press-release/apigee-files-registration-statement-proposed-initial-public-offering">I think the Apigee IPO is a pretty significant milestone for the industry</a>, something I have to give pause to, and reflect on how far we&rsquo;ve come, and evaluate how an IPO compares to the acquisitions we&rsquo;ve seen in recent years, or the other significant industry milestones.</p>
<p>The acquisitions of Mashery, Layer7, Vordel, and Apiphany showed the space was really maturing, and the recent name change by SOA Software to Akana, shows the space has evolved over the last ten years. I think the Apigee IPO shows the overall space is actually growing up. I don&rsquo;t think Apigee had many other alternatives, with a gagillion dollars in funding, but I still think still it shows the space is moving out of its juvenile phase. I guess the actual IPO will be the true test of how grown up we all actually are eh?</p>
<p>For me, another thing to note is where 3Scale is at. You see, I consider Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee to be the OG three of API management service providers. Yeah, I know you have been around longer--SOA, Vordel, and other gateway solutions, but those three are the "OG API management&rdquo;. 3Scale has been plugging along slow and steady, taking on only the funding it needs, while Mashery was acquired, and now while Apigee is IPOing. I know I&rsquo;m biased when it comes to 3Scale, but I think their longevity, and success is as notable as any IPO, or acquisition milestones--its been a long haul.</p>
<p>Another thing to think about is the amount of open source tooling that is available in 2015--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">I was pleased by the amount of new players when I did my last roundup</a>. I was also happy to work with WSO2 early on to understand what the space needed with its open source API management solution, and also the API Umbrella platform as part of the federal government work I&rsquo;ve done. The amount of open source tooling that is available is a clear sign for me, that the API management is truly growing up, and API management is really a thing (was a little shaky there for a while, couldn&rsquo;t tell if I was dreaming, or awake ;-).</p>
<p>I would like to end this reflection, on the most important sign for me that the API space will continue its growth, and reach new heights in coming years. The fact that the conversation has moved way beyond just API management, with companies, services, and tooling emerging throughout the API life-cycle, stimulating design, deployment, discovery, integration, and management conversations that are generating the growth I speak of. Things were only about API management for a while, something that really worried me, but in 2015 the conversation goes much wider and deeper, pushing into even more exciting territory like visualizations, containerization, and objects.</p>
<p>In closing, congrats to Apigee, wishing you best of luck in your IPO--Its been a fun ride, and I&rsquo;m looking froward to it not ending anytime soon.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale, and WSO2 are API Evangelist partners.</em></p>

<p>Ok, it seems like Monday is going to be the regular posting day for my weekly API.Report. No matter how hard I try to get done over the weekend, something always seems to get in the way. Regardless, I'm still going to do, as the process is more than worth it.</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>A couple of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3D printing</strong></span> footnotes for the week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://3dprint.com/51988/3d-printed-twitter-mood-lamp/">3D Printed Twitter Mood Lamp Assesses the Emotional State of Denver Residents</a> - Not sure this is a realistic implementation, but I think the combo of 3D printing and social APIs, is an interesting crossover.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://hackaday.com/2015/03/18/adding-recycling-codes-to-3d-prints/">Adding Recycling Codes To 3D Prints</a> - Another potential interesting cross section of APIs and 3D printing. Seems like you could really go to down making 3D printed items that have a barcode, that is linked to online resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Accessibility</strong></span> is a critical aspect of the API space that needs more discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/16/web-accessibility-with-accessibility-api/">Accessibility APIs: A Key To Web Accessibility</a> - This is an important aspect of the API conversation that isn't discussed, let alone APIs delivering a solution. I'm going to break this down, and try to incorporate accessibly into my research more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>acquisitions</strong></span> I wanted to showcase this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/16/linkedin-acquires-hr-startup-careerify/">LinkedIn acquires HR startup Careerify</a> - Just keeping tabs on who buys who when it comes to API providers.</li>

<p>Interesting usage of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>analytics</strong></span> in an acronym, and some money rais'n:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dataplumbing.com/blog/example-of-architecture-for-aaas-analytics-as-a-service">Example of architecture for AaaS (Analytics as a Service)</a> - I thought the title was a joke at first, but actually provides an interesting blueprint to use for API driven analytics. I'd ditch the acronym though. ;-)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/dataminr-raises-130-million-to-expand-enterprise-verticals-for-twitter-analytics/">Dataminr raises $130 million to expand enterprise verticals for Twitter analytics</a>&nbsp;- Lots of money in API driven analytics. We've seen this market stabilize with the world of social, but with the number of APIs out there, the Dataminr, Datasift, and other models will become relevant in other areas of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be tracking on more <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>annotation</strong></span> related discussions in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/16/youtube-introduces-interactive-cards-to-complement-annotations-and-they-work-on-mobile-too/">YouTube introduces interactive cards to complement annotations &ndash; and they work on mobile too</a> - I think normally I'd consider this an embeddable story, I'm going to be looking for annotation specific elements that are API driven.

</ul>
<p>Some <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API aggregation</strong></span> action, mostly from Google:</p>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://trafficandweather.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/traffic-and-weather/Traffic-and-Weather.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/posts/2015/3/19/episode-28-everybody-likes-to-listen-to-people-searching-for-things-on-twitter">listening to too infrequent Traffic and Weather API podcast today</a>, and one of the topics John and Steve covered was an interesting approach to API consumption, and getting past API rate limits, with <a href="https://github.com/singingwolfboy/webhookdb">WebhookDB</a>. I agree with John, that WebhookDB is pretty clever, and represents what I'd consider classic API developer ingenuity, when it comes to getting access to the resources they need. I&rsquo;d have to give this one to my friend and API adversary Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>), when he says rate limits stimulate developer creativity. +1 Tyler.</p>
<p>So, what does WebhookDB do?</p>
<blockquote><em>...allows you to replicate Github's database over HTTP using webhooks. It's useful if you want to treat Github's APIs as a database, querying over pull requests and issues. Github doesn't like that, and you'll quickly hit the API's rate limits -- but if you use WebhookDB, you don't have to worry about it! Just populate the initial data into the database, set up the webhook replication to keep it in sync, and query your local database however you'd like...</em></blockquote>
<p>There is more back-story over at the <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201412/rest_api_gotcha_and_webhookdb.html">REST API gotcha, and webhookdb story</a> that Traffic and Weather linked to. I agree with John&rsquo;s thoughts, that this is an opportunity for a service provider to step up and deliver on. I envision a pretty simple, open source, containerized version, as well as a cloud-based version that people could tap into, and pay for more premium services on top of each index.</p>
<p>John is right, there will be significant overhead in defining the schema of each API you would support. Let me know, I can help with some of the targeting, alongside what I&rsquo;m doing for my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>. Each API would need some special attention, but with containers, you could easily build out a pretty slick deployment solution that runs in cloud, or in infrastructure of choice for end-users. With some heavy lifting up front, it would be a pretty viable solution for API consumers, but I also think provide an interesting cache opportunity for API providers--think <a href="http://datasift.com/">Datasift</a>.</p>
<p>I also see a higher, more analyst level view here, in helping establish a common definition of web hook patterns across the space, and identify common patterns, then bring much needed education and potential consistency to the API space when it comes to webhook execution. Kind of like what I work to do for API design, deployment, management, integration, and other key areas of the API space. People are hungry for this type of information, and I&rsquo;m happy to aggregate the work of anyone who steps up and delivers in this way.</p>
<p>I would also take this one step further, and charge someone with stepping up into more of a web hook advocacy role, where you could push back on some API providers to offer webhooks (many don&rsquo;t), and improve existing web hook designs, again helping establish consistency in the space. In my experience many API providers want to understand the bigger picture, but don&rsquo;t often have the time or awareness, and with a little education, and guidance, you could make a significant impact.</p>
<p>I look at webhooks as the important second lane, making APIs a two-way street, shifting API operations to be just as much push, as it is pull. Web hooks play a different role in potentially each APIs operations and ecosystems, but for many platforms, they will continue to play an important role in giving developers more control over API resources, while also eliminating much of the burden upon API providers.</p>
<p>Great idea John and Steve, thanks for sharing. One more reason to tune into <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>&mdash;startup ideas!!</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-bright.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">slowly migrating my own infrastructure, towards a microservice first approach</a>, something you can follow the details of on my <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">alpha.apievangelist.com blog</a>. I've been running on my own custom brew content management system (CMS) since I started API Evangelist in 2010. There are many APIs in use across my system, both external publicly available APIs like Twitter and Crunchbase, and a wide variety of internal APIs I've developed myself.</p>
<p>As I work to replicate each aspect of my CMS, carving off each potential micro service, I'm reminded of how much of what I do lives in the shadows. Little scripts I've written here, and there, jobs I haven't run in months, and just general code exhaust from years of operation. I&rsquo;m a little different than most shops, as I'm a one person operation, who codes all my own stuff, but based upon my experience in other shops, the same behavior exists in almost any organization.</p>
<p>Throughout this migration I&rsquo;m reminded of what I'd consider to be one of the biggest security lapses in my world, which is just about things being known. As I build out new features, jobs, bells, and whistles, are they all cataloged, mapped out, and consistently used, or deprecated. Anything that is unknown, unaccounted for, lives in the shadows of my operations, and potentially provides a security risk. Often times the culprit in any security lapse, is an unknown workstation, server, application, or single script.</p>
<p>Having a single doorway (micro service), with a single approach to authentication (<a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API Infrastructure</a>), and a map of my entire surface area, using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> + <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, I&rsquo;m getting a much better handle on things. It will take a while to clean up all my legacy stuff, and map everything out, but once I do, I can easily audit, monitor, deprecate, and ultimately secure the entire surface area of my infrastructure, because it is all done with an API first approach. Then I&rsquo;ll continue to address other aspects of my security like SSL, app management, and other critical areas, but for now, I feel like being able to map out my infrastructure, is doing wonders for bringing my infrastructure out of the shadows.</p>

<p>I am putting a lot of thought into the value of an API request and response lately. I've talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/postman-collections-as-unit-of-measurement-for-transactions-in-the-api-economy/">the potential of a Postman collection as a unit of measurement, for the API economy</a>. I&rsquo;m also spending time breaking down the monetization strategies of <a href="http://theapistack.com/">the 700+ companies I track on</a>, but I&rsquo;m really looking to get beyond just the API pricing, and actually measure any evidence of real value that I can.</p>
<p>This particular post is born out of a conversation with John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1rgh3wM">Runscope</a>, while we were in Sydney Australia last month for <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days Sydney</a>. John had mentioned that when people asked him which are the best APIs out there, he replies &ldquo;none of them, until they are used&rdquo;. Which when you think about it, it really is the truth--APIs do not offer ay value, until they are actually put to use in an app, or system integration.</p>
<p>It is easy to place the value in the actual API definition, or in the request, or response from the API. There is also a lot of talk about much of the value being in the documentation, or possibly the SDK. You can event point to the value being that it is a public API, with easy on-boarding, that you can rely on, and scale as you need. All of this may contribute units to the overall value, but at this point any API still doesn't have value to anyone.</p>
<p>As John says, the point at which an API has value, is when it is used. Until that point, an API isn&rsquo;t a thing. I&rsquo;m not saying the API call as a metric, is the single metric to rule them all, but it is at this point when I feel you can really begin to measure the value an API delivers, and capture the exhaust from it. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know what I mean by all of this, it really is just an exercise for me to break down the moving parts of each API, so that I can better understand how APIs will potentially fuel the API economy--think what Runscope does, but for the monetization portion of each API transaction.</p>

<p>I'm working with multiple partners to define what I&rsquo;d consider to be the firsts stops along the API lifecycle, when you use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as the scaffolding for your API operations. APIs.json is a machine readable format for indexing APIs, that exist under a specific website domain, or are part of a aggregate collection designed for a specific project or objective.</p>
<p>To help me, and the folks I&rsquo;m working with to better see the API lifecycle that APIs.json is enabling, I wanted to take a stroll through each of the stops along the API lifecycle, and think through the potential for additional formats, services, and tooling throughout the entire journey. I want to explore the possibilities for individual API providers, API consumers, as well as API service providers, and the aggregate level, where companies and individuals are delivering valuable tools and services to the overall space.</p>
<p>First, lets start with what I envision APIs.json enabling at the direct one to one, API provider and consumer levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Metadata - </strong>Quick access to the most important info about any API, its title, description, image, endpoint, url and tags.</li>
<li><strong>API Surface Area - (The Truth) -</strong> Using Swagger and API Blueprint, any developer can quickly quantify the surface area of an API or microservice.</li>
<li><strong>Execute API -</strong> Include Postman Collections, allowing each API to be execute ready, allowing consumers to load in Postman and deliver the value behind any API.</li>
<li><strong>On-Board API -</strong> One click reference to where an API consumer can onboard with an API.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Server-Side Code - </strong>Locating of existing server-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Generate Server-Side Code -</strong> Locating of services for generating of server-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Supporting Container Images - </strong>Where Docker, and other container images reside, providing instant deployment opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Client Side Code - </strong>Locating of existing client-side code in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-generate Client Side Code - </strong>Locating of services for generating of client-side code in multiple language.</li>
<li><strong>API Pricing -</strong> Understand pricing, access tiers, and partnership opportunities around API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Services - </strong>Access, and make sense of terms of services that apply to API usage.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing - </strong>Understand the licensing of an API, data, content, and code related with an API.</li>
<li><strong>General Questions -</strong> Be able to ask, and get answers to common questions about any API.</li>
<li><strong>API Conversations - </strong>Understand where to engage in conversations, and experience streams from common sources like Github and forums.</li>
<li><strong>Augment APIs - </strong>Add endpoints, verbs, and parameters to existing endpoints, augmenting what any single API provider can deliver.</li>
<li><strong>API Presets -</strong> Establish preset value for API entries, allowing the single, or bulk publishing of data, content and other values to APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Mapping and Domain Specific Language (DSL) - </strong>Bridging API definitions, and APIs, providing much needed aggregation and reciprocity for APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Sandboxes -</strong> Establish API sandboxes, based upon existing API designs, allowing developers to develop against alternative API than a production environment.</li>
<li><strong>API Simulations - </strong>Beyond just a sandbox, actually establish alternative APIs that provide specific simulations of production scenarios that an API would serve.</li>
<li><strong>API Cookbooks - </strong>Assemble API cookbooks that help onboard API consumers using wizards, blueprints, and other established orchestration patterns.</li>
<li><strong>API Testing -</strong> Initiate API testing tools and services, covering surface area of each API.</li>
<li><strong>API Monitoring - </strong>Initiate API monitoring tools and services, covering surface area of each API.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Security - </strong>Audit surface area of any API that is indexed using APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>API Adjacent Monitoring - </strong>Initiate monitoring of other API adjacent resources like documentation, terms of services, and other essential building blocks of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Visualize API Surface Area -</strong> Simple, embeddable visualizations that help us see the surface area an API provides.</li>
<li><strong>Visualize API Resources - </strong>Simple, embeddable visualizations that help us interact with the resources APIs deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze API Surface Area - </strong>Simple, plug and plug tooling and services for analyzing the surface area of any API.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze API Resources -</strong> Simple, plug and play tooling and services for analyzing the resources APIs deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Load API Response In Spreadsheet - </strong>Resource for loading, and importing API resources into an Excel or Google Spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong>Craft experiences -</strong> Weave together experiences made up of multiple API resources, and the resources that are available to support them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list represents my master vision for stops along the API lifecycle, that could be served via APIs.json, providing value directly to API providers, and their consumers. Each of these areas would benefit both sides of the API coin, but as you can see will add value to the APIs.json engine, in a way that goes well beyond just API discovery--which APIs.json is known for.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to articulate, and map out the opportunities that will be available when APIs.json is fully realized. Our goal is to push the number of APIs.json files available to a critical point, where this full lifecycle vision is a reality. Once this occurs, I see another plane of existence emerging, one that can be applied across hundreds, or thousands or public or private APIs and micro services.</p>
<p>Once a critical mass with the number of APIs.json files is achieved, the wider opportunities for expansion, growth, and monetization will span three main areas in my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definitions - </strong>Additional API definitions like Swagger, API Blueprint, and API Commons, providing machine readable access to vital components of API operations, that can be baked into the overall API lifecycle. 
<ul>
<li><strong>API Pricing -</strong> A machine readable format for breaking down pricing, access tiers, and partnership opportunities around APis indexed with APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>API Questions - </strong>A machine readable format for aggregating questions around API operations, including terms of service, privacy policy, and other elements that impact API integration.</li>
<li><strong>API Conversations - </strong>A machine readable for for aggregating conversations that occur around API operations, that occur on multiple channels like Github, Stack Overflow, Twitter and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>API Services -</strong>&nbsp;The opportunity for new API services to be developed on top of the APIs.json lifecycle.   
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing -</strong> Introduction of testing related services to known, and custom APIs definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring -</strong> One time and schedule monitoring services, triggered via APIs.json indexing.</li>
<li><strong>Security -</strong> Scanning of entire API surface area defined by an APIs.json definition.</li>
<li><strong>Broker - </strong>Use of APIs.json in API broker related activity, crafting custom API backends and stacks.</li>
<li><strong>Analyst - </strong>Delivery of vital industry and area data and content, using APis.json format, connecting analysis directly to sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>API Tooling&nbsp;<strong>-</strong></strong>&nbsp;The opportunity for new API tooling to be developed on top of the APIs.json lifecycle.  
<ul>
<li><strong>Search -</strong> Continued growth in the number of API search engines like APIs.io, providing options, and competition.</li>
<li><strong>Collections -</strong> Establishment of common tooling for doing API roundups, collections, stacks, or any other grouping that is defined.</li>
<li><strong>Notebook -</strong> Deployment of tools for saving, organizing, and remixing using APIs.json formats, either publicly or privately.</li>
<li><strong>Spots / Hubs - </strong>Deployment of API spots and hubs that allow aggregation of API definitions, supporting building blocks, and API consumers in a wide variety of API areas.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboards -</strong> Deployment of dynamic, APIs.json driven dashboards that generate visualizations, listings, and other detail via machine readable API definition formats.</li>
<li><strong>Infographics / Reports -</strong> Deployment of dynamic, APIs.json driven infographics, reports  that generate visualizations, listings, and other detail via machine readable API definition formats, in a portable format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is just a sampling of the definition, services, and tooling opportunities that are already, and will eventually emerge around an APIs.json driven lifecycle. The objective of this post was to flush out my ideas around the one to one, and the wider API economy opportunities using in APIs.json driven API lifecycle, for my own purposes, but also to communicate my thoughts to a handful of partners who are executing definitions, services, and tooling already.</p>
<p>If you are curious about what this all means, and get more clarification about how your company, its services and tooling fit into this, feel free to reach out, and I&rsquo;ll do what I can to help you understand where you fit. Some of the stops along this API driven supply chain, I&rsquo;m depending on existing efforts like Swagger and API Blueprint to execute, some of the areas I&rsquo;m pushing forward myself like API Commons, API Pricing, API Questions, and API Conversations, while other areas I&rsquo;m depending on 3rd party individuals and companies to step up and own. If you think you might be interested in delivering an API definition, service, or tooling somewhere in the areas I&rsquo;ve defined, feel free to reach out.</p>
<p>This post is a product of several conversations I&rsquo;m having with folks, and the regular conversations that Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of 3Scale, and I are having around the APIs.json format. Additionally we are currently working on the roadmap for APIs.io with Nicolas Grenie (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a>), which is the first of many tools that are being built on the APIs.json format. <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">You can influence the roadmap for APIs.json via the Github repo</a>, and the individual communities of each of the sub APIs.json API definitions formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, on their own working sites and repos.</p>

<p>I was just talking with my friend Oliver Seiler (@0seiler) in New Zealand via email. Oliver is great at keeping me in tune with API related stories out of New Zealand. I was making sure he knew how much I appreciate people like him sending me regular updates, and that it is what makes API Evangelist go around&mdash;to which he replied, reminding of how important the work we are doing here in the US API space.</p>
<p>Oliver told me what I hear a lot, <em>"We still need to sell our story every single day and you wouldn't believe how much anything that comes from particularly you and 18F, but also ProgrammableWeb and GDS in the UK matters to our work."</em> This isn't an isolated case, I hear this a lot from people I talk to in government, enterprises, and other institutions around then globe--the stories we tell are used to make change in how they think and potentially operate. Our stories from the trenches, become the stories they use to sell APis to their bosses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These reminders are what keeps me going after almost five years of evangelizing. The stories we are sharing about API best practices, and the challenges we face across API design, deployment, management, monetization, evangelism, discovery, and integration, are important to not just the health of the overall API space, but to each public and private sectors that APIs are touching in 2015.</p>
<p>The message for me here, is that we all need to keep pushing forward, but also making sure we tell the stories publicly, sharing our knowledge in real-time, because people are watching, and depending on us to help influence how things work in their businesses, institutions, and government agencies around the world. #NoPressure</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://gsa.github.io/sam_api/sam/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/sam-api-gov.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Running the perfect API operation is pretty much a delusional dream. Even leaders &nbsp;like Twilio and AWS have platform, and ecosystem produced problems on a regular basis. In my opinion, API are all about the journey, and we may never get our strategy 100% perfect, we can communicate, and evolve along the way&mdash;this is what I consider the API journey.</p>
<p>To help demonstrate this in action, here a p<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/yBlLdvG2lmk">ost from the GSA, about the SAM API, on the US Government API Forum</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We've, rightfully, heard complaints about the SAM API languishing and the documentation not being as functional as it needs to be. We want to make sure users of the API feel comfortable using it to build real applications off of. We've adjusted how we're staffing the API as well as raised the priority the API in the eyes of our developers.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To you, this means this:</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>1) At a minimum, we're sweeping through new GitHub issues weekly, but we will do everything to go through those issues more rapidly.<br /></em><em>2) We're going to increase our transparency by making sure that anything in our backlog that's API-related is in a GitHub issue - if it's prioritized with a date, that'll be made clear, too. We want to make sure you know what's coming and on what days - and the docs will be updated to reflect what's currently implemented and what's coming.<br /></em><em>3) We're going to publish our version management plan to the SAM API site so it's more clear what's going to cause a version change. One of the things about the SAM data is that regulations may change our data, so we should be treating some of it (like reps and certs) as variable-length instead of fixed to keep systems from breaking, so we absolutely document that.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>We've already added some updates that include reference data that wasn't available before and a few minor cleanups. Expect the more as we ramp up our people at this to be worked through by the end of next week. We appreciate being held to task on this - IAE's larger strategy relies on usable, exciting APIs and we can't do that if we aren't serving you.</em></p>
<p>This is why I prescribe APIs, not because APIs are a technological wonder that magically fixes everything (they do, oh they do). I prescribe APis because of the API journey, and if done right, the API provider can change, evolve, and learn to better serve their consumers, and in this case constituents.</p>
<p>APIs are born out of breaking down legacy walls built up between IT and business operations, but they have also become about breaking down walls built up between inside the firewall, and outside the firewall. In the end I do not think APIs are the thing that will change government or companies, it is the process of doing them, learning to open up and communicate, that will move the needle forward.</p>
<p>Something that will not happen at your agency, organization, institution, or business if you do not start on the API journey yourself.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">More Pondering On My Own Microservice Definition</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-micro-definition.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Like API, the term microservice has emerged as a force, along with a meaning that is very precise, or very broad, depending on who you are. The only thing I&rsquo;m sure of at this point, is the term microservice is very personal, and means very different things to different people, depending on where you stand in the industry.</p>
<p>Regardless I can't help but consider the implications of the term, internalize it, and see what value I can derive from its meaning in my own world. This exercise leaves me asking, what is a microservice? Over and over, acknowledging I may never fully know the meaning, and like API it will be more of a journey, then it never will be a destination.</p>
<p>First and foremost in my world a microservice means simple, and small. Simple and small. Simple and small. Say it until you can feel it, all Buddhist colliding with API Evangelist. Simple and small, penetrates all layer of meaning for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal surface</li>
<li>minimal on disk</li>
<li>minimal compute</li>
<li>minimal message</li>
<li>minimal network</li>
<li>minimal ui</li>
<li>minimal time to rebuild</li>
<li>minimal time to throw away</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately I want all of this, coupled with the ability to achieve maximum scale, with minimum effort. I want to do one thing, as well as I possibly can, with as minimal resources necessary, but delivering the maximum value at any scale&mdash;with value benefiting myself, my API consumers, and the end-users being served, equally.</p>
<p>None of this is set in stone for me. I acknowledge this is my own perception, and that others will see microservices as something entirely different. Even so, I share my definition publicly, as also I enjoy reading others definition. I kind of think that is part of the whole microservices thing, sharing your own personal definition. In reality microservices do not change my API mission, but it does allow the conversation to be distilled down, for a new generation of business leaders working to make sense of all of this.</p>

<p>Phew!! This week was hard. I just couldn't find the mojo to plow through, but I did it. A little late on Monday evening, but still so worth doing--putting the week into perspective.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to assess the best balance with what I post as individual news stories on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>. I think more of this could be pulled out as actual news stories, but will have to see if I have the time. Overall I am happy with how the weekly API.Report is evolving, but there is so much more I could do.</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>I track on a lot of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3D Printing</span></strong>, but few of them are directly API related, finallky one that moves the conversation forward:</p>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>As I did last week, I'm walking away with a better awareness of what is happening across the space. It isn't enough for me to read all of this API news in isolation, it helps to see it side by side with other news, allowing me to see and understand patterns that I may have missed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-enterprise.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I would say the enterprise space fleet has successfully shifted their course, heading in the general direction of everything API. SAP, Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, and the rest of the usual suspects have pledged their faith to APIs, mobile, and IoT, all in a very public way. For those of us who jumped off the SOA bandwagon a while back (getting on the API bandwagon, yeehaw), this can be amusing to watch, cause the API bandwagon is better y'know?. ;-)</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that these large companies can make a shift towards an API way of life, or a microservice devops way of operating, or whatever the cool enterprise kids are calling it these days. Some companies will find success in these areas, while many, many others will just talk about it, and buy a wide range of vendor services that will help them talk about it&mdash;there will be a lot of money to be made (and spent).</p>
<p>The thing I fear, is that many of the core principles of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">why this whole thing is working</a> will go right over the heads of many technologies and business leaders in the enterprise. Elements like simplicity, transparency, openness, and functioning in a decoupled, decentralized way. You are the enterprise, many of the essential ingredients of API, are just fundamentally at odds with what you are. You are a big, complex, powerful, and political corporate presence&mdash;a beast that does not like being taken apart, reinvented over and over, and being forced to work in concert with other internal, partner, and public resources, in an open way.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that some enterprise entities won&rsquo;t be successful&mdash;some will. I will be carefully watching the waves of enterprise organizations, for these tech savvy few, who internalize the core philosophy around APIs, successfully uploading their corporate soul to the API singularity. However, I predict I will have to work very hard to find these companies amidst the wreckage of the enterprise organizations that make the same mistakes they did with SOA, because APIs are just not compatible with their DNA, and ultimately will be rejected for reasons that are more enterprise than they are API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm immersed in deep thoughts about the implications of machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collections,</a> which are being applied to APIs, in some very different, but overlapping, and complementary ways. Currently I&rsquo;m working to define the overlap between APIs.json and Postman Collections, and how they work together.</p>
<p>For me, any good API starts with a Swagger definition, or API Blueprint, which is the single, machine readable truth of what is the surface area of any API, which I consider fingerprint for what is possible with any API or micro service. Additionally when I am working with any API, or stack of APIs, I am using APis.json to organize them into a single coherent set of APIs, then rely on each APIs properties to point to essential resources like Swagger, terms of service, pricing, and anything else I feel is essential to operations.</p>
<p>In addition to providing links to Swagger definitions for each APIs.json API entry, I&rsquo;m also experimenting with adding a property that point to any Postman Collection for each API, and microservice.  I&rsquo;ll start by just calling the type &ldquo;x-postman-collection&rdquo;, and provide a URL to a Postman Collection I&rsquo;ve generated around the API call, providing a link between what an API is, and a measurement of the transaction an API produces.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that Swagger is the promise of value an API delivers, and Postman is a machine readable representation of the value, ready for execution&mdash;which acts as machine readable unit you can then load into Postman, or any other system, and actually experience the result. When this unit is sitting in your Postman client, you can see the value behind a single collection, but when you see a couple hundred of these collections in your Postman, you start seeing the important role they can play in the overall API economy, as portable a unit of measurement for API transactions.</p>

<p>If you are following some of my recent stories, I&rsquo;m heavily focused on <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, as <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">I work to organize my own stack of microservices</a>, using APIs.son and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. I&rsquo;m working hard to define additional, machine readable layers to my microservices index that answer as many of the questions that I have about the microservices and APIs that I depend on.</p>
<p>The first machine readable definition I include in any <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/making-sure-my-api-roundup-stories-are-machine-readable-by-designing-them-as-apisjson-collections/">APIs.json collection</a> I&rsquo;m building is Swagger, which provides a JSON or YAML definition of the surface area for any microservice or API that I depend on. The second thing I put to work for my own APIs, is <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, which provides a JSON definition for the licensing of my APIs. Beyond that I&rsquo;m pushing forward a couple of other machine readable definitions, that help me make sense of not just a handful of APIs in my own collections, but potentially thousands of APIs in the public space.</p>
<p>I just published two potential new machine readable definitions to add to my stack of APIs.json properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com/">api-pricing</a></strong> - My quest to understand the API pricing across the API space, from providers like Amazon to Twilio, there are some healthy patterns to follow when crafting API pricing.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">api-questions</a></strong> - My realization that nobody would give a shit about a machine readable terms of service, so I created a simple JSON list of questions and answers that can be applied to APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are two areas that I am trying to better understand, as I build my machine readable index of the APIs, that I call <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>, which also helps fuel <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Another area I&rsquo;m struggling to get a handle on, is the message layer around APIs, and more widely what I&rsquo;d consider the feedback look around APIs. So, what the heck do I mean by this? I&rsquo;m not entirely sure, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure it out in real-time--which is why I'm writing this post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an API is one of my internal APIs, the messaging, communication, and feedback loop starts with issue management in Github. Each API has its own Github repo as its home base, and any communication around its design, deployment, and management, happens there. However there may be other references to the API made on Twitter, Stack Overflow, or other channel, and I am looking for a way to aggregate them all in a single machine readable away, that is connected to the API.</p>
<p>To do this, I&rsquo;m employing the same approach I&rsquo;m using to get a handle on pricing, and other questions I have around API operations, and creating a new APIs.json API property type, which I&rsquo;m going to call <span style="text-decoration: underline;">api-conversations</span>. Right now I&rsquo;m just going to include message entries for Github issues, but work to make as inclusive as I can, to include any possible channel. We&rsquo;ll see where I go with api-conversations, right now I&rsquo;m going to use it to manage the feedback loop within my own microservices stack, but then I&rsquo;m also going to apply to the API Stack, and see what it looks like when I try and aggregate the feedback loop around public APIs.</p>

<p>I've said it before, and I will say it again &mdash; <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">Excel and spreadsheets</a>&nbsp;will continue to be super critical for the growth of the API industry. There are an increasing number of solutions like <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark for deploying and managing APIs using spreadsheets</a>, something that will get easier over time, but so far I'm not seeing equal acknowledgment of the potential of Microsoft Excel as an API client.</p>
<p>The majority of the world's data is locked up in spreadsheets, and CSV files. Something I learned during my short time in Washington DC, is that the API community is going to have to court the legions of data stewards who spend their days in spreadsheets at the companies, and government agencies around the world, if we are going to be successful. The tooling for deploying APIs from spreadsheets has emerged, but we have a lot of work ahead to make them simpler and easier to use.</p>
<p>With the majority of the worlds data locked up in spreadsheets, this also means many of the business decision makers have their head in the spreadsheet on a daily basis, depending on the data, calculations, and visualizations that influence their daily decision-making. I&rsquo;m seeing only light efforts around delivering API driven services in the spreadsheet, something that is going to have to grow significantly before the API industry can reach the scale we would like.</p>
<p>I know that the spreadsheet does not excite API providers, and API integrators, but they are a comfortable tool for many of the business ranks, and if we are going to get them to buy into API economy, and play nicely, we are going to have to accommodate their world. When thinking of spreadsheets and APIs, don't just think delivering content and data to APIs, but also how APIs can deliver vital content and data back to spreadsheets users&mdash;acknowledging the ubiquitous tool can provide huge benefits as an API client, as well as data source.</p>

<p>My API hero of the day is <a href="https://twitter.com/adelevie">Alan deLevie</a> (@adelevie) over at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. I was tweeting out my story "<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/going-beyond-excel-as-a-data-source-for-api-deployment-and-focusing-on-it-as-an-api-client/">Going Beyond Excel As A Data Source For API Deployment And Focusing On It As An API Client</a>&rdquo; today, and he tweeted me back his <a href="https://ecfs.link/search?q=12-83">slick usage of the ImportXML function to get Federal Communication Commission (FCC) Electronic Comment Filing System data into a Google Spreadsheet.</a></p>
<p>When you visit&nbsp;<a href="https://ecfs.link/search?q=12-83">ecfa.link</a>, and scroll to the bottom of the page you will see simple instructions on how to get the data into your Google Spreadsheet:</p>
<p><a href="https://ecfs.link/search?q=12-83"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/ecfs-link-google-spreadsheet-importxml.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>This is what we need more of, something that should be default for all data APIs. There are some other RSS, JSON, and XML goodies on the page too, but that is another story. Providing a simple copy / paste option for taking API driven data and making available in Google Spreadsheets is what I'd consider fundamental building block, getting us towards what I talk about in my post. Spreadsheet users need a wealth of simple, copy and paste resources like this that they can tap, from both public, and private data sources.</p>
<p>You rock Alan! I think his approach to providing a copy / paste ImportXML standard should be standard for all data APIs. We can start simple, by building a library of simple data sources like cities, states, postal codes, but then graduate up to more advanced data sources, or even subscriptions to valuable, curated, premium data--the trick is going to be keeping it as dead simple as Alan made it.</p>
<p>I will have to think about adding the ImportXML copy / paste as a standard building block, along with RSS, XML, and JSON. It feeds nicely into my <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com">wider spreadsheet and API research</a> nicely. Thanks Alan for this story, keep up good work!</p>

<p>I use many types of APIs. Some are public APIs, operated by other people, and then there are the APIs I have designed, operate, and consume on my own. As I design, redesign, deploy, and manage my APIs, I'm in a fortunate place that I get to push the boundaries of API operations, without much of the friction of normal API platforms. I'm the only one providing and consuming many of my APIs, essentially running an API dictatorship.</p>
<p>Over time I have built quite a few APIs that are still up, active, but nobody is using them. I have built them during some specific research, or to support a prototype, which once I was done with core work, I do not need the API to actually be alive and running. At some point in the future when I revisit the research, I may want to fire back up the APIs, but for now its ok if they are down, with a dormant Docker image, and server-side code living within its requisite Github repo.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how I&rsquo;m building APIs that could possibly go away at anytime. It is an area that, as I think about more, the more use cases I come up with. It is helping me rethink some of my architecture, and workflow. Another potential approach I am contemplating involves having a single UI that may use one or many APIs, but those APIs aren't even live until I load the screen&mdash;which triggers the containerized deployment of the last known snapshot of each of the dependent microservices.</p>
<p>If nothing else I&rsquo;m having fun. I&rsquo;m not sure if all these scenarios are viable in the real world, but it makes for an interesting exercise, and provides me with a kind of fire drill approach to my workflow that lets me rethink my APIs, and the workflow around them, with each drill. For me, it shines a whole new light on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever-wait-nothey-can-go-away-at-any-time/">the old APIs can go away at any time, no wait you have to support them forever argument</a>. Docker and containerized deployment of my APIs are really warping how I see the services I depend on&mdash;fun, fun!</p>

<p>I was listening the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/apisuncensored">APIsâUncensored podcast last weekend</a>, where Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>), and Lorinda Brandon (<a href="/admin/blog/lindybrandon">@lindybrandon</a>) sat down for a conversation with Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>), the creator of API definition format Swagger. There are a lot of interesting API informational nuggets throughout the podcast, some of which I'll be writing about, but this one is about something Tony mentioned&mdash;called <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#vendorExtensions">Swagger vendor extensions</a>.</p>
<p>I've been using Swagger for a while, and specifically Swagger 2.0 since its release, and Swagger vendor extensions was new thing to me&mdash;most likly user error. I don't ever sweat things I miss, because I consume so much information each day, things are bound to get past me. Anyways, Swagger vendor extensions are simply the ability to add any property to an API definition by using the &ldquo;x-&ldquo; prefix&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is something we do with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as well, and is something that I think becomes the R&amp;D layer for any specification. Since I just learned about this ability, I do not have many examples of what has been done with these extensions.<a href="https://blog.apigee.com/detail/tutorial_using_apigee_127_to_build_apis_in_nodejs_swagger_20"> I found a post from Apigee</a> demonstrating how you can add "capabilities such as caching, quota, OAuth, and analytics to your API with Swagger vendor extensions via a <a href="https://github.com/apigee-127/volos)">project we call Volos.js</a>&rdquo;, and I came across <a href="http://rest.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/v1/?spec">Wikimedia using a "x-subspecs&rdquo; in the API definition for Wikipedia</a>&mdash;now that I&rsquo;m tracking on Swagger vendor extensions I will look for them in Swagger specs I come across.</p>
<p>I've come across blog posts about Swagger, where people outline how they don&rsquo;t use it because they can&rsquo;t define something they want. Maybe they just didn't know about Swagger vendor extensions like me, IDK. Regardless I will be tracking on how people are extending Swagger using the vendor extensions, and begin brainstorming some of my own ideas on how they can be used to craft exactly the API definition you need.</p>

<p>I am revisiting some work that I started when I was working in Washington DC as a Presidential Innovation Fellow(PIF). Actually there are several things going on here, a sort of perfect storm of API design thoughts. After reviewing hundreds of APIs, including APIs in the federal government, you start to want to either go mad, or start making changes to the API designs you are exposed to.</p>
<p>This leads me to the other layer to this story, a common question I get regularly, regarding <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/02/using-machine-readable-api-definitions-to-solve-a-persistent-question-are-there-any-write-apis-in-federal-government/">whether or not there are any write APIs in the federal government</a>&mdash;meaning, can you POST, or PUT to a common government resources. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/25/a-rare-beast-in-government-the-write-api/">Write APIs are important in government</a>, and their scarcity reflect some of the systemic illnesses I feel exists in government IT. With that in mind, bundled with the regular process of reviewing an API implementation out of government&mdash;you get this late night API Evangelist story. Enjoy. ;-)</p>
<p>I was profiling the <a href="https://data.usajobs.gov/Rest">data.usajobs.gov jobs API</a>, which included crafting a machine readable Swagger API definition:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7bccc3d914aae35003a0.js"></script>
<p>After crafting this machine readable definition of the surface area of data.usajobs.gov, I am once again reminded of the lack of write APIs in government--as the data.usajobs.gov API is GET only, which only provides a single search endpoint. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I am thankful for the work they&rsquo;ve done with the data.usajobs.gov jobs API, it is just my nature to study, then push and iterate on API designs anywhere I possibly can. Sorry, I have an addiction. ;-(</p>
<p>As I was profiling data.usajobs.gov, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/25/github-can-be-the-post-and-put-layer-for-federal-government-apis/">I remembered of the work I did as a PIF in DC, and how after the government shutdown, I wanted to see more APIs, have an augmented layer to their operations</a>&mdash;eliminating the ability to turn off the switch for government APIs. Meaning I would like read only APIs like data.usajobs.gov to have one or many other APIs that sync, and augment API functionality, beyond what the original government agency intended. It may sound radical, but I think it is how we are going to get this stuff done.</p>
<p>To help understand what I&rsquo;m talking about, I generated a basic evolution of the data.usajobs.gov jobs API design, allowing for potential POST, PUT, and DELETE capabilities, opening up the federal jobs API for community input:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/b5100f01f293cad858ea.js"></script>
<p>Of course, this API isn&rsquo;t a real API--It is just a Swagger representation of one possible API that could exist to augment the read only API provided by data.usajobs.gov. My goal is to just think through how we might be able to help iterate on existing API resources being provided by government agencies. Allowing for extending, building upon, and potentially crowdsourced assistance in the management public data. I&rsquo;m not saying this should be a fully open API, available to anyone, but the idea of a well managed, or possibly multiple well managed resources for the same public data is an interesting thought.</p>
<p>This approach would allow for the evolution of public data, beyond what the government can do on its own. External entities could build upon government data, like the jobs data from data.usajobs.gov, and then data.usajobs.gov could decide if any 3rd party resources becomes worthy of paying attention to. I&rsquo;m thinking about applying this type of model in other areas of government I am working through like with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/15/free-application-for-federal-student-aid-fafsa-api/">FAFSA API</a>, and some of the API efforts I&rsquo;m seeing out of Department of Interior and Department of Energy.</p>
<p>In the end this post is primarily about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/17/beyondget-or-otherverbs-an-augmented-api-platform-/">potential in augmenting existing read only APIs, with an external POST, PUT, and DELETE</a>. I&rsquo;m not saying the data.usajobs.gov jobs API needs this, it just happen to be the API I was profiling when this story came up, and it seemed as good of an API as any to leverage as part of this story.</p>
<p>Not much else will happen for me on this topic. I am not going to develop this API. <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">I just wanted to add the data.usajobs.gov job API to my federal API stack,</a> and along the way I got sidetracked with adding the POST, PUT, and DELETE layer of this story--damn ADD! ;-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find a couple of other federal government data sources to possibly push this idea forward, and eventually I&rsquo;d like to see a single API, developed on top of a government resources, surpass its original source in quality, and value, resulting in the original agency accepting the data back into their interanal systems. When it comes to data stewardship, open data, and APIs in government it is all about trust&mdash;without trust, any external, outside-in effort around open data and APis in the federal government, will be rejected.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/10/frontline-systems-rason-modeling-language-and-rest-api-make-advanced-analytics-easy-in-web-and-mobile-applications/">an interesting piece of technology today while doing new curation for API.Report</a>. <a href="https://rason.com/">RASON</a>,&nbsp;an interesting approach to API driven analytics and potential UI and visualization, that kind of resembles what I have been envisioning for one possible future. The analytics tool is created by a company called Frontline Systems, and I&rsquo;ll let them articulate what it is:</p>
<blockquote><em>RASON&trade; software is designed to make it much easier to create, test and deploy analytic models that use optimization, simulation, and data mining. RASON stands for Restful Analytic Solver&trade; Object Notation.</em></blockquote>
<p>RASON targets analytical professionals, excel power users, and web app developers, but here is where it gets over my head, "Problems you can solve with the RASON service include linear programming and mixed-integer programming problems, quadratic programming and second-order cone problems, nonlinear and global optimization problems, problems requiring genetic algorithm and tabu search methods -- from small to very large." &mdash; sounds impressive to me!</p>
<p>I signed up and played with RASON a little bit, but it wasn't as intuitive as I hoped. I think I have a little more to learn about RASON. <a href="https://rason.com/Home/About#rason_models">The RASON models are very cool, I like the airport hub</a>, I just don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge to make it work right now, however I&rsquo;m digging the idea, and it reflects what I&rsquo;ve been seeing in my head when it comes to defining <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com">API driven analysis</a>--when you connecting that with <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com">API generated visualizations</a>, <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a>, <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com">spreadsheets</a>, <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a>, and more&mdash;I start to get a little too excited.</p>
<p>Anyhoo. Just sharing a new technology that I found. Once I learn more about RASON, hopefully I will be able to see where RASON fits into the bigger API life-cycle, and share a little more.</p>

<p>I was watching an <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/api-craft/mSFq__019ik">open thread around ALPS over at API Craft</a>, something that is on my working list to better understand, apply more in my world, and tell the story all along the way. ALPS author, and API visionary (;-) Mike Amundsen (<a href="/admin/blog/mamund">@mamund</a>) responded to the thread with a nice overview, which I wantd to repost and share with you.</p>
<p>So, what is <a href="http://alps.io/">ALPS</a>?</p>
<ul>
<li>ALPS is not a runtime format like HTML or HAL</li>
<li>ALPS is not a designtime format like RAML or Swagger</li>
</ul>
<p>ALPS is a Profile format for describing the bounded context of a service.  ALPS can be used as source material for designtime formats like RAML, WADL, Swagger, WSDL, etc. on the server side.</p>
<p>ALPS can also be used as source material for client-side frameworks like Ember.js, Angular, etc on the client side.</p>
<p>ALPS describes the operations (actions) and data elements of a service. that's all. that description is the same no matter the designtime tooling, protocol, or message format used. that description is the same whether you are implementing code on the client-side or server-side.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Hence state is maintained SERVER SIDE by mapping the URL's when it is implemented... correct?"</em></blockquote>
<p>ALPS has nothing to say about how or where state is maintained. You can do whatever you wish when you implement the bounded context ALPS describes.</p>
<p>ALPS tells you the WHAT of the service, not the HOW.</p>
<p>For example, you can use the ALPS document to implement a services that employs your API Chaining on the server side. Or you can use the same ALPS document to implement a classic hypermedia-driven service using Cj or some other hypermedia-rich format. You can also use the same ALPS document to implement a simple JSON-object CRUD-style service.</p>
<p>When you use ALPS as the "shared bounded context" you can be confident that each of the services, regardless of their local implementation choices are supporting the same bounded context. this is especially handy when you want to provide the same operations using different implementations (e.g. JSON-object CRUD for mobile, HTML for browser, etc.).</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mohiomap/mohiomap-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are lots of good visualization stories recently, or maybe I&rsquo;m more focused on API driven visualizations. Who knows? This particular post is an API story because <a href="https://www.moh.io/mohiomap/welcome.php">Mohiomap</a>, the company at the center is using APIs to accomplish their &ldquo;vision&rdquo;, not because they have an API&mdash;which actually would be a nice way to pay it forward, but that is another story. Regardless, I think what <a href="https://www.moh.io/mohiomap/welcome.php">Mohiomap</a> is up to, is interesting on a lot of levels, bur primarily because in coming years we need to be able to better understand this new, cloud-based world we are  creating for ourselves.</p>
<p>Why am I blogging about this? Because Mohiomap is driven with APIs, and if done right, it can make a big difference in how we see our virtual selves, whether the business or brand personas we are crafting online, or our personal self that is spread across Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, and other API driven platforms. We currently can easily see our personas within each silo, like Facebook profile, Twitter profile, or Github profile, but understanding ourselves across the places we frequent online is much more difficult&mdash;something only possible when you begin using APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a visualization research project on my radar for some time now, but I think its time that I start publishing it for everyone to enjoy. API driven visualization is an important layer to my overall API economy research, and whether its for the meta layer of APIs, or for the valuable resources they are serving up, like wall posts, messages, photos, videos, or business documents--visualizations will continue to drive how we evolve our understanding of the digital world that is unfolding at a breakneck speed.</p>
<p>With the addition of Mohiomap, I&rsquo;m starting to develop quite a list of API driven visualization services and tooling. Enough to warrant its own research area, and be given a certain amount of attention each week. Ultimately it will depend on what the community delivers, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that visualizations will dominate the stories here on API Evangelist for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>As I look through more APIs, and I don&rsquo;t just play around in their developer portal, and look at documentation, I am actually get my hands dirty generating Swagger definitions, and authenticating and making calls to an API. There is no better way to get to know an API, that generating a Swagger definition, and integrating with it&mdash;something when done, you always walk away with a new perspective.</p>
<p>Once I get more of the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">APIs profiled in my API Stack</a>, I&rsquo;m going to see if I can configure my API editor to let me iterate on other people&rsquo;s API designs a little bit. As an API consumer, you don&rsquo;t always get a voice in the design of the next version of an API, but with API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, you can actually make edits, and then share them back with a provider. Of course it is still up to a provider to decide on what they accept, but there is not better way to make suggestions than a machine readable API definition, that is ready to go.</p>
<p>When I get around to doing some housecleaning on these API designs I generated, and possibly make some design iterations, I&rsquo;ll focus on some of the smaller operations, leaving the bigger teams to do their own heavy lifting. Also, my goal isn&rsquo;t just to iterate on API designs to help the original provider improve on their design, my goal is to iterative and improve on the API designs in my stack. The more designs I play with, more designs I have in my library, and the more I get a feel for what I think API designs could, or should look like.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t fix all the APIs in the world, but I can improve on the hard work that has already occurred, and who knows, maybe some providers will see it for the compliment that it is, and listen to some of my API designing that is occurring out loud.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2015</span>

<p>While processing the news today over at <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, I came across a <a href="http://api.report/2015/03/10/broadcom-open-switch-apis-drive-innovation-in-network-infrastructure/">story about Broadcom delivering an API for managing their latest network infrastructure</a>. The intersection of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Application Programming Interface (API) is something I&rsquo;m paying closer attention to lately. Hmmm. SDN + API = Brand New Bullshit Acronym? Meh. Onward, I just can&rsquo;t slow down to care--{"packet keep moving"}.</p>
<p>At the networking level, I&rsquo;m hearing <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/">Broadcom</a> making a classic API infrastructure argument, "With the OpenNSL software platform, Broadcom is publishing APIs that map Broadcom's Software Development Kit (SDK) to an open north bound interface, enabling the integration of new applications and the ability to optimize switch hardware platforms.&rdquo;, with examples of what you could build including "network monitoring, load balancing, service chaining, workload optimization and traffic engineering."</p>
<p>This new API driven approach to networking is available in the Broadcom Tomahawk and Trident II switches, looking to build up a developer community who can help deliver networking solutions, with Broadcom interested in giving, "users the freedom to control their technology, share their designs and boost application innovation.&rdquo; Everything Broadcom is up to is in alignment with other valid Internet of Things (IoT) efforts I&rsquo;m seeing across not just the networking arena, but almost any other physical object being connected to the Internet in 2015.</p>
<p>I think what Broadcom is doing, is very forward leaning effort, and providing native API support at the device level is definitely how you support &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; around your networking infrastructure. To keep in sync with the leading edge of the current API evolution as I'm seeing it, I would also recommend adding virtualized container support at the device level. As a developer I am thankful for the APIs that you are exposing, allowing me to develop custom solutions using your hardware, but I need you to take it one level further--I need to be able to deploy my own APIs using Docker, as well as working with your APIs, all running on your infrastructure.</p>
<p>I need your devices to support not just the web and mobile apps I will build around your around your hardware, and the API surface area you are providing with the new Tomahawk and Trident II switches, I need to also plugin my own microservice stack, and the microservices that vendors will be delivering to me. I need the next generation of switches to be API driven, but I also need to guarantee it is exactly the stack I need to achieve my networking objectives.</p>
<p>That concludes my intrusion into your road-map. I appreciate you even entertaining my ideas. I cannot share much more details on what I intend to do with your new SDN &amp; API driven goodness, but if you work with me to let me innovate on your virtual and physical API stack&mdash;I feel that you will be surprised with what what the overall community around your hardware will deliver.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-changelog-eye-icon.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm a big fan of private APIs, and all for keeping API access tailored to meaningful groups of users vs. just opening up data to the public, without first thinking critically about the possible pros and cons. With that said, I always encourage API providers to seriously consider the outside-in effect, when APIs are designed to be as accessible as possible, allowing unintended things to occur around your API resources.</p>
<p>It isn't just about the developers who are directly working with your API, it is also the entire API industry, and service providers that serve it. A number of companies exist across the API space, providing valuable products, services, and tooling that is derived from one or many API platforms. The API space is big enough now, it isn't just about the handful of strongest players, it is about the entire community.</p>
<p>An example of this is with <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API ChangeLog</a>, a monitoring service for API documentation. The API ChangeLog keeps an eye on 68 of the leading APIs, and tracks on whether or not they have updated their API documentation, and keeps developers informed of the changes. These types of services benefit both API providers, and consumers, making for a healthier space overall. While some API provider are good at keeping developers in tune with documentation changes, not all of us are able keep up, and sometimes developers just aren't tuned in, and the API ChangeLog helps fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Without outside access to API resources (like your docs), services like API ChangeLog do not exist, leaving developers to fend for themselves, and not providing valuable industry data that can be used by anyone. Services like API ChangeLog will be the lifeblood of the API economy, and provide valuable exhaust that informs API driven markets as they grow, and help give these markets som e of the positive forces they are so well known for.</p>
<p>Keep your APIs, and much of their supporting building blocks as accessible as possible, and while you are at it, <a href="http://apisjson.org">make sure and index them using APIs.json</a>, helping services like <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API ChangeLog</a> provide vital data to developers, and the wider API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dailymotion/Dailymotion-Developer-Area.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A short, concise, portable description of what your API does, is one of the most critical building blocks of API management, and is essential to reducing friction when new users are on-boarding with any API. It can be easy to design, and populate your API developer portal from a perspective that is very much in the know. I do it all the time, structuring your portal to reach the widest possible audience can be hard&mdash;it is why I&rsquo;m here! ;-)</p>
<p>Here is a great example of providing all the right elements, but leaving out the essential detail that new API consumers will need. View the <a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com/">Dailymotion developer area</a>, land on home page, and without clicking, tell me what Dailymotion does.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/dailymotion-dev-portal-screenshot.png" alt="" width="98%" align="right" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The portal has all the right moves, except it neglects to say anything about videos, or show a video picture. I guess you could argue that anyone landing here will probably be getting there via the main Dailymotion site, with the proper knowledge of what is going on. This is probably true, but there will always be people landing on the API developer portal page, without any clue of what Dailymotion does&mdash;do not make them click to find out.</p>
<p>This really isn&rsquo;t that big of a mistake, and something that only someone like me, who looks at numerous developer portals would think about. For Dailymotion, all they have to do is update the FMA area, put video in the title, short description, and maybe include as an image in the background. Boom, within seconds everyone understands the value offered by Dailymotion in 2 seconds or less.</p>
<p>The description you provide on your API portal landing page is your first impression, make it count. It is also likely, that the press, bloggers, and  other 3rd parties will copy / paste the description to describe what you do, on remote websites&mdash;so make it good!</p>

<p>You don't often see me lead into a story with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">accounting</span></strong>, but Xero is pushing forward with their world domination plan, worthy of highlighting:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Advertising</strong></span> is not something usually here, but at the intersection of gaming, I'm a little more interested:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.amazon.com/post/TxRVIU79H0XNDZ/Get-Started-with-the-Amazon-Mobile-Ads-API-in-Your-iOS-App-or-Game">Get Started with the Amazon Mobile Ads API in Your iOS App or Game</a> - I will have to do more research on how big the mobile advertising space is, and see what portion of that is gaming.

</ul>
</div>
<p>I am working to pull together <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>analytics</strong></span> specific research project over the next week. It is one of those areas I'm carving off of data:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2015/03/lightning-components-analytics-api.html">Build Reporting Apps Using Lightning Components and the Salesforce Analytics API</a> - I'd like to see more stories about building dynamic reporting solutions from API providers. There is a lot of opportunity to build simple tools for end-users here.&nbsp;</li>

I think this type of analytics in aggregate across government, institutions and other aspects of our public world makes sense. I'd like to see APIs that provide access to anyone looking to better understand how government operates (or doesn't).&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2015/03/02/google-launches-player-analytics-and-custom-native-ads-tools-for-gaming-developers/">Google launches Player Analytics and custom native ads tools for game developers</a> - More gaming news. At some point I'm going to start a gaming research site, as I see more API, and API adjacent stories in this space.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I am moving <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API definitions</span></strong> out of the API design realm, where I can showcase the benefits of machine readable formats:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.apigee.com/detail/apigee_product_highlight_video_smartdocs">Apigee Product Highlight Video: SmartDocs</a> - I thought was an introducing highlight of SmartDocs on the Apigee platform, or as I call them interactive docs. I like seeing how each of the API providers view the benefits of machine readable API definitions like Swagger--Apigee is definitely invested in Swagger.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are my thoughts on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API deployment</strong></span> for the week:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/07/we-need-an-open-library-of-the-most-common-utility-api-implementations">We Need An Open Library Of The Most Common Utility API Implementations &middot;</a> - This seems like a no brainer to me. Someone should step up and build a platform to house these, and figure out some way of generating revenue around this, in a way that you can offer the open source designs for free. Maybe premium services, or custom deployments could be enough to pay for it? It is another area that if someone doesn't step up I may start creating and publishing to a Github repo.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Some interesting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API design</strong></span> discussions this week, from the pragmatic, to the restafarian:</p>

I keep meaning to add it to my wheelhouse of API design knowledge, but haven't had the time. Looks I better prioritize, as they are getting real with it.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://nordicapis.com/common-cases-when-using-soap-makes-sense/">Common Cases When Using SOAP Makes Sense</a> - It is ok to use SOAP, especially if you work with the enterprise, or take showers every day like I do! ;-)&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>As usual, I'm leading the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API discovery</strong></span> conversation:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/07/a-breakdown-of-my-dream-apisjson-file/">A Breakdown Of My Dream APIs.json File &middot;</a> - It could happen! If I believe hard enough, or maybe work hard enough and create enough APIs.json for other people to reach the tipping point.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>A handful of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API evangelism</strong></span> discussions throughout the week:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>I predict <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API integration</strong></span> conversation will keep dominating the landscape:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.runscope.com/posts/sharing-http-requests">Sharing HTTP Requests Publicly or Privately When You Need Help Debugging an API Call</a> - I'm really digging how Runscope is opening up this layer of API integration, and making it more conversational and social.

</ul>
</div>
<p>I am hoping that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API podcasts</strong></span> that have emerged keep it up, and new one's continue to emerge:</p>
<div>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-journey.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Tony Hirst (<a href="https://twitter.com/psychemedia">@psychemedia</a>) wrote an interesting story about what I would consider <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the API journey</span>, which he called, &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2015/03/09/whats-the-point-of-an-api/">What&rsquo;s The Point Of An API?</a>&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m the first to call bullshit on the term API, which is more storytelling magic than it ever was technical, for me. In my opinion, the point of an API is rarely ever the actual technical implementation&mdash;sorry devs. ;-( The point of the API is the journey, for the API provider, and the API consumer (both dev and end-user).</p>
<p>The point of the API is about the API provider reducing friction, when it comes to understanding, and put to work, valuable digital assets from data, content, to more programmatic, algorithmic elements like image filtering or video encoding, to more physical elements like a Nest thermostat, webcam access, or drone controls. An API does not automatically equal success, it take so much more than just launching an API to establish something that delivers value, and is sustainable--something that can be easier said than done, in todays volatile, digital environment.</p>
<p>The point of an API is about the API consumers having the freedom to discover, access, explore, and put to use valuable digital resources that they couldn&rsquo;t deliver on their own, in new and interesting ways. Developers need to be part of a feedback loop with API providers that helps iterate APIs, and evolve APIs towards being more experience based beyond their resource oriented roots, and integrate them in meaningful ways into the systems, apps, and devices end-users depend on the most.</p>
<p>The point of an API is about empowering the end-user with applications that deliver value, all while opening up as much of the backend, and the pipes that are delivering valuable API driven resources, giving end-users a voice throughout the supply chain, using open formats like oAuth&mdash;bringing much needed transparency to the process. This isn&rsquo;t just about tech, it is also about developing sustainable businesses built around applications that are truly deliver value, which along a way also protect the interests, security, and privacy of the end-user.</p>
<p>The API is not purely the technical elements, it is made up of the technical, business, and political building blocks, which includes the documentation, SDK, terms of service, pricing, and the many other essential aspects of API operations. APIs are definitely made up of the API projections into the users environment, and back-again, facilitating a real-time journey, that if done right, can benefit the API platform, developers who build upon it, and the end-users who ultimately define what the point of any API is.</p>

<p>I'm adding a new layer to my monitoring of the API space, what I consider to be the people layer of the API Evangelist network--the actual people who are executing on much of what I talk about, across my research, and storytelling. This is all born out of the network of people I already talk to regularly, to get the stories, and details for the research that I publish regularly.</p>
<p>I have been tracking on many of the doers of the space for a while, behind the scenes, and this is just about exposing a select handful of individuals who can help you with some of the areas I discuss in my research and storytelling.</p>
<p>Up until now, my research has been about showcasing:</p>
<ul>
<li>News </li>
<li>Companies </li>
<li>Tools </li>
</ul>
<p>All I&rsquo;m doing now is exposing some of the people who are doing interesting things as well, and are open to being contacted about their work, and discuss how you can potentially tap their expertise to help you achieve your API objectives. Over the next couple weeks, you will see me start listing individuals who are open to helping out in the core areas I research:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Design</li>
<li>API Deployment</li>
<li>API Management</li>
<li>API Discovery</li>
<li>API Integration</li>
<li>API Evangelism</li>
<li>API Monetization</li>
<li>API Security</li>
</ul>
<p>I already showcase companies in many of these areas, and track on the features, or building blocks employed to deliver products and services they offer, all I&rsquo;m going to do now is provide more information on individuals who can help execute in these areas as well. Along the way you will also find me showcasing specific companies and tooling as well--API Evangelist partners like 3Scale, WSO2, and Restlet, but also other products I&rsquo;m personally invested in like APIs.json, and the companies, and tools I use daily like Swagger, API Blueprint, APITools, API Science, and Runscope.</p>
<p>After five years of doing this, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/scaling-what-i-do-at-api-evangelist/">I&rsquo;m trying to understand what scale looks like for API Evangelist</a>. My objective is to keep funding my research, producing the short form (blog), and long form (guides, white papers, and blueprints), while keeping it all rooted in what the leading API providers, and ultimately the people behind them are doing on the ground. With this in mind, you will find more areas of my research, providing links to people actually doing these things in the field, and you will also hear more about the conversations I am having with these people as they execute their craft.</p>
<p>As always, if you, or your company is doing something interesting in these areas, let me know&mdash;if you are an individual looking to freelance in these ares, or build a consultancy delivering services in these areas, let me know. I can&rsquo;t guarantee I&rsquo;ll include you in my research, but if you are doing interesting things, you&rsquo;ll stand out, and I&rsquo;m sure I can find some way to showcase your work in a way that helps you, me, and the wider API space. Also, if you need help with a project in one of these areas, feel free to reach out, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to point you in the right direction.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1Gm0CmP"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you are an API developer, it is likely you have used <a href="http://bit.ly/1Gm0CmP">Postman</a>, the simple tool for building, testing, and documenting your APIs. I have <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop">Postman open as a Google Chrome App</a>, which allows me to make API calls as I&rsquo;m designing, developing, and integrating with the APIs across my world. Something which opens up the response and requests of API calls that I&rsquo;m making, giving me more insight into how things are actually working (or not).</p>
<p>One of the <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">key aspects of Postman, are the collections</a>, which:</p>
<blockquote><em>A collection lets you group individual requests together. These requests can be further organized into sub-collections/folders to completely mirror your API. Requests can also store variations and responses when saved in a collection. You can add metadata like name and description too so that all the information that a developer needs to use your API is available right where he(she) needs it. Collections are listed in the sidebar alphabetically. You can search through collection requests using the search form for quick access.</em></blockquote>
<p>To me, Postman Collections are <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> at the API transaction level. Allowing you to define a single unit of currency in the API economy, save, and organize them, and execute them at any point in your API lifecycle. Postman Collections measure not just an API transaction that happens, it is a measure of future transactions that can happen, complete with any relevant meta data that will be needed along the way.</p>
<p>Along with <a href="http://bitly.com/1tnYxV8">Swagger</a>, and <a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/1arUHCU">API Blueprint</a>, I&rsquo;m working to better understand how Postman Collections impact, and fuel the API lifecycle, including conversations with Abhinav Asthana (<a href="https://twitter.com/a85">@a85</a>), Founder and CEO of Postman, about their roadmap. Postman Collections are not just about defining, organizing, and executing your API calls in the Postman client as a solo API developer, they are also about collaborating with other key players involved throughout the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m setting up my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> as Postman Collections, to help me understand how I can use the format to improve my API own API workflows. My goal is to ensure Postman works seamless with all stops along my own API and micro service lifecycle, from design to evangelism, and is plug and play as a machine readable element of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com/support">Dailymotion employs two very common building blocks for their platform support</a>, including an API specific Twitter handle, and good ol fashion email&mdash;both pretty proven approaches. However Dailymotion also employs a third aspect to thier API support, by recommending you head over to Stack Overflow for some community support.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> in this way is not that original, I see numerous API providers doing this, the part I found interesting was their reference to getting Dailymotion API support via Stack Overflow as, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"ask the stack!"</span> I like that, I think it reflects what Stack Overflow is to the API developer community, and was an elegant way to send API developers off your site, to get the support they need.</p>

<p>I was spending time profiling APIs late last night while putting back a couple of IPAs. Yes this is what I do on a Friday night, you have a problem with that? Anyways, I was crafting Swagger definitions for the <a href="http://developer.7digital.com/">7digital music APIs</a>, and the I came across <a href="http://developer.7digital.com/resources/api-docs/territories-api">their territories API</a>. "The Territories API serves data about countries that 7digital operates in, data about those counties, and a one or more languages with shop urls in each country&rdquo;, something that I could see being pretty useful to developers when building music apps on top of the platform.</p>
<p>There has been numerous APIs I&rsquo;ve developed in the past, where the need for some supporting, utility APIs, such as a list of states, zip codes, counties, or other resources was called for. Two layers to doing this: 1) Acknowledging the little things developers need goes a long way in building trust with them, letting them know you actually care, and get what they are facing 2) You want devs to achieve integration as quickly as possible, provide them with the little things that they will have to go hunt for, and possibly prevent them from achieving their objectives. &mdash; Reduce any friction possible!</p>
<p>I'd like to see an open source library of utility API design, complete with a variety of server side code, and data stores emerge, that help API providers deliver a more complete stacks of API resources. If you need a state / province API, or a language API, you could just grab one off the shelf and install it seamlessly into your API stack. This is just one of those little areas, that I think could be slowing the overall advancement of APis (just a wee bit), and with a little community effort, could really grease the wheels in API adoption, and fuel more meaningful integrations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm continuing my work, to help people understand what APIs.json is, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/three-ways-i-am-putting-apisjson-to-work/">varying ways that it can be put to use</a>.  My post the other week, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">breaking down Fitbits APIs.json file is a good example of where to get started</a>, and as a follow-up I wanted to help further set the bar for what a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">minimum viable APIs.json</a>&nbsp;looks like, and today, I am going in the other direction--toward my dream APis.json file.</p>
<p>APIs.json starts with a basic set of descriptions for who you are, the API provider. Each header of an APIs.json file gives you a handful of parameters for describing who you are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - your individual or company name, who is managing the APIs.json file.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of your company and / or the API collection you are building.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes yourself or your company</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe your API collection.</li>
<li><strong>created</strong> - the first date in which an APIs.json file was created.</li>
<li><strong>modified</strong> - the last date in which an APIs.json file created.</li>
<li><strong>url</strong> - The url of where the APIs.json lives, allowing your file to be portable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those seven parameters provide details on who you are, and what the API collection is all about. Remember an API collection doesn&rsquo;t always have to live under a specific company domain like Twilio.com, it could be a temporary or more permanent collection, that is part of specific project or application.</p>
<p>The next essential element of an APIs.json file, is the APIs collection, providing you the ability to describe one or many APIs as part of this collection. Similar to the parameters provided for the header, each API entry is allowed a handful of parameters that describe the API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - the name of the API.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> - a description of the value an API delivers.</li>
<li><strong>image</strong> - an image, logo, or icon that describes an API.</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong> - a handful of key words and phrases that describe the API itself.</li>
<li><strong>humanURL</strong> - The url any human should visit to learn more about an API.</li>
<li><strong>baseURL</strong> - The base url any machine should follow to start using an API.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears-soft-round.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Each API should have at least this information, at a minimum. I could stay here, with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">minimum viable APIs.json definition</a>, but I encourage you to take one more step, and put the properties collection to use for each API. You can provide any other URL you want for an APIs properties, but I recommend starting with the basic properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TermsOfService</strong> - where do I find your terms of service page.</li>
<li><strong>StatusPage</strong> - where is the url of the status page, where I can get platform update.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - point me directly to where your pricing page is, so I can make a decision on price.</li>
<li><strong>Forums</strong> - where is the community forum located for a platform, even if this is Stack Overflow.</li>
<li><strong>AlertsTwitterHandle</strong> - what is the primary Twitter handle for the API itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are meant to satisfy the common needs of anyone learning about API operations, however they are just URLs meant for the human API consumer. In my dream APIs.json file, there will be a robust amount of machine readable properties available for each API, beginning with the two most important:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> &nbsp;- a machine readable JSON or YAML file describing your API surface area</li>
<li><strong>Blueprint</strong> - a machine readable markdown file describing your API surface area</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with providing machine readable definitions of the API surface area, establishing a central truth or fingerprint for any API interface, it is just as important to provide a machine readable license for the API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>InterfaceLicense</strong> - a machine readable pointer to the licensing for the API interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with making sure the interface of an API matches your application objectives, consumers need to understand the licensing restrictions, or the freedom that comes with deeply integrating an API resource into any system or app.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m talking about my dream APIs.json file, I&rsquo;m going to talk about two added property formats I&rsquo;m currently working on behind the scenes, adding to the stack of machine readable API definition formats..  These new areas, represent two areas I&rsquo;m working hard to define and understand, right after I hand-craft Swagger definitions for my APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com/">API Pricing</a></strong> - taking pricing to the next level and making it machine readable.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">API Questions</a> </strong>- answering the important questions I need to know about each API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you imagine if API pricing was machine readable by default? Think of the options for building in a broker or market layer within the index of API platforms, and API collections, or even via an IDE. These two definitions are in an <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com">alpha stage</a>, but are based upon data I've been gathering behind the scenes, so a lot of thought has gone into settling on these buckets.</p>
<p>After that, I&rsquo;d say there are a handful custom properties I&rsquo;d like to see applied to each API indexed within an APIs.json:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>x-blog -</strong> where do I find your blog. (machine-readable below)</li>
<li><strong>x-blogrss - </strong>where can I just get an RSS of your blog stream.</li>
<li><strong>b-github -</strong> what is the primary Github account for the API.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-circuit-paths.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>That concludes my list of elements I&rsquo;d like to see available in my dream APIs.json file. You can see examples of this in action, with the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">700+ companies I've generated APIs.json files for, over at my API Stack Github repo</a>. There is a lot of work left to do, but this dream APIs.json file resembles a vision I have for the future of API discovery&mdash;which I see as the engine for the API economy.</p>
<p>My goal is to get there I need the most important aspects of API operations machine readable. We aren't there yet, but I can see it. Taste it. Imagine what we can do when you can program against:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surface Area (Swagger, Blueprint)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blog (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Status (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forum (RSS Feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Twitter (Twitter API)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Github (Github API)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pricing (api-pricing)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Licensing (API Commons)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Questions (api-questions)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I have been staying in tune with the API space using RSS feeds, and the Twitter and Github APIs for a couple years. I&rsquo;m just now developing a deeper understanding of the overall API space through the generation of machine readable API definitions for popular APIs. I can&rsquo;t do much on the API licensing front beyond launching <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, but I am working to define pricing with my <a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com">api-pricing</a> definition work, and also trying to capture the vital meta-data I need about API operations using <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com">api-questions</a>.</p>
<p>This post ended up being longer than I anticipated, but it is helping me beter understand what some of the next steps are for not just APIs.json, but also my own monitoring of the space. My goal is to not just push forward the APIs.json definition, but push forward my understanding along the way. Who knows maybe I'll drag you along too! ;-)</p>
<p>Ok, back to work. I just needed to wrap up these two posts about APis.json that were lingering in my outgoing story and idea queue.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had a conversation with some folks who are building a wikipedia of API definitions the other day, looking to employ formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to make an open, authoritative directory of machine readable API designs&mdash;something I can get behind 100%. I can even contribute the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">700+ APIs.json files, and the 250+ Swagger files I have generated</a>&nbsp;as part of my research.</p>
<p>When I have discussions about APIs.json folks, I always find it helpful to summarize the vision we have for the API discovery format, and described it in a short, concise way. This time around I was able to clarify the vision, in a way I hadn&rsquo;t fully been able to articulate before. To help me remember what I said, I wanted to capture it here on the blog.Many people who have heard about APIs.json as a sitemap for your APIs, but in reality there are three distinct ways I'm putting APIs.json to work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Providing A Sitemap -</strong> This is the simplest approach to using API.json, is to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">create a simple index of the APIs that exist within a domain</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Defining API Collection -</strong> Defining a portable, machine readable collection of common, or disparate APIs, like I&rsquo;ve done with my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/making-sure-my-api-roundup-stories-are-machine-readable-by-designing-them-as-apisjson-collections/">SMS messaging API stack</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Establishing New Definitions - </strong>A place to define the next generation of API definitions that support Swagger, Blueprint, adding licensing layer with <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, or maybe pricing, and the ability to answer service related questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be easy to call APIs.json a sitemap for APIs, but it is much more. It has a lot of potential for defining API collections while also making them portable, and machine readable by default. Where I really get excited for the potential is when it comes to defining new definitions that can work in conjunction with existing definitions, like Swagger and API Blueprint.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to leave you thinking about when it comes to APIs.json, is that it is designed to map out the world of public APIs we have, and the even larger layers of private APIs that exist behind the firewall, and make sense of this mess we&rsquo;ve created. Then with a rough blueprint, we can all work to define some new definition formats that help us bridge where we are currently at, to the next step of where we should be.</p>
<p>In the near fture, I'm focused on educating API providers on how to use APIs.json as a sitemap, and help API evangelists, brokers, and tech bloggers understand the potential that arises when you define API collections using APIs.json. When it comes to establishing new definitions, I think this will take longer to play out. I&rsquo;m working to help folks understand the importance of licensing their API using API Commons, and I&rsquo;m also playing around with some alpha formats for identifying some of the common questions that arise around API operations, and how companies are monetizing their APIs, but there is a lot of work to be done before this bears fruit.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-rolodex-card.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I come across a new company, during the course of my monitoring and information gathering across the API space, I enter them into my company API. Once a company is in there, and I&rsquo;ve deemed it worthy enough for a closer look, I profile their operations.</p>
<p>For my own organization, and in the spirit of transparency and collaboration, I wanted to breakdown what I mean by profiling. First I start with the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - The official name for any company or project. APis aren&rsquo;t always clearly defined corporate entities.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A short, concise description of what a company does. You&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is.</li>
<li><strong>Logo</strong> - A clean, simple, medium resolution logo for company. Again, you&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I dive into the common URLs that I care about, that provide me with the best signals possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - The heartbeat of any company, and API operations. In my opinion, the blog is one of the most important aspects of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Blog RSS</strong> - A simple, machine readable blog stream &mdash; blown away by how many companies don&rsquo;t have.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active, engaged Twitter account, providing me easy access via the Twitter API.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - A complete, active Github user or organization, where I can access code, and other aspects of API operations via Github API.</li>
<li><strong>Crunchbase</strong> - A business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Crunchable API.</li>
<li><strong>Angelist</strong> - Similar to Crunchbase a business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Angelist API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I tackle the API, or APIs, and profile each API they have by gathering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - A clean, portable name that describes the API, but keeps context of company or organization running it.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A short, concise description of what an API does &mdash; this is another pain in the ass to find most of the time.</li>
<li><strong>BaseURL</strong> - The base url for API calls. The process of finding this, will often determine for me, whether or not an API is worth monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - Doing the deep dive on an API, and generating a machine readable definition of at least the API surface area, and include underlying data model, and authentication when I can.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I sweep through the rest of the API program looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management Building Blocks - </strong>Run through my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common API management building blocks</a>, and record if any are present.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication Building Blocks - </strong>Track what type of authentication is available for the API, including supporting building blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Definition -</strong> Profile how money is made around an API, even if their are indirect benefits when possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once done, I have everything I need to establish a robust profile of an API provider, and add them to my monitoring. To assist me in my profiling, I then generate an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a> for the company, providing a machine readable version of all the information I&rsquo;ve gathered in my profiling. This doesn&rsquo;t always happen all at once, the companies usually queue up, then I go through and do full profiles in controlled sprints.</p>
<p>As with all of my research, y<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">ou can find the resulting APIs.son files on Github</a>, and as my monitoring continues, I will aggregate more companies doing interesting things with APIs, and as I have the time I will generate full profiles for each one.</p>
<p>If there is a specific company you&rsquo;d like profiled, please let me know.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><em>I am giving each of my primary API research sites a refresh, and first up is the home page of my&nbsp;<a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery research</a>. As I update each home page, I'm going to publish here on API Evangelist to help bring more awareness to each of the main areas I'm studying.</em></p>
<p>This is one of my API research sites, focused specifically on API discovery. My name is <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, and I am the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a>, working as hard as I can to understand the world of the Application Programming Interfaces, widely called an API. This network of API research projects all run on Github, and is my real-time workbench, which means there is a lot of finished work present, but occasionally you will also come across areas projects that are unfinished--you have stumbled in my API discovery research, you will find the main <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist site over here</a>, with other links to my work.</p>
<p>This site is where I publish news that I have read, stories I&rsquo;ve published, company I&rsquo;ve profiled, and valuable tools I&rsquo;m stumbled on across while researching API discovery. Finding APIs, and having your APIs found is a pretty significant pain point, and in the last ten years, little has been done to provide adequate solutions. API discovery is an area I've been monitoring, ultimately have been unsatisfied with what I've seen, I've take matters into my own hands, and created <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, a machine readable API discovery format, any API provider can use to describe their APIs.</p>
<p>There are several API management companies, including Apigee, Mashery, and Mashape who have put forth API discovery solutions, and while these offerings are valuable, I feel they lack the openness necessary to truly move the API space, and the API discovery conversation forward. APIs.json was created to help make sense of the API space, in partnership with 3Scale API management infrastructure, CEO Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>). Together we are working to define as much of the public APIs space as possible using APIs.json, and encourage the development of open tooling around the format, with the first major addition being an open source API search engine called, <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a></p>
<p>Next I am working with other providers like Socrata, WSO2, and others to develop additional tooling, to serve all levels of the API sector. I do not feel API discovery is something that simply happens via an <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">API directory like ProgrammableWeb</a>, or even via <a href="http://apis.io">API search engines like APIs.io</a>--in the future API discovery will also occur in the browser, via our IDEs, and seamlessly within modern clients. In 2015, you'll see many more APIs.json driven efforts to help alleviate API discovery pain, and we hope the format, and supporting open tooling will stimulate other complimentary, or even competing efforts. API discovery is long overdue for some investment by the community, helping us get past some of our PTSD of the SOA era--we can do it!</p>

I try to be as fair as I can when covering companies, individuals, and the tools they provide, but ultimately you will notice I have my favorites, and there are some areas I only touch on lightly, for a variety of personal reasons. I try to stay as neutral as I can when it comes to technological dogma, and company allegiance, but after almost five years, I have some pretty strong opinions, and can&rsquo;t help but try and steer, and influence things in my own unique way. ;-)</p>

<p>I was reviewing one of the many entries in my review queue of companies who are doing interesting things with APIs, and stumbled across the data visualization API&mdash;<a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">Lightning</a>. Their implementation grabs my attention on several fronts, but their focus on delivering their API within your own infrastructure via a Heroku button, is one of the most relevant aspects.</p>
<p>This approach reflects a seismic shift occurring in how we deploy APIs, and how we deploy architecture overall.  You need a <a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">data visualization API</a>, let me deploy my API into your cloud, or on-premise infrastructure using popular approaches to virtualization&mdash;developers do not need to go to the API, the API will now come to you, and live within your existing infrastructure stack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/a-wholesale-onpremise-version-of-my-api-for-sale/">wholesale APIs a lot lately,</a> showcasing the<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/a-peek-at-the-future-with-white-label-apis/"> white label approach by some API providers</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/blog/">exploring within the evolution of my own infrastructure</a>, and as more savvy API providers jump in on this opportunity, you&rsquo;ll see more stories emerge trying to understand the shift going on. <a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">Lightning</a> is accomplishing this with Heroku, and their embeddable button, but companies who embrace a containerized micro-service centered approach to API deployment, will have a wide open playing field for buying and selling of the wholesale API driven technology being deployed across the emerging API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-headset.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I work to isolate all of my calls on Thursdays, leaving other days of the week to more asynchronous forms of communication, and deep dives into coding, research, and storytelling efforts. Last Thursday was interesting, but this weeks conversations has spurred me to summarize some of the conversations that occurred on this busy day. This isn't something I'll do every thursday, and not all conversations will make it in, but I figured it would help me process, as well as share some insight into the types of conversations I'm having being the scene.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the conversations I&rsquo;ve had today, anonymized to protect the lives of those involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Evangelist at Major Media Company </strong>- I usually dodge recruiter calls early on in the process, but this one got through because it came in as a referral from someone I knew. This was regarding a lead role at a major media company you all know, a position I&rsquo;m not interested in, but willing to help talk through what is next for companies who can&rsquo;t find the right person for the role of lead API Evangelist! </li>
<li><strong>Available API Deployment Resources -</strong> I&rsquo;ve had a lot of trouble finding competent resources for any stage of the API lifecycle, but when it comes to API deployment, it has been impossible to establish relationships development shops I can refer work to. I had a very promising conversation about scaling an existing team I&rsquo;ve work with to successfully deploy APIs at scale in the past, opening up the opportunities for a scalable resource I can tap for designing, developing, deploying, and even the ongoing management of API resources. #fingerscrossed</li>
<li><strong>Developing a Wikipedia for API Definitions -</strong> I&rsquo;m working hard to develop a public catalog of open API designs via <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> and the <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> using the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a> format, and I had an interesting conversation with a group that is working on the "Wikipedia for APIs", using machine readable formats like Swagger, and APIs.son. We'll see where this goes, but I&rsquo;m excited about the number of conversations I&rsquo;m having in the area of API discovery, and design. </li>
<li><strong>Containerized Micro-Service Orchestration - </strong>I've been immersed in my own version of micro-service orchestration, using Docker, but today I got a look into other approaches, helping me better understand the bigger picture, and how I can apply existing practices, and tooling to better orchestrate this new world I&rsquo;m creating. </li>
<li><strong>An APIs and IPAs Podcast -</strong> Three of my favorite letters, rearranged into a single podcast conversation. <a href="http://readme.io">Readme.io</a> has asked me to participate in a beer fueled conversation about the API space. Talk about being privileged, I couldn't think of a better career where I get to talk about publicly, what I do for a living, while drinking the best quality beer possible. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done the APIs and IPAs podcast yet, that is up next&mdash;so I need to get ready. I'll have to consider more about how my Thursday conversations compare with the other, asynchronous conversations I&rsquo;m having through the week. At first glance, they seem very similar, but as I continue to get into the groove having my phone conversations only on Thursdays, and do these summaries&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;ll begin to see other patterns emerge.</p>
<p>Anyway you look at it, being in the center of the API economy is pretty exciting in 2015. I thought the buzz in 2010 was significant, but I had no idea of what it would be like in 2015. Lots going on, lots of important technological shifts, and lots of important industries, and companies turning their focus to the world of APIs. Sometimes it can make my head swim, but at the end of the day I&rsquo;m stoked to be where I am, as all of this moves forward--no matter how fast.</p>

<p>This site is where I publish news that I have read, stories I&rsquo;ve published, company I&rsquo;ve profiled, and valuable tools I&rsquo;m stumbled on across while researching API design space. I&rsquo;m in the middle of carving off a couple individual projects from this API design research including <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/">hypermedia</a>, and a soon API definition specific projects. As with my other research projects, there can be a great deal of overlap with other projects, when it comes to defining exactly what is API design. This research isn&rsquo;t about being complete, or finished, it is about maintaining a liquid understanding of what API design is, and be as comprehensive as a one man operation can be.</p>
<p>I execute on my API research by focusing in on specific areas like API design, getting to work understanding who the key actors are, which may include individual personalities, or corporate, government, or institutional entities. I profile each actor, and establish monitoring streams using Github, Twitter, RSS, Stack Exchange, and any other relevant channels. Throughout my monitoring I keep an eye out for interesting articles, white papers, announcements, and tooling that contribute to, and expands upon my definition of what is API design.</p>
<p>The more I research an area like API design, the more I&rsquo;m able to identify common building blocks, that make up the space. For API design, this can be as fundamental as API definitions, or as specific as publishing and sharing interactive documentation. My interpretation of these building blocks change over time, and sometimes I will link up these building blocks with other research projects, or spin off as independent projects, allowing me to dive even deeper&mdash;for example, Swagger began as a building block on API management, and is now its own research area entirely.</p>

<p>Making a list of valuable APIs has been a staple of my tech blogging for 10 years now, and as I work to find even more meaningful ways of defining the API space, I&rsquo;m pushing the envelope on how I do API roundup stories. Instead of just finding a handful of valuable APIs, and providing an HTML list of them, I'm going to use <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, to make sure all of my collections are machine readable by default.</p>
<p>For each API I profile, it is valuable to have a nice logo, name, short description, and a link to the developer portal. However I want to also make sure other valuable, machine readable resources are also present like Twitter, Github, and Blog RSS. This is just the start, I want each API to also have a machine readable API definition using Swagger and API Blueprint as well--all indexed using an APIs.json file.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using APIs.json in two ways, as an index for each API, as well as an index for the overall collection I&rsquo;m building--you will find the overall collection using the big {A} below, and each API has its own little {A}. To show you this in action, here is an <a href="http://sms.apievangelist.com/">SMS API collection</a> I've built:</p>

<p>This is all rendered using APIs.json, and provides all of the relevant links you will need to potentially get up and running with each API. You can use the APIs.json to further pull activity for each API using the Twitter and Github APIs, as well as via RSS. You can also programmatically evaluate, compare, and generate client-side code, documentation, testing, monitoring, and other essential elements using the machine readable Swagger definitions I&rsquo;ve included.</p>
<p>In the future, each time I post a roundup of APIs blog post, I will publish the list of APIs, using this APIs.json approach. There is a lot of work still to be done in, identifying, and indexing APIs in this format, as well as clarifying more detail about each API, like underlying data models, authentication, and pricing, but having a standard approach is a damn a good start.  This is the standard format I will be using for all my API Stack profiling--<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">you can find a complete list of APIs.json files, and Swagger definitions over on the Github repository for the work</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as I finish my API Blueprint tooling, I will also be providing each API in the API Blueprint format, as well as in Swagger, offering some variety, when it comes to understanding the surface area for each API. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/looking-beyond-the-number-of-apis-or-just-new-apis-and-working-harder-to-find-only-the-most-important-apis/">Instead of tracking on the number of APIs across the industry</a>, I&rsquo;m going to be tracking on the number of APIs that are fully defined, using APIs.json, providing full access to each API operations, as well as providing machine readable API definitions in Swagger and API Blueprint.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-building-blocks-design.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am adding four new building blocks, to my list of suggested <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that API providers should consider when crafting their API management strategy</a>. These four building blocks, are based upon several things I&rsquo;ve seen in the space, and how some current deficiencies I&rsquo;ve identified that could slow things, and hold us back.</p>
<p>These new building blocks are all about API providers practicing what they preach, and making the account for API consumers, and developers, programmatic through an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">API management API</span>. As I was profiling the <a href="http://dev.mailjet.com/email-api/v3/metadata/">Maijet API</a> as part of my <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">email API research</a>, I noticed <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">they had an API for their developer accounts</a>, and with the growth in the number of APIs being consumed, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">the need for account automation is only going to incease</a>, something that is only getting even more critical when you think about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/api-management-infrastructure-and-service-composition-is-key-to-orchestration-with-microservices-in-a-containerized-world/">API service composition overhead needed to support the containerization and micro-services movement.</a> To help stimulate this area, and encourage API providers to automate their API accounts, I&rsquo;m adding these four separate APIs building blocks, providing an overall blueprint for how API providers can launch a developer account API for their own API.</p>
<p>I used Mailjet&rsquo;s approach as a base model, but quickly began looking at <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">3Scale own API design</a>. 1) I use 3Scale, so I&rsquo;m familiar with their approach to user management 2) Their API was simple, robust, and clearly a proven approach that was working.  I broke 3Scale&rsquo;s own endpoints down into four logical groups for v1 of this API management API blueprint. There were a number of features they had, that I wanted in there, but figured it was better to start out simple, and meet most of the common needs I'm seeing from my own experiences.</p>
<p>Here is what I came up with, after taking a look at 3Scale&rsquo;s active docs.</p>
<p><strong>API Management API - User Management<br /></strong>Allow API API consumers to manage their own accounts via an API management API, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete information associated with their account--fields may vary, depending on what information each API requires for user accounts.</p>
<ul>
<li>User Create</li>
<li>User Read</li>
<li>User Update</li>
<li>User Delete</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Management API - Account Management</strong><br />Beyond the user profile, allow API consumers to manage the billing related account information, enable the programmatic adjustment of credit cards, and being able to check in on invoices, and payments through the API management API.</p>
<ul>
<li>Account Set Credit Card</li>
<li>Account Delete Credit Card</li>
<li>Invoice By Account</li>
<li>Invoice Line Item List</li>
<li>Invoice Payment Transaction List</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Management API - Service Management</strong><br />Enable API consumers to retrieve information about plans available for a specific API, or stack of APIs. Allow for listing of plans, and the features available for each plan. Also recommend considering the ability to set default plan for an account, enabling smooth application management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Service Plan List</li>
<li>Service Plan Feature List</li>
<li>Service Plan Set To Default</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Management API - Application Management</strong><br />Ideally each user can have multiple applications, consuming API resources at various rates. This allows for the most flexibility in API consumption, but may vary depending on what API management infrastructure employed. This API should allow for management of all applications, with secure control over application keys. Additionally, there should be analytics available, with a short, simple, but robust list of metrics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Application Plan List (per isolated service)</li>
<li>Application List</li>
<li>Application Create</li>
<li>Application Read</li>
<li>Application Update</li>
<li>Application Change Plan</li>
<li>Application Key List</li>
<li>Application Key Create</li>
<li>Application Key Delete</li>
<li>Application Usage by Metric</li>
</ul>
<p>This represents the v1 stack I&rsquo;d like to see every API provider offer, as well for my own portable stack of API management APIs. I don't just want my core APIs to have these features, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/making-my-3scale-api-management-portable-with-a-containerized-microservices/">I want every wholesale API I deploy in other companies infrastructure to be equipped with the same basic stack</a>. I can add in more features later, but I think this represents the minimum viable stack for automating API consumption at this point.</p>
<p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll build a docker image for deploying this API management infrastructure, alongside other APIs as a single virtual stack of loosely coupled micro-services, when bundled with the service composition 3Scale affords me, it will give me an unprecedented ability to orchestrate my API infrastructure.  Hopefully it can also provide a blueprint for others to use, and evolve beyond what I can do on my own.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/keranm"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/myob/keran-mckenzie-myob.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of finally meeting someone in person, that I feel like I&rsquo;ve known for years, while I was over in Australia, for <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days Sydney</a>&mdash;Keran McKenzie (<a href="https://twitter.com/keranm">@keranm</a>), API Evangelist for <a href="http://developer.myob.com/">MYOBapi</a>. I got to drink, and talk with Keran (finally), but more importantly I got to listen to him talk about his approach to evangelism at the accounting API.</p>
<p>I have given, and listened to more talks on evangelism and advocacy than I care to remember. I always work hard to make sure I sit and list to as many evangelism talks as I can&mdash;there is always something to learn. Keran's talk was informative, thorough, and most importantly it was genuine. Keran discussed many of the proven areas of evangelism we all share, but not in a robotic or corporate way, he shared his, and MYOB&rsquo;s philosophy, and told the honest story about the challenges and triumphs.</p>
<p>Keran gives an energetic talk, but it wasn&rsquo;t just the high energy that sold it for me, it was demonstrating that he actually gives a shit about how to do it right, admitting he doesn&rsquo;t know everything, or nails it in all categories, and he gives an honest, friendly, approachable, and genuine story of what is API evangelism at MYOB.</p>
<p>This approach to API evangelism is critical to success. You won&rsquo;t last long as an evangelist if you are full of shit, or the company behind you is, sorry&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been in this position too many times. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, every API evangelist role is difficult, and full of compromises, challenges, and things that are out of your control&mdash;even in my world. In the end, the only thing you can do is be honest, genuine, and as transparent as you can, and never be afraid to tell you story like Keran does.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/press-release.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time wading through press releases at the number of the dominate aggregate news outlets, looking for API news. I also have a number of scripts running, keeping an automated eye on the press sections for some of the companies I track on. The number of press releases available in corporate press areas vs. the number of press releases submitted by PR outlets, is much larger--which is a missed opportunity in my book.</p>
<p>Each day I look through PRWeb, PR Newswire, Business Wire and others trying to find the latest API stories. This is a process that will always be partially a manual process, as you just can&rsquo;t look for API news without getting petroleum, education, pharmaceutical, and other API news&mdash;which has nothing to with my beloved application programming interface. In short, these sites suck. Their UI is crap, and their search mechanisms are shit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest problem with these news outlets do not usually even have RSS, let alone an API, requiring me to go to each site, each day, and sift through the search results.  The world of press releases is like many other industries I engage with&mdash;needs a dead simple API driven solution. I want a press release API that allows any company to submit for free, but the problem is nobody will in the beginning, so it also needs to go out and find the direct corporate press sources as well, and scrape this long tail of the PR world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d pay a monthly fee to be able to search this vast PR database via an API, and be able to integrate directly into my API monitoring system. It is something I could build, but I just do not have time, and as I do with my other ideas, I am putting out there for someone else to do. The API would be a very simple design, but the legwork to make it truly a rich, and valuable source of press, would take a significant amount of time.</p>
<p>This is one of the ideas I hope someone does not do, thinking it is a VC level start-up idea. It really is something that a handful of folks could bootstrap, and do very well in monetizing premium services, but if you go get VC money you will probably fuck it all up, and have to chase some unnecessary approaches to making money. If someone doesn&rsquo;t do soon, I&rsquo;m going to have to build an API focused version, because I am spending about 1-2 hours a day on this each day.</p>

</ul>
<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>As I did last week, I'm walking away with a better awareness of what is happening across the space. It isn't enough for me to read all of this API news in isolation, it helps to see it side by side with other news, allowing me to see and understand patterns that I may have missed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm just getting started exploring the ways to use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;when it comes organize my new Docker fueled, micro services stack. I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/use-apisjson-to-organize-my-swagger-defined-apis-running-in-docker-containers/">using APIs.son to describe each micro service</a>, as well as define the overall collection of almost 20 micro services. I&rsquo;m using the include collection, as a <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery/">navigation for the loosely coupled stack of micro-services</a>, and my friend <span>Chris Spiliotopoulos (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/chefarchitect">@chefarchitect</a><span>)</span>, has done some more work with <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed">his Swagger.ed</a>, delivering some <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> goodness that is in alignment with where I want to take all of this.</p>
<p>Adding to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">discovery and visualization work he did for Swagger</a>, Chris enabled Swagger.ed to look for valid APIs.son files as well, so when you browse to any APIs.son, like the one I have for my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master">micro services stack</a>, you see the little APIs.son search icon in the address bar.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/apis.json"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-json-in-browser.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>When you click on the APIs.son search icon in the address bar, you get a very cool visualization. Its pretty basic at the moment, just a visual catalog of the APIs available in the include collection of my stack, but when you connect up with the Swagger visualization work he's already done, we could have a pretty cool API catalog for managing and exploring microservices.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-catalog.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>I have almost 20 micro-services listed, and Swagger.ed gives me the ability to navigate it in a very interactive way.  Whats next? We don&rsquo;t know&hellip;it is about exploration, and finding out the most meaningful way of exploring the APIs I deploy and aggregate into APIs.son collections.</p>
<p>I can see having a visual catalog of all of my API design that I collect, then deploy, and evolve them as needed for various parts of my infrastructure or for my clients, into other sub-collections? Disconnected collections? Loosely coupled collections? Not sure how tight I want things, part of <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/how-much-api-surface-area-before-it-stops-being-micro/">the micro service definition for me</a> is the size of the network connecting the services, as well as the services theselves.</p>
