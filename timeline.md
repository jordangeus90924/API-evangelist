title: The API Timeline

I am perpetually captivated by how APIs have come to be. I have heard since I started talking about APIs that they've been around longer than I state in my history narrative or within blog posts. Honestly, if you see application as all about applying a concept or resource of some kind, then APIs go way back to even African drumming circles. Every once in a while I geta wild hair and scratch at this narrative, and this page reflects what I consider to be the API timeline.
