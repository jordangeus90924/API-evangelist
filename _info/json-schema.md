The JSON Schema specification provides a machine- and human-readable way of describing digital objects used as part of API requests and responses, as well as the messages we publish and subscribe to our more asynchronous APIs. JSON Schema allows us to describe the structure of our digital resources and capabilities so that we can validate them during development and production.

JSON Schema is how the digital bits we pass around the web each day get validated behind the scenes, making sure the requests we make, and the response received meet the expectations of both API producers and consumers, and giving us the real-time validation, we need to reliably do business at scale.

Both OpenAPI and AsyncAPI use JSON Schema to model the payloads of both our synchronous and asynchronous APIs, providing a rich way to define the digital resources and capabilities of the enterprise. JSON Schema validates that business is happening as we expand at scale across our operations.
