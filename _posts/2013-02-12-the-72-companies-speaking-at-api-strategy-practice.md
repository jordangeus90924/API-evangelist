{% include JB/setup %}<p>The API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference is happening next week in NYC.I have had so much fun pulling together the schedule of keynotes, panels, sessions and the talks on the 429 - Too Many Requests stage.  The number of requests weve received for sponsoring, speaking and attending has been overhelming. Resulting in a sold out conference, and an amazing lineup of speakers. I was spending some time tidying up the speakers page and sponsor page today, and was so impressed with the companies involved, I had to share.</p>
