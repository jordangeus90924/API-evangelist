        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/02/17/measuring-the-success-of-a-public-web-api/">Measuring the Success of a Public Web API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Feb 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/api-craft"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/API-Craft-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>I'm a member of a Google group called <a title="API Craft" href="http://groups.google.com/group/api-craft">API Craft</a>.  There are some really smart API folks talking about everything from API deployment to API business strategies there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The other day someone in the groups asked:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>How does someone measure success in developing and deploying a public&ndash;facing Web API?</strong></em></blockquote>
<p>Scott Regan (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/scottregan">@scottregan</a>) of <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a> gave a great response, and I wanted to share with everyone here.  Scott&rsquo;s suggestions for measurements were:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - For public APIs, could be affiliate program revenue, ad revenue, or if incremental traffic from apps to the website has a known monetization rate</li>
<li><strong>Reach</strong> -  Incremental new user accounts or unique users</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships</strong> - Number of new partnerships established around your API</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong> - The number of new apps developed using your API</li>
<li><strong>Traffic</strong> - Apply percentage of incremental traffic ("our API channel is now X% of total internet traffic")</li>
<li><strong>Brand</strong> - Measuring increased 'brand', but only if the company has an really established way to do this</li>
</ul>
<p>Scott goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><em>When it comes to business metric tracking one thing i've seen work well is when the  API team publishes a 'dashboard'  widely and regularly -   tracking actual results to estimates  -   because it helps PM focus the roadmap on what moves the business needle as agreed and avoid getting the team pulled in different directions.</em></blockquote>
<p>Each API could potentially have different success factors depending on the type of API or the goals of a company.  But revenue, reach, partnerships, apps, traffic and increased brand awareness are good places to start. &nbsp;Thanks Scott.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Feb 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I first wrote about <a title="interactive API documentation with Posterous's new API area" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/deploying-smarter-api-documentation/">interactive API documentation with Posterous&rsquo;s new API area</a> in June 2011, then the follow-up when&nbsp;<a title="Mashery deploying their own version called I/O docs" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/26/mashery-delivers-smarter-api-documentation/">Mashery deployed their own version called I/O Docs</a> in July 2011.</p>
<p>Smart, interactive or I/O API documentation is an evolution of API documentation from static and often boring documentation, to more interactive and real-time experience, allowing you to make live calls against an API while also browsing the documentation that explains how it operates.</p>
<p>Peter Gruenbaum of <a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">SDK Bridge</a> has surveyed and done exhaustive research on <a title="what developers say about API documentation" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/20/what-developers-say-about-api-documentation/">what developers say about API documentation</a> and <a title="web api documentation best practices" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">web API documentation best practices</a>, proving that up to date, and complete documentation can be very successful in helping developers get up and running using an API.</p>
<p>The <a title="API Service Provider" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API Service Provider</a>, <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a> has stepped up with their own interactive API documentation for users of their platform using <a title="Swagger" href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>, an open-source framework that lets developers learn, play, test and debug each element of an API in real-time.</p>
<p>There are 3 main benefits for API owners coming from adopting <a title="Swagger" href="/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">Swagger</a>:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Automated, consistent generation of clean, beautiful, interactive API documentation</li>
<li>Generation of client code and SDK in Scala, Java, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, and Actionscript 3</li>
<li>Feeding into an industry wide API discovery language that both developers and non-developers can use</li>
</ul>
<p>While many companies are providing <a title="API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/api_explorer.php">API explorers</a> for their developers to make live calls against their APIs, I think interactive documentation holds more value in educating developers about APIs, while also allowing them to make real-time calls.  My feeling is that this makes some tough concepts stickier while trying to understand and integrate with an API.</p>
<p>Visit the <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a> site for more information on using their <a title="API management platform for deploying interactive documentation" href="http://www.3scale.net/2012/01/24/interactive-api-documentation-the-new-api-console-for-developers/">API management platform for deploying interactive documentation</a>, using Swagger, for your APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> &nbsp;I have consulted with 3Scale on industry strategy several times.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2012</span>
        <p><a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/CityGrid.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Much of the work I get as an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> starts with a review of an API area.  I have evolved a way to look at API areas, and identify which building blocks are present or missing, all contributing to the success or failure of an API.</p>
<p>I started evolved this methodology in summer of 2012 when I was first building API Evangelist, by reviewing over 250+ of the top APIs out there.  I generated a list of the common building blocks used by APIs, as well as identified a bunch of innovative and less commonly used <a title="Building Blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">building blocks</a>.</p>
<p>When I first started working with <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a> I reviewed their API area, which contained the following building blocks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Dashboard" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">API Dashboard</a></li>
<li>Documentation for <a title="content api documentation" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Content+by+CityGrid">Content</a> and <a title="advertising API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">Advertising</a> APIs</li>

<p>I have a list of what I consider <a title="essential api building blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">essential API area building blocks</a>, and most of them are represented here, but there were a couple missing.  So today I added 3 more areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Getting Started" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Getting+Started">Getting Started</a></li>
<li><a title="publisher overview" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Publisher+Overview">Publisher Overview</a></li>
<li><a title="FAQ" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/FAQ">FAQ</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An API has to have a getting started page as well as a place for frequently asked questions.  Developers have to find the information they need to go from evaluation to integration without asking for help.</p>
<p>The publisher overview page is unique.  It covers the different business tiers of developers, or as we call them at CityGrid, publishers.  Even though these tiers are unique to how we approach things at CityGrid, they are <a title="four potential levels of an api ecosystem" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">four potential levels of an API ecosystem</a>, that other API owners can employ.</p>
<p>The CityGrid API area is not up to par 100% by the standards I preach here on API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m working on a new code samples page which has PHP, Python, Ruby code samples and starter kits--which I will publish this week at some point.  But overall the <a title="CityGrid API community" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid API community</a> contains the essential building blocks I feel are necessary to build an ecosystem, and I&rsquo;m working on finding out what else my developers will need to be successful and put them in my roadmap.</p>

<p>I am an eternal optimist, especially when it comes to APIs.  I really feel that <a title="APIs can decouple business assets and resources" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/12/25/apis-can-decouple-business-information-and-resources/">APIs can decouple businesses assets and resources</a>, making these companies much more efficient.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen the power of the API when it comes to companies like Twitter, Twilio, Facebook and many others.  But to build something on top of an API, you have to be a do-er.</p>
<p>A do-er is a term invented by Jeff Lawson (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jeffiel">@jeffiel</a>) of Twilio:</p>
<blockquote><em><a title="Do-er" href="http://www.twilio.com/doers">Do-er </a>(n): A particularly driven individual, esp. a developer, who picks up their tools and builds something special.</em></blockquote>
<p>Do-ers are a fundamental ingredient in API ecosystems, and when I go to many conferences and walk by booths I see a fundamentally different process of holding peoples hands and showing them what they need to know.  I also see many companies relying on this process to even make money.</p>
<p>So I have to ask--are we creating enough do-ers? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very optimistic about the future of API growth, but I do worry sometimes about there being enough doers to make APIs continue to grow.  Many individuals are so used to the regular sales cycle and corporate training, they don&rsquo;t seem equipped to find solutions to their problems on their own.</p>
<p>Are you a do-er? &nbsp;Do you think there are enough do-ers out there?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/02/07/lets-remake-libraries-as-hacker-spaces-and-community-innovation-centers/">Let's Remake Libraries as Hacker Spaces and Community Innovation Centers</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2012</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Library-NYC.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     I was reading several stories yesterday about the <a href="http://kalw.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/post/goodbye-state-funding-california-libraries">State of California cutting funding for libraries across the state</a>. These kind of budget cuts really make me worry for the future of our children and our communities.
</p>
<p>
     I say it is time that we all come together and figure out a way to re-invent our libraries, and one possible way forward is to remake our local libraries as hacker space.
</p>
<p>
     Here are a few ideas I had today about this:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Dedicated Hacker Spaces</strong> - Each community could have a space to have hackathons that could be used for locally driven events as well as a place for out of town organizers to throw events.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Hackathon Model</strong> - Libraries could adopt a hackathon model for throwing small or large events in any area, allowing kids and adults to organize and participate in hackathons in any topic area.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Sponsorship</strong> - Bring in sponsors much like we do for hackathons, allowing tech and other companies to invest in single or ongoing hackathon efforts at libraries in the markets and subject areas that matter to them most.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Revenue Opportunities</strong> - These sponsorship opportunities would allow libraries to create new ways to fund their operations based upon the corporate sponsors that reflect the type of space libraries want to create.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Mentorship</strong> - Allow anyone to become a hacker mentor in any subject, allowing them to share expertise and knowledge with others in their community.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Resources</strong> - Libraries could provide access to computers, Internet connectivity, data repositories, code repositories, APIs, software and other resources that are essential to hackers.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Community Innovation</strong> - These new library hacker spaces could be centers for community innovation to occur, bringing in outside ideas, and circulating new ideas within existing community leaders.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Incubation</strong> - Library hacker spaces could be centers of business incubation, providing a rich and fertile environment for ideas to take root and find the resources and talent they need to actually become businesses, creating desperately needed jobs in communities.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I’m not sure entirely of the reasons why libraries are not a funding priority in this country, at a time when we are more than happy to fund wars, prisons and other areas that do not enrich our communities.  The whole thing just boggles my mind, and leaves me very concerned.
</p>
<p>
     Times are changing, and I’m sure this has something to do with it--regardless ibraries need to find new ways to stay relevant in this digitial age within their communities, and the tech community needs to step in and help.
</p>
<p>
     I think the hackathon model could provide a very positive way to remake our libraries into innovation centers within our communities, turning anyone into a potential hacker and mentor in the subject area they are most skilled and passionate about.
</p>
<p>
     I’d love to hear other ideas, about how we can do this, and I’ll work them into my future stories as well as my hackathon schedule as I travel around the country.

<p>I brought my 11 year old daughter Kaia, to the <a title="Trojan Hack" href="http://trojanhack.co/">Trojan Hack</a> at USC Friday night and Saturday, which was a new experience for her. I wouldn&rsquo;t say she is on a track to be a hacker like her dad, but she does have a Chromebook, iPhone and is pretty technologically literate.</p>
<p>She has asked me a couple times about teaching her how to build a game, or some sort of fashion web site.  She has her own Wordpress blog and even went and setup her own Wordpress.com account to blog about Harry Potter without my help.</p>
<p>I asked her if she found any of the projects that were being built at the hackathon interesting--she said no, except the Wolves with Friends video game.  Then she said, &ldquo;maybe if there were more girl hackers, the projects would be more interesting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Kaia is at a very important age, where I think she can be influenced or turned off in many different ways, and within a variety of subjects.  I don&rsquo;t want to push my hacker ways on her, but I want to influence her as much as I possibly can--and leave the decisions up to her.</p>
<p>When I go to hackathons with Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) and my daughter I can&rsquo;t help but see it through their eyes--where not only the programming challenges are intimidating, but a room full of boys are a big turn off.  Something that isn&rsquo;t apparent to me, when I go by myself as hacker white guy.</p>
<p>One of things I&rsquo;ve noticed at various places I&rsquo;ve worked is that the tone of the workplace, the focus of projects, and the overall energy is different when there are more girls on teams.  This is something that is very apparent working at <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a>, not just the diversity of the workplace, but that there are many female managers and team leads, which sets a very positive tone for the company.</p>
<p>We <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HAVE</strong></span> to begin to have more discussion about how do we evolve the face of hackathons to include a more diverse range of problem owners, including making sure women and girls feel much more comfortable, and are a much larger presence at hackathons.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2012</span>

     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/nationl-park-ranger.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     I've been having a lot of discussions with folks around the country about how to make money from data. There is a lot of data being pushed out there from federal, state and city governments, as well as from private companies and individuals--without much evidence of revenue.
</p>
<p>
     At this point there seems to be money in acquiring, processing, storing an deriving meaning out of the data, but not much money in actually selling access directly to the data. Through portals like <a href="http://opendata.socrata.com/">opendata.socrata.com</a> we are seeing more government agencies and cities publish their data, and after talking with the guys from Socrata last week, their focus is on helping more agencies get their data up, not metering or building business models around the data. 
</p>
<p>
     Socrata has some great tools, that let developers customize how they want to access the data, and use in their applications, but there really are no mechanisms that allow data owners to make money from their data. Granted this is public data, so it should be publicly available for anyone to access and use. However there are costs associated with acquiring, processing and making this data available for download and via APIs.
</p>
<p>
     I've had discussions with several data evangelist about how government could maximize their efforts around data in the virtual space and even charge for it under certain circumstances, allowing them to generate revenue to cover operational costs as well as fund more data projects.
</p>
<p>
     If you think about it the government does this with public domain in the physical space. Cities and National Parks are free and open spaces for anyone to use, but once you begin looking to use these spaces for commercial use, you are required to apply for permits, and often pay fees and revenue share for access to these spaces and facilities. Why shouldn't this same thinking be applied to the virtual public domain?
</p>
<p>
     Don't get me wrong. I'm not a huge fan of having to pay for accessing public data at first thought, but if the data is still open for me to access, play with and use in a non-commercial setting, and I only start paying once I use for commercial purposes, it starts to make sense. It seems like the government could come up with a data licensing model that allows this type of free, limited usage, then paid commercial usage with some sort of attribution and contribute back when data is cleaned and enhanced.
</p>
<p>
     Obviously this model would require a lot more discussion, but if we could not just fund the operations of government data marketplaces, but also finance the acquisition and generation of new, high quality data--not only would our government be in a better position, I think businesses and the public would reap the benefits as well.

        <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <a title="Developer Connect" href="http://developer.mashery.com/devconnect"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashery/Mashery-Developer-Connect.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     One of the biggest areas around APIs I think needs attention in 2012 is more tools that focus on developers. There are plenty API services and tools focusing on API owners, but we need to start making sure developers are taken care of.
</p>
<p>
     So its nice to see the Mashery’s new <a title="Developer Connect" href="http://developer.mashery.com/devconnect">Developer Connect</a>, which matches developers with companies looking for specific API development skills. Mashery partnered with <a title="Elance" href="https://www.elance.com/php/landing/main/login.php?crypted=cGVyc2lzaWQ9Mzg5ODQ5OTMx">Elance</a> to develop the API skill matchmaking service, powered by Elance’s huge network of professional technical talent.
</p>
<p>
     There are plenty of developers out there who have polished their skills working with specific APIs, either on production, or hobby development projects, and would love to find freelance work, and make some money of their talent.
</p>
<p>
     On the flip-side, there are plenty of companies looking to build web and mobile applications that use one or many APIs, and would prefer to contract with developers who already have experience with those APIs.
</p>
<p>
     Its a win-win situation for developers, API owners and companies looking to build on top of APIs. I think it is also a sign that the API space is really maturing. With platforms like Mashery’s Developer Connect, powered by Elance, developers may now be able to make a good living specializing in API development.
</p>
<p>
     Its a great idea, I wish I had come up with it! Oh wait. I did!! In fall of 2010, and pitched it to Elance, after pitching the idea, I even built a <a title="Elance Developer Area Prootype" href="http://elance.apievangelist.com/index.php">Elance Developer Area prototype</a>, and did a <a title="four part series on the potential" href="/2011/02/28/plug-and-play-api-developer-area-with-elance/">four part series on the potential</a>.
</p>
<p>
     I actually don’t have a problem with this, I thoroughly enjoy my ideas getting used, rather than sitting on the back burner. What did piss me off, is when I was offered the exclusive by Elance after they actually built their version...they sent me a <a title="TechCrunch Post" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/09/mobile-component-marketplace-verious-exits-beta-partners-with-elance/">Techcrunch post</a>, saying here is your exclusive.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">Four Potential Levels of an API Business Ecosystem</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/CityGrid.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I'm working on a framework for the <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">City Grid API</a> that helps define the different types of developers that are using our APIs, helping me understand how to better support them, and ensure their success.
</p>
<p>
     This particular approach is different than segmenting my developers by type of development, like web and mobile or by industry like real estate or medical. I'm focusing on the business side of the API, and identifying what developers need to be successful in the business of the applications they are building on the CityGrid API, and where I should focus CityGrid resources.
</p>
<p>
     I'm breaking down our API developers into four distinct levels:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Open</strong> - Publicly available, self-service use of the API, with general forum and email support via developer area.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Associate</strong> - Motivated app developers who demonstrate their understanding of an API, submit their app for internal approval and take advantage of revenue sharing opportunities around the API.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Partner</strong> - Developers who already have successful businesses or have built businesses around the CityGrid APIs, and may have higher usage needs, and usually contribute some value back to the CityGrid business model and API ecosystem.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Incubation</strong> - Developers who have grown their businesses in significant ways, but need mentoring and investment of additional resources to take their business to the next level.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Anyone can register to use the API and become an open developer, integrating businesses, <a title="places" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">places</a> and other related content like <a title="reviews" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">reviews</a>, <a title="offers" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Offers+API">offers</a>, images and videos in their web or mobile apps. The API is self-service, allowing anyone to participate.  I can speculate what these developers need, but its up to them to let me know how they are building on the API and what they need to go to the next level.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Photo Credit - Sustainable Labs" href="http://sustainablelab.co.za/idea-incubation"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/incubation.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     To rise up to the next level of associate, you need to demonstrate you've integrated CityGrid APis into your app, using best practices, while adhering to the CityGrid <a title="Terms and Conditions" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Terms+and+Conditions">Terms and Conditions</a> and <a title="Usage Requirements" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Usage+Requirements">Usage Requirements</a>. Once approved as an associate you can start making money with your application or site using <a title="web advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Web+Ads+API">web</a>, <a title="local mobile advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Mobile+Ads+API">mobile</a> or <a title="custom advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Custom+Ads+API">custom advertising</a>, as well as taking advantage of <a title="places that pay" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+that+Pay">Place that Pay</a>.
</p>
<p>
     To become a partner your business usually provides some sort of value to CityGrid, and have potentially higher usage needs when it comes to CityGrid APIs. Not every developer has the opportunity to become a partner, but with the right business model, its an option that can be negotiated.
</p>
<p>
     We are all watching as technology incubators like <a title="Y Combinator" href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> and <a title="TechStars" href="http://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a> mentor and invest in tech startups from Silicon Valley to New York City. CityGrid is integrating this model into its API ecosystem. Companies like <a title="UrbanSpoon" href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/">UrbanSpoon</a> and <a title="BuzzLabs" href="http://buzzlabs.com/">BuzzLabs</a> have started out as open developers, rising up the ladder, with hard work and incremental success, until they are in need of a higher level of attention from CityGrid, as well as providing a lot of value to the CitiyGrid network.
</p>
<p>
     Not all companies have the capacity to approach their APIs in the way I'm laying out, but for those looking to build a vibrant ecosystem around their API, where developers can not just play with your API, but truly build businesses and the next generation of startups, you may want to consider how you can define a similar set of levels, that help you identify and meet the business needs of your developers.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/books/apis-a-strategy-guide.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I had the pleasure of getting an early copy of the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do">APIs: A Strategy Guide</a>, Creating Channels with Application Programming Interfaces, by Daniel Jacobson(<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), Greg Brail(<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gbrail">@gbrail</a>), Dan Woods(<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/danwoodscito">@danwoodscito</a>), published by O’Reilly Books.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do">APIs: A Strategy Guide</a>, provides the essential knowledge needed for planning, implementing and managing an API in this emerging API driven world. Written by Daniel Jacobsen who has managed two of the fastest growing and progressive APIs I know of--Netflix and NPR, and Greg Brail who is probably the one individual who has deployed the most number of APIs in the industry, and not leaving out Dan Woods who's is responsible for bringing this book together.
</p>
<p>
     The APIs: A Strategy Guide is sound advice for any executive, business, marketing or engineering person looking to deploy an API. But it doesn't stop there, as an experienced API product manager and evangelist it provides a framework to better look at much of what I already do, while also introducing some new concepts I hadn't considered.
</p>
<p>
     From a business perspective the book describes the API opportunity perfectly while providing the necessary business, product and value chain understanding to take on an API initiative within any company. As an author who's written a book on the <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">Business of APis</a>, Jacobsen, Brail and Woods take it even deeper and perfectly describe the business imperative for using APIs in your company.
</p>
<p>
     From a technical guide, you can't ask for a better approach than Jacobsen and Brail provide. API design is more art than science and they describe a balanced, but deeply technical approach for designing your API, wearing a very pragmatic hat, which is crucial in deploying a successful API.
</p>
<p>
     Beyond technical, the book provides the necessary legal considerations that come up when deploying an API, that could make or break your efforts. There is also concrete operational advice regarding how to approach the day to day operations of your API and ensure that you are able to measure and define the success of your API.
</p>
<p>
     The authors didn't neglect the most important aspect of any API, its developers. The book provides a key overview of what it will take to attract, engage and build a community of developers around your API. Without developers, your API will go nowhere.
</p>
<p>
     I've personally been working with RESTful APIs since their early days and have been studying the business of APis full time for the last year and half exclusively. Reading the APIs: A Strategy Guide, I added two extremely important concepts to my API model:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>APIs Expose Business Assets</strong> - APis are channels for exposing your most important business assets--products, services and information.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>API is a Contrac</strong>t - Developers are enticed to use the API because they know they can rely on it. The contract increases confidence, which increases use. The contract also makes the connection between pro-vider and consumer much more efficient since the interfaces are documented, consistent, and predictable.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The authors leave us with the knowledge you will need build a case for an API within your company, plan, implement and manage internal, partner and public APIs. The book ends right where you will be once you successfully launch your API; the beginning. The beginning of a whole new world of innovation, R&amp;D, equipped with a biz dev 2.0 platform that will enable your company to stay competitive in the emerging API economy.

<p><em>This post comes from the&nbsp;<a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a>&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.</em></p>
<p>I recently received an email with the subject "FW: boring job". It was a long email chain that started with someone casting about for someone to write API documentation. It got me thinking about how most developers must wonder&nbsp;<em>why on earth</em>&nbsp;someone with the skills to program would choose to write API documentation instead.</p>
<p>"Why" is a good question to ask yourself when starting up a new year. In fact, I recently saw a&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/r/" target="_blank">TED talk video by Simon Sinek</a>&nbsp;on how the most effective people, companies, and organizations, start by thinking about&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;they do something instead of&nbsp;<em>what</em>. In the video, Sinek brings up examples like Apple, the Wright Brothers, and even Martin Luther King, whose most famous speech began with "I have a dream" (why) and not "I have a plan" (what).</p>
<p>In this newsletter, I'll talk about why we write API documentation, from how it impacts the world to how it challenges us personally. But first, here's what SDK Bridge been up to since our last newsletter:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Writing C++ documentation for software embedded into agricultural vehicles.</li>
<li>Writing REST documentation for a company that creates software for governments.</li>
<li>Writing REST documentation based on&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/y/" target="_blank">OpenSocial</a>&nbsp;to be able to create and manage online meetings.</li>
<li>Writing IT documentation for&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/j/" target="_blank">Microsoft HealthVault</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why We Write API Documentation</h2>
<p>To most developers, writing <a title="API Documentation" href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php">API documentation</a> is nothing short of torture. But to a few of us, it's a fascinating area. What gets us so excited?</p>
<h3>Enormous Impact</h3>
<p>In case you haven't heard, the biggest technology revolution is happening since the invention of HTML. We've all heard about the explosion of smart phone, tablet, and software-as-a-service technology, but not everyone knows that APIs are what's driving all of these technologies, providing people with instant access to data. It used to be that only the people who had the data could write the software that granted access, but with APIs, the number of software developers who can create applications with that data is vastly increased. Companies are discovering that developers are doing things with their data that they had never dreamed of. It's an exciting time to be working in software.</p>
<p>Ask anyone in the API industry what the biggest obstacles are to creating apps, and I guarantee that they will bring up API documentation. Good documentation results in application innovation; bad documentation stifles it. API writers have the power to get an API adopted and used.</p>
<h3>An Interesting Human-Computer Interaction Challenge</h3>
<p><a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/t/" target="_blank">Donald Norman</a>, the Human-Computer Interaction guru, once wrote an&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/i/" target="_blank">interesting essay</a>&nbsp;of how the qualities of human beings are different than the qualities of computers. The way that we think is different than the way that machines "think", and a good user interface bridges the gap, making the computer intuitive to the person.</p>
<p>When your product is a software platform, then your API and its accompanying documentation is its user interface. If you want the API to be usable, then you have to figure how to bridge that difficult gap between the linear, inflexible world of computer programming and the non-linear, flexible way that people think and learn. It's a fascinating challenge.</p>
<h3>Extreme Variety</h3>
<p>Writing documentation for an API is a much faster process than writing the API itself. This means that an API writer often gets to learn about something, explain it, and then move on to the next thing. In just the last two years, I've gotten to learn about eCommerce, health care, traffic prediction, agricultural vehicles, online meetings, call centers, mobile phone applications, electric utilities, and noSQL databases. I even once wrote documentation to help the search for extraterrestial intelligence.</p>
<p>In the near future, everyone who has data will have an API to access that data, and all of those APIs need documentation. Writing that documentation is a way to get a taste of all of the different worlds that software is touching.</p>
<h3>On the Cutting Edge</h3>
<p>One of the big challenges of being a developer is staying on top of the latest technologies while there is so much legacy code to maintain that's built on old technology. Often developers get stuck working in old technology, wistfully wishing they could be on the cutting-edge.</p>
<p>Companies like to promote their platforms that use the hottest languages and protocols. That means that they will prioritize documentation for those platforms. Not only that, but I find that writers are given even more permission than developers when it comes to learning technology on the job. Between these two, API writers often get to work with the latest and greatest technologies</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Enormous impact, thinking about how people learn, extreme variety, and getting to work with cutting edge technology - it's pretty cool being an <a title="API Writer" href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php">API writer</a> these days. Of course, you have to love to write and you have to love to program. But if you are good at those two things, there's never been a better time to be an API writer.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/rapportive/rapportive-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     When new developers register for the <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API</a>, I get an email with their name and email address. I want to make sure each developer knows I’m here, and available to help them get up and running as quick as possible.
</p>
<p>
     Emailing them as soon as they register seems a little too pushy, but following them on Twitter, with <a title="my personal Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/kinlane">my personal Twitter</a> and the <a title="CityGrid API Twitter Account" href="https://twitter.com/#!/CityGridAPITeam">CityGrid API Twitter account</a> makes sense. So how do I get their Twitter handle, without spending too much time and derailing whatever I’m working on?
</p>
<p>
     In comes <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>. For those of you who don’t know what Rapportive is, it is an browser add-on that runs in my Gmail and shows me everything about a contact I’m emailing with. On the right hand side it lists as much information associated with the email as the service can find, such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.
</p>
<p>
     So when I get a new registration email from CityGrid APIs, I highlight the email address and it shows me information about the user. Many users don’t maintain active online profiles, so it returns nothing. However a handful, have Twitter accounts associated, which I immediately follow with my personal and CityGrid API Twitter accounts.
</p>
<p>
     Both of my Twitter profiles clearly reflect <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a>, so when I follow them on Twitter, my developers know who I am, and they should now be aware that I am here to help. If they have any questions, they know they know how to find me.

        <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/CityGrid.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I started with <a title="CityGrid API Evangelist" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/citygrid-api-evangelist/">CityGrid as their API Evangelist</a>, I wanted to make sure and share as much of my strategy with my audience here, in real-time.  Of course I&rsquo;ve been so busy executing I have forgotten to tell the story about what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>So let me take a few moments to kick off telling the story of what I&rsquo;m doing to build awareness of the CityGrid <a title="places" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">Places</a>, <a title="reviews" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">Reviews</a>, <a title="offers" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Offers+API">Offers</a> and <a title="advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">Advertising</a>&nbsp;APIs.</p>
<p>Let me paint a picture from the 100K foot view, then in other posts I&rsquo;ll go into more detail.  Here are the areas I&rsquo;m focusing on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API</strong> - The CityGrid API already provides clear value and has a developer base, but there are always ways to improve.  I will be providing feedback regularly, to the CityGrid API team on where we can improve on our APis.</li>
<li><strong>API Area</strong> - Spending time in December hacking on the CityGrid APIs, I experienced first hand what it takes to get started hacking using the content and advertising APIs.  While it is still fresh in my mind, I&rsquo;m working on building a new getting started, publisher overview, FAQ and code samples and SDK page to help my publishers get up and running with their own development.</li>
<li><strong>Hyp3rL0cal</strong> - To wrap my head around the CityGrid APIs I needed a project, so I started <a title="Hyp3rL0cal" href="http://hyp3rl0cal.com">Hyp3L0cal</a>, a playground for building local applications using CityGrid and other local and social APIs. I will be publishing all my code there, for others to use in their projects. </li>
<li><strong>Presence</strong> - A healthy presence is important to the success of the CityGrid APIs.  I am focusing on equal doses of an online and offline presence for CityGrid.  The online presence consists of actively blogging, tweeting and coding on projects, while my offline presence includes a non-stop tour schedule of hackathons and conferences.</li>
<li><strong>Publishers</strong> - CityGrid calls its developers, &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;. I am focusing on helping attract new publishers, and educating them about what CityGrid APIs can do for them, while also listening to existing publishers about what they need to be more successful with their web and mobile applications.</li>
<li><strong>Landscape</strong> - CityGrid is working hard to dominate and lead the local content and advertising space, I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time working to understand this arena.  I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time understanding the landscape and the other players like Foursquare, Factual, Yellow Pages and Google to not just understand their approach, but also help CityGrid publishers understand which tools are the best for them.</li>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - Not everything I&rsquo;m doing is outwardly focused.  I&rsquo;m working hard to share what I learn from working with publishers and studying the local, social and mobile landscape and bring what I learn back to CityGrid.  Internal evangelism is very important to the success of CityGrid APIs, without a larger awareness our internal teams can&rsquo;t build the next generation of local content and advertising platform.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Updates</strong> - I&rsquo;ve worked to report on four main areas of what I&rsquo;m doing, to help track on what my efforts and the results I&rsquo;m delivering.  I provide a general overview of my week, as well as a schedule of events that I&rsquo;m attending, overview of the industry landscape and list of stories I&rsquo;m working on for blogging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are a lot of details in these eight areas, but this provides an nice overview of the things I&rsquo;m focusing on while evangelizing for <a title="CityGrid" href="http://citygrid.com/">CityGrid</a>.</p>
<p>Even though I feel like I have a solid strategy around what I what need to accomplish for CityGrid, there is so much to learn on a week to week basis.  That is why my weekly evaluation and updates are so important.  I need to stop an evaluate what I&rsquo;m doing every week and learn from it in as real-time as possible--so I can adjust quickly to prevent mistakes and maximize opportunities.</p>
<p>This is the best part of what I do, I&rsquo;m constant learning at the forefront of technology that is changing the face of multiple industries.    Not only do I get paid to do this, I get to share it here on API Evangelist so that others can learn from my success, and my mistakes.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2012</span>
        <p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-513" title="HTML5_Logo_512" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/HTML5/HTML5_Logo_512.png" alt="" width="225" height="225" align="right" />I just wrapped up two separate Facebook Hackathons, one in&nbsp;<a title="New York" href="http://www.hackweekends.com/events/facebook_mobile_hack__new_york.php">New York</a>&nbsp;and the other in&nbsp;<a title="Boston" href="http://www.hackweekends.com/events/facebook_mobile_hack__boston.php">Boston</a>. &nbsp;Both events started with presentations from various Facebook team members, demonstrating different aspects of the Facebook platform.</p>
<p>After the Facebook workshops, there was a presentation by Jim Zimmerman&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Thuzi" href="http://www.thuzi.com/">Thuzi</a>, a preferred Facebook mobile development shop from Florida. &nbsp;During both his talks, he asked audience &nbsp;to raise their hand and show which platform they developed their mobile apps on.</p>
<p>The breakdown in New York, from my view was about:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>25% iOS</li>
<li>25% Android</li>
<li>50% HTML5</li>
</ul>
<p>While the breakdown in Boston, from my view was about:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>&nbsp;10% iOS</li>
<li>10% Android</li>
<li>80% HTML5</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cities HTML5 was the clear choice of developers. &nbsp;Even though Facebook still heavily focused on native app development during their workshops you can tell they were leaning heavily towards HTML5, by inviting PhoneGap to present, and giving away HTML5 t-shirts.</p>
<p>I don't think HTML5 has won the mobile battle by any stretch, but after seeing Adobes heavy focus on HTML5 at the&nbsp;<a title="Designing &amp; Developing for Mobile Workshop in San Francisco" href="http://www.hackweekends.com/events/designing__developing_for_mobile_workshop.php">Designing &amp; Developing for Mobile Workshop in San Francisco</a>, and now the dominance of it by developers at both Facebook Mobile Hacks, I think the tide is turning.</p>

<p>One of the areas of API development I'm focusing a lot of energy on in 2012 is around monetization.  I want to help define the playing field, of how API owners make money from their APIs, as well as how developers make money from their apps.</p>
<p>Both areas are extremely critical for the success of any API ecosystem.  If the API owner does not have a clear path to generate revenue, the API won't be sustainable, and eventually will go away.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, developers have to be able to make money from their apps in order to sustain their work, and build a viable business around an API.</p>
<p>As part of my work on understanding the developer side of things, I'm doing several posts asking developers how they make or plan to make money from their apps. Two obvious ways immediately come to mind:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>App Sales </strong>- Download and service based fees around apps.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising</strong> - Web and mobile ads in apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advertising has long held the title when it comes to monetizing apps, and iTunes and iOS sparked the mobile app gold rush.  But what other ways are there?</p>
<p>How can developers make money from their apps in ways that make them successful and sustainable? At CityGrid we have "<strong><a title="Places that Pay" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+that+Pay">Places that Pay</a></strong>", where users get paid for showing certain business profiles, and we are working on other versions of "Content that Pays", in the future.  But there has to be other innovative ways to make money from web and mobile app development.</p>
<p><strong>Let me know how you are making money from your apps!</strong></p>

     <em>This is a guest post by <a title="Travis Spencer" href="http://travisspencer.com/">Travis Spencer</a>, a Software engineer specializing in federation, SSO, cloud computing, Web services, &amp; enterprise architecture.</em>
</p>
<p>
     This week, <a href="http://www.attinnovationspace.com/innovation/story/a7779618">AT&amp;T announced</a> the release of a <a href="http://developer.att.com/">new API platform</a> that is made up of various components designed to simplify mobile Web application development and utilize resources only available through them. Specifically, the new offering is made up of the following:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <span>A number of RESTful cloud services such as device location, MMS, digital signing, and direct carrier billing</span>
     </li>
     <li>An application marketplace and distribution channel
     </li>
     <li>A hosting environment for the HTML5 and server-side components used by applications running on the platform
     </li>
     <li>SDKs for common development environments such as C#, PHP, Ruby, and Java that can be used to call the API
     </li>
     <li>An HTML5 client-side SDK built atop Sencha Touch that abstract away the various mobile UI differences of Android, iOS, Blackberry and others while simultaneously simplifying the integration w/ their new cloud services
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/att/att-1.png" alt="" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     <span>These are complimented by extensive samples, documentation, forums, on-line support, and a non-production environment where you can create an unlimited number of test applications.</span>
</p>
<p>
     <span>After</span> <a href="https://developer.att.com/developer/urlRouter.jsp?referer=callToAction"><span>joining the developer program</span></a><span>, you can use the portal to create applications. When you do so, you specify which services your application will use (as shown in the adjacent screenshot). If you are developing a mobile Web application w/ HTML5, the SDK for that platform greatly simplifies the process and reduces the effort required.</span>
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/att/att-2.png" alt="" align="left" />
</p>
<p>
     <span>It does this using the architecture shown in the following figure. As depicted, an HTML5 application calls the new cloud API via a proxy (possibly hosted by AT&amp;T). This intermediary hides the security of the API in a Sencha plug-in, simplifying the programming model clients must follow.</span>
</p>
<p>
     <span>This JavaScript library ensures that a user has authorized an application to access her AT&amp;T resources without having to share a username or password. It does this using a standard security protocol called OAuth, which many other APIs</span> <a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=OAuth"><span>discussed previously on this blog</span></a> <span>also use. Because all calls to the API go through this proxy, the fact that the user has authorized the application can be maintained, ensuring that this step is only done once (or at least on an infrequently basis). After this initial call, the proxy will tack on a token to subsequent ones, proving the user has granted the application the right to use their resources. (See my other blog post for a</span> <a href="http://travisspencer.com/blog/2012/01/atts_use_of_oauth_in_new_api_p"><span>deeper dive into the security of the API</span></a><span>.)</span>
</p>
<p>
     <span>Once the application is done, you can deploy it into production. After doing so, you can monitor it in the same management portal. The available reports show you API response time, number of MMS and SMS messages sent, the number of errors encountered, the number of payments made, and more. This type of data will help measure ROI, optimize future releases, and better design other applications. Once the app is live, it can also be submitted to the AppCenter (though not through the portal). This widget presents applications to AT&amp;T subscribers right on their devices, helping market your inventions.</span>
</p>
<p>
     <span>After digging into and toying w/ this new platform for a bit, I have to say I’m impressed. Not every mobile network operator could pull this off, especially to the extent and quality AT&amp;T has done. Their use of an industry standard like OAuth, a common architectural paradigm like REST, and an extension to a popular framework like Sencha is very modern and appealing, which is unexpected coming from an industry where the opposite is often the case. These things together w/ the fact that the API exposes resources only available from the carrier itself, certainly make the API worth checking out.</span>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 1px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ifthisthenthat/ifthisthenthat-api-evangelist-to-tumblr.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I think email is highly underrated as a content API.  I know its not what we traditionally think of as an API, but has a lot of potential as a basic interface into an application.</p>
<p>An example of this is <a title="If This Then That" href="http://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (iftt)</a>. I use iftt to syndicate content to some of my blog platforms.  As part of my blogging strategy I want posts I publish on API Evangelist, to also show up on my <a title="Blogger" href="http://kinlane.blogspot.com/">Blogger</a>, <a title="Posterous" href="http://kinlane.posterous.com/">Posterous</a>, <a title="Tumblr" href="http://kinlane.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and <a title="Wordpress" href="http://kinlane.posterous.com/">Wordpress</a>.</p>
<p>Using iftt you can setup tasks that get triggered on certain events.  One such trigger is a new post to an RSS feed.  So when a new blog posts shows up in the <a title="API Evangelist RSS Feed" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ApiEvangelist">API Evangelist RSS</a> feed I can have iftt pull the title and body and push to a channel.  iftt provides channels for Posterous and Tumblr, allowing me to automatically syndicate using their APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 1px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ifthisthenthat/ifthisthenthat-api-evangelist-to-wordpress-via-email.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are no channels for Blogger and Wordpress, so I use their Gmail channel in conjunction with the post by email features on Blogger and Wordpress.  So instead of using an API to syndicate my content, I use email as an interface for these blogging platforms.</p>
<p>Using email as a content API is obviously not for every situation, but for some application processes, it might just work for moving content from one application to another, without much overhead.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret to Amazon's Success--Internal APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/amazon-com-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="225" />Last year there was an <a title="accidental post from a Google employee" href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">accidental post from a Google employee</a> about Google+.  The internal rant was accidentally shared publicly and provides some insight into how Google approached APIs for their new Google + platform, as well as insight how Amazon adopted an internal service oriented architecture (SOA).
</p>
<p>
     The insight about how Google approached the API for Google+ is interesting, but what is far more interesting is the insight the Google engineer who posted the rant, Steve Yegge, provides about his time working at Amazon, before he was a engineer with Google.
</p>
<p>
     During 6 years at Amazon he witnessed the transformation of the company from a bookseller to the almost $1B, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) API, cloud computing leader.  As Yegge's recalls that one day Jeff Bezos issued a mandate, sometime back around 2002 (give or take a year):
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.
     </li>
     <li>Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.
     </li>
     <li>There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.
     </li>
     <li>It doesn’t matter what technology they use.
     </li>
     <li>All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The mandate closed with:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <p>
          <strong><em>Anyone who doesn’t do this will be fired.  Thank you; have a nice day!</em></strong>
     </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
     Everyone got to work and over the next couple of years, Amazon transformed itself, internally into a service-oriented architecture (SOA), learning a tremendous amount along the way.<br />
     <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><br />
     Think about what Bezos was asking!   Every team within Amazon had to interact using web services.  If you were human resources and you needed some numbers from marketing, you had to get them using an API.  He was asking every team to decouple, define what resources they had, and make them available through an API.  Every team within your company essential becomes a partner of the other.
</p>
<p>
     Some of the lessons Amazon learned along the way:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Support</strong> - Support for your teams interface becomes critical
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Security</strong> - Every teams becomes a potential DOS attacker requiring service levels, quotas and throttling
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Monitoring / QA</strong> - Monitoring and QA are interconnected, you will need smart tools for not just telling if something is up and running, but actually delivering the expected results
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Discovery</strong> - Service discovery becomes important.  You will need to know what APIs there are, if they are available and where to find them.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Testing</strong> - Sandbox and debugging is essential for all APIs
     </li>
</ul>
<div>
     Of course this is a very small sampling from a rant of a former employee.   There are dozens, maybe hundreds of individual lessons like these that Amazon had to discover organically.
</div>
<div>
     <p>
          Yegge’s  points out that, <em>“Organizing into services taught teams not to trust each other in most of the same ways they’re not supposed to trust external developers.”</em>
     </p>
     <p>
          This makes deploying internal APIs a great exercise for preparing your company for the coming API economy where, you will have to have expose self-service, partner and public APIs to stay competitive in your industry.
     </p>
     <p>
          When Amazon started, it was difficult to see how the bookseller would be come the e-commerce powerhouse it is today, let alone to see that Amazon would transform culturally into a company that thinks and operates as a service oriented architecture, delivering Amazon Web Services, that not only changed how the company operates, but created an entire platform that would change how the Internet works.
     </p>

<p>So I created&nbsp;<a title="Hyp3rL0cal" href="http://hyp3rl0cal.com/">Hyp3rL0cal</a>, my playground for all things local. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal gives me a place to publish projects that I hack on using the CityGrid APIs, while also telling the story of what I build in real-time. &nbsp;You can find local applications I build in a variety of languages, complete with links to&nbsp;<a title="download and fork on Github" href="https://github.com/kinlane">download and fork on Github</a>, and even in some cases I publish Amazon Machine Images (AMI) with the code already loaded and ready to use.</p>
<p>As the API Evangelist at CityGrid I will be touring around the country attending hackathons and conferences, &nbsp;spreading the word about CityGrid, and interacting with developers in different cities. &nbsp;Each city I visit, I will launch a copy of my local directory prototype for that city, and publish to Hyp3rL0cal. &nbsp;This will allow me to see the quality of data available via CityGrid APIs for each city and community I visit.</p>
<p>I have added a&nbsp;<a title="blog to Hyp3rL0cal" href="http://hyp3rl0cal.com/blog/">blog to Hyp3rL0cal&nbsp;</a>where I will tell the story of my projects and travels around the country evangelizing about&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com/">CityGrid</a>. &nbsp;Come back often, I hope this will be as much of a learning experience for you, as it is for me.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <a title="Hackathon" href="http://www.hackweekends.com" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-hackathon.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I just wrapped up the <a title="AT&amp;T Mobile Hackathon in Las Vegas" href="/events/att_mobile_app_hackathon_las_vegas.php">AT&amp;T Mobile App Hackathon in Las Vegas</a>. I had a great time hanging out with developers at the <a title="Palms Hotel" href="http://www.palms.com/">Palms Hotel</a>, and watching everyone compete for the 30K in prizes.
</p>
<p>
     My primary goal at these events is to get to know developers and hear what they have to say. I was fortunate to connect with one such developer, <a title="@Code4Ever" href="https://twitter.com/#!/code4ever">Ravi Singh</a> (<a title="@Code4Ever" href="https://twitter.com/#!/code4ever">@Code4Ever</a>), and he was so kind to share Ravi's Rules for Hackathon's:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <strong>#1:</strong> Use Eventbrite or Meetup to organize the event. Don't spin your own system because it is a waste of time. Eventbrite has it's own systems to market and get info about your event out.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#2:</strong> Build a messaging network BEFORE the hackathon and register a hash for it. So many times developers leave the main area to work out their idea and miss critical information. Establish a simple back-end for all messages and let the attendees now and blast all important information about the even through it.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#3:</strong> BEFORE the event setup a Google Spreadsheet so teams can register for the final presentations and send that out in the first mails. Do not wait to do or announce it late or in slides.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#4:</strong> FOOD: Do not waste your money in lots of cheap items that are bad for the developer. Pounds of candy and jerky don't help your developers become more productive. There is a reason Google has 640 chef's cooking with organic and healthy foods. Instead of wasting your money on that stuff, find a good local cook or chef to make a hot lunch for the developers. Do not invest in Red Bull or 5hr energy or other food items that are actually bad and questionable for the health of the developers. This doesn't mean you serve tofu and fruit , but that you actively consider making food and providing drinks that are in the benefit of making the best apps.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#5:</strong> Networking, test the network before and get a clause from the facility that states what the maximum they can support is and hold them to it. So many times the wifi connection is the blocking point for developers to make something great.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#6:</strong> Judging and Rules. Make sure you post information about all of this upfront and be consistent and transparent. Do NOT have hidden or "soften" requirements when they are declared as hard ones. There is nothing more frustrating then when a team plays by the rules and gets beat by another team that hasn't. Create simple, clear and clean rules and enforce them. The more complicated the rules it is inversely proportional to the quality of the applications produced. Instead of making something great people make something to appease a set or rules. Always , Always , Always focus on making great software.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#7:</strong> Vet all API's. If a particular requirement is to use an API , you must thoroughly examine the API ahead of time and if you have to hire someone to write a sample app for the intended app that you can distribute. There is nothing more negative then presenting a badly written or untested API to a potential group of developers , it actually creates negative market impressions.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#8:</strong> Choose to make several smaller prizes instead of just 1 super prize. A lot of times the difference between #1 and #2 is negligible, reward the effort.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
     <strong>#9:</strong> Let the developers present to you and give them feedback if they request it. I have seen a few times where hackathon's ask for Video's or PowerPoint slides and don't let the developer present their idea in person. A developer that can not give a good presentation is still a million times better than the best powerpoint. Hacakthon's are usually compressed time events let the developers focus on making a great app and not waste time on presentation materials. Simple is always best. Ask the judges to keep notes and if they feel comfortable share with teams how they did. Give the developers a chance to get better. <br />
     <br />
     <strong>#10:</strong> Think about app display BEFORE the presentations. I have seen elmo's used, or projectors with VGA cables but the best setup is a an elmo or projector attached to video camera because it allows people to show their app on their computer or mobile device without a lot of fuss. You will need ideally 3 people in dedicated positions, A: Someone to host and take care of announcements and queueing up teams B: Someone near the display device adjusting and helping the nervous hackathoner's setup C: Someone to advise and keep the queued up teams in order. The video setup has maximum adaptability and the least amount of change over time between devices.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#11:</strong> Give them time. I always find it weird that the developers spend 500 to 700 minutes creating something great and the presentations get limited to a 2 or 3 mins. Average hackathons have 30 teams , if each team was given an extra minute that is only about half an hour of extra judging time. If the developers have spent the time to make something they believe is great let them share it with you and the group and give them that extra minute.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#12:</strong> Along the lines of being upfront there has been a new trend I have been seeing at hackathons that has me bewildered. One of the great things about this profession is that we are color and age blind. All we care about is if someone can make something great and not what they choose to do in their personal life or look like. The troubling trend that I have seen is discriminating against developers because of age. I have heard this a few times now where a judge has said outside the chambers that a particular developer was "too old" or they were looking for someone really young. This is insane. This should only be based on merit , who made the best app, nothing else.<br />

<p>
     Ravi is what I’d label as a hackathon veteran with over 30 hackathons under his belt, he has a good idea of what developers are looking for when attending hackathons.
</p>
<p>
     Thanks again <a title="@Code4Ever" href="https://twitter.com/#!/code4ever">Ravi</a>(<a title="@Code4Ever" href="https://twitter.com/#!/code4ever">@Code4Ever</a>) for sharing your thoughts, and I’d love to hear what other developers have to say about the event, now that we have all gotten some rest, and had time to reflect.

        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2012</span>

</p>
<p>
     I’m spending a lot of time traveling around the country going to <a title="hackathons" href="/events/">hackathons</a>. I find myself constantly explaining what the term hack means.
</p>
<p>
     I’m blown away by the number of people, even in the tech industry that still see hack as a negative term. At the <a title="AT&amp;T Hackathon" href="/events/att_mobile_app_hackathon_las_vegas.php">AT&amp;T hackathon in Las Vegas</a> , I encountered quite a few hardware folks in town for CES, attending the event. I was asked by one guy, “Are all these people trying to hack someone’s network?”.
</p>
<p>
     So, as part of my 2012 hackathon roadshow, I will take on trying to rebrand the term. Currently, these are the common definitions of the word hack:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>To cut or chop with repeated and irregular blows: hacked down the saplings
     </li>
     <li>To break up the surface of soil
     </li>
     <li>To alter a computer program
     </li>
     <li>To gain access to a computer file or network illegally or without authorization
     </li>
     <li>To cut or mutilate as if by hacking
     </li>
     <li>To cope with successfully
     </li>
     <li>To chop or cut something by hacking
     </li>
     <li>To write or refine computer programs skillfully
     </li>
     <li>To use one's skill in computer programming to gain illegal or unauthorized access to a file or network
     </li>
     <li>To cough roughly or harshly
     </li>
     <li>A rough, irregular cut made by hacking
     </li>
     <li>A tool, such as a hoe, used for hacking
     </li>
     <li>A blow made by hacking
     </li>
     <li>A rough, dry cough
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The definition I’ve heard, and prefer is:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <strong><em>A quick and dirty programmatic solution to a problem.</em></strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
     I would like to solicit other definitions and feedback of how you’d like to see the term hack used widely in the media and Hollywood.

        <p><a title="Twitter Hashtags" href="http://cmiroconsulting.com/2011/07/what-are-twitter-hashtags-and-how-to-use-them/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/Twitter-Hashtag.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons for throwing a <a title="hackathons" href="/events/">hackathon</a>, and what value you get out of a hackathon will vary depending on who you are.</p>
<p>As I explore the hackathon phenomenom in 2012, I&rsquo;m trying to track on what value hackathon organizers, API owners, mobile platforms, developers and other participants get out of hackathons.</p>
<p>I will be tracking on the different reasons people attend hackathons throughout the year, and share my findings, but here in January I know one thing for sure--hackthons are a marketing vehicle.  Whether you are the hackathon organizer, an API provider or developer you are depending on the event to market your organization, business, API or talent and skills as a developer.</p>
<p>In future posts I will write, more about the marketing effect of hackathons, but I wanted to talk about a common mistake I&rsquo;m seeing from hacakthon organizers--no Twitter hashtag for the event.</p>
<p>A Twitter hashtag is probably the most important marketing element of your hackathon.  It should be everywhere, on your site, print materials, slides...everywhere.  A hackathon organizer should be tweeting out every aspect of the event with the hashtag, before, during and after the event.</p>
<p>The hashtag will enable sponsors and other participating businesses to market themselves around the event.  It will also allow hackathon developers to showcase their ideas, skills and applications.</p>
<p>While researching hackathons I have to spend a lot of time tracking down the event hashtag, and many times I have to ask an event organizer to provide it, and often there isn&rsquo;t even one.</p>
<p>If your organizing an hackathon, make sure and establish a unique Twitter hashtag for event right away, and use it everywhere, everyone involved will benefit, and your event will be much more successful.</p>

     I look forward to meeting everyone at these events.  I will also work to establish some open office hours when I'm in each town, so I can maximize my networking with local developers from every city I visit.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/03/service-offered-by-local-social-mobile-api-providers/">Service Offered by Local, Social, Mobile API Providers</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2012</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/local-search-map-pin.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />To kick-off my role as <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> at <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid</a>, I took a <a title="quick walk through of locations and places data APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/12/22/quick-walk-through-the-world-of-location-&amp;-places-apis/">quick walk through the world of location and places API</a>.<p></p>
The <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API</a> centers around places API which provides rich local business data via a RESTful API. So getting familiar with other location and places API is critical to my role.<p></p>
While going through each of these APIs in the space I flushed out what I'd consider the high levels areas that these APIs offer. This list is a work in progress, with a goal in helping see the industry, and potentially identify where players are leading the industry, and where there are gaps.<p></p>
Of course it all starts with places information. Rich content about businesses and other geographic points of interest. CityGrid, Google, Yahoo, Bing and other players like Foursquare, SimpleGeo, InfoChimps and Factual all bring places data to the table.<p></p>
CityGrid and Foursquare also bring merchant APIs to the game, allowing businesses to manage their profile data as well as how it gets syndicated across many networks.<p></p>
Along with places data there are various geo related services that are offered across these APIs:
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/geofencing.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Geocoding" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding">GeoCoding</a></li>
	<li>Directions</li>
	<li>Distance</li>
	<li>Elevation</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence">Geofencing</a></li>
</ul>
The next area I'm grouping location services under would be other content directly related to specific places, pulled through APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Reviews</li>
	<li>Offers</li>
	<li>Images</li>
	<li>Videos</li>
	<li>Menus</li>
	<li>Editorials</li>
</ul>
After location and business related content I'd say there is a growing pool of related content that may not be directly associated with a business or location, but provide context, and augment places data making it more meaningful to users:
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/neighborhood-city-center.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Weather</li>
	<li>Demographics</li>
	<li>Wikipedia</li>
	<li>Neighborhood</li>
	<li>Tagging</li>
</ul>
That isn't a complete list of contextual places content, but a couple of quick ones I found. I will explore this area more later.<p></p>
After content I'm seeing very distinct actions that users can take around location and places data. Again, I'm sure there are more of these, but here is a short list of location actions:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Check-In</li>
	<li>Push Notifications</li>
	<li>Recommendations</li>
</ul>
You can't talk about location data without bringing in mapping. Google Maps is the most well known mapping API, but there are several providers that have JavaScript and Image based location mapping that developers can use in their web and mobile applications.<p></p>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/urban-spoon-iphone.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Next I broke out a group of location specific services, that provide location tools for developers that provide current location of users as well as tools for recording the history of users. There are also robust tools for doing look-ups of location based upon IP address, longitude and latitude and physical address.<p></p>
While doing the review of location and places APIs I also notice mobile specific tools offered by a few of the provider like mobile network probe for identifying network quality, and mobile specific SDKs, making sure mobile developers can take maximize their usage of services.<p></p>
Last but not least are a handful of social tools that bring the social to local, mobile, social. Mostly these are hooks into Twitter and Facebook friend networks, but some bring their own social networks to the table, such as Foursquare.<p></p>
This is just my first draft of the different areas of APIs, tools and services provide by location and places API providers. Its by no means a complete listing, and is meant to give me a start in understanding and organizing the local, mobile, social API space.<p></p>
If you know of any areas I'm missing and should be considering, please <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/contact/">let me know</a>.

<p>
     I expected Apple related API stories to be big, but the other topics on here like endpoint planning, transit APIs, open building blocks, RESTful business architecture and a flood of APIs were a surprise.
</p>
<p>
     Overall it shows me that applying APIs and RESTful concepts to business in specific industries can really get people talking.
</p>
<p>
     A few of these posts were written while I was doing deep dives into government, water and transit industries and how APIs are changing the landscape.
</p>
<p>
     I hope to do many of these deep industry dives in 2012.

     One of the most important fronts of API development is Government.  All of us API and data guys have all been screaming for city, county, state and federal government to open up their data via APIs for years now. 
</p>
<p>
     In 2011 I would say many government officials listened, and opened up almost <a title="100 government APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?apicat=Government&amp;maxdays=360">100 government APIs, according to ProgrammableWeb</a>:

<p>
     In 2012 it will be critical for more government agencies to open up, but also I think its time for us developers to step up and start making sense of this data and how our government operates.
</p>
<p>
     We are getting what we wanted, now how do we deliver on the promise of open government APIs?

So far its a great read. Very thought provoking stuff.
</p>
<p>
     I just read this passage on how the first dictionary transformed the way we were able to think about, understand and re-use words:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>...the meaning of words come from other words. It implies that all words come from other words, taken together, form an interlocking structure: interlocking, because all the words are defined in terms of other words. This could never have been an issue in an oral culture, where language was barely visible. Only when printing---and the diction---put the language into separate relief, as an object to be scrutinized, could anyone develop a sense of a word meaning as interdependent and even circular. Words had to be considered as words, representing other words, apart from things.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     For the first time words stood on their own, apart from the stories and poems that contained them. The first dictionaries set into motion, much of what we take for granite today with writing and communicating.
</p>
<p>
     It made me think of what APIs are doing for business information and resources. APIs decouple them, making them independent of their original intended form and meaning.  Allowing them be accessed, distributed, re-used and transformed into new ways never even conceived by its original source or creator.
</p>
<p>
     The content of an existing travel book could become an interactive application, using Google Earth, Wikipedia and other APIs allowing someone to travel the global on their iPad without leaving their home.  
</p>
<p>
     The <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid API</a> I evangelize for offers business and places data for cities across the country, with a web and mobile adveritising network.  This single resource can mean many things to different people, it could be a restaurant directory in Seattle or a medical assistance guide in Philadelphia.  
</p>
<p>
     APIs have a lot of potential in freeing up many of the business resources, media and content we use everyday and allow for them to be used in new ways.   Creating entirely new ways of doing business, using many of the same business information and resources we've been using for years.

</p>
<p>
     As 2011 comes to an end, I’d like to take another look at what I learned about the <a title="API Service Provider" href="/serviceproviders/">API management service provider</a> space in 2011. I started the year engaging 3Scale, Apigee and Mashery, trying to find a platform to build the Mimeo Connect API platform on. Then spent the entire year getting to know each of the API management service providers, and the products they offer. At the end of the year, we are <a title="discussing the relevancy of API service providers" href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/How-can-Infrastructure-API-vendors-4084799.S.86250844?qid=c824d4cb-887b-41d2-81c1-1170eff1c6d8&amp;trk=group_most_popular-0-b-ttl&amp;goback=%2Egde_4084799_member_86250844%2Egmp_4084799">discussing the relevancy of API service providers</a>, so I think a year-end API service provider post is due.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>The First Dimension<br /></strong>To make sense of the API management space, I’m looking at it in five separate dimensions. As of December 2011, I would set the first dimension and primary API management playing field as:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="3Scale" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Alcatel Lucent" href="/serviceproviders/alcatel_lucent.php">Alcatel Lucent</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="SOA Software" href="http://www.soa.com/">SOA Software</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Intel" href="/serviceproviders/intel.php">Intel</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Layer 7 Technologies" href="/serviceproviders/layer_7_technologies.php">Layer 7 Technologies</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Vordel" href="/serviceproviders/vordel.php">Vordel</a></strong>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     These companies are going to provide a gateway, proxy or a connector for your APIs either on-premise or in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
     Then through that gateway, proxy, connector they will offer a variety of services to secure, translate, throttle, cache, distribute and scale your APIs as you need.
</p>
<p>
     Some of these companies will also provide you with a way to manage usage, billing, reporting and legal for the users, partners and developers who will be consuming your API.
</p>
<p>
     These companies will also bring a whole bunch of expertise to the table, that your company can tap while building your API strategy. Some will even help you market your API to developers online and at events.
</p>
<p>
     One thing to know about these API management service providers is, well...they are API management service providers. To my knowledge they don’t actually deploy your API for you, they help you build a strategy, and manage the API. But you still need to rely on other tools and in-house resources to deliver your API.
</p>
<p>
     A common Google search or in-person query I get is: Apigee vs. Mashery, 3Scale vs. Apigee and Layer7 vs. Apigee, etc 
</p>
<p>
     After all my research, and talking to all the API management service providers--I don’t have a straight answer. My response is...visit each of their sites, choose the ones that speak to you, and call them. They each have a unique style to API management, and its healthy to get acquainted with each of their approaches, and find one that fits your companies objectives.
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Second-Dimension-Data-API-Management.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     <strong>The Second Dimension</strong><br />
     Beyond the primary players I’d say there are a group of data driven API service providers that bring a different set of tools and expertise:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="WebServius" href="/serviceproviders/webservius.php">WebServius</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Kasabi" href="/serviceproviders/kasabi.php">Kasabi</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="InfoChimps" href="/serviceproviders/infochimps.php">InfoChimps</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Socrata" href="/serviceproviders/socrata.php">Socrata</a></strong>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Data API management platforms are focusing on bringing data to life as APIs. These companies are either acquiring their own data-sets to deliver as APIs, doing it as a service for companies or providing you with tools to do it yourself. Whatever the scenario is, its about building access and delivery networks, for data, using APIs.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>The Third Dimension</strong><br />
     There is also a wave of new breed API management platforms, each with a slightly different vision of where the space should go:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Apiary.io" href="/serviceproviders/apiary.io.php">Apiary.io</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Atmosphere" href="/serviceproviders/atmosphere.php">Atmosphere</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Mashape" href="/serviceproviders/mashape.php">Mashape</a></strong>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     These new players are bringing community and social to API management, along with new ways to describe, test, manage and share APIs. This new wave has a chance to change the conversation around APIs dramatically in 2012.
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Third-Dimension-New-Wave-API-Management.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     <strong>The Fourth Dimension</strong><br />
     Beyond these companies directly offering API management services, there is always the bootstrap model. Wordpress, Github, Google Groups, Twitter and some custom coding on an Amazon EC2 instance can make for a pretty fine API and supporting area.
</p>
<p>
     I’ve identified a whole range of <a title="API Building Blocks on API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building blocks on API Evangelist</a>, and I’m always working to <a title="define the tools a DIY API owner can use" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/apitools/">define tools that the DIY API owner can use</a> to deploy and manage their API. This is where you’ll find the frameworks you’ll need to deploy an API, forum, blog, code samples, repositories, etc.
</p>
<p>
     However there are some key building blocks missing in this approach. There are no clear tools for API key management, rate limiting, translation, transformation, metrics, billing, reporting, and other areas that API management service providers are capitalizing on. <a title="on the road to the commodization of certain API management" href="http://www.diversity.net.nz/finding-relevance-in-a-commoditized-world-apis-and-infrastructure-2/2011/12/21/">On the road to the commodization of certain API management services</a>, we need some more open-source players to jump in the game. Or maybe some existing player could open-source their tools?
</p>
<p>
     <strong>The Fifth Dimension</strong><br />
     So we have the primary, data and next wave of API management service providers as well as the DIY approach to API management. I’d have to say there is a fifth dimension of this space, and that’s Google.
</p>
<p>
     Much like Amazon has done with EC2, S3 and RDS, Google is in a great position to lead the industry by example, with their standardized approach to Google API delivery and management with <a title="Google Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google Console</a>, <a title="Google Discovery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google Discovery</a>, <a title="Google Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/google-api-explorer/">Google Explorer</a> and Google Analytics.
</p>
<p>
     In my post, the <a title="Business of Google APIs" href="/2011/12/21/business-of-google-apis-2011/">Business of Google APIs 2011</a>, I introduce the idea of Google opening up its API management platform to other API owners. My thought is, that Google is in a good position to open up API management infrastructure via the Google Apps Platform, allowing any company to easily deploy an API and enable discover, exploration and management via the tools Google rolled out in 2011 for its own APIs.
</p>
<p>
     In my opinion each of the <strong>five API management dimensions</strong> I’ve laid out will have significant roles they could play in 2012:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>First Dimension</strong> - The primary API management players will fuel growth of API adoption in 2012 from the small business to the enterprise.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Second Dimension</strong> - Data API management providers will ensure the massive amounts of data we have, and are creating daily will be accessible, have delivery networks and marketplaces using APIs.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Third Dimension</strong> - A new wave of social, agile and community driven approaches to API management whill change the game and create entirely new ways to deploy, deliver, manage and consume what we know as APIs.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Fourth Dimension</strong> - DIY API management will fuel growth and innovation in the space, but without the entry of more open-source API building block players the whole industry will suffer.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Fifth Dimension</strong> - Google posses all the tools for deploying, discovering, exploring, managing and consuming APIs, will they share with the world, or keep it for themselves?
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I may actually throw in a <strong>Sixth Dimension</strong> for the API management space in 2012, <strong><a title="Content APIs" href="http://seabourneinc.com/projects/contentapi/">Content APIs</a></strong>. This is based on what I’ve <a title="seen in the space around delivering content APIs" href="/2011/12/20/the-fcc-lanches-api-curation-platform-called-myfcc/">seen in the space around deployment of Content APIs</a> for Worpdress, Drupal and other CMS platforms. Essentially turning every site into an API.
</p>
<p>
     Any of these six dimensions of API management could change the API conversation in 2012. The only thing I can predict 100%, is 2012 is definitely going to be a fun ride, based upon what i’ve seen in 2011--we are poised for some serious growth.

<p>I took a walk through what I am calling the locations and places API landscape today. Most of these APIs I&rsquo;m familiar with, but as the <a title="CityGrid API Evangelist" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/citygrid-api-evangelist/">CityGrid API Evangelist</a>, I&rsquo;m getting an opportunity to immerse myself into this new local, social mobile world.</p>
<p>As I immerse myself in this semi-new world I want to share my findings with everyone else. &nbsp;If you have any suggestions make sure and let me know in comments below.</p>
<p>First I started with&nbsp;<strong><a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a></strong>, which provide several key location and places APIs:<br /><a href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/citygrid_logo_200.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>The Places API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides functionality for information on local businesses, including search, detail, user content submission, and predictive text</li>
<li><strong>The Offers API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides coupons and special offers from businesses based on geography and category</li>
<li><strong>The Reviews API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides access to customer reviews for businesses selected by id or by geography or category</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I wanted to see what Google was doing, and of course started with the&nbsp;<strong><a title="Google Maps API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html">Google Maps APIs</a>:</strong><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-Maps-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Maps JavaScript API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Maps Javascript API lets you embed Google Maps in your own web pages</li>
<li><strong>Maps Image API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Maps Image APIs make it easy to embed a static Google Maps image or Street View panorama into your web page, with no need for JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with Google Maps they offer a set of&nbsp;<strong><a title="Geo Web Services" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/">Geo Web Services</a></strong>&nbsp;that contain several location and places based APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Directions API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Directions API is a service that calculates directions between locations</li>
<li><strong>Distance Matrix API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Distance Matrix API is a service that provides travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations.</li>
<li><strong>Elevation API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Elevation API provides you an interface to query locations on the earth for elevation data.</li>
<li><strong>Geocoding API</strong>&nbsp;- Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates</li>
<li><strong>Places API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Places API is a service that returns information about places, defined as establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest</li>
</ul>
<p>Already with&nbsp;<strong><a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com/">CityGrid</a></strong>&nbsp;and Google I&rsquo;m seeing that the type of location and places services, really start to get complicated and diverse. With&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/latitude/" target="_blank">Google Latitude</a></strong>&nbsp;I start separating the location from the place, with what are two location specific APIs:<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/latitude/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google_latitude_icon.jpeg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Curent locations</strong>&nbsp;- Represents the user's most recent known location</li>
<li><strong>Location history</strong>&nbsp;- Represents the list of all recorded user locations</li>
</ul>
<p>After Google I have to look at another big player,&nbsp;<strong><a title="Yahoo" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/everything.html?category=location&amp;view=detail">Yahoo</a></strong>. Yahoo has several location based services:<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/everything.html?category=location&amp;view=detail"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/yahoo/yahoo_geo_logo_med.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Fire Eagle</strong>&nbsp;- Fire Eagle is a service designed to build and use location-aware applications and services</li>
<li><strong>GeoPlanet</strong>&nbsp;- Yahoo! GeoPlanet is a resource for managing all geo-permanent named places on Earth</li>
<li><strong>Local</strong>&nbsp;<strong>API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides a database of information including business address and phone, category, rating, distance, URL, and traffic alerts</li>
<li><strong>Maps</strong>&nbsp;- Provides interactive maps with driving directions and traffic information</li>
<li><strong>PlaceFinder</strong>&nbsp;- Converts street addresses or place names into geographic coordinates (and vice versa)</li>
<li><strong>Placemaker</strong>&nbsp;- Identifies places mentioned in text, disambiguating them and returning unique identifiers</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally after taking a look at Yahoo I have to go see what&nbsp;<strong><a title="Microsoft" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701715.aspx">Microsoft</a></strong>&nbsp;is up to in the space:<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701715.aspx"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/bing/Bing_Maps_blue_200.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Bing Maps API</strong>- The API that power Bing Maps, an online mapping service that enables users to search, discover, explore, plan, and share information about specific locations</li>
<li><strong>Bings Maps Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Use the Locations API to get location information (<em>I love this description!</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>After looking at what local and mobile offerings the big players Google, Yahoo and Microsoft had I started looking at less search and mapping based services to more carrier based location and place services. I started with&nbsp;<strong><a title="Verizon" href="http://developer.verizon.com/content/vdc/en/verizon-tools-apis/verizon_apis.html">Verizon</a></strong>, who has a single location API:<a href="http://developer.verizon.com/content/vdc/en/verizon-tools-apis/verizon_apis.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/verizon/verizon-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>LBS Network API</strong>&nbsp;- The Verizon LBS API allows you to use the user's location to deliver specific services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a title="Sprint" href="http://developer.sprint.com/site/global/home/p_home.jsp">Sprint</a></strong>&nbsp;brings three location APIs to the table:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Geofence</strong>&nbsp;- Provides virtual perimeter services</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong>&nbsp;- Determines the location of a Sprint CDMA Device</li>
<li><strong>Presence</strong>&nbsp;- Determines if a device is present on the Sprint CDMA&nbsp;network</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a title="AT&amp;T" href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/att-logo.jpg">AT&amp;T</a></strong>&nbsp;has a LBS API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Terminal Location</strong>&nbsp;- Set of Location-based Services (LBS)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a title="Deutsche Telekom" href="http://www.developergarden.com/startseite">Deutsche Telekom</a></strong>&nbsp;has one location API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>IP Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Locate Internet users with their IP addresses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a title="Ericsson Labs" href="https://labs.ericsson.com/apis/">Ericsson Labs</a></strong>&nbsp;provides a developer community around a full suite of APIS:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>3D Landscape API</strong>&nbsp;- 3D Landscape API for integration o realistic 3D MAPS</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Allows the use a mobile phone user's current CELL-ID to obtain their geographical location</li>
<li><strong>Network Probe API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides services measure certain characteristics of network IP connectivity, firewalls and Network Address Translators</li>
<li><strong>Web Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides location data from a mobile phone using the positioning systems of mobile operators</li>
<li><strong>Web Maps API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides dynamic maps for application integration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a title="France Telecom" href="http://www.orangepartner.com/">France Telecom</a></strong>&nbsp;also has a location API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Allows applications to get geographic coordinates of a given Orange France mobile phone or a fleet</li>
</ul>
<p>Makes sense for every carrier to also provide developers with a set of location services, as they don&rsquo;t want to just be dumb pipes. They want to be an integrated player in their own customers handset usage.</p>
<p>Next I start looking to put the social in local, mobile, social. Where else to you start but Facebook, which has two location based objects as part of the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/" target="_blank">Graph API</a>:</strong><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/facebook_logo-icon.png" alt="" width="80" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Checkin</strong>&nbsp;- A checkin represents a single visit by a user to a location</li>
<li><strong>Places</strong>&nbsp;- A search option before initiating a checkin, returning name and location information from Graph API</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought I'd consider Twitter next. &nbsp;They have&nbsp;<a title="Places &amp; Geo" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api#places-geo">Places and Geo</a>&nbsp;methods, but it really doesn't seem like its going anywhere, and a really small portion of tweets have geo info recorded. &nbsp;I will consider in the future if I see action around it.</p>
<p>In the category of location based social network I was investigating&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a title="Gowalla" href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a></strong>, but with the recent Facebook acquisition of Gowalla I think I will only look at&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a></strong>. Foursquare offers access to four different APIs:</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/foursquare/foursquare_logo_200.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Core API</strong>&nbsp;- Users, Venues, Venue Groups, Checkins, Tips, Lists, Photos, Specials, Campaigns, Events</li>
<li><strong>Real-time API</strong>&nbsp;- Notifies venue managers when users check in to their venues, and our user push API notifies developers when their users check in anywhere</li>
<li><strong>Merchant Platform</strong>&nbsp;- The Merchant Platform allows developers to write applications that help registered venue owners manage their foursquare presence and specials</li>
<li><strong>Venues Platform</strong>&nbsp;- The Venues Platform allows developers to search for places and access a wealth of information about them, including addresses, popularity, tips, and photos</li>
</ul>
<p>After Foursquare you leave social, getting into the places data world, with popular player&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://simplegeo.com/" target="_blank">SimpleGeo</a></strong>. Similar to Gowalla I was going to overlook SimpleGeo, with their recent&nbsp;<a title="acquisition by Urban Airship" href="http://blog.simplegeo.com/2011/10/31/taking-our-relationship-with-urban-airship-to-a-cruising-altitude/">acquisition by Urban Airship</a>, but I think SimpleGeo is still an important enough of a player, that we should still consider them in the game. SimpleGeo has four distinct web services for location and places:<a href="https://simplegeo.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/simplegeo/simplegeo_logo_200.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>SimpleGeo Storage</strong>&nbsp;- Storage of data in SimpleGeo system</li>
<li><strong>SimpleGeo Features</strong>&nbsp;- Features in SimpleGeo represent real-world places such as businesses, regions, or US states</li>
<li><strong>SimpleGeo Context</strong>&nbsp;- Provides relevant contextual information such as weather, demographics, or neighborhood data for a specific location</li>
<li><strong>SimpleGeo Places</strong>&nbsp;- Businesses and points of interest</li>
</ul>
<p>In the pure places data game I&rsquo;d put&nbsp;<strong><a href="ttps://www.factual.com" target="_blank">Factual</a></strong>&nbsp;in the same category as SimpleGeo. Factual has seven location and places APIs:<a href="ttps://www.factual.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/factual/factual-logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Places Category API</strong>&nbsp;- Taxonomy to classify entities in the various Factual point-of-interest (POI) datasets</li>
<li><strong>Places Crossref&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- URLs for pages that mention a specific business or point of interest or vice versa</li>
<li><strong>Places Crosswalk&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- Maps third-party (Yelp, Foursquare, etc.) identifiers for businesses or points of interest to each other where each ID represents the same place</li>
<li><strong>Places Global Database&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- 55 million entities in 47 countries</li>
<li><strong>Places Global Place Attributes&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- The latest schema for the global places dataset</li>
<li><strong>Places Resolve&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- Makes partial records complete, matches one entity against another, and assists in de-duping and normalizing datasets</li>
<li><strong>Places Restaurants&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- Core places attributes in addition to 43 extended attributes on 800,000+ restaurants, bars, and casual eateries including datatypes such as cuisine, ratings, hours of operations, and price</li>
</ul>
<p>Tied with SimpleGeo and Factual is&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.infochimps.com/apis/geo" target="_blank">InfoChimps</a></strong>. InfoChimps is a data marketplace player with some very strong location and places services:<a href="http://www.infochimps.com/apis/geo" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/infochimps-logo.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Wikipedia Articles</strong>&nbsp;- Correlate Wikipedia articles with geographic locations</li>
<li><strong>Business Places by Locationary</strong>&nbsp;- The Business Places by Locationary API delivers quality business information based on your geographically defined query</li>
<li><strong>Foursquare Places</strong>&nbsp;- The Foursquare Places API delivers uniquely rich information about venues, worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Geonames Places</strong>&nbsp;- The Geonames Places API locates all places within a specified area. Places are any geographic points that can be named</li>
<li><strong>NCDC Weather</strong>&nbsp;- The NCDC Weather API provides detailed weather data based on your geographically defined query. Weather data points for your query may include dew point, precipitation, snow depth, temperature, visibility, and wind speed details</li>
<li><strong>American Community Survey (Topline)</strong>&nbsp;- The 2009 American Community Survey (ACS) Topline API provides basic demographic data based on your geographically defined query</li>
<li><strong>American Community Survey (Drilldown)</strong>- The 2009 American Community Survey (ACS) Drilldown API provides detailed demographic data based on your geographically defined query</li>
<li><strong>Core Geographic Regions</strong>&nbsp;- The Core Geographic Regions API delivers detailed geodata for any geographically defined query, worldwide</li>
<li><strong>Zillow Neighborhoods</strong>&nbsp;- Zillow Neighborhoods retrieves geo data pertaining to neighborhoods within defined geometric parameters</li>
<li><strong>Digital Element IP Intelligence Demographics</strong>&nbsp;- A geolocation API for all your demographics needs. Search by IP address to return data about a geographical area, including number of households, gender, age groups and language</li>
<li><strong>Digital Element IP Intelligence Domains</strong>&nbsp;- A reverse IP lookup API with 5 fields of search results, all customized to your IP query. Search by IP address to return data about the domain, company, ISP, NAICS industry code and proxy type for an IP</li>
<li><strong>Digital Element IP Intelligence Geolocation</strong>&nbsp;- A geolocation API with 20 fields of search results, all customized to your IP query. Search by IP address to return data about a geographical area, including country, region, city, internet connection speed</li>
<li><strong>Geocoding API</strong>&nbsp;- The Geocoding API is a powerful and useful tool that provides location information for any given address in the United States. Geocoding is a process that assigns geographic data (ie, latitude and longitude) to an address</li>
<li><strong>Latitude Longitude and Zip Code Conversions -</strong>&nbsp;This API returns approximated latitude/longitude centroids for a given zip code, along with the relative city, state, and county</li>
</ul>
<p>Then moving out of pure data players&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview" target="_blank">Yelp</a></strong>&nbsp;has always been centered around reviews, and more recently, with version 2.0 of their API moved to be centered around the businesses. Yelp has two places APIs:<a href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/yelp/Yelp_Logo_200.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Search API</strong>&nbsp;- Searches for Businesses</li>
<li><strong>Business API</strong>&nbsp;- Returns full details of businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>Another player in the space is&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://fwix.com/" target="_blank">Fwix</a></strong>. Fwix has a different approach to places, trying to geotag the web. Fwix offers six places and location APIs:<a href="http://fwix.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/fwix/fwix_logo_300.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Geotagger API</strong>&nbsp;- Returns places geotagged to a given web page</li>
<li><strong>Content API</strong>&nbsp;- Returns geotagged content in or near a location</li>
<li><strong>Categories API</strong>&nbsp;- Returns the list of canonical place categories</li>
<li><strong>Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Returns geographic data for a latitude/longitude point</li>
<li><strong>Places API</strong>&nbsp;- Return, Submit and Delete a list of businesses for a given location</li>
</ul>
<p>After Fwix I found a couple of other mapping, location and places data services:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="PushPin" href="http://www.pushpin.com/api/1.3/docs/rest/latlng.html">PushPin</a></strong>&nbsp;- The Pushpin Identify Service is a REST service that takes geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and resolves them to named locations on the earth</li>
<li><strong><a title="43 Places" href="http://www.43places.com/about/view/web_service_api">43 Places</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Allows users build 43 Places by adding places, asking questions, giving travel advice, uploading pictures of their favorite places and writing stories about the places they've been and want to go.</li>
<li><strong><a title="MaxMind" href="http://www.maxmind.com/app/city">MaxMind GeoIP&reg; City Database</a>&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;Determine country, state/region, city, US postal code, US area code, metro code, latitude, and longitude information for IP addresses worldwide.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Compass" href="http://compass.webservius.com/documentation.htm">Compass</a>&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;Allows access to a database of 16 million business establishments in the USA.</li>
</ul>
<p>These providers either didn&rsquo;t have clear market share or started deviating into other parallel universes of content and services to location and places, so I'm going to stop here.</p>
<p>These 17 places and location API providers are a lot to process. &nbsp;I want to spend some time getting a handle on the types of services they offer, before I dive into the peripheral services as well as the players that have less market share. But in my style, I'll keep posting my findings as I pull them together.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Dec 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://code.google.com/more/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google_code.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb says Google has 94 APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?company=Google">ProgrammableWeb says Google has 94 APIs</a>.  I roughly count about <a href="http://code.google.com/more/">75 going through Google Code</a>.  I&rsquo;m more concerned with public web APIs, and Google has Android, Chrome and other non-web APIs, so its hard to tell.</p>
<p>In any case I would consider Google to the largest public web API owner around.  I don&rsquo;t think any other single provider, owns the number of, as well as size of public APIs, that Google does.  As with any leading API providers I think there is a lot to learn in studying their approach to API deployment and management.</p>
<p>With this in mind I wanted to take a look at the Business of Google APIs in 2011 as one of my year-end, API reflection posts.  I think there are some important lessons to be learned from the work Google did over 2011, to get their API business in order.</p>
<p>Google was already setting the theme for 2011, with the <a title="launch of Google Console in 2010" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/11/introducing-google-apis-console-and-our.html">launch of Google Console in November 2010</a>.  The <a title="Google API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">Google API Console</a> helps developers manage their Google API usage across all of thier sites and apps.  It was clear, Google was not just looking for a way to get a handle on how they deploy and manage large numbers of APIs, they were acknowledging developers needed a way as well.</p>
<p><a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-Dashboard.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a> centralized how developers managed the Google APIs they used, traffic generated via these APIs, introduced billing management for some APIs, and provided developers with project and team building tools. &nbsp;Google supports 30 APIs inside of the API Console now.</p>
<p>In 2011 Google also worked to make their <a title="Google APIs more discoverable" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/google-apis-discovery-service-one-api.html">APIs more discoverable for developers</a> with the launch <a title="Google API Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/">Google API Discovery Service</a>.  The <a title="Google API Discover Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google API Discovery Service</a> provides a set of web APIs for discovering metadata across Google APIs by delivering a JSON-based API that provides a directory of supported Google APIs, and a machine-readable discovery document for each API.</p>
<p><a title="Google API Discover Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-discover-file-cabinet.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Now developers can integrate Google API discovery into client libraries, IDE plugins and other tools, making it easier to discover the API they need.  After providing an API discovery service,  Google followed another 2011 trend around deploying the <a title="Google API Explorer" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">Google API Explorer</a>.</p>
<p>Like other API explorers, <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/google-api-explorer/">Google API Explorer</a> allows users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a web interface, allowing anyone to start using an API without writing any code, even when authentication using Basic Auth or OAuth is required.</p>
<p>API explorers have done a lot to improve the time it takes for developers to get up and running using an API, but nothing beats good quality code samples, and Google put some serious effort into standardized code samples that can be used across Google APIs, in multiple programming languages:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2011-09-09T15:20:00-07:00&amp;max-results=10 Google APIs"><strong>Google APIs Client Library for PHP (Beta)</strong></a></li>

<li><a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/04/google-apis-python-library-goes-to-beta.html"><strong>Google APIs Python Library goes to Beta </strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond making it easier to discover, explore and manage APIs with Google Discovery, Google Explorer and Google Console in 2011, Google also spent a lot of time addressing API security.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Google-OAuth-2-Playground.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The first step to <a title="improving security across Google APIs by supporting SSL" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/03/improving-security-of-google-apis-with.html">improving the security of Google APIs was by supporting SSL</a> across all Google APIs.  Next Google went all in by not just working to <a title="support OAuth across Google APIs" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/03/making-auth-easier-oauth-20-for-google.html">support OAuth 2.0 across Google APIs</a>, they want to help developers understand OAuth 2.0, making it easier to secure applications with the standard.  To help facilitate this understanding, <a title="Google opened up the oauth playground" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/11/oauth-20-playground-open-to-developers.ht">Google opened up the OAuth 2.0 Playground</a>, which is meant to simplify experimentation with the OAuth 2.0 protocol and APIs that use the protocol by developers.</p>
<p>With these moves by Google in 2011,  I think we can say that SSL support and OAuth 2.0 are two API security essentials that are here to stay.   After working on security, Google moved into the legal department with the introduction of a <a title="single Google APIs Terms of Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/12/12/google-deploys-a-single,-centralized-terms-of-use-for-apis/">single Google APIs Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>Google has rewritten their terms from the ground up with the goal of making them easier to understand for application developers, and one by one, redirecting each API to use the <a title="centralized, easier to use terms of service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/terms/index.html">centralized, easier to understand terms of service</a>.   At the moment it seems as though most of the APIs that use the central terms of service are content and data related APIs, like Google Moderator and Blogger, while more complex APIs like Youtube and Google Adwords still use their own terms of service.</p>
<p>Overall Google made some pretty significant improvements to get their API house in order. Of course in order to do this they also had to make some hard decision, like deciding to <a title="shut down 18 Google APIs in May" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/spring-cleaning-for-some-of-our-apis.html">shut down 18 Google APIs in May</a>, which included the Google Translate API.  A decision they reversed two months later, when they decided it was better to&nbsp;<a title="offer Google Translate as a Billable API" href="/2011/08/25/paid-version-of-google-translate-api/">offer Google Translate as a billable API</a> under Google Console.</p>

<p>As the <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I don&rsquo;t really invent any of the API approaches I write about, I try to shed light on what others are doing.  Thats what this post is all about, shedding light on how Google is conducting the business of their APIs, so we can learn from them-- the good and the bad.</p>
<p>I think its important to remember that we are all making this shit up as we go along, of course it should be based on some experience, but ultimately we are in some seriously new territory, and even some of the biggest players in this space fumble the ball.  This fact became painfully clear in an <a title="accidental post by Steve Yegge" href="https://plus.google.com/112678702228711889851/posts/eVeouesvaVX">accidental post by Googler Steve Yegge</a>, shedding light into the API strategy of not just Google, but also Amazon.</p>
<p>So what do I take from Google&rsquo;s approach to APIs in 2011?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API discovery is important</li>
<li>API exploration is important </li>
<li>Centralized billing and reporting are essentials</li>
<li>Good quality code samples are essential </li>
<li>Security with SSL and OAuth 2.0 for APIs is standard </li>
<li>The legal around APIs needs to be easier and standardized </li>
<li>Sometimes, APIs go away </li>
<li>We are all making this shit up as we go along </li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of this is what we already are seeing from API service providers in the space like <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a>, Atmosphere and <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a>. But, what I don&rsquo;t see, is anyone addressing discoverability, easy legal and centralized billing, management and reporting from a developers perspective.</p>
<p>Google is addressing all of this because its in their best interest for ALL developers to be successful, where API service providers tend to focus on the success of developers who use their client APIs, not ALL developers.</p>
<p>Well, maybe in 2012 a service provider can step up with a solution that help developers discover and manage their business and legal across &ldquo;ANY&rdquo; API, or maybe Google can open the doors to any API provider to use the Google API platform as part of any Google Apps account?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/12/20/the-fcc-lanches-api-curation-platform-called-myfcc/">The FCC Lanches API Curation Platform Called MyFCC</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2011</span>
        <p><a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/My-FCC-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The FCC just launched a new platform that&nbsp;allows anyone to create, save and manage a customized page, built from widgets that pull content from FCC APIs, called <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a> might look like just another dashboard or start page, but it goes much further, as an API curation platform.</p>
<p>To understand, you have to go back to the beginning and see the scope of the problem being solved.  To deliver on its promise for a more open government, the FCC didn't just want a new website, they needed a platform.  To do this the FCC embraced an API-driven methodology while building their web site, meant to standardize the way they deliver information between internal groups, government agencies and with the public.</p>
<p><a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/Seabourne.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At the time, the managing FCC director Steve Van Roekel, partnered with <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a> to architect a platform that could deliver on this vision.</p>
<p>The new FCC web site would start with Drupal, providing a content management system (CMS) that would allow the FCC to focus on getting a handle on its content, centralizing it, preparing it to be shared with other departments, agencies and the public.   The federal government is drowning in content, so the entry, storage and management of this content was the first problem to solve, and an open-source platform like Drupal, was an ideal solution.</p>
<p>The new Drupal web site provided public access to the content, but the FCC needed to allow sharing of content with other departments, agencies and allow the public to get at the raw data for re-use.</p>
<p><a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/My-FCC-Available-Widgets.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>"Everyone is talking about opening up data with APIs, to me it makes more sense to focus on opening up content using APIs.", says Mike Reich, owner of Seabourne.</em></blockquote>
<p>So Seabourne developed the <a title="Content API Drupal Module" href="http://seabourneinc.com/projects/contentapi/">Content API module for Drupal</a>, providing a plug-and-play API, not just for the FCC website, but for any Drupal driven website.</p>
<p>Then in April, the FCC launched their API driven content platform, stating that &ldquo;<a title="Everything Should Be An API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">Everything should be an API</a>&rdquo;.   In doing so the FCC did two very significant things:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Got control over their content using an open-source content management tool</li>
<li>Made their content accessible inter-department, inter-agency and with the public using APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>Now with MyFCC the FCC is providing a dashboard that allows anyone to curate content that is made available via the FCC&rsquo;s API.   Centralized content, opened up with APIs, bundled with curation tools opens up lot of potential for data journalists, analysts, scientists and other average users to derive deeper meaning from FCC operations.</p>
<p>All of this potential is made possible through a healthy dose of open source Drupal CMS, open source Drupal modules, open data, and open APIs. That is a lot of open, and shows the commitment of the FCC.</p>
<p><a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/My-FCC-Topic-Watcher.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I sat down with Mike, while in DC in October, when he first introduced me to <a title="Cumula Framework to Github" href="https://github.com/Cumula/framework">Cumula&nbsp;</a>, the framework that drives MyFCC.  During their work with the FCC, they have been committing the <a title="Cumula Framework to Github" href="https://github.com/Cumula/framework">Cumula framework to Github</a>, planting the seeds for a much larger vision of what the framework could do.</p>
<p>Cumula has the potential to act as curation platform for any single or group of APIs.  The MyFCC implementation is very tailored to serving up the FCC content, but the platform can act as a visual builder and dashboard for any topical area.  For example, the platform could be setup with widgets that pull medical content from various health, science and medical APIs, allowing users to create custom dashboards around the medical information most important and relevant to them.</p>
<p><a title="Cumulu" href="https://github.com/Cumula/framework">Cumula</a> is to API curation as <a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee console</a> is to <a title="API exploration" href="/2011/03/24/explorers-open-api-access-beyond-developers/">API exploration</a>, <a title="Google API Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/">Google API Discovery Service</a> is to <a title="API discovery" href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">API discovery</a>, and <a title="Swagger" href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a> is to interactive API documentation.   It has the potential to be the platform that the world uses to discover, pull, curate and make sense of the flood of content and data we are only just beginning to drown in, with this new API driven economy.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/12/17/google-affiliate-network-api/">Google Affiliate Network API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Dec 2011</span>

<p>Google just launched their new <a title="Google Affiliate Network API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/gan/index.html">Google Affiliate Network API</a>, which allows publishers and advertisers to automate various tasks related to the <a title="Google Affiliate Network" href="http://www.google.com/affiliatenetwork">Google Affiliate Network</a>.</p>
<p>The Google Affiliate Network is the affiliate network, formerly known as Doubleclick Performics, which was part of <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/doubleclick.html">Google&rsquo;s Doublick acquisition in April of 2007</a>.</p>
<p>Using the new Google Affiliate Network APIs, developers can programmaticaly manage:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Advertiser Lookup</strong> - Publishers can now use the Google Affiliate Network API to access data that advertisers have chosen to share with them.</li>
<li><strong>Event and Order Details</strong> - Developers can easily integrate data from events that occur in Google Affiliate Network into their own website's workflow and internal systems.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher Lookup</strong> - Advertisers can use the API to look up data that publishers have chosen to share with them</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to play with the network more to understand how it works from both an advertisers and publishers perspective.</p>
<p>It looks like an interesting addition to the suite of publishing, advertising and revenue generating tools from Google like <a title="Google Analytics" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, <a title="Google Adwords" href="https://adwords.google.com/">Google Adwords</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/v3/app">Google Adsense</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Google Webmaster Tools</a>.</p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/blueprints.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />In my quest to fully understand the underlying principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), i'm re-reading Roy Thomas Fielding original dissertation, <a title="Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architecture" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>, where he first introduced the REST architectural style.</p>
<p>His dissertation explored the junction of two disciplines in computer science: <em>software and networking</em>.</p>
<p>He identifies that software research:</p>
<blockquote><em>...has long been concerned with the categorization of software designs and the development of design methodologies, but has rarely been able to objectively evaluate the impact of various design choices on system behavior.</em></blockquote>
<p>While networking research:</p>
<blockquote><em>...is focused on the details of generic communication behavior between systems and improving the performance of particular communication techniques, often ignoring the fact that changing the interaction style of an application can have more impact on performance than the communication protocols used for that interaction.</em></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/parthenon.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Fieldings work was motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software.  He wanted to rethink software design in the context of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web is intended to be an Internet-scale, distributed system, interconnecting information networks across organizational boundaries, and cope with the demands of scalability and independent deployment of software.</p>
<p>As Fielding states:</p>
<blockquote><em>REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.</em></blockquote>
<p>As I'm reading his abstract and introduction I can't help but think about where I stand as an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/api-evangelism-vs-developer-evangelism/">API Evangelist</a>, at the convergence of business and RESTful APIs.</p>
<p>When RESTful APIs are applied to business, what does this look like?  Is business currently restricted in the same ways as software?  When business is operating on the World Wide Web do we need to consider the network more?</p>
<p>Lots to consider at the intersection of business and RESTful APIs.</p>

<p>Google has made another step towards a more common API infrastructure in line with their <a title="API Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">API Discovery Service</a>, <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/google-api-explorer/">API Explorer</a>, and <a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">API Console</a> by launching a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/terms/index.html">single terms of service for all Google APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Google has rewritten their terms from the ground up with the goal of making them easier to understand for application developers.</p>
<p>At the moment it seems as though most of the APIs that use the central terms of service are content and data related APIs, like <a title="Google Tasks" href="http://code.google.com/apis/tasks/terms.html">Google Tasks</a>, <a title="Google Moderator" href="http://code.google.com/apis/moderator/terms.html">Google Moderator</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Google Charts" href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/terms.html">Google Charts</a> and <a title="Blogger" href="http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/terms.html">Blogger</a>.</p>
<p>While more complex APIs like <a title="Youtube Terms of Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/terms.html">Youtube</a>, <a title="Google Analytics" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google Analytics</a>, <a title="Google Adwords Terms of Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/terms.html">Google Adwords</a> and <a title="Google Latitude" href="http://code.google.com/apis/latitude/terms.html">Google Latitude</a> still use their own terms of service.  Over time, more APIs will be migrated to the new, centralized terms of service format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With almost 100 APIs now, it makes sense for Google to reduce the complexity of terms of use across APIs, increasing the chances a developer will &ldquo;legally&rdquo; build an application or business around one or multiple Google APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google provides tools for developers to easily discover, explore their APIs, while also providing centralized management of billing, usage reporting and terms of use. &nbsp;I predict we will see other API service providers offering tools for managing <a title="terms of use" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/terms_of_use__conditions.php">terms of use</a>, <a title="branding" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/branding.php">branding</a> and other legal aspects of API management in 2012.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Dec 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a title="4,480 APIs in the Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/programmableweb/ProgrammableWeb-API-Directory.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I recently pulled the title, description and tags for all the APIs in the <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgramableWeb</a> directory into a local MySQL database. At the time of this writing there are <a title="4,480 APIs in the Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">4,480 public APIs in the directory</a>.
</p>
<p>
     My goal is build a better search and discovery interface, so I can get a handle on all these APIs. Which ones I should be paying attention to, recommending to developers and generally just have an awareness of what types of APIs are available.
</p>
<p>
     Where do I start?
</p>
<p>
     First I start with a keyword search on the title, description and tags associated with each API. I will build a bunch of custom search queries, but no matter how good my queries are, I’m still limited by whatever descriptions are associated with the APIs and whatever tags were applied. This is just search, it isn’t discovery or real-time tracking.
</p>
<p>
     Having gone through whole categories of image APIs and storage APIs by hand I know there is a lot of crap APIs that aren’t in my opinion, real API efforts. They just throw up an API, register it with ProgrammableWeb and don’t actually have a supporting area for developers.
</p>
<p>
     I need a way to programmatically rank each API while searching through APIs. When I search for photo management APIs, I want them sorted by some sort of value. Currently ProgrammableWeb uses the number of mashups of an API as a “popularity” ranking. I need more and I figured <a title="Compete" href="https://www.compete.com/developer/">Compete</a> and <a title="Alexa" href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> APIs could give me some sense of the value of each API based upon its domain. This is just a start and I want to establish a <a title="wide variety of metrics for measuring the value delivered by an API" href="/2011/04/21/measuring-the-popularity-of-apis/">wide variety of metrics for measuring the value delivered by an API</a>.
</p>

     My API ranking algorithm is obviously a work in progress. I just figured I’d tell the story of how I evolve my API ranking algorthm here, and leave open for comment and others to add to. But as I work to make sense of 4,480 APIs, I can’t help but think--what does a world with 100K open APIs look like?

</p>
<p>
     <a title="Hackathons" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/events/">Hackathons</a> are growing into a popular way to spark innovation around hardware, data and APIs within developer and hacker communities. I count over 40 hackathons going on in December alone, and this is just what I can discover and keep up with in my research.
</p>
<p>
     Hackathons are also being used by many companies to drive innovation internally between departments. Businesses like <a title="LinkedIn" href="http://blog.linkedin.com/category/linkedin-hackdays/">LinkedIn</a> and <a title="Zappos" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/19/how-zappos-drives-internal-innovation-with-its-public-api/">Zappos</a> employ Hackathons and Hack Days internally to get recreate this same hackathon phenomenon within their own companies, in a much more controlled, safe environment.
</p>
<p>
     Now Zappos is going even further and opening up their Internal Hackathon to the public. December 12th through the 16th of 2011 they are holding the <a title="Zappos API Hackathon" href="http://developer.zappos.com/blog/zappos-api-hackathon-hack-long-contest">Zappos API Hackathon Hack-a-long</a>, which in the past, has been an event open only to Zappos employees, but this year, they want the public to hack alongside of Zappos employees.
</p>
<p>
     On Monday, Dec 12th, Zappos will post a theme on their blog, and developers will have one week to hack up a project that fits in with the theme. Zappos will be awarding three $100 gift cards for <a title="Zappos.com" href="http://www.Zappos.com">Zappos.com</a> to the winners in three categories: Best Mashup, Best Overall, and Most Fun and Weird.
</p>
<p>
     Public developer apps will be presented along side internal Zappos employee projects, during their Hackathon Open House. The goal of the event is to help inspire Zappos developers and expose them to the passion and creative juices of the public Zappos developer community.
</p>
<p>
     I’m spending a lot of time tracking on the evolving Hackathon phenonemon and how these events are spurring innovating both internally within companies and externally in public developer communities in cities around the globe. I’ll keep tracking on the innovation and talent coming out of hackathons and I am excited to see more companies adopt them internally and even inviting the public to come participate in the hacking!

<p>
     There was a post a couple weeks back in the <a title="New York Times Bits Blog" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/">New York Times Bits Blog</a> called, "<a title="TaskRabbit Looks to Expand Cities and Offers an API" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/taskrabbit-looks-to-expand-cities-and-offer-an-a-p-i/">TaskRabbit Looks to Expand Cities and Offer an A.P.I.</a>"
</p>
<p>
     Its a pretty straightforward post about the San Francisco based start-up, that gets you in touch with friendly, reliable people who can help you get just about anything you need done. At first glance, it is a pretty standard post. However I feel there are two things very notable about this post and more specifically, it’s title:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>TaskRabbit Looks to Expand Cities and Offer an A.P.I.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     One, the launching of an API is tied directly to the startups expansion into other cities. Those of us in the know, understand the important role an API plays in scaling your company, but explaining this to mainstream audiences is so important.
</p>
<p>
     Two, that the acronym "API" gets used in a title of a mainstream publication like the New York Times.  Of course they spell it out in the article, but the editor expects that the user will understand the acronym in the title.
</p>
<p>
     There are many API stories in 2011, but I think this really shows APIs are coming of age, when it is acceptable for a wider, mainstream audience to accept the term into their vocabulary.
</p>
<p>
     One of the things I like about APIs is they are a silent, but powerful force behind many industry sectors including e-commerce, social, cloud computing and mobile computing. I think this use of API in the NYT represent classic API style, a silent coming of age, showing APIs are being adopted by a mainstream audience.

        <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2011</span>
        <p>
     There was a post in the Atlantic about Twitter’s advertising network called, <a title="No One's Noticing Twitter's New Ad Experiment, Which is a Good Thing" href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/11/no-ones-noticing-twitters-new-ad-experiment-which-good-thing/45143/">No One's Noticing Twitter's New Ad Experiment, Which Is a Good Thing</a>.
</p>
<p>
     Twitter is dropping what they call “promoted tweets” into users timelines. Adam Clark Estes of the Atlantic states:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>Despite months of hemming and hawing over the danger of polluting the sacred Twitter feed, the few people that have taken notice seem reasonably pleased by the hands-off approach.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     A user, also cited in the article, Ellis Hamburger at Business Insider thinks the approach is awesome:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>I realized that Promoted Tweets really aren't that much different from TV commercials—brief interruptions from your content.</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
     <em>Except they're not very annoying. …</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
     <em>Twitter's commercials are different and have a leg up because they will be intermixed with incredibly time-sensitive content. They're also brief, which helps. And a lot of of the time, Promoted Tweets are from celebrities who tweet their thoughts in their own voice.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     I’m following Twitter’s rollout of their advertising network because its a big deal to finally see the popular micro-blogging platform finally move towards monetizing the network--even if some don’t like it. But I think the work Twitter is doing has even bigger implications, on the future of online advertising, even beyond social media.
</p>
<p>
     The Internets seem to be stuck in a rut, when it comes to monetization of our online real estate. There isn’t much innovation beyond the classic online and slightly newer mobile advertising platforms dominated by Google and a handful of others. What is next?
</p>
<p>
     <a title="advertising network dedicated to APIs" href="/2011/09/28/advertising-network-dedicated-to-apis-and-developers/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Advertising.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     APIs of course. As APIs also struggle to develop their monetization strategies, they tend to default to charging for their services, with some API providers like <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid</a> are providing mobile and web advertising solutions alongside their APIs.
</p>
<p>
     I feel what Twitter is doing is one possible model for other API owners to follow in monetizing their API platforms. Provide relevant, seamless advertising embedded into each API stream. When it comes to content APIs this is easy to envision, but with other forms of media and resources it will get much more complicated.
</p>
<p>
     Twitter, was made successful by its API community, with all its web and mobile properties consuming its API, and the service itself resembles many APIs in how it works. Perhaps the work Twitter is doing can be used as a model for building out an <a title="advertising network dedicated to APIs" href="/2011/09/28/advertising-network-dedicated-to-apis-and-developers/">advertising network dedicated to APIs</a>, baking in monetization into each and every API call, before it reaches the web or mobile application layers.

        <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Defag Conf" href="http://defragcon.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/defrag-2011/defrag-2011.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>"Are API service providers relevant?  Will they remain relevant?"</p>
<p>Thats the question asked by Ben Kepes at this years <a title="Defag Conf" href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag Conference</a>, while moderating a panel with Apigee's Sam Ramji and Mashery's Neil Mansilla.</p>
<p>It was a bold question to ask, perhaps, in front of an audience comprised of people from 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery and Alcatel Lucent -- all API service providers.  And Sam's response was to dismiss Ben's question was &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;, steering the conversation elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sam seemed to interpret Ben&rsquo;s question as an affront -- not just to Apigee but arguably to all the API providers in the room.  But in light of Sam's own arguments about the importance of thinking about apps as intermediaries, I thought Ben's question was particularly interesting.  After all, many of these API services providers do just that -- act as intermediaries.</p>
<p>On the surface Ben&rsquo;s question may have seemed to be picking a fight with Sam, but I think he meant it, and was seriously asking it of the industry, and I feel it is an important question. I personally think API service providers have a role to play, and can stay relevant if...if they do not impose themselves as intermediaries, but I would love to hear what others think.</p>
<p>I believe doing business in the API space, centers around providing clear value to your customers, without getting in their way.  In the words of Jeff Lawson of Twilio, "Get out of the way of the Doers!".  This philosophy applies to API service providers as well.</p>
<p>To stay relevant, the API service providers have to practice what they preach to their customers; be service oriented, decouple and allow their customers to be doers via a self-service, clearly priced, secure platform while providing added value in the form of premium services.  Without this practice, API services providers just reflect the old way of building and selling software, not the new API driven world.</p>
<p>Beyond the <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a> and <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> API service providers of the world, we also need to acknowledge there is a continued need for open-source tools and platforms that can deliver the services that businesses need for their APIs.   These tools allow for a vibrant ecosystem of service providers to support these tools and platforms just like with other open-source software communities.  Maybe the existing API service providers can even contribute to these projects and champion the cause?</p>
<p>I guess my point is, that things change quickly,  you have to have to be agile, flexible and deliver clear value to stay relevant.  This applies to any business, API service providers are not exempt.  In today's fast paced, technology driven business climate, I don't think any business leader can dismiss this question, and I think everyone should ask it often...how can I remain relevant?  Great question Ben!</p>

</p>
<p>
     There is a lot of discussion around the growth of APIs, and what the future will look like. How will we discover and make sense of the number of available APIs, and quickly get to work integrating with the APIs that bring the most value to our apps and businesses.
</p>
<p>
     One technology that comes up in every conversation I’ve had is <a title="Swagger" href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a>. What is Swagger?
</p>
<blockquote>
     <strong><em>Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.</em></strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
     The goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server. The documentation of methods, parameters and models are tightly integrated into the server code, allowing APIs to always stay in sync.
</p>
<p>
     Swagger was born out of initiatives from <a title="Wordnik" href="http://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, developed for Wordnik’s own use during the development of <a title="developer.wordnik.com" href="http://developer.wordnik.com/">developer.wordnik.com</a>. Swagger development began in early 2010 and the framework being released is used by Wordnik’s APIs, which power both internal and external API clients.
</p>
<p>
     Swagger provides a declarative resource specification, allowing users to understand and consume services without knowledge of server implementation, enabling both developers and non-developers to interact with the API, providing clear insight into how the API responds to parameters and options.
</p>
<p>
     I’m familiarizing myself with the specification more and playing with the various tools they provide:
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Swagger" href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/"></a><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger UI</strong> - A dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger-compliant API
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger Core</strong> - Defines Java annotations and required logic to generate a Swagger server or client.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger CodeGen</strong> - Contains a template-driven engine to generate client code in different languages by parsing your Swagger Resource Declaration.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger node.js</strong> - A Sample App is a fully-functioning, stand-alone Swagger server written in javascript which uses node.js and the express framework.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger Scala Sample App</strong> - A fully-functioning, stand-alone Swagger server written in Scala which demonstrates how to enable Swagger in your API.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger Java Sample App</strong> - A fully-functioning, stand-alone Swagger server written in Java which demonstrates how to enable Swagger in your API.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I understand that Swagger is not the one specification to rule all APIs, and it won’t make all religious API fanatics happy. But I want to start somewhere. I see three main benefits for API owners coming from adopting Swagger:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Automated, consistent generation of clean, beautiful, interactive API documentation
     </li>
     <li>Generation of client code and SDK in multiple languages
     </li>
     <li>Feeding into an industry wide API discovery language that both developers and non-developers can use
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I believe strongly that consistent documentation and code samples ensure an API will get used, but as the number of APIs grows, a system like <a title="Google API Discovery Service" href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google API Discovery Service</a>, will be essential for API adoption across industries and around the globe. I’m hoping to learn more about Swagger, and see if it can help deliver on this vision.

</p>
<p>
     <a title="Last March Google support OAuth 2.0" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/14/google-api-access-with-oauth-2-0/">Last March Google started support OAuth 2.0 for all of their APIs</a>, and has been pushing all developers to switch to using OAuth 2.0 in all applications.
</p>
<p>
     Today they announced the <a href="https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0 Playground</a> which allows developers to experiment with APIs using the OAuth 2.0 protocol, and understand how the protocol functions and will make your life easier.
</p>
<p>
     The OAuth 2.0 Playground enables developers to walk through each step of the OAuth 2.0 flow for server-side web applications:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Authorizing API scopes
     </li>
     <li>Exchanging authorization tokens
     </li>
     <li>Refreshing access tokens
     </li>
     <li>Sending authorized requests to API endpoints
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     At each step, the Playground displays the full HTTP requests and responses for each API.
</p>
<p>
     Google’s endorsement of OAuth 2.0 was very important for the standard and the API industry as a whole. APIs need a secure and standard way for users to authenticate and allow access to their resources when using web and mobile apps.  With Twitter, Google, Facebook and other heavyhitters on board, OAuth is here to stay.
</p>
<p>
     OAuth has traditionally been difficult for some developers to implement, which has gotten easier with 2.0. But we all have to work to help developers understand its value and how to implement--tools like <a href="https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/" target="_blank">Google OAuth 2.0 Playground</a> will go a long way in helping developers understand the standard, ensuring that users app experience is pleasant and secure, and APIs are seen as a secure and efficient way to builld applications around.

<p><a title="Pioneer Corporation" href="http://pioneer.jp/">Pioneer Corporation</a> just announced the availability of Zypr&trade;, a new voice-powered API that  provides a conversational, voice-control command API allowing developers to integrate <a title="Siri" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html">Siri</a> like functionality into their own applications.</p>
<p>The <a title="Zypr API" href="http://www.zypr.net/">Zypr API</a> provides a single RESTful API for developers to access voice UI, maps and routing, local search, social networking, music and radio, contacts, calendars and weather from multiple service providers, including:  Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yelp, AccuWeather, INRIX real-time and predictive traffic information, Slacker Radio, Tuner2 Radio, Wcities, xAd and VoiceBox.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered <a title="unified and aggregate APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/09/13/unified-data-apis-for-geo,-weather-and-beyond/">unified and aggregate APIs</a> in the past, where within maturing industries like social and cloud computing, service providers are stepping up with a single API to work with multiple providers.  Zypr is similar in that it offers a single API for multiple providers, but uses voice as the mechanism for search.   Zypyr&rsquo;s goal is to normalize, stable and voice-enhanced method for accessing a wide array of constantly changing APIs, Zypr can reduces the impact of service-specific API changes.</p>
<p><a title="Zypr API" href="http://www.zypr.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Zypr/Zypr-Server-Architecture.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pioneer created Zypr so that any type of developer or device maker on any platform can easily offer compelling new services to enhance their own technology and brand equity,&rdquo; said Susumu Kotani, the president of Pioneer Corporation. &ldquo;We have also changed the rules by allowing developers and device makers alike the opportunity to share in revenue when they deploy Zypr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to providing revenue sharing opportunities, the Zypr API is available at no chrage to developers.  You can access documentation, code, sample application and other developer tools at <a title="Zyprnet" href="http://www.zypr.net/">www.zypr.net</a>.</p>
<p>With a simple, but powerful RESTful API and the buzz around <a title="Siri" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html">Siri</a>, Apples new voice tasking system , the Zypr API is sure to be a hit.  If Pioneer Corporation can successfully evangelize the Zypr API and get it into the hands of hackers and developer globally, it could easy become the <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/apis/twilio.php">Twilio</a> of voice tasking.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Atmosphere API Management" href="http://atmos.phe.re/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/soa/atmosphere-logo-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I first reported on service oriented architecture (SOA) pioneer <a href="http://www.soa.com/">SOA Software&rsquo;s</a> entry into the API management arena <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">back in June</a>, today at the Cloud Computing Expo in Santa Clara, CA they are announcing the beta release of their enterprise API management solution called <a title="Atmosphere API Management" href="http://atmos.phe.re/">Atmos.phe.re</a>.</p>
<p>SOA has taken their enterprise API management solution, and bundled it with many of the features we are growing accustomed to within open API ecosystems, and deployed as a new solution with a focus on community.</p>
<p>The new platform intends to bring together API owners and application developers into a community, providing a central place where an ecosystem can grow around each of your APIs, whether its a private or public initiative.</p>
<p>Atmosphere is taking the social aspects of popular, open API ecosystems, and are applying these concepts to the enterprise, providing not only a place where API owners and developers can come together, but it also invites business, marketing and creative folks to get involved--creating a truly collaborative, enterprise environment around any API initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enterprises now have a choice in how they provide APIs. They can use Atmosphere Cloud to manage their developer community, and process messages on-premise.&rdquo; said Alistair Farquharson, Chief Technology Officer, SOA Software. &ldquo;This provides companies with complete control over their API traffic without requiring a large internal infrastructure to support their developer community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This evolution of the API ecosystem makes sense, by providing the same set of social features available within both public and private communities as well as on-premise or cloud deployments it provides a very agile, business development environment for enterprises to take advantage of.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a full test drive of SOA&rsquo;s new platform, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen it posseses all the characteristics I&rsquo;ve seen with other API management providers, but also brings to the table important social and community layers that I think are essential to the future of APIs.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> &nbsp;I have consulted for SOA Software.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/US_white_house_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I came across this on the White House blog today, &ldquo;<a title="Request for Information on Public Access to Digital Data and Scientific Publications" href="http://m.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/07/request-information-public-access-digital-data-and-scientific-publications">Request for Information on Public Access to Digital Data and Scientific Publications</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The <a title="America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.5116:">America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010</a>, signed by President Obama earlier this year, calls upon OSTP to coordinate with agencies to develop policies that assure widespread public access to and long-term stewardship of the results of federally funded unclassified research. Towards that goal, OSTP last week released two Requests for Information (RFI) soliciting public input on long term preservation of and public access to the results of federally funded research, including digital data and peer-reviewed scholarly publications.</p>
<p>The White House is now seeking additional insight from "non-Federal stakeholders, including the public, universities, nonprofit and for-profit publishers, libraries, federally funded and non-federally funded research scientists, and other organizations and institutions with an interest in long- term stewardship and improved public access to the results of federally funded research".  Specifically the Working Group seeks further public comment on the questions listed below:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>What specific Federal policies would encourage public access to and the preservation of broadly valuable digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research, to grow the U.S. economy and improve the productivity of the American scientific enterprise?</li>
<li>What specific steps can be taken to protect the intellectual property interests of publishers, scientists, Federal agencies, and other stakeholders, with respect to any existing or proposed policies for encouraging public access to and preservation of digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research?</li>
<li>How could Federal agencies take into account inherent differences between scientific disciplines and different types of digital data when developing policies on the management of data?</li>
<li>How could agency policies consider differences in the relative costs and benefits of long-term stewardship and dissemination of different types of data resulting from federally funded research?</li>
<li>How can stakeholders (e.g., research communities, universities, research institutions, libraries, scientific publishers) best contribute to the implementation of data management plans?</li>
<li>How could funding mechanisms be improved to better address the real costs of preserving and making digital data accessible?</li>
<li>What approaches could agencies take to measure, verify, and improve compliance with Federal data stewardship and access policies for scientific research?</li>
How can the burden of compliance and verification be minimized?
<li>What additional steps could agencies take to stimulate innovative use of publicly accessible research data in new and existing markets and industries to create jobs and grow the economy?</li>
<li>What mechanisms could be developed to assure that those who produced the data are given appropriate attribution and credit when secondary results are reported?</li>
Standards for Interoperability, Re-Use and Re-Purposing
<li>What digital data standards would enable interoperability, reuse, and repurposing of digital scientific data?</li>
For example, MIAME (minimum information about a microarray experiment; see Brazma et al., 2001, Nature Genetics 29, 371) is an example of a community-driven data standards effort.
<li>What are other examples of standards development processes that were successful in producing effective standards and what characteristics of the process made these efforts successful?</li>
<li>How could Federal agencies promote effective coordination on digital data standards with other nations and international communities?</li>
<li>What policies, practices, and standards are needed to support linking between publications and associated data?</li>
</ol>
<p>As I was reading through these questions I can&rsquo;t help think about the <a title="API Service Provider Platforms" href="http://apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API service provider platforms</a> that I review on a regular basis, and how APIs can be employed for opening up this research.   Responses to this RFI will be accepted through January 12, 2012.  I&rsquo;m going to spend the holidays thinking about how APIs can best facilitate public access to this federally funded research, and I wanted to turn it into more discussion here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> and see what others have to say.</p>
<p>As I answer each question I&rsquo;m going to try and publish as separate blog post, feel free share your comments as I work through.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2011</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/US-Capitol-Building.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wrote a piece yesterday on the FCC Open Commission recent proposal to require that television stations make their &ldquo;public inspection file&rdquo; available online called, &ldquo;<a title="Opening Up Information is Not Enough, It Needs to Be Open" href="/2011/11/02/opening-up-information-is-not-enough,-its-needs-to-be-accessible/">Opening Up Information is Not Enough, Its Needs to be Accessible</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since writing I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how APIs can become a self-service tool in government regulation.  Here are my rough thoughts on the subject, completely un-polished.</p>
<p>When a government agency mandates that an industry provide some information, along with that request should come with a mandate on a standard for the data format and making it accessible via an API. &nbsp;Of course this could come with some sort of security layer, so not everything is immediately open, but the more open the better.</p>
<p>Along with the regulatory mandate the requesting agency could have some sort of aggregate tool for pull the requested data from each entities API, making available internally and externally as needed for other agencies, researchers or the general public.</p>
<p>This type of self-service, API driven, regulatory framework could force businesses and organizations within an industry to comply with necessary information requirements, reduce the overhead for the governing body to collect and organize the data, while also opening up the data, to allow the public and other industry groups to police and make sure companies are complying.</p>
<p>Seems like it could make the overall process around industry regulation more efficient, while putting the responsibility for policing on the public and other public interest groups, reducing the need for government enforcement that can often be bought.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Nov 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a title="Verizon Wireless" href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/index.html"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/verizon/verizon-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     According to PCMag.com, <a title="Verizon will publish an API that could allow consumers to turbocharge the network bandwidth" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395728,00.asp?kc=PCRSS05039TX1K0000762#fbid=r4tz9kBNC_8">Verizon will publish an API that could allow consumers to "turbocharge" the network bandwidth</a> on their smartphone, for a small fee.
</p>
<p>
     Developers could give users the option to pay for the extra bandwidth using a separate micro-transaction API, that Verizon Wireless is developing and hopes to have in place by the end of 2012.
</p>
<p>
     I understand that wireless networks are often congested. But isn’t allowing someone to pay money and circumvent that congestion, creating two separate Internets? A faster one for those that can afford it and a slower one for those that cannot?
</p>
<p>
     Would certain companies be able to offer users “turbocharge credits” when using their apps? So the Internet was faster, only when using the apps that could afford to buy its users attention.
</p>
<p>
     I am pleased to see <a title="Verizon Wireless" href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/index.html">Verizon Wireless</a> working on network optimization tools, but is this where we need to monetize the network? Seems like you could make the Internet fast for everyone and charge for other premium services.  You know, really innovate.
