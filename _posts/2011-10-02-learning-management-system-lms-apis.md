{% include JB/setup %}<p>At Mimeo I get approached by a lot of customers who use various learning management systems, and ask if they can print training and classroom materials from their LMS.I ask them the name of their LMS system, then set out to research what is possible.Ive researched almost 30 LMS systems so far (according to my notes), and Ive come across 3 that have APIs.Im in talks with a fourth, Schoology, that has an API as a premium feature, but information is limited and they are super busy with the new school year.Here are the three LMS platforms that Ive come across that have APIs: BrainHoney – A learning management system providing course authoring, learning objective management, and gradebook management Haiku Learning System – Learning management system providing website design and development, listserve hosting, assignment dropboxes, and more for teachers to take classrooms online Litmos – Litmos is a SCORM-certified, learning management system, that enables developers to connect their applications to the Litmos training engine, providing deeper integration of training data generated in Litmos with any other systems I find it pretty disturbing that only 3% of the learning management systems have APIs.</p>
