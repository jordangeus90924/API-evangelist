{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m playing around with my Twitter Advertising account, trying to understand Twitter’s path to monetization.The Twitter Advertising interface is pretty clean and simple, allowing me to promote my account or tweets in four easy steps.Step 1 - I can choose the locations where I want to reach users anywhere in the world, in specific countries only or in specific US cities: Step 2 - I can promote my Twitter account prominently in the who to follow section to users that are most likely to be interested in my account--I only pay for new followers that I gain: Step 3 - I can promote my Tweets, prominently displaying them to other users with similar interests: Step 4 - Then plug in my credit cards to pay for the ad spend I setup for my promoted account or tweets: Twitter Advertising is pretty straightforward.I wouldn’t call it anything revolutionary.But it is implemented simply, making it work for the masses.</p>
