        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/13/airmaps-api-enabled-digital-notice-and-awareness-system/">Airmap&#039;s API Enabled Digital Notice And Awareness System</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>I am spending time learning more about what <a href="https://www.airmap.com">Airmap</a> is doing with their <a href="https://www.airmap.com/stakeholders/">digital notice and awareness system</a>. I first <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/05/airmap-is-positioning-itself-to-be-a-critical-api-broker-for-the-drone-industry/">learned about what Airmap was up to when I learned they&nbsp;were behind the notifications of national parks, and forest fires</a> that displayed via the iPhone enabled radio controller for my <a href="https://www.dji.com/phantom-3-pro">DJI Phantom 3 Pro drone</a>. I found it to be a pretty slick way to&nbsp;notify me of issues with the drone, my radio signal, and the environment around me, so when I came back to civilization I set out researching more about what Airmap does, staying in tune with what they are up to ever since.</p>
<p>Now, Airmap's&nbsp;digital notice and awareness system caught my attention: <em>AirMap&rsquo;s Digital Notice &amp; Awareness System works by sending an encrypted digital flight notice from a drone operator to a secure airspace management dashboard accessible by airspace authorities. </em>Moving this beyond just the drone operator getting notifications about device or environmental conditions based upon my latitude, longitude, and elevation. This system allows for an event driven notification system to be put in place between drone operator(s) and the cloud, modeling an airplane flight control system, but for the drone universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.airmap.com/stakeholders/"><img style="padding: 3px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_12_at_5.33.25_pm.png" alt="" width="98%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>For me, this is just one possible control system for drones--a cloud, mobile, and device based flight control system. I'm thinking about movie production, agricultural, mining, disaster, and many other types of control systems.<a href="https://developers.airmap.com/"> Airmap&nbsp;provides you with some of the APIs you will need to develop a drone platform and/or application(s) that will deliver in these areas</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.airmap.com/reference#status-api-overview">Status API</a></strong> - Provide nearby airspace information, including advisories, and notice requirements.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.airmap.com/reference#airspace-api-overview">Airspace API</a></strong> - Interact with the surrounding airspace including its obstacles, rules, and requirements.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.airmap.com/reference#flight-api-overview">Flight API</a></strong> - Create and query flights, verify a pilot meets flight requirements, and provide digital notice.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.airmap.com/reference#pilot-api-overview">Pilot API</a></strong> - Manage a pilot's profile, preferences, and provide identity verification.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.airmap.com/reference#aircraft-api-overview">Aircraft API</a></strong> - Information about drone manufacturers, models, and metadata.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.airmap.com/reference#vector-tiles">Maps</a></strong> - Provides a TileJSON spec map style for use with MapBox GL.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm taking these APIs and including them in my drone API research. Next, I'm taking what I've learned about machine learning and API enabled cloud pipelines and get to working mapping out some of the common blueprints for video production pipelines, and data processing workflows. I am looking to identify some common ways that AWS and Google cloud infrastructure can be seamlessly mapped to Airmap, and other drone enablement solutions--providing the next generation digital notice and awareness systems like Airmap is doing.</p>
<p>I am enjoying staying in tune where Airmap is headed with their platform. They have identified a very interesting and important layer to the emerging world of drones. Providing the API for tracking for airspace, aircraft, pilots, and their flights is a super smart approach to providing APIs, as well as leading the charge when it comes to information, advisories, and notices in the real world where drones are operating. This space fascinates me, as well as the production, and post-production API enablement when it comes to processing the video, images, and data these fascinating devices generate.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2017</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-connect-the-dots.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I spend a lot of time connecting the dots with APIs, trying to understand what resources are available via an API, and then how I can actually put them to use. I can usually land the documentation page of an API, and be up to speed about what resources are available, and have a basic level of understanding of how I can put the APIs to work withing 15 minutes--if the API is reasonably designed, and somewhat documented. Where things get tougher for meÂ and require much heavier of a cognitive load, is going from the basicsÂ to understanding what is possible when you can really connect the dots between all the APIs a provider makes available.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/27/an-example-of-an-api-service-provider-using-hypermedia/">While I was profiling, and learning more about the AWS API Gateway</a>, which is an API that let's you deploy and manage your APIs, I found that their usage of the hypermedia format HAL, significantly contributed to me going from basicsÂ to aÂ better understanding the big picture, and what is possible at scale. Each API path I learned about gave me a wealth of links describing what was possible next, providing details on what I should be doing next, perpetually introducing and teaching me about what is possible with the AWS API Gateway.</p>
<p>I am hyper aware of the cost of getting up and running using an API. As a one person shop, reviewing thousands of APIs, my time is precious. I've looked at all of the AWS APIs, and it's easy to get a basic understanding of the resources available with their classic action= approach, but I rarely ever see the big picture of what is possible with the API. After spending the same amount of time in the AWS Gateway API as I would have spent learning any of the other AWS APIs, I found that I had a much greater understanding of what was possible, due to the presence of the hypermedia design pattern.</p>
<p>Hypermedia provides a much more complete story for me, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/18/a-more-honest-and-flexible-api-contract-using-hypermedia/">as well as offering up a much more honest approach to supporting the API</a>. It doesn't just provide me with documentation of available API resources, it connects the dots for me, showing me what is possible. In this scenario, it is an API deployment and management API, so while I'm learning about the API, I'm also being introduced toÂ new API deployment and management concepts along the way. We shouldn't assume that all of our consumers will be able to connect the dots, we should be providing them withÂ a more complete story of what is possible with the API design patterns we choose.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-toolbox.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm learning a lot about HTTP/2 and gRPC this week, so I have been thinking about how we isolate ourselves by focusing in on individual toolsets, where we should really be expanding our horizons, helping ensure we have the most robust and diverse API toolbox we possibly can. Depending on what part of the tech universe an engineer comes from they'll have a different view on just exactly what I mean when I say API to them.</p>
<p>The most common perspective that people respond with is REST. Folks automatically think this is what I mean when I say API--it isn't. That is your dogma&nbsp;or your gullibility to other people's dogma--please expand your horizons. When I say APIs, I mean an application programming interface that leverages web technology (aka HTTP, HTTP/2). Sure REST is the dominating philosophy in this discussion, but I see no benefit in limiting ourselves in this fashion--I see API as a toolbox, with the following toolsets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REST</strong> - Considering Roy Fielding's&nbsp;guidance when it comes to leveraging HTTP in my API design.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong> - Considering the web, and the role that links can play in your API design.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong> - Helping keep APIs a two-way street, expanding your API to respond to events not just single requests.</li>
<li><strong>GraphQL</strong> - Helping put powerful query tooling in the hands of API consumers when working with large and complex datasets.</li>
<li><strong>gRPC</strong> - Acknowledging that the HTTP protocol is evolving, and our API contract can evolve along with the specification.</li>
</ul>
<p>This represents the major toolsets that are currently in my API toolbox. Sure there are a number of other individual tools and specifications in there as well, but this represents the top tier toolsets I am looking at when it comes to getting things done. In my opinion, there is a time and place for each of these toolsets to be put to use. I can easily geek out on any of these areas, but because I'm not selling you a product or service, I'm more interested in finding the right tool for the situation.</p>
<p>I do not expect that all providers have this robust of API toolbox from day one--it is something that will come with time. My recommendation is everyone begins with REST, developing proficiency in this domain, while you are also learning about hypermedia webhooks. As your understanding evolves, then you should start looking at GraphQL, gRPC, and other more advanced approaches to round off your skills. Do not let your religious technological beliefs or any single vendor motivations limit the scope of your API toolbox, you should be working to make it as robust and diverse as you possibly can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/managing_grpc_apis_with_google_cloud_endpoints_3_638.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have been learning more about the way Google designs and defines their APIs after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/03/google-shares-their-api-design-guide/">their release of their API design guide</a>. When I research a company's APIs I always spend time looking through their Github repositories for anything interesting, and while poking around in Google's I found a repository of "<a href="https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis">interface definitions for a small (but growing) set of Google APIs</a>". I keep track of any Github repo I find containing API definitions, but Google's repo stood out because it contained a set of API definitions that covered both APIs that support both REST and gRPC.</p>
<p>Straight from the Github repo, they support two ways of access APIs: <em>"Google APIs use&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">Protocol Buffers</a>&nbsp;version 3 (proto3) as their Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface and the structure of the payload messages. The same interface definition is used for both REST and RPC versions of the API, which can be accessed over different wire protocols."</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>JSON over HTTP: You can access Google APIs directly using JSON over HTTP, using&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-libraries">Google API client libraries&nbsp;</a>or third-party API client libraries.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Protocol Buffers over gRPC: You can access Google APIs published in this repository through&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/grpc">GRPC</a>, which is a high-performance binary RPC protocol over HTTP/2. It offers many useful features, including request/response multiplex and full-duplex streaming.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the first example of this I've seen in the wild, and it feels like we are shifting from an HTTP to an HTTP/2&nbsp;API world. I don't think regular old REST or web APIs are going anywhere, I think they'll continue to be a staple, but it looks like Google is laying the groundwork for two-speed APIs, that are defined using a common API definition--you pick the speed you need. I've been hearing tales of gRPC usage for a while and seeing more APIs defined using protocol buffers, but Google's approach signals a wider more significant shift for me.</p>
<p>I'm still learning about gRPC, so I can't quite visualize the overlap between&nbsp;gRPC and REST quite yet. I'm going through their API definitions because they provide an interesting snapshot of the surface area of these hybrid APIs. As I spend my week in San Francisco for Google Next, I'm eager to learn more about their evolving approach to designing and defining APIs--something that I think will be setting the tone for API design at scale in the near future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_onion.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I read a lot of content about APIs. I read a lot of redundant and fluffy marketing and technical jargon, trying to understand exactly what an API does, or doesn't do. Before I criticize, I have to admit that crafting really good API marketing and documentation is hard. Only about 5% of what I read is good, a significant portion is just incomplete and lazily done by someone who doesn't care--the rest is actually incorrect, misleading, and straight up hype.</p>
<p>There are three layers to the API hype onion in my experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing - </strong>The fluff on the main page written by the marketing team who usually doesn't care about the API and has taken the time to get to know what it does.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation - </strong>The technical fluff in the API portal usually written by someone technical, and not quite possessing the skills to talk to humans, let alone coherently explain something to another human being.</li>
<li><strong>API -</strong> The actual naming, ordering, parameters, and overall request and response structure for an API that actually accomplishes something--it may not always accomplish exactly what I'm looking for, but at least it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I still read marketing&nbsp;and documentation, because they provide me with clues about the intent behind API operations, when I actually want the honest take of what an API does, I always go straight to the API and get to work making API calls. This is a problem that is only increasing as we enter into the artificial intelligence and machine learning hype phase.</p>
<p>After you finish writing the marketing, documentation, and have your API up and running--step back, and re-read everything, and think about the synchronicity between these three areas of your operations. It takes a lot of practice&nbsp;and hard work to do right, but I think if you just take a moment, step back, and think about these layers to how you articulate what your APIs does--you will immediately find yourself in a better position to communicate what it is you are trying to accomplish to a much wider audience.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-version.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I always enjoy learning about how companies are versioning their APIs. The topic is always one of the most discussed areas when we do APIStrat workshops, and is an aspect of the API space that I think there is never a 100% right way of doing things. Making it an area I recommend learning as many different approaches as you can, then decide on the right solution for your particular situation.</p>
<p>To help you in your journey, and mine, I try to document any official versioning strategies published by API providers I research. Today I have one from Google, providing some very interesting insight into how they version their APIs. Google uses&nbsp;<a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, which follows this approach to each version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, incrementing the:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>MAJOR</code>&nbsp;version when you make incompatible API changes,</li>
<li><code>MINOR</code>&nbsp;version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner,</li>
<li><code>PATCH</code>&nbsp;version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to their REST APIs Google puts the version in URL, and I'm still learning more about their approach to how it's applied to the proto package for gRPC APIs. They also have some good advice when it comes to what is breaking and non-breaking changes.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-broken-gears.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Backwards-compatible (non-breaking) changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding an API interface to an API service definition</li>
<li>Adding a method to an API interface</li>
<li>Adding an HTTP binding to a method</li>
<li>Adding a field to a request message</li>
<li>Adding a field to a response message</li>
<li>Adding a value to an enum</li>
<li>Adding an output-only resource field</li>
</ul>
<p>Backwards-incompatible (breaking) changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing or renaming a service, field, method or enum value</li>
<li>Changing an HTTP binding</li>
<li>Changing the type of a field</li>
<li>Changing a resource name format</li>
<li>Changing visible behavior of existing requests</li>
<li>Changing the URL format in the HTTP definition</li>
<li>Adding a read/write field to a resource message</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/versioning">This Google API versioning advice comes from their API design guide</a>. I also f<a href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/versioning-an-api">ound some versioning advice from them as part of the Google Cloud Endpoints documentation</a>, which provides some easier to follow advice for REST APIs. It also includes some advice for handling as part of your OpenAPI definition, something I will be investigating further.</p>
<p>I am just looking to add semantic versioning approach, the example of putting the version in the URL, and the advice on backwards-compatibility to my API research. It helps me keep my work full of healthy examples, and URL references to how specific API providers are documenting their own APIs, as well as offering guidance to customers who are using their services to design, deploy, and manage their APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/09/from-awareness-observability-to-api-ratings/">From Awareness, Observability, To API Ratings</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>This is the third post in my effort to try and define the three sides of my API monitoring. I'm trying to quantify what is needed as a sort of API industry monitoring dashboard -- if there is such a thing. To help me think through this, I have taken my approach to monitoring the API space and I'm breaking them up into three buckets <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/16/trying-to-define-api-awareness/">API awareness</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/a-checklist-for-api-observability/">API observability</a>, and now API ratings. While the three areas share many common characteristics, the motivations behind each area are significantly different--enough so, I want to look at them and evolve them separately.</p>
<p>A rating system for the API space is something I usually get one or two requests to discuss each quarter, sustained throughout the year. I have very different actors approaching me to solve this, from hedge fund managers, to venture capital managers, to startups and enterprise organizations. Everyone (except one) who has approached me to date has been woefully unaware of the scope of doing something like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">creating a Standard and Poors or Moody's for the API economy</a>, which is always a red flag for me when it comes to understanding their motivations.</p>
<p>I do not have the resources to develop an API ranking system on my own, and I have no desire to exclusively own such a thing--it needs to be an open, community driven thing. However, I do have interest it trying to define possible algorithms for such a ranking system, derived from the approach I've developed for myself. I am driving this work from <a href="http://apievangelist.com">a master dump of my research,</a> and the approach I have used to track on in the world of APIs since 2010--an analyst 100K view, and here is what I'm considering...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery -&nbsp;</strong>If we are rating APIs, they need to be discoverable, and accessible--if you can't find them, understand what they do, and kick the tires--you really can't rate something. How many APIs? What is churn?

<li><strong>Embeddable</strong>&nbsp;- What embeddable tooling are available for either working with individual APIs, or across collections of APIs, providing solutions that can be embedded within any website, or application.</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong>&nbsp;- What integration platform as a service (iPaaS), continuous integration, and other orchestration solutions are available for helping to make sense of API operations within this world.</li>
<li><strong>Deprecation</strong>&nbsp;- What deprecation notices are on the horizon for APIs, applications, SDKs, and other elements of API operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use data and make gut-level decisions from these areas across my monitoring of the space. Some of these signals are directly within the control of API providers, while others are more in control of their consumers, and the wider public. Many of these signals depend on a company, organization, institutions, and government agencies being public with their API operations. I just can't know about and measure private, internal APIs, without some sort of observability into their operations.</p>
<p>The most obvious areas for measuring the quality of API providers have been based on the&nbsp;number of users, or the&nbsp;number of API calls, which are both completely within the control of the API provider to report, or not to report. My approach to rating APIs is dependent on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/16/trying-to-define-api-awareness/">my API awareness</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/a-checklist-for-api-observability/">the API observability</a> of each API&nbsp;provider. This is why I am working my way through these three levels, trying to take another look at how to distil down what I do into a set of metrics that can be used to establish some sort of rating for each provider.</p>
<p>I actually have metrics in place for about 25% of this list, and I know other API service providers who have an additional 10% of this, but really there is a pretty big opportunity out there right now for an organization (or organizations) to step up in the area of API ratings. The challenge is going to be about how you are going to keep the money from influencing the rating system, or I guess to be as transparent as possible in how you take money from the people you are rating, and how the process works. Let me know if you want to talk about in detail, I'm looking to stimulate this conversation further in 2017.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>I just wanted to take a moment and highlight some folks who are doing interesting things with APIs. I spend a lot of time focusing on the companies, products, and services from&nbsp;the sector, but I don't talk a lot about individual people. So I wanted to pause for a moment and just highlight a couple of people doing really interesting things with APIs right now.</p>
<p>If have been paying attention to API definitions in the last year, then you probably have come across APIs.guru, <a href="https://apis.guru/openapi-directory/">the Wikipedia for APIs</a>. They have 244 OpenAPI definitions available in their catalog, which&nbsp;is the most comprehensive directory of machine readable API definitions out there. If you have an OpenAPI for your API you should be <a href="https://apis.guru/browse-apis/">publishing it to APIs.guru</a>. if you don't, you should be creating one, and then publishing it to APIs.guru.</p>
<p>Here are the hardworking, API-savvy folks behind APIs.guru:</p>

<p>I am in the middle of a project where I am building on the work these two have invested in with APIs.guru. I'm hoping that with the next wave of this work, I'll have some complete API definitions I can contribute to APIs.guru. I encourage you to make sure your API definitions are published to the directory so that other people like me can include your APIs in our work.</p>
<p class="p2">Beyond the APIs.guru directory, <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory">I recommend checking out their Github repository, as they are doing some interesting things with GraphQL</a>. If you need help crafting an API definition for your API platform, or in need of other API advice, I recommend messaging the APIs.guru team. I'm sure they'd be happy to talk to you, and see where they can help you with your API efforts.</p>

<p><em>This is an outline I pulled together for a potential project I am working on this week. It's derived from my research, and previous workshops I've done with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies in the past. I wanted to share here, in hopes it would stimulate API-focused conversations with some interesting folks.</em></p>
<p>I put together a framework to guide a full day discussion between us, which will leave you with a greater awareness of what an API focus can bring to your company, and leave you with a strategy that you could apply to your API operations back home. This framework is assembled from the last seven years of monitoring the API practices of leading companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others, but tailored to meet the needs of a retail and digital commerce focused company. I don't expect you to digest everything here in a single reading, it is the complete list of building blocks which we will move around, and organize in a guide for you to take back with you.</p>
<p><strong>API 101<br /></strong>I wanted to start with the basics&nbsp;and help provide you and your organization grasp the fundamental concepts of why having an API focus is important to doing business in 2017. It is important that all stakeholders have a base level awareness of the what and why of APIs are, as well as the technical, business, and legal implications of API operations. Here is an outline for our discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What Is API?&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss your overall web strategy, and discuss how your API operations will augment, complement, and extend your web presence.</li>
<li><strong>Why do API?&nbsp;</strong>- Cover why APIs will help you deliver to web and mobile, as well as bring more flexibility in any&nbsp;system to system integrations internally, and with your partners.</li>
<li><strong>API Consumption</strong>&nbsp;- Talk about the current and future consumption of 3rd party APIs&nbsp;and from trusted partners, as well as thoughts about internal usage.</li>
<li><strong>Providing APIs&nbsp;</strong>- Talk about the overall world of providing APIs, alongside your existing web and mobile application development.</li>
<li><strong>The Technology of APIs</strong>&nbsp;- Briefly talk about the technological building blocks of providing and consuming APIs, without getting too much into the weeds.</li>
<li><strong>The Business of APIs&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the nuances of how APIs are being monetized when it comes to retail and products, as well as approaches to data, and other resources.</li>
<li><strong>The Politics of APIs&nbsp;</strong>- Makes sure to highlight many of common legal, privacy, security, transparency, and other political aspects of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>API Operations&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the final product of our gathering, assembling a strategy for your API operations that can be implemented in phases, and growing with successes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we dive into the details of modern API operations I want to make sure we have a solid base for understanding why your company should be investing APIs. Then we can talk about what else will be needed to do this successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions<br /></strong>Before we get started, let's define the building blocks of doing APIs, starting with the high-level objectives of why your company is looking to do APIs. Then we will move from the 100K level, and identify some of the common building blocks we'll use to define API operations across all the working areas below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectives&nbsp;</strong>- Get to work defining the primary objectives of your&nbsp;company-wide API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Web Concepts&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the core elements of the web, and how they are reused for APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Web Standards</strong>&nbsp;- Walk through a handful of the common standards employed as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Data Schema</strong>&nbsp;- Talk about how data is defined, managed, shared, and monetized using APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Definitions</strong>&nbsp;- Introduce you to common ways in which APIs are being defined and communicated around.</li>
<li><strong>Access Scopes</strong>&nbsp;- Talk through the myriad of ways in which data, content, and other resources are accessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these areas touch on&nbsp;and will guide our discussions throughout the day. The definitions will guide our conversation, and then also become a core outline for governing API operations at every stage of its development--defining the design, deployment, management, and every other area of operations.</p>
<p><strong>Design<br /></strong>A design first strategy is needed to achieve consistency, and maturity before we enter the more costly phases of development and deployment. There are many common approaches to API design on the web, and these are the common areas I'd like to discuss as part of your operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best Practices&nbsp;</strong>- Walk through some of the best practices of API design, and the common approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Requests /&nbsp;</strong><strong>Response</strong>&nbsp;- Talk through the common patterns of how API requests are made, and what responses look like.</li>
<li><strong>Errors&nbsp;</strong>- Think briefly about error handling, and how this feeds into overall stability strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Media Types&nbsp;</strong>- Talk about the common media types in play, starting with HTML, and moving into common API patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong>&nbsp;- Move into a more detailed discussion around hypermedia, and how it impacts design.</li>
<li><strong>Schema&nbsp;</strong>- Take the building blocks in the definition discussion, and talk about how they'll be applied as part of design.</li>
<li><strong>Standards&nbsp;</strong>- Walk through some of the common standards that will be applied, such as dates, currencies, and other standards.</li>
<li><strong>Resources&nbsp;</strong>- Talk more about the types of resources that will be in play, and what actions can be taken using these resources.</li>
<li><strong>Process&nbsp;</strong>- What does the full process of API design look like, across all APIs being deployed and managed.</li>
<li><strong>Organization&nbsp;</strong>- How are tooling, practices, knowledge, and process stored, shared, and implemented as part of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Internationalization</strong>&nbsp;- What international considerations are there regarding the overall design of the API its design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your API design strategy will evolve and mature with time, but setting a healthy base for operations will help set a tone for API operations. How you design your API resources, will affect how they speak to your partners&nbsp;as well as 3rd party developers, and contribute to the overall success or failure of internal and external API consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Versioning<br /></strong>I want to discuss the high level of how things will evolve across API operations. Your web and IT development already have established cycles&nbsp;and workflows. How will these apply to API operations, and what are the key considerations when it comes to API versioning, and all applications that consume them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Versioning&nbsp;</strong>- How will APIs&nbsp;and their supporting operations be versioned, from design to deprecation?</li>
<li><strong>Communication&nbsp;</strong>- What are the communication considerations around API versioning and changes?</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia -</strong>&nbsp;Consider hypermedia design practices, and their contribution to the versioning of APIs, and the applications that are integrated.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is necessary to discuss versioning in a technical and business sense. Better understanding how things will change and evolve, and being truthful and honest about how this change impacts operations, integrations, and each application that touches API operations.</p>
<p><strong>DNS<br /></strong>You already have DNS in place for your web operations. We will be taking a look at what is in place, as well as discuss the front line for API operations. DNS provides the base URL for API access, as well as human access for the overall API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain(s)&nbsp;</strong>- What domains are required for the API, portal, and other supporting elements of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved with setup and management of the DNS for API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>&nbsp;- How is DNS stability considered, and managed,&nbsp;ensuring resources remain available.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is already DNS infrastructure in place, this is a discussion around what is required to deliver and support API operations. As with the web, DNS is the frontline for the&nbsp;presence of the API operations, and we need a snapshot of the role it will play in API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Data<br /></strong>I would like to learn more about all of the data sources for your operations. Where is data stored? Where does it come from? What is the complete picture when it comes to data and content accessibility?&nbsp;We can cover a handful of areas to help paint a picture of what is currently&nbsp;behind&nbsp;operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platforms&nbsp;</strong>- What internal,&nbsp;partner and 3rd party platforms, software, and data solutions are in place, or being considered for the next phase.</li>
<li><strong>Files -&nbsp;</strong>What is a general look at how data and content&nbsp;are&nbsp;accessed in a raw file format, considering spreadsheets, XML, CSV, and many other common formats.</li>
<li><strong>Process -</strong>&nbsp;What is a general look at your overall data acquisition, normalization, development, and production&nbsp;life cycle&nbsp;-- how is data currently flowing inside and outside the firewall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all APIs will be about delivering data, but a significant portion of APIs will be data or content driven from a myriad of sources. I need an honest perspective of the data landscape behind. Opening up APIs shouldn't just expose everything behind, it should be thoughtfully composed, providing the best possible view of the database backend.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment<br /></strong>Next up is the actual deployment of APIs. Discussing how APIs are deployed, building from the database backend that is available, and moving forward to look at many of the common ways APIs are being deployed today. These are some of the common areas we'll discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Database&nbsp;</strong>- Taking the database snapshot, and building on the current data connectivity in place, and drive a sensible web API facade.</li>
<li><strong>Code&nbsp;</strong>- Considering the code required to drive APIs, providing the business logic behind each resource, allowing interaction with data, content, and algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Gateway</strong>&nbsp;- What are the current gateways are in place, proxying, and providing access to existing systems, starting with databases, but also other systems.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud&nbsp;</strong>- Moving the discussion into the cloud, and talking about what cloud infrastructure is in place, or being considered as part of future API operations.</li>
<li><strong>On-Premise</strong>&nbsp;- How much of the operations are in the cloud vs. on premise? What are the short and long-term strategies for managing API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Serverless&nbsp;</strong>- How decoupled and modular are existing&nbsp;compute resource across the company? Are looking at or discussing a serverless approach to delivering APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>These areas represent the current API deployment stack, providing the framework for our discussion when it comes to publishing APIs. How you are currently deploying web infrastructure will significantly impact this discussion. However, I'd like to also introduce you to other approaches to deploying APIs, so that you can consider the future of your web and API infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Environment / Virtualization<br /></strong>APIs are rarely deployed directly into a production environment. Leading approaches to API deployment involve a variety of virtualization techniques for underlying infrastructure, the APIs themselves, and possibly even the data, and content they serve up. These environments will provide solutions to mock, simulate, conduct quality assurance, production, and other approaches to staging API deployment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the need for mocking API resources, allowing resources to be designed and tested before costly development begins.</li>
<li><strong>Data&nbsp;</strong>- What needs are there around testing, simulating, and virtualizing data and content across API consumption to support development and production environments.</li>
<li><strong>Containers&nbsp;</strong>- Are there any containerization and virtualization efforts underway, starting with cloud practices, but also focusing on Docker and other leading approaches to isolating deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Environment&nbsp;</strong>- What are the needs for staging, sandbox, as well as production environments? Let's think about a variety of environments beyond just a single production environment.</li>
<li><strong>Import / Export&nbsp;</strong>- What import and export capabilities will be in place to help support the ephemeral nature of virtualized environments, templates, and other enablers of virtualization.</li>
</ul>
<p>This are might seem like a nice to have a category,&nbsp;but in reality, API and data virtualization can significantly lower the cost of deployment and management&nbsp;and rapidly increasing the rate of maturation of API resources. Different APIs will have varying virtualization needs, let's consider what is needed, based upon your goals with API enablement.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication<br /></strong>Let's take a quick look at what is needed regarding platform authentication. Looking at internal and partner needs first, but then also considering the 3rd party, and authentication using popular social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or even Github for developers and more technical user.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- What does authentication look like for internal systems and existing applications? Provide some discussion on common concerns, needs, and benefits of the authentication layer of API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Approaches</strong>&nbsp;- Let's walk through some of the common approaches, to making 100% publicly available, all the way to very granular level authorization and access with OAuth--allowing for fine-grained authorization and access at the user and API resource levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a common toolbox for enterprise applications. There is also a common set of authentication practices for web APIs. The goal of our conversation will be to set a baseline for this overlap between what you currently have, and what will be needed to deliver API resources across web, mobile, and device applications, in as frictionless a way as possible.</p>
<p><strong>A Portal&nbsp;</strong><br />Where will internal, partner, and public users find API resources? It is common to have a central portal to find all APIs and supporting resources can be found. Providing a focused presence and voice for an API, encouraging the awareness and usage of common APIs across company operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public / Private&nbsp;</strong>- Who will be served by a portal? Will there be separate portals for internal, or partner operations? What is the relationship between portals?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>&nbsp;- Let's talk about the target audience for portals. Who will be stumbling across them, and who will be regular visitors, making it a community thing.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Portals</strong>&nbsp;- What are the pros and cons of a single, focused portal vs. a variety of portal serving different audiences, and providing a variety level of security.</li>
</ul>
<p>Portals can be permanent, or ephemeral. They can exist in the cloud, on-premise, or on devices. Portals can act like a retail storefront, providing a permanent or tempory snapshot of resources available across the entire platform, in support of a single project or event. Regardless of the objectives, a portal provides a single doorway into API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Management<br /></strong>Next, let's walk through the management of API operations. Focusing on what it takes to manage the intersection of providing and consuming APIs. How will engagement be documented, managed, measured, and provide a wholesale representation of the companies existing platform, brand, and presence?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Onboarding&nbsp;</strong>- What does onboarding look like for the platform. Once onboard, what happens next? How are users engaged, challenged, and verified?</li>
<li><strong>Developer Account(s)&nbsp;</strong>- What resources are available to developers and consumers to help them manage their account, applications, access, and consumption of resources?</li>
<li><strong>Internationalization&nbsp;</strong>- APIs augment your web presence. What are the international efforts already in place, and what are the considerations for API efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Corporate&nbsp;</strong>- What is the corporate presence within the API operations, and how do management reach across the corporate environment, locations, and brand.</li>
<li><strong>API -&nbsp;</strong>What APIs should be present to help access and manage API operations. Every aspect of API operations should be controlled via APIs, adding another dimension to operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Management doesn't stop here. Each of the following areas will play a role in the management of the platform and have a place in the portal. The goal of API management is to provide a scalable, measurable, observable layer for efficiently managing the technical and&nbsp;business intersection that APIs open up.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started<br /></strong>First impressions are everything. Let's take the onboarding discussion, and think about it from a consumer's perspective, and establish exactly the right experience for new, as well as existing users. A little bit of discussion ahead of time around what it takes to get started can go a long way.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- Let's think through the big picture of getting started for internal and partner users, then discuss any other potential consumers from the media to application developers.</li>
<li><strong>Steps&nbsp;</strong>- What are the steps involved with getting started with integration? What approval steps required? Where can we reduce friction, and encourage new and existing users to do more?</li>
<li><strong>Targets&nbsp;</strong>- Who are we targeting with this process? Are there different steps, and objectives for different users. Are there users who won't actually be building applications, but just encouraging and supporting other consumers?</li>
<li><strong>FAQ&nbsp;</strong>- Let's address some of the questions developers will have with getting started. Let's discuss a way to plug the FAQ into the overall feedback loop, keeping it a growing and evolving list that represents the evolution of API operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is common to launch an API and think only technical people will be accessing it. In reality, an API should speak to technical, as well as non-technical users. You never know who will be researching your API for a story, creating the curriculum for a university class, or other use that hadn't occurred to you. APIs aren't just for developers--anyone should be able to get started without too much friction.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation<br /></strong>The next step in getting started is always about visiting documentation for an API. API documentation provides the next step after the marketing and advertising that directed a consumer to an API. Let's explore what should be available to ensure all users quickly get up to speed on the details of what an API does or doesn't do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>&nbsp;- What documentation is required for each available API? Let's talk about common approaches to delivering interactive documentation using API definitions and schema, ensuring there is always up to date documentation available for the entire platform.</li>
<li><strong>Solutions&nbsp;</strong>- Documentation should just be about the API resources available, they should also be about the solutions they provide. Sharing case studies, showcasing applications, and helping consumers understand the opportunities available through integration partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Errors&nbsp;</strong>- Don't just document what a platform does. Let's talk about what an API platform does when it fails. What are the boundaries, and limitations of a platform, helping consumers develop more resilient applications?</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation is always identified as the number one pain point for developers when it comes to putting APIs to work in web, mobile, and device applications. I will walk you through the advancements made in the area of documentation, minimizing it as a pain point for both API providers and consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Software Development Kits (SDK)<br /></strong>It is common for API providers to provide a variety of language and platform development kits for consumers to put to use. Web APIs are language and platform agnostic and can be consumed in any programming language. There are some common aspects of delivering and management code as part of API operations--let's look at some of the common areas:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- What is the overall tone of code for a platform. Is there a heavy lead for development internally, is it partner driven, or will it be more of a community effort? There are plenty of approaches to managing and delivering code in support of API integration.</li>
<li><strong>Language Samples&nbsp;</strong>- Starting with the samples, many providers offer up simple, standalone code samples in a variety of programming languages, giving only what is needed for making and handling of a single request.</li>
<li><strong>Language SDKs&nbsp;</strong>- Additionally more mature providers also offer up complete software development kits that help developers with authentication, as well as working on all available API paths.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile SDKs</strong>&nbsp;- Beyond language SDKs, some API providers focus on mobile SDKs helping consumers deliver iPhone, Android, and Windows applications using API resources.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Code Management&nbsp;</strong>- A discussion about where the code is managed. The common approach is to use Github, which provides the resources for managing code but done in a social way that also allows continued engagement with consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Development Kits (PDK)&nbsp;</strong>- What platform integrations needs will there be? Is there the need or desire to provide WordPress, SalesForce, AWS, Heroku, Facebook, or other existing platform integration.</li>
<li><strong>Single Page Applications (SPA)</strong>&nbsp;- Will there be single page application libraries and scaffolding available for API consumers to use as a start for delivering storefronts, and other deliverables?</li>
<li><strong>Browser Development Kits (BDK)</strong>&nbsp;- What browser add-on toolkits will be needed to help developers better integrate with the browser, providing a different experience for end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery&nbsp;</strong>- How are SDKs discovered, made available, and showcased as part of API operations, making sure standardized, approved resources are put to use as often as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where APIs really shine, providing a variety of openly licensed or even premium resources for API consumers and developers to put to use. When you look at the leading pioneers in the space like Amazon, SalesFroce, and Google, they all have a wealth of existing code resources, helping to go from idea to integration as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Support<br /></strong>Let's talk about supporting API operations. Providing the necessary technical and business support that individuals, companies&nbsp;and any consumer will need when working with APIs in their integration or application--a successful API has a wealth of support resources that scale with the demand.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- What support resources are available? There should be a variety of channels, as well as dedicated human resources to providing timely, and information support when developers need it.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Support&nbsp;</strong>- It is common for APIs to provide a variety of self-service support like forums, and knowledge bases, allowing consumers to find answers to their questions 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without directly contacting platform support.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Support&nbsp;</strong>- In addition to a variety of self-service support elements, there should be a handful of direct support channels like email, phone, chat, or a ticketing system.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with other areas of IT and web operations, API support will overlap with existing services. However, because of the technical nature of API integration, support should include a heightened level of technical expertise, understanding the challenges of API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Communication<br /></strong>Complimenting support, let's talk about the communication strategy for API operations. This should overlap with existing communication efforts, but if the resources are available, it can be beneficial to have a dedicated API operations strategy and presence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Channels&nbsp;</strong>- Which channels are used? Blog, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Github, Youtube, and other leading platforms should all be considered for an APIs presence.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy</strong>&nbsp;- I walk you through the common elements of a communication strategy, highlighting what an API can do, what people are doing with the resources, as well as other platform activity, providing a common heartbeat for API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Process&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about the execution of the communication strategy. What resources are available, how can it be grown over time, and possibly involve community efforts, encouraging passionate consumers to help communicate the platform message?</li>
</ul>
<p>This can dovetail with existing communication but needs to possess a focused message that speaks to a more technical audience. It helps to provide separate channels dedicated to a developer message, but take advantage of cross-pollination between mainstream and API operational efforts, keeping a message in alignment, and increasing the reach.</p>
<p><strong>Road Map / Issues / Change Log&nbsp;<br /></strong>One of the benefits of doing APIs is that they can help deal with change and shifts in the development process easier. There are many common ways in which an API helps address change, and evolution, something that is integrated with support, and communication efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved internally with road map planning, dealing with issues that arise, and the historical tracking of changes--including communication.</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved externally with&nbsp;road map&nbsp;planning, dealing with issues that arise, and the historical tracking of change--including communication.</li>
<li><strong>Process&nbsp;</strong>- What process is involved with change management, and the approval of the roadmap, and establishing of the schedule and timeline<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Communications&nbsp;</strong>- How and when are changes communicated? How transparent is the platform when it comes to issues? How is change communicated?</li>
</ul>
<p>Change management is essential to address change for not just the platform, but the many distributed applications and integrations that depend on APIs. Clarity, transparency, and communication in this area will potentially make or break a platform, determining the success of the platform, as well as partners.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring / Testing / Performance<br /></strong>Let's spend some time talking about the monitoring of API operations, their availability, performance, and assessment of whether or not they are meeting their intended objectives. Some of this will already be in place with web efforts but will need a unique set of considerations when it comes to API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management&nbsp;</strong>- How are monitoring and testing set up? What is measured, and how is it reported and communicated across operations.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted&nbsp;</strong>- What does targeted testing and monitoring look like providing regional and international coverage for all testing and monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Status&nbsp;</strong>- How is the status of operations presented, giving a single external dashboard for consumers to see the current and historical status of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Notification&nbsp;</strong>- Who is notified when there are monitoring, testing, and performance concerns, providing a hierarchy or notifications about changes.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong>&nbsp;- How are results included in internal, and partner reporting, and part of service level agreements and partner contracts for API access.</li>
<li><strong>3rd Party&nbsp;</strong>- Is there monitoring of third party providers in place, allowing for an understanding of how reliable the 3rd party services being consumed are.</li>
</ul>
<p>This are of API operations will help us understand how well we are doing executing the strategy, and meeting internal and partner expectations. Monitoring and testing should be executed as part of every API deployed, led by development groups, but should include business unit, and partner stakeholders in the conversation, notification, and discussions about changes to monitoring and testing efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability<br /></strong>Let's talk about the reliability of the platform, and what will be expected of internal and partner stakeholders. We'll take what we learned in the monitoring and testing discussions, and translate it into business terms, and understand what was promised as part of API operations and integration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assertions&nbsp;</strong>- What assertions are made regarding each API resource, as well as groups of API resources. What are the technical details, as well as the plain English explaining the business objective, and the legalese&nbsp;that will pass lawyer review of assertions made?</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreement&nbsp;</strong>- What actual service contracts are available and in place regarding API operations. These are the legal contracts that are governing the expectations of API availability and consumption.</li>
</ul>
<p>If API resources are to be monetized upstream or downstream they will have to meet the expected level of reliability. Meeting the API contracts in place for accessing and consuming data, content, and algorithmic resources, and justify the money being exchanged for services.</p>
<p><strong>Security<br /></strong>Along with reliability, security will be essential to a successful API operation. APIs leverage the web, but are far from open and available to anyone with the web address. There are many technical areas to consider when it comes to API security, but let's just talk the basics this round.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- A well defined, discoverable, and consistent API approach brings a level of security by itself. Let's discuss the other aspects of security when it comes to API operations from authentication outlined above to DNS level attacks that might disrupt operations.</li>
<li><strong>Transport-Level Security&nbsp;</strong>- Encryption by default is the norm for API operations, and we'll discuss encryption in transport, as well as other platform or client, led efforts supporting encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can expand on this area if needed, but I prefer to address a well-defined API strategy as the first step in platform security. APIs help standardizes how resources are accessed and put to use, which goes a long way to help secure valuable corporate interests and protect valuable corporate assets.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Department<br /></strong>Let's make sure and cover the legal side of operations lightly. As with security, we will lightly cover the legal department&nbsp;and stay out of the weeds. There are a handful of areas I'd like to discuss, just to make sure we have this side of operations in order.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy&nbsp;</strong>- What privacy considerations are there regarding data and content being made available, as well as the developers using the APIs, and the users of the applications that are built on the application.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service</strong>&nbsp;- We can talk through some of the ways a platform's terms of service will need to be augmented as part of API operations--discussing any concerns you may have regarding the API terms of service.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing&nbsp;</strong>- I'll walk through the layers of the licensing stack for API operations, starting with server side code, ad extending to the content and data access via API operations, and the client code being put to use across all integrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The terms of service, privacy policy, and licensing will affect the business side of API operations. This area governs all other aspects of partner, and 3rd party integrations. These areas need to be well defined, providing clear guidance for developers who are integrating with the APIs being made available.</p>
<p><strong>Branding<br /></strong>As an extension of the legal department, let's also discuss branding for API operations. This is one of the most important of API operations but is often overlooked and under invested in when it comes to execution. Let's talk about a few of the common areas I'm seeing API providers deal with branding.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about goals, and existing branding efforts in place, then we put some thought into what should be in place to not just govern branding but encourage developers to help strengthen the brand and extend the reach.</li>
<li><strong>Assets&nbsp;</strong>- What image assets are in place to help developers understand branding, and easily extend the brand in their applications. Do not make developers work in this area, there need to be a wealth of resources that help them do this right.</li>
<li><strong>Requirements&nbsp;</strong>- Provide a structured set of branding requirements for developers. Let's discuss what some of the common approaches are depending on the implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Guides</strong>&nbsp;- Does it make sense to package up the branding requirements, and assets into a single guide, that developers can share with their team, and bake into their development process.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to generating value, branding is one of the most important tools in the API toolbox. Extending the network of your retail and online presence, through consistent implementation, execution of the brand is part of the API game. When done right, you can make a significant impact, and extend the reach and strength of a platform using APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery<br /></strong>Any moderately sized company will operate potentially hundreds, if not thousands of APIs, while also depending on tens&nbsp;or even hundreds of external APIs. The discovery of available resources, no matter where they are in the development life cycle is an important area to discuss and plan for.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Inventory&nbsp;</strong>- Taking what we discussed in the data and deployment areas of discussion, let's think about these raw sources as part of the wider API discovery discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Service Inventory&nbsp;</strong>- While this is a discussion about the future of APIs, I am guessing there are already a number of existing APIs in place from existing software and infrastructure in place, as well as the consumption of 3rd party Saas and cloud services.</li>
<li><strong>Schema&nbsp;</strong>- How can APIs be discovered&nbsp;using schema, and how can the schema of all data be well defined and reused using common formats like JSON schema.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Definitions&nbsp;</strong>- Along with schema how can API specifications like OpenAPI and APIs.json be applied to help define APIs, and make them more discoverable as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Search /&nbsp;</strong><strong>Catalog&nbsp;</strong>- Discovery will involve the presence of a catalog and other solutions for search APIs and schema applied.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Public API Search Engines / Directories</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a need for being listed in public API search engines and directories, helping bring awareness to the existence of API resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of API discovery will depend on the approach we take to define and design APIs deployed as part of API operations. API discovery is critical to this working, allowing internal, partner, and public consumers to find what they need, and properly integrate into their applications.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable<br /></strong>Defining where the code meets branding, I'd like to spend some time talking about embeddable tooling available as part of API operations. These are usually JavaScript goodies that leverage the API to help extend the reach of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- What types of embeddable are there? Let's discuss the simple examples like Twitter and Facebook share buttons, to the more sophisticated commerce, payment, or other API-enabled feature.</li>
<li><strong>Tools&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about what tooling is available for defining, customizing, and extending embeddable tooling, helping API consumers build the embeddable toling they need.</li>
<li><strong>Formats&nbsp;</strong>- Building on the API definition portion of this discussion, I want to make sure and discuss some of the open formats for developing embeddable tooling from oEmbed, to common data standards that help streamline the embedding of API tooling.</li>
</ul>
<p>The embeddable portion of operations will help put the branding for the platform into action. Giving developers tools, and other assets that they can put to work in their web and mobile applications, as well as signage, and retail experiences. The goal is to extend the reach of the platform to partner web, mobile, and device properties, with just a simple copy and paste when possible.</p>
<p><strong>Webhooks<br /></strong>It is common to think of APIs as just a one-way street -- allowing consumers to make requests and get responses. A common approach to making APIs a two-way street has emerged called web hooks. Allowing API consumers to define and subscribe to events, making API calls to locations they define, as part of regular API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core</strong>&nbsp;- Let's talk about what webhooks are, and how they are being put to use my leading API platform. While this isn't a standard, there are common practices in play that can help streamline setup and usage.</li>
<li><strong>Inbound&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about allowing for inbound webhooks, defining custom services that can receive requests, based upon specific events, and further define API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Outbound&nbsp;</strong>-- Additionally we will discuss the most common approaches to outbound webhooks that make calls and may push data to external URLs, based upon the occurrence of activities and events across the platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Webhooks help in&nbsp;alleviating the strain on API resources, reducing the number of calls an application will be making. Allowing applications to define and subscribe to events, and receive webhook notifications occur, such as new product shows up in catalog&nbsp;or a purchase is made.</p>
<p><strong>Orchestration<br /></strong>Let's spend some time discussing the platform orchestration opportunities. Outlining some of the other ways APIs are enabling the synchronization, interoperability, and integration between platforms, and applications used across the enterprise and by partners. &nbsp;These are the areas I'd like to help you be more aware of when it comes to API enabled orchestration of the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iPaaS&nbsp;</strong>- Availability of next generation ETL solutions like If This Then That and Zapier, allow any user to use APIs to orchestrate business processes, defining what APIs means to their regular work.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Integration&nbsp;</strong>- The evolution of development, making the whole develop stack API driven so that developers can not just access data and content, but they can use APIs to customize their access to resources.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets&nbsp;</strong>- APIs are being used to publish data to spreadsheets, making it available in business functions and reporting, while also making valuable spreadsheet data available for use as part of API deployment and operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>These areas represent how developers and average business users are putting APIs to use as part of regular IT and business operations. By providing API resources to internal and external users, individual users can be empowered to get things done on their own, within the structure of predefined governance and data and content access strategies. Many of these areas are available by default, just by having APIs available--the connectors for moving things around the web with iPaaS, weaving into continuous integration workflows, and spreadsheets are already available out there.</p>
<p><strong>Logging<br /></strong>A structured approach to logging of all API activity is essential to management, security, and the health of operations. It can also become another layer to API operations, as well as monetization, providing access to valuable aggregate, trending, and other valuable data derived from the exhaust of API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about the logging features present with existing infrastructure, and the API management layer of this conversation. Let's talk about the other opportunities involved when logging is API driven, providing programmatic access to every aspect of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>&nbsp;- In addition to the recording, and storage of log data let's talk about the analysis and reporting objectives around this data, as well as the privacy and security implications of logging at all layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the layer where we measure everything happening across API operations. It is the awareness of how resources are being accessed and used, provide the data needed to identify where value exists and generate revenue from all aspects operations. While logging should exist at all layers, from the&nbsp;server to client, it should be done sensibly, securely, and with as light of a footprint as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics / Visualization<br /></strong>Providing the meaningful layer on top of platform logging, I want to spend time talking about the analysis, reporting, and visualization requirements around API operations. What is needed to deliver required intelligence to dashboards, dynamic, and static reporting?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analytics&nbsp;</strong>- What analysis will be required of data, providing additional algorithmic layers of access beyond just the raw data behind API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong>&nbsp;- Providing visually derived meaning from all data gathered, and the analysis provided on top of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>&nbsp;- Let's makes sure that the analytics layer is all API driven, and the visualization layer is included as part of the embeddable API aspects of operations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>With this layer is developed as part of the overall embeddable API strategy for the platform, all the analysis, and visualizations will be embeddable in emails, other web or mobile applications, delivering insight, awareness, and intelligence wherever it is needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monetization<br /></strong>Now we are really getting into the business side of this discussion&nbsp;and begin talking about the nuts and bolts of generating revenue from API operations. Before we assemble an actual plan for generating revenue from operations, we need to discuss other aspects of investment in the platform, and how value is generated, or not generated.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquisition&nbsp;</strong>- What is required to acquire data and content, tracking the costs associated with licensing, royalties, or other aspects of discovering and acquiring data or content.</li>
<li><strong>Development&nbsp;</strong>- A breakdown of the costs involved with developing APIs, making data, content, or algorithms available as APIs, and accessible via the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Operation</strong>&nbsp;- Taking a look at what it will cost to operate an API, considering not just the technical, but also the business and legal side of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Value&nbsp;</strong>- Discussing the direct value of data, content, media, and other resources being made available via APIs, exploring the tangible and known value present.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Value&nbsp;</strong>- Thinking a little about the indirect value generated by APIs, like traffic to&nbsp;website&nbsp;or maybe brand awareness, bringing value to the table, but not direct revenue generation.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting&nbsp;</strong>- What are some of the reporting requirements present around investment into API operations. Understanding and sharing awareness around what it takes to create, and operate an API platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll think about monetization from the big picture, but also down to the individual API level--understand what it takes to operate any single API, as well as how they support overall objectives. Without an awareness of what it takes to develop and operate each available API, we will never fully be able to determine the return on investment from any plan we establish.</p>
<p><strong>Plans<br /></strong>With a general awareness of what it will take to develop and operate APIs, we can start planning a little more about how access tiers will be defined, what will be charged for API access, and even what might be paid for incentivizing access to some API resources. I would like to discuss many of the common aspects of how API plans are being operated by the most successful providers like Amazon, Google, and others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Let's spend some time discussing how API plans operate. Thinking about the variety of ways APIs can be mixed, matched, and a variety of access levels can be defined to maximize access and usage, while also generating revenue in a sensible way.</li>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>&nbsp;- What are the elements of API access? What other elements are present like support, and specific features are present--further defining what is included beyond just API access.</li>
<li><strong>Timeframes</strong>&nbsp;- What timeframes impact API access plans. What considerations are there per month, day, or possibly by the second? Let's think through the timeframes that drive API plans.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics&nbsp;</strong>- What is being measured as part of each plan level? By the API call, amount of storage, or measuring bandwidth. There are many different metrics to be defined, depending on the resource available, and the monetization objective in play.</li>
<li><strong>Geo&nbsp;</strong>- With cloud computing advances there are many possibilities for additional monetization layers to API plans that include geographically deployed APIs, and in-country services depending on laws and regulatory climate.</li>
<li><strong>Limits</strong>&nbsp;- Let's look to define the limits of each plan, talking about what types of constraints can be put in place to incentivize desired behavior, and drive revenue in an appropriate direction.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>&nbsp;- Let's spend some time thinking about individual API access, and the monetization opportunities involved with different levels of access--this is widely known as service composition, providing different layers of access based upon business objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Extensions -</strong>&nbsp;What opportunities are there for an extension? Can plans be extended and overreached either by usage or possibly paying for preferred treatment--let's think about what the boundaries are.</li>
</ul>
<p>API plans aren't just for public access to APIs, they can be crafted specifically for enterprise level and partner access needs. They can also be established internal consumption, defining the access levels and usage across teams, or geographic locations. API plans aren't just for defining, and charging for API access, they should also be used to measure value created, and possibly defining cash payouts to partners, affiliates, and resellers, encouraging the desired behavior across all API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Partners<br /></strong>Beyond the basic plans, I wanted to discuss the higher levels of access, providing tiers of access that are usually not metered, or limited, providing special considerations for trusted partners. There are a number of common approaches to helping enable partner integrations, driving the overall objectives of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Program Details&nbsp;</strong>- What existing partner efforts exist? What are the details of existing data or content acquisition or consumption? Beyond the basic levels of access, what should we be thinking about?</li>
<li><strong>Access Levels&nbsp;</strong>- What are the partner level considerations to discuss? Are partners given early or exclusive access to resources? There are many ways to leverage the reading or writing of data and include them as part of partner program incentives.</li>
<li><strong>Legal&nbsp;</strong>- What are the individual legal concerns with partner levels of access. Existing contracts in place, and the existing API-related data or content partnerships that might drive API access tier considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing Activities&nbsp;</strong>- Are there a specific marketing or advertising considerations that might impact partner access, providing special promotions and other activities to drive integration and partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Support&nbsp;</strong>- What levels of support are given to partner API access levels, and support the overall program. Support is commonly given to the entire community, with an emphasis on preferred or unpaid support for partners.</li>
<li><strong>Content&nbsp;</strong>- What content opportunities are there for partners to participate in. Weaving their messaging into existing marketing and advertising activities, and demonstrate the API integration or application fueling the partnership.</li>
<li><strong>Communication&nbsp;</strong>- What are the additional layers of API operations communication strategy that are focused on partner activity? Some portions of the execution might be dedicated to partners, while others have a general focus.</li>
<li><strong>Financial&nbsp;</strong>- What are the financial reporting, and tracking needs for partner levels of access, measuring their usage of resources, revenue sharing, or collection?</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>&nbsp;- Will there be an API for the partner program? Allowing for programmatic access to program details, activities, support, content, communication, and other elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three main areas of API access companies are thinking about are internal, partner, and the&nbsp;general public. Partner tends to drive a significant portion of the efforts especially early on until providers gain the expertise and platform maturity necessary to successfully operate a fully public API platform. A well-defined partner access can provide the momentum needed to extend the platform's resources to a wider audience in a way that furthers a company mission.</p>
<p><strong>Evangelism / Outreach / Inreach<br /></strong>Last I want to discuss the evangelism, outreach, and what I like to call reach around API operations. Successful API operations have advocates, evangelists, and dedicated resources to helping spread the word about APIs, supporting the needs of consumers, and ensure there is a feedback loop around everything happening. There are some common approaches established by leading providers when it comes to API outreach.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/t-shirts/KL_InApiWeTrust-1000.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>&nbsp;- Let's start again with the basics. What are our goals in doing APIs, and wanting to take an API-first approach to internal, and partner operations?</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Outreach</strong>&nbsp;- What&nbsp;can be done to reach out to the developer community, and join the existing API community, to drive integration with the platform?</li>
<li><strong>Partner Outreach&nbsp;</strong>- What separate outreach is required for partners, maintaining relationships, and establishing a feedback loop for the future of platform operations?</li>
<li><strong>Landscape Analysis</strong>&nbsp;- What research has been done regarding existing, competitive, or possibly complementary API programs, maybe as part of existing efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Communications</strong>&nbsp;- Let's take the communication strategy and think of it in terms of reaching new users, and spreading awareness of the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Support&nbsp;</strong>- Let's also talk about how support should be woven into outreach strategies, using publicly available platforms that bring SEO exposure for the platform.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub&nbsp;</strong>- When it comes to managing code, and API operations many providers lean on Github for code management, as well as social engagement with the developer community.</li>
<li><strong>Social Management&nbsp;</strong>- Successful API efforts engage with consumers via the social channels they are already operating on, including Github, Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong>&nbsp;- What does the event landscape look like for the platform? What conferences, meetups, or hackathons can be attended, or hosted. Is there a calendar available to the community to deepen the engagement with the community.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboard</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a private, or even public dashboard for outreach to begin, providing links to all outreach across operations, all reporting, and community activity?</li>
<li><strong>Reporting&nbsp;</strong>- What regular reporting occurs around outreach, keeping stakeholders informed, and aware--let's discuss how important reporting is to keeping stakeholders invested.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outreach is about connecting the feedback loop around API operations. It all starts over again with the feedback gathered at this level. You take this back to the definition layer, enrich your approach, dial in the design of new and existing API efforts, and do it all again. It is touch to articulate and convey the cyclical aspects of API operations, and how companies get better at it with each wave, if they invest in the right areas. API operations are much more than a technical, IT, developer effort--in 2017, it is more about business and people&nbsp;than it ever is about just the data.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Strategy<br /></strong>This is the framework for an API operational strategy. I don't expect you to have all the answers for everything here. It is just meant to help guide our discussion, and provide a framework that we can organize and hang details on for you to take home and consider as part of your team's strategy. Hopefully, this outline provides you with a primer for our&nbsp;discussion. It might seem like a lot, but we should be able to get through in a couple hours, then we can think about the draft of this document for you to take back to your company.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/sonossystem.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is a reason why I encourage API providers to look at not just the technology of APIs&nbsp;but also invest heavily into the business and politics of API operations. There is a reason I evangelize a more open, web-based approach to doing APIs, even if you are peddling hardware and device APIs. It is because there are a number of human-centered elements present when doing APIs, that will&nbsp;define your services, and ultimately contribute to whether or not they are a success&nbsp;or a failure.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cepro.com/article/new_sonos_api_disrupts_home_automation_integration_but_lays_solid_foundatio">One example of this from my API news curation archives is from the Sonos API ecosystem, and a pretty big blunder in communication the audio device platform made late last year, that is significantly impacting their partnerships in 2017.</a> &nbsp;Directly from the CEPro article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A collective cheer roared from home-technology installers at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/cedia">CEDIA Expo 2016</a>, when&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/article/sonos_now_integrates_for_real_iport_and_lutron_launch_new_sonos_controls">Sonos announced an API</a>&nbsp;for home-automation integration starting with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Control4">Control4</a>&nbsp;(Nasdaq:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ctrl">CTRL</a>),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Crestron">Crestron</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/iPort">iPort</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Lutron">Lutron</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Savant">Savant</a>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>These partners &ndash; and most other respectable smart-home systems providers &ndash; have integrated with Sonos for many years, albeit with unsanctioned drivers created through reverse-engineering of a fairly straightforward UPnP-based protocol.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But the new API kind of snuck up on dealers and vendors alike, with their customers waking up to a brand new&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Sonos">Sonos</a>&nbsp;experience in late December, courtesy of an auto-update by Sonos.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The new experience was inferior to the original, with users unable to access Spotify or Amazon Music from the home automation system, except to select favorites created through Sonos&rsquo;s own app.</em></p>
<p>When you are operating an API that many different businesses depend on, communication is essential. this is why I advocate that API providers always have a clear communication and support strategy, as well as the road map, issue management, and change log processes. Every single change has to be considered for its impact on the community, and you have to have a plan for how you will be communicating and supporting&nbsp;your API consumers needs around a change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also why API providers should be understanding the benefits of hypermedia when it comes to change management. Hypermedia design patterns provide you with a more honest approach to dealing change, one that helps make your partner's clients more fault tolerant. It is well worth the time learning about the handful of leading hypermedia media types. Any one of them would have helped Sonos manage change.</p>
<p>There are multiple tools in the API toolbox to help you manage change. In the en,d the most effective tools involve human to human interaction, and actually talking to your partners early on about change, and making sure you have a robust communication strategy throughout your API lifecycle. Us engineers like to think it is the API technology making the magic happen, but in the end, there is more to this than just having application programming interfaces, it is about also having the right human interfaces.</p>

<p>I am finally seeing more solutions available for API providers when it comes to publishing an portal for their API operations. <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">I've long had my minimum viable API portal definition</a>, which I recently <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/02/my-developer-portal-checklist-for-a-human-services-api/">deployed to support the Miami Open211 API</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">I also wrote about AWS serverless approach to an API portal</a>. Next up, is <a href="https://tyk.io/2017/03/01/new-wordpress-api-portal-plugin/">a WordPress solution from my API management partner Tyk</a>.</p>
<p>The WordPress API portal solution has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic developer registration on Tyk when developers sign up in WP</li>
<li>Configuration of API policies available for token registration</li>
<li>Developers may request an access token for the available API policies</li>
<li>Automatic or manual approval of key requests</li>
<li>Storage of token (references) by name and API policy</li>
<li>Revoking of tokens by developer</li>
<li>Display usage statistics per key</li>
<li>Request quota usage per key</li>
</ul>
<p>All the basics you need when standing up a basic API operation. If WordPress is your go-to content management system, then it might make sense for you to think about API portal&nbsp;in these terms. The<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/">Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS)</a>&nbsp;is already using the plugin&nbsp;in production, and you can <a href="https://github.com/liip/wp-tyk-dev-portal">download the plugin on Github</a>, or find it <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tyk-developer-portal/">over at WordPress.org</a>.</p>
<p>We need multiple versions of API portals like this, designed for every type of platform a company, organization, institution, and government agency might be already using as a default platform for their operations. This is why API management providers <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/27/the-api-definition-for-the-tyk-api-gateway/">need to follow Tyk's&nbsp;lead and make sure your solution is API driven</a>--practicing what you preach so that your API management solution can be integrated anywhere.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/grpc.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/03/google-shares-their-api-design-guide/">I have been processing Google's API design guide</a>, and an unexpected part of the work has been learning more about gRPC, which Google is&nbsp;<span>"converging designs of socket-based RPC APIs with HTTP-based REST APIs." -- something I have not seen in an API design guide until now. "<span>gRPC uses&nbsp;</span><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">protocol buffers</a><span>&nbsp;as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) for describing both the service interface and the structure of the payload messages", and is something I'm hearing more chatter about from larger providers, which I think represents the evolving world of API design beyond the old REST days.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.grpc.io/docs/">According to the site</a>, "gRPC is used in last mile of computing in mobile and web client since it can generate libraries for iOS and Android and uses standards based HTTP/2 as transport allowing it to easily traverse proxies and firewalls. There is also work underway to develop a JS library for use in browsers. Beyond that, it is ideal as a microservices interconnect, not just because the core protocol is very efficient but also because the framework has pluggable authentication, load balancing etc. Google itself is also transitioning to use it to connect microservices."</p>
<p>To help me learn anything I need an example to reverse engineer, showing me how things work--so here are the examples they provide from the site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-bigtable-client">Google Cloud BigTable Client APIs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/03/announcing-grpc-alpha-for-google-cloud-pubsub">Google Cloud PubSub APIs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech/reference/rpc/">Google Cloud Speech APIs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to add a research area for gRPC, similar to <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a>, as well as GraphQL. It helps me better keep track of the&nbsp;news&nbsp;about each approach to crafting APIs, and a single place I can go to reference service providers, and working examples. I've had gRPC / Protocol Buffers on my monitoring list for some time now, but seeing Google invest so heavily in this area gives me a signal that I should be paying attention to gRPC more, and gathering more examples that I can share with my readers.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that I will assemble some sort of toolbox area in my API design research, helping folks understand when a more RESTful approach makes sense, as well as when hypermedia, GraphQL, or maybe a gRPC approach might be more appropriate. Next, I'm going to dive into BigTable, PubSub, and Speech APIs to see gRPC in action--something I'm hoping that will help me better understand <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/03/google-shares-their-api-design-guide/">Google's approach to API design</a>, which something I'm struggling with grasping completely.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_04_at_10.46.01_pm.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://apis.guru/browse-apis/">I am building on the great work by the APIs.guru team</a>, assembling a collection of Google definitions. I will be forking their Google Open definitions and wrap them in <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json indexes</a>, so I can analyze the APIs at the 100K level, and potentially augment, and enrich the existing OpenAPIs that the APIs.guru team has worked so hard on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When APIs.guru crafts an OpenAPI for an API, they have a set of OpenAPI extensions that&nbsp;provides a snapshot of the history for each OpenAPI. They provide six OpenAPI extensions, specific to their API discovery objectives:</p>
<blockquote>x-apiClientRegistration:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://console.developers.google.com'<br /> x-logo:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/material/product/2x/blogger_64dp.png'<br /> x-origin:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;format: google<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/blogger/v3/rest'<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;version: v1<br /> x-preferred: true<br /> x-providerName: googleapis.com<br /> x-serviceName: blogger</blockquote>
<p>I like that they include the origin of thier API definitions. I want to do the same, but I would like to turn x-origin into a collection so that I can add multiple entries into it, and evolve it beyond just origin. I want to show the provenance for the API definition, that I build mine on top of APIs.guru's hard work, and that they built theirs on Google's using their discovery format. I'm going to add x-provenance to mine&nbsp;and start tracking on the source of where my API definitions originate and include anything else present when I imported.</p>
<p>It is important that we are able to have many different copies of an API's definition, in a variety of formats. There will be copies of API definitions all over Github, and the web, for a variety of different purposes. I'd like to see more stewards of API definitions include some sort of origin, provenance, and history for their API definitions. If they are yours, they are authoritative and it isn't necessary, but if they are for 3rd party APIs, try to capture as much information as you can about where it comes from, to help everyone understand it's history.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">This is a repeat story of one I&nbsp;wrote two years ago</a>, but things haven't changed so I'm going to rant about again, 2017 style. We need someone to develop an open source, visual API design editor. There is the <a href="http://swagger.io/swagger-editor/">Swagger Editor</a>, but that is more a web IDE, and I'm looking for a well designed, intuitive, visual editor for managing your OpenAPI definitions, that is embeddable and easily integrated into any web or mobile system.</p>
<p>There are examples of nice visual API design editors with some of the leading API service providers, but I'm looking for something any API service provider could put to work. I included these examples in my last story, except I'm including Stoplight this round instead of Gelato, because they gave me an upgrade my account message,&nbsp;and wouldn't let me see the interface. These are currently my favorite three API design editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://studio.restlet.com">Restlet</a>&nbsp;- A design, deployment, management service provider.</li>
<li><a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>&nbsp; - An SDK, API definition transformer, and continous integration provider.</li>
<li><a href="https://stoplight.io">Stoplight</a>&nbsp;- An API design, definition, documentation, and orchestration provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoy using all three of their API design interfaces. They are well thought out&nbsp;and provide what you need to design new APIs, as well manage the design of your existing APIs. While they are doing a good job at this, it is something I'd like to see standardized, and open sourced, so that other service providers do not have to reinvent the wheel here. We shouldn't have to use a different API design interface for each service we depend on, we need a common editor, making things more familiar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, rant over. This is something I'll keep talking about until there is a solution. Oh, I have to say, I am impressed with what <a href="http://getmateria.com">the Materia&nbsp;team</a> has done for API design on the desktop. Between them and Stoplight, there has been positive motion forward. I'm just looking to give things another nudge and help folks understand the opportunity. I'll explore possible business models for such a solution in another post, and keep beating this drum until I get what I want.</p>

<p>Everyone developing APIs struggles with API design. Ok, maybe a few of the gurus out there don't, but the rest of us need education, practice, and ideally someone or something to help guide us through the best practices when it comes to API design. I try to track what different companies are doing when it comes to API design, and <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools/design-guides/">maintain a list of any API design guides I come across in my work</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking to start getting a grasp on API design at your company, organization, institution or agency, I recommend starting on the journey to define your own API design guide--you will be surprised what you can learn along the way. You can kick things off by visiting my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design research</a>, but I strongly recommend you head over <a href="http://apistylebook.com/">to the API Stylebook</a>, and build on this important work.</p>
<p>My friend Arnaud has <a href="http://apistylebook.com/design/guidelines/">aggregated 12 of the leading API design guides out there</a> and is currently processing Google's API design guide, adding more knowledge&nbsp;to the repository. <a href="http://apistylebook.com/design/topics/">He takes each API design guide and breaks them down into common API design topics that you can consider as part of your own process, and resulting guide.</a> His work is all <a href="https://github.com/arno-di-loreto/apistylebook.com">machine readable and forkable</a> so that you can easily assemble your own guide, and get to work learning, defining, and refining--then you can submit your guide to the API Stylebook when you are ready.</p>
<p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design</a> and <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> are the top two most trafficked areas of my website in 2017, and most of 2016. API design is top of mind for API providers who are further along in their journey, and the ones who are seriously rocking it usually have some sort of guide, helping keep things consistent. If you need any help, feel free to reach out. I am not an API design expert, but I know my way around the finer details, and concepts at play, and I'm happy to help where I can. I know Arnaud is happy to answer questions as well, and if nothing else, let me help tell the story of your API design journey so that others can learn from it.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/02/dreaming-of-a-more-modular-event-driven-api-monetization/">I was dreaming of a more modular, event-driven approach to API monetization</a>&nbsp;the other day, and I found myself thinking more about the motivations behind each API call made, from the perspective of both the consumer and the provider. With this story I am just thinking about just the POST, or how we usually add something to a system via API--this is not always the case, but it is the common usage of the verb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have any numbers to support this, but the majority of APIs I encounter are GET only. The more mature API platforms have diverse stacks, using their verbs, but when companies are just getting going with their API operations, they rarely use POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. When it comes to having APIs, and incentivizing developers to generate some&nbsp;value using APIs, it seems like a company wants to encourage the creation of valuable data and content.</p>
<p>I was talking with Lufthansa Airlines the other day, and one of the things that they said to me that stood out&nbsp;when we were talking about the different APIs available, was that none of them matter if someone doesn't buy (POST) a ticket. Today, while on the phone with one of my partners, they asked if they could put my industry guides behind a lead generation form--something I allow my partners do. However, I wish more of them had a POST path for me to submit new leads, share stories, topics, and other times, for a variety of reasons--I promise would help generate value with each API call.</p>
<p>With this work I am ramping up for my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">API monetization</a> and <a href="http://plan.apievangelist.com">API plan</a> research, thinking about the bigger picture of how we generate value, as well as make money doing all of this. I guess that I am just lamenting the stagnation of how APIs are being designed, and deployed, with any sensible or even creative monetization strategies. To help me get through this I am going to think about what is important in my world operating API Evangelist. How I can create API endpoints for directly generating value in these areas. Things like adding a news article, sharing a story, asking questions, and other seeds of value in my world--then maybe I can provide some examples to help clarify what I'm talking about.</p>

        <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_01_at_10.08.35_pm.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/">Google released an API design guide recently</a>. I'll be adding the design guide to the list of examples I have in <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools/design-guides/">my API design research</a>. The Google API design guide is pretty straight forward in its purpose, with a goal of helping, "developers design&nbsp;<strong>simple, consistent and easy-to-use</strong>&nbsp;networked APIs", but I thought it was noteworthy that they were also looking to help "converging designs of socket-based RPC APIs with HTTP-based REST APIs."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC and Protocol Buffers</a> has been on my task list to learn more about for a while now, but without any projects at scale, it's probably not a task I'll find much time for anytime soon. I'll try to carve off more time to learn how folks like Google are doing it, through their guides and storytelling. One thing I did know, which Google reinforces is that"many companies use socket-based RPC APIs to carry most network traffic, which can be orders of magnitude higher than public REST APIs."</p>
<p>I like&nbsp;their approach that, "both RPC APIs and HTTP REST APIs are needed for various reasons. Ideally, an API platform should provide best support for all APIs". They also provide a note that "This Design Guide explains how to apply REST principles to API designs independent of programming language, operating system, or network protocol. It is NOT a guide solely to creating REST APIs." I like this because we are getting past the notion that API design is simply about REST--it is clearly evolving to be more about getting the work&nbsp;done&nbsp;than any single philosophy or dogma.</p>
<p><a href="http://apistylebook.com/">In addition to encouraging more API providers to craft an API design guide for their companies using API Stylebook</a>, and sharing their API design guides with the public, I will also be encouraging companies to think beyond just REST when they consider their API design best practices. I'm hoping that more companies will continue to do the hard work of getting their API design house in order&nbsp;because that means they can also begin to think about best practices when it comes to API deployment, management, testing, and the other stops along the API life cycle.</p>

<p>There have been many advances in the way that we deploy APIs in the last couple of years, but I still want more of an embeddable, push botton way to deploy generic or even more specialized APIs. This is something I've ranted about before, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">asking where the deploy to AWS and Google buttons</a>. I'm seeing more AWS solutions emerge, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">helping deploy from Github using AWS Codeploy</a>, and the regular number of deploy to Heroku buttons, but not the real growth I'd like to see occur--making it a drum I will keep beating&nbsp;until I get what I want.</p>
<p>I was working <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">on my OpenAPI toolbox</a>, cataloging <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">open source tools that put the OpenAPI specification to work</a>, and came across a deploy with Heroku button for the <a href="https://github.com/sethherr/grape-doorkeeper/">Grape Doorkeeper</a>, which helps you<em> "create an awesome versioned API, secured with OAuth2 and automatically documented"</em>. This should be the&nbsp;default for all server-side API deployment frameworks, allowing push button deployment of any open source API framework to the cloud platform of your choosing.</p>
<p>If I have my way, it won't just be API frameworks that will have deployment buttons. Specialized API designs, available in a variety of frameworks will be available for deployment with a single click of a button. We should be able to deploy a product API, or a user API, to AWS, Heroku, Google, or Microsoft, with a single click. There should be a wealth of open source templates for us to choose from on Github, with deploy buttons, and easy to follow wizards that help us set things up properly.</p>
<p>Smells like an opportunity to me. I'll have to think more about where the revenue would come from in such a model, but I'm sure it would be easy enough to upsell deployments to some premium features and services. I understand that both the areas of API design and API deployment are playing catch-up with API management at the moment, but someone needs to get to work on streamlining the API deployment button experience across all major cloud platforms&nbsp;and get to work on crafting some useful API server deployments that people can put to work instantly. #please #thankyou</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_01_at_9.03.53_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was handed the URL for a human services API implementation for Miami. It was my job to now deploy a portal, documentation, and other supporting resources for the API implementation. This project is part of the work I'm doing with <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a> to help push forward the API conversation around the human services data specification (HSDS).</p>
<p><a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">I got to work forking my minimum viable API portal definition</a>, to provide a doorway for the <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/">Miami Open211 API</a>. &nbsp;Next, I got to work on setting up a basic presence for the human services API. I started with giving the portal a title, and a basic description of what the service does, then I got to work on each of the portal elements that will help people put the data to work.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong><br />It can be hard to cut through what you need to get going with an API&nbsp;and cut through all the information available. The portal has a <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/getting-started/">getting started page</a> providing a basic introduction, a handful of links to the documentation, code, and where to get help--<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-getting-started.yaml">the page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br />I included an <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/authentication/">authentication page</a> to make it clear that the API is publicly available, but also provide a placeholder to explain that we will be opening up write access to the organizations, locations, and services that are being made available--<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-authentication.yaml">the page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong><br />Next, I wanted to always have the most <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/frequently-asked-questions/">frequently asked questions</a> front and center where anyone can find it. I am using this page as a default place to publish any questions asked via Github, Twitter, or email. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-frequently-asked-questions.yaml">The page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br /><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/documentation/">Now for the documentation</a>, the most important piece of the puzzle. I published a <a href="https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/basics">Liquid</a> documentation driven by <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">the OpenAPI for the API</a>. With a little bit of JavaScript voodoo,&nbsp;I was able to make the documentation interactive so that you can actually try out each path, and see the JSON response--the documentation is driven by the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/apis.yaml">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">OpenAPI</a> for the API.</p>
<p><strong>Code Samples</strong><br />After completing the OpenAPI definition for the API documentation, I used the machine-readable definition to generate code samples using <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">swagger code-gen</a>. I <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/code/">published C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby code samples</a> to help developers get started with their projects. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/client-sdks">All the language samples are published to a separate Github </a><a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/client-sdks">repository</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-code.yaml">the page is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Postman Collection</strong><br />To help jumpstart integration, <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/postman_collection.json">I also generated and published a Postman Collection</a>, so that anyone can quickly import it into their client, and get to work playing with the API in their environment. You can do this with OpenAPI also, but Postman helps extend the possibilities--<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/postman_collection.json">the Postman Collection is editable via its Github page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Road Map</strong><br />Next, I published a <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/road-map/">road map</a> so we could share what is next for the project, providing a list where developers can stay in tune with what is going to happen. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22road+map%22">The road map entries are pulled from the Github issues for any entry with the road map label</a>. There is a script that can be run regularly to keep the issues in sync with the roadmap, and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-road-map.yaml">page is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Issues</strong><br />Similar to the road map, <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/issues/">I created a page for sharing any open Github issues</a>, that are <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aissues">labeled 'issues'</a>, to help communicate outstanding and known issues with the platform. It stays in sync using the same script, and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-issues.yaml">page&nbsp;is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Change Log</strong><br />In addition to a road map and known issues, when these items get accomplished or fixed <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/change-log/">they get moved to the change log</a>, keeping a complete history of everything that has changed with the platform.&nbsp;It stays in sync using the same script, and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-change-log.yaml">page&nbsp;is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Status Page</strong><br />Beyond the resources to get up and running with documentation, code samples, and a road map, issues, and change log to stay in tune with the platform, <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/status/">I wanted a status page keeping an eye on things</a>. I signed up for a monitoring service called <a href="http://apiscience.com/">API Science</a> (which I highly recommend), and imported the OpenAPI definition, and had monitors to keep an eye on things and make sure the API stays up. The page is generated from an&nbsp;embeddable JavaScript widget&nbsp;and is updated using the API Science API.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong><br /><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/terms-of-service/">For the terms of service</a>, I just grabbed an open source copy from Wikidot, providing a baseline place to start when it comes to the TOS for the API-<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/terms-of-service/index.html">the terms of service is editable via its Github page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br />Similar to the terms of service&nbsp;I just grabbed an <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/privacy-policy/">open source privacy policy from Wikidot</a>, providing a baseline place to start when it comes to a <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/privacy-policy/">privacy policy for the API</a>-<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/privacy-policy/index.html">the privacy policy is editable via its Github page</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Developer Blog</strong><br /><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/blog/">The blog for the project</a> is driven by the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll framework</a> for <a href="https://pages.github.com/">the developer portal hosted on Github Pages</a>. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/tree/master/_posts">To manage the blog entries, you just add or update pages in the _posts folder for the website</a>. All entries in the _post folder are listed in chronological order on the blog page for the developer portal.</p>
<p><strong>Github</strong><br />This developer portal runs 100% on Github and leverages the potential of Jekyll when running on Github. The API is hosted on Heroku and run by someone else, but the developer portal is a static website, completely editable via Github through the web interface, API, or locally with the desktop client. Github also provides much of the support framework for the project, driving the roadmap, issues, change log, and 1/3 of the support options for developers--the entire site is driven from the _data store, with the website just being a Liquid-driven Jekyll template.</p>
<p><strong>OpenAPI</strong><br /><a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">This developer portal is defined by its OpenAPI definition</a>. It drives the documentation, generated the code samples, fired up the API Science monitors, and is the central contract defining the APIs operation. I will be keeping the OpenAPI up to date, and using it as the central truth for the API and its operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>APIs.json</strong><br /><a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/apis.yaml">The portal is entirely indexed using APIs.json</a>, providing a single machine-readable definition of the API and its operations. All the supporting pages of the API are linked to in the index, and their contents&nbsp;and data are all machine-readable YAML and JSON. The APIs.json provides access to the OpenAPI which describes the surface area of the API, as well as providing links to all it's supporting operations.</p>
<p><strong>What Is Next?</strong><br />I'm going to put things down for a couple days. We still need some FAQs entered, and the content needs fluffing up and editing. Then we'll invite other folks to take a look at. Then I will get to work on the POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE paths, and once those are certified I will push as part of the OpenAPI, regenerate the code samples, and turn on the ability for people to get involved not just reading data, but also potentially adding and updating data in the database--making things a group effort.</p>
<p>I'm going to take what I have here, and fork it into a new project, making it a baseline demo portal for <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a>. My goal is to have a downloadable, forkable API portal that is well documented, and anyone providing an HSDS compliant API can put to use for their project. I just wanted to take a moment and gather my thoughts on what I did and share the approach I took with you.</p>

        <p>I used to have a Github repository dedicated to Swagger tooling and implementations, but I took it down after Swagger was donated to the Linux Foundation. I've rebooted it as <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">my OpenAPI Toolbox</a>, providing <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox">a single Github repository for managing an active list of open source tooling built on top of the OpenAPI specification</a>.</p>

This site is a Jekyll-driven website running on Github, using Github Pages. The tools in this toolbox are driven by a YAML file in <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/tree/master/_data">the _data folder for this repository</a>, with the HTML pages driven using Liquid.</p>

<p>This project is <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox">forkable using the Github repository</a>, and <a href="/data/tools.json">accessible as JSON</a>. If you have a tool you think should be added, or there is something that needs fixing, <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/issues">you can submit an issue on the Github repository</a>, or submit a pull request. It is meant to be a community project, designed to be forkable, shareable, and machine-readable.</p>
<p>I've just started adding the tools I have in my database. I only have 37 so far, but will be adding more as I have time. Once I have it up to date, I will start thinking about other ways to slice and dice the tools, to better understand what is being built on the OpenAPI specification, what tools are being built on the upcoming 3.0 version, as well as working to identify where the gaps and opportunities are for developing tooling.</p>

<p>I was learning about the approach Amazon has taken with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">their serverless API developer portal</a>, and <a href="/2017/03/01/a-machine-readable-definition-for-your-aws-api-plan/">highlighting their approach to API plans</a>, and couldn't help but think there was more to it all than just rate limiting your API. Amazon's approach to API plans is in alignment with other API management providers, allowing you to deploy your APIs, meter, rate limit, and charge for access to your API--standard business of APIs stuff.</p>
<p>Controlling access to a variety of API resources is something that has been well-defined over the last decade by API management providers like <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale</a>, and now <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">Tyk</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">DreamFactory</a>. They provide you with all the tools you need to define access to APIs, and meter access based upon a wide variety of parameters. While I haven't seen the type of growth I expected to see in this area, we have seen a significant amount of growth because API management providers are helping to standardize things--something that will grow significantly because of availability&nbsp;from cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google.</p>
<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us, standardizing how we charge for API consumption at scale. We have even more work ahead of us to realize that we can turn all of this on its head, and start paying for API consumption at scale. I do not understand how we've gotten so hung up on the click and the view, when there are so many&nbsp;other richer, and more meaningful actions already occurring&nbsp;every second, of each day online. We should be identifying these opportunities, then paying and incentivizing developers to consume APIs in most valuable way possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With modern approaches to API management, we already have the infrastructure in place. We need to just start thinking about our APIs differently. We also need to get better at leveraging POST, PUT, and PATCH, as well as GET, when it comes to paying for consumption. Imagine a sort of event driven API affiliate layer to the&nbsp;web, mobile, device, and even conversational interfaces--where developers get paid for making the most meaningful events occur. It makes the notion of paying per view or click seem really, really, shit simple.</p>
<p>Anyways, just a thought I needed to get out. The lack of innovation, and abundance of greed when it comes to API monetization and planning always leaves me depressed. I wish someone would move the needle forward with some sort of modular, event-driven&nbsp;API monetization framework--allowing some different dimensions to be added to the API economy.</p>

<p>I come across more companies managing their <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> definition as a single Github repository. One example of this is from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">the New York Times</a>, who as <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs">the API definitions for their platform available as its own Github repository</a>. It demonstrates the importance of maintaining your API definitions separately from any particular implementation, such as just your documentation.</p>
<p>You can find Individual OpenAPIs for their&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/archive_api">archive_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/commit/dd0716a5adc93f95eb4b065ddd8601ffd17cb09c">updated description</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/article_search">article_search</a>,<a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/books_api">books_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/community">community</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/geo_api">geo_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/most_popular_api">most_popular_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/movie_reviews">movie_reviews</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/semantic_api">semantic_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/times_tags">times_tags</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/timeswire">timeswire</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/top_stories">top_stories</a>&nbsp;broken down into separate folders within the Github repository. The NYT also provides markdown documentation, alongside the machine-readable OpenAPI definition in each folder, helping make sure things are human-readable.</p>
<p>It just makes sense to manage your API definitions this way. It's more than just documentation. When you do this, you are taking advantage of the repository and version control features of Github, but you also open things up for participation through forking and pull requests. The resulting definition and machine readable contract can then be injected anywhere into the integration&nbsp;and API lifecycle, internally or externally.</p>
<p>I personally like it when companies manage their API definitions in this way. It gives me a central truth to work with when profiling their operations, something that will be used across my research and storytelling. The more you describe your APIs in this way, the more chance I will be writing about them&nbsp;and including them across my work.</p>

<p>I was playing around with the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/blog/2309-introducing-topics">new Github topics</a>, and found that it provides an interesting look at the API space, one that I'm hoping will continue to evolve, and maybe I can influence.</p>
<p>I typed 'api-' into Github's topic tagging tool for my repository, and after I tagged each of my research areas with appropriate tags, I set out exploring these layers of Github by clicking on each tag. It is something that became quite a wormhole of API exploration.</p>
<p>I had to put it down, as I could spend hours looking through the repositories, but I wanted to create a machine-readable mapping to my existing API research areas, that I could use to regularly keep an eye on these slices of the Github pie--in an automated way.</p>
<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/"><strong>Definitions</strong></a>&nbsp;- These are the topics I'm adding to my monitoring of the API space when it comes to API definitions. I thought it was interesting how folks are using Github to manage their API definitions.</p>

<p>I like how OpenAPI is starting to branch out into separate areas, as well as how this area touches on almost every other area&nbsp;liste here. I am going to work to help shape the tags present based on the definitions, templates, and tooling I find on Github in my work.</p>
<p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/"><strong>Design</strong></a>&nbsp;- There was only&nbsp;one API design related item, but is something I expect to expand rapidly as I dive into this area further.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-design</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-design&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I know of a number of projects that should be tagged and added to the area of API design, as well as have a number of sub-areas I'd like to see included as relevant API design tags.</p>
<p><a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/"><strong>Deployment</strong></a>&nbsp;- Deployment was a little tougher to get a handle on. There are many different ways to deploy an API, but these are the ones I've identified so far.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-deployment</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-deployment&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-server</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-server&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>

<li><strong>api-server</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-server&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I know I will be adding some other areas to this area quickly. Tracking on&nbsp;database, containerized, and serverless approaches to API deployment.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/"><strong>Management</strong></a>&nbsp;- There were two topics that jumped out to me for inclusion in my API management research.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-management</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-management&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-key</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-key&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all the other areas, I will be harassing some of the common API management providers I know to tag their repositories appropriately, so that they show up in these searches.</p>
<p><a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com/"><strong>Documentation</strong></a>&nbsp;- There are always a number of different perspectives on what constitutes API documentation, but these are a few of these I've found so far.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-console</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-console&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-documentation</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-documentation&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-error</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-error&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that API console overlaps with API clients, but it works here as well. I will work to find a way to separate out the documentation tools, from the documentation implementations.</p>
<p><a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/"><strong>SDK</strong></a>&nbsp;- It is hard to identify what is an SDK. It is a sector of the space I've seen renewed innovation, as well as bending of the definition of what is a development kit.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-sdk</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-sdk&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-wrapper</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-wrapper&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-client</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-client&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-bindings</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-bindings&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be looking to identify language-specific variations as part of this mapping to API SDKs available on Github, making discoverable through topic searches.</p>
<p><a href="http://portal.apievangelist.com/"><strong>API Portal</strong></a>&nbsp;- It was good to see wicked.haufe.io as part of an API portal topic search. I know of a couple of other implementations that should be present, helping people see this growing area of API deployment and management.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-portal</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-portal&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach to providing Github driven API templates is the future of both the technical and business side of API operations. It is the seed for continuous integration across all stops along the API lifecycle.</p>
<p><a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/"><strong>API Discovery</strong></a>&nbsp;- Currently it is just my research in the API discovery topic search, but it is where I'm putting this area my work down. I was going to add all my research areas, but I think that will make for a good story in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-catalog</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-catalog&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-discovery</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-discovery&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>API discovery is one of the areas I'm looking to stimulate with this Github topics work. I'm going to be publishing separate repositories for each of the API I've profiled as part of my monitoring of the API space, and highlighting those providers who do it as well. We need more API providers to publish their API definitions to Github, making it available to be applied at every other stop along the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>I've long used Github as a discovery tool. Tracking on the Github accounts of companies, organizations, institutions, agencies and individuals is the best way to find the meaningful things going on with APIs. Github topics just adds another dimension to this discovery process, where I don't have to always do the discovery, and other people can tag their repositories, and they'll float up on the radar. Github repo activity, stars, and forks just give&nbsp;an added dimensions to this conversation.</p>
<p>I will have to figure out how to harass people I know about properly tagging their repos. I may even submit a Github issue for some of the ones I think are important enough. Maybe Github will allow users to tag other people's projects, adding another dimension to the conversation, while giving consumers a voice as well. <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/github-topics-mapping/blob/master/_data/mapping.yaml">I will update the YAML mapping for this project as I find new Github topics that should be mapped to my existing API research</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_26_at_7.12.16_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was learning about the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-api-gateway-developer-portal">AWS Serverless Developer </a><a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-api-gateway-developer-portal">Portal</a>, and found their API plan layer to be an interesting evolution in how we define the access tiers of our APIs. There were a couple different layers of AWS's approach to deploying APIs that I found interesting, including the AWS marketplace integration, but I wanted to stop for a moment and focus in on their API plan approach.</p>
<p>Using the AWS API Gateway you can establish a variety of API plans, with the underlying mechanics of that plan configurable via the AWS API Gateway user interface or the AWS API Gateway API. In the documentation for the&nbsp;AWS Serverless Developer&nbsp;Portal, they include a JSON snippet of the configuration of the plan for each API being deployed.</p>
<p>This reminds me that I needed to take another look at <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">my API plan research</a>, and take the plan configuration, rate limit, and other&nbsp;service composition API definitions I have, and aggregate their schema into a single snapshot. <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">It has been a while since I worked on my machine-readable API plan definition</a>, and there are now enough API management solutions with an API layer out there, I should be able to pull a wider sampling of the&nbsp;schema in play. I'm not in the business of defining what the definition should be, I am only looking to aggregate what others are doing.</p>
<p>I am happy to see more folks sharing machine-readable <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> definitions describing the surface area of their APIs. As this work continues to grow we are going to have to also start sharing machine-readable definitions of the monetization, plan, and access layers of our API operations. After I identify the schema in play for some of the major <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> providers I track on, I'm going to invest more work into my standard API plan definition to make the access levels of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs more discoverable using APIs.json</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_25_at_6.02.50_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading about Experian the credit score company "<a href="http://diginomica.com/2017/02/22/experian-shrugs-off-size-to-go-nimbly-api-economy/">ventures nimbly into the API economy</a>" this week. I'm happy to see any company begin their API journey, especially companies whose important algorithms impact our lives in such a major way. APIs are critical when it comes to shining a light on how algorithms work and don't work.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.experian.com/connect/api/">Experian developer page</a>, <em>"the Experian Connect API provides easy access to embed credit functionality on your websites and mobile apps. Consumer-empowered sharing allows you to create products and services for previously unreachable markets"</em>. Sadly I can't see much about the API itself, as you have to fill out a form and request access to see documentation&nbsp;or anything beyond just a basic description.</p>
<p>The Experian Connect API says you get access to credit scores and reports, but most of it sounds like your standard marketing speak. I find API documentation and actually playing with an API provide a much more honest take on what's going on. Their approach reflects what I've seen from other very secretive companies who are used to maintaining tight control over their algorithms, processes, and partnerships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another aspect of the Experian Connect API I noticed as I read was it doesn't focus on solutions for the end-users who is being scored and reported on, it is designed for businesses looking to pull reports on people for a variety of purposes. When you read the story about the Experian API, and the description on the Experian developer page, it is all very business focused--centering on the opportunity for businesses, not the people it scores and ranks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credit scores are one of the OG big data companies, long tracking information on people, and selling access to business and the government. While Experian's venture into the API economy is worth noting, I'm guessing their API journey won't be a very public one. It's just not in their DNA. I wish they would see the value of incentivizing their partners to better serve the humans at the center of the service, and be more transparent about their algorithm(s), but I'm not going to hold my breath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all APIs will be open by default. All we can do is tell stories that help convince companies to open up their APIs, be more transparent, allowing their algorithms to be more observable by everyone who impacted along the way.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">The AWS Serverless API Portal</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/aws_serverless_portal.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was looking through the Github accounts for Amazon Web Services and came across <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-api-gateway-developer-portal">their Serverless API Portal</a>--a pretty functional example of a forkable developer portal for your API, running on a variety of AWS services. It's a pretty interesting implementation&nbsp;because in addition to the tech of your API management it also helps you with the business side of things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AWS Serverless Developer Portal <em>"is a reference implementation for a developer portal application that allows users to register, discover, and subscribe to your API Products (API Gateway Usage Plans), manage their API Keys, and view their usage metrics for your APIs..[]..it also&nbsp;<span>supports subscription/unsubscription through a SaaS product offering through the AWS Marketplace."--p</span></em>roviding a pretty compelling API portal solution running on AWS.</p>
<p>There are a couple things I think are pretty noteworthy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Backend (/lambdas/backend) - </strong>The application backend is a Lambda function built on the aws-serverless-express library. The backend is responsible for login/registration, API subscription/unsubscription, usage metrics, and handling product subscription redirects from AWS Marketplace.</li>
<li><strong>Marketplace SaaS Setup Instructions -</strong> You can sell your SaaS product through AWS Marketplace and have the developer portal manage the subscription/unsubscription workflows. API Gateway will automatically provide authorization and metering for your product and subscribers will be automatically billed through AWS Marketplace</li>
<li><strong>AWS Marketplace SNS Listener Function (Optional) (/listener) - </strong>The listener Lambda function will be triggered when customers subscribe or unsubscribe to your product through the AWS Marketplace console. AWS Marketplace will generate a unique SNS Topic where events will be published for your product.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the required infrastructure we'll need to get to what I've been talking about for some time with my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale API</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stack</a> stories. Amazon is providing you with the infrastructure you need to set up the storefront for your APIs, providing the management layer you will need, including monetization via their marketplace. This is a retail layer, but because your&nbsp;infrastructure is setup in this way, there is no reason you can't sell all or part of your setup to other wholesale customers, using the same AWS marketplace.</p>
<p>I had AWS marketplace on my list of solutions to better understand for some time now, but the AWS Serverless Developer Portal really begins to connect the dots for me. If you can sell access to your API infrastructure using this model, you can also sell your API infrastructure to others using this model. I will have to set up some infrastructure using this approach to better flush out how AWS infrastructure&nbsp;and open templates like this serverless developer portal can help facilitate&nbsp;a more versatile, virtualized, and wholesale API lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/generate-your-own-api-gateway-developer-portal/">a more detailed walkthrough of how to get going with the AWS Serverless Developer Portal</a>, helping you think through the details. I am a big fan of these types of templates--forkable Github repositories, with a blueprint you can follow to achieve a specific API deployment, management, or any&nbsp;other lifecycle objective.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_observability_lighthouse.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">the Wikipedia page for Observability</a> open in a browser tab for weeks now. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/25/thinking-about-an-api-observability-stack/">I learned about the concept from Stripe a while back</a> and is something that I am looking to help define APIs from an external vantage point. In this world of fake news and wild promises of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we need these black boxes to be as observable as they can--I am hoping that APIs can be one of the tools in this observability toolbox.</p>
<p>Stripe is approaching this concept from the inside, with a focus on stability and reliability of their API operations. I am focusing on this concept from the outside, to "measure how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">external outputs</span>". More of a regulatory, auditing, and journalistic way of thinking, but in the API way of doing things. Some of this is about understanding, but some of it is also about holding providers accountable for what they are peddling.</p>
<p>The other day I mapped out what API monitoring means to me, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/16/trying-to-define-api-awareness/">rebranding it as what I'd prefer to call API awareness</a>. I went through the elements I use to understand what is going on with APIs across the sector, but this time I am thinking about them in terms of observability. Meaning, not what I'm doing to be aware of APIs, but what is expected from providers to meet (my) minimum viable definition of a platform being observable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery -</strong> Do APIs exist? Are they easily discoverable? Are they public? Can anyone put them to use?<br />&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- Find new applications built on top of APIs.</li>

<li><strong>Visualizations</strong>&nbsp;- What visualizations are available for making sense of any single API or collections of APIs, providing easy to understand, or perhaps more complex visualizations that bring meaning to the dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong>&nbsp;- What integration platform as a service (iPaaS), continuous integration, and other orchestration solutions are available for helping to make sense of API operations within this world.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not think APIs being present automatically mean a company, it's data, content, or algorithms are observable. This list represents what I feel enables and empowers observability, and are the key areas where I think companies need to work on when it comes to ensuring their operations are more observable. I pulled this list of elements from my own toolbox for monitoring the API sector&nbsp;but is trimmed down specifically for platform operators who might be thinking about how they can make things more observable for everyone involved, internal or external.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are like me and operating outside the corporate firewall, this list represents the areas you should be encouraging platform operators to invest in when it comes to pulling back the current a little bit more. Different folks will read this post and walk away with different takes on what observability might mean. Some will view it as a good thing, while others will see it is as API driven regulatory interference. Your take probably has more to do with your position in the conversation, than it does to the observability of anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for some concrete examples. What is the observability of the Facebook news algorithm? What is the observability of the Twitter feed? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score">What is the observability of our credit score?</a> <a href="http://doc.wi.gov/about/doc-overview/office-of-the-secretary/office-of-reentry/compas-assessment-tool">How observable is COMPAS as it evaluates its risk score for whether a criminal offender will reoffend?</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation">How observable is Chicago's food inspection algorithm?</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">How observable is the RSA algorithm which drives cryptography?</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading">How observable is algorithmic trading across stock markets?</a>&nbsp;These are just a handful of some relatable algorithms&nbsp;when in reality there are numerous micro impacts of algorithms felt each moment, of each day, as we navigate our worlds.</p>
<p>I do not think there are easy answers when it comes to <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">algorithmic transparency</a>. This is just my attempt to understand how APIs can be put to work making the algorithms that are increasingly governing our reality more observable. I spend a lot of time trying to make sense of the very obscure things like cloud and social. What are they? What can you do with them? Do they do what they promise? When do things change? <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/16/trying-to-define-api-awareness/">I shared a version of this list for folks on the outside to develop API awareness</a>. Now,, this is my recommendations for what companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies can do to make the data, content, and algorithms they use more observable--not just for our benefit, for yours as well.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2017</span>
        <p>If you are selling a service you should have an API. It is something you hear me talk about a lot here on the blog. I push on this subject because it is important, and there are numerous API service providers out there who do not have an API&nbsp;or choose to not make them available. In a DevOps,&nbsp;continuous integration world, we need the entire stack to have APIs--making our API platforms programmatic, just like the data, content, and algorithms we are making available via the APIs we are deploying.</p>
<p>If you need an example of this in the wild, <a href="http://tyk.management.apievangelist.com/">you don't have to look much further than my partner in crime Tyk</a>, who have a simple API for their API gateway--no matter where you deploy the gateway, you can manage it using it's APIs. The&nbsp;Tyk&nbsp;API Gateway API provides you with a base set of paths for you to manage your gateway.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/tyk_io_logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="left" /></p>
<p>An open source, lightweight, fast and scalable API Gateway. Set rate limiting, request throttling, and auto-renewing request quotas to manage how your users access your API. Tyk supports access tokens, HMAC request signing, basic authentication and OAuth 2.0 to integrate old and new services easily. Tyk can record and store detailed analytics which can be segmented by user, error, endpoint and client ID across multiple APIs and versions. Integrate your existing or new applications with Tyk using a simple REST API, Tyk even support hot-reloads so you can introduce new services without downtime.</p>

<p>The Tyk&nbsp;API Gateway provides a base set of API management features that can be deployed in the cloud, on-premise, or on-device. Making the key ingredients for API management programmable.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_25_at_9.00.37_pm.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></p>
<p>Tyk's&nbsp;API Gateway represents just one component in any API operation's toolbox. <a href="https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-swagger-definitions/blob/master/tyk_gateway_api.yml">Tyk also provides an OpenAPI for the API gateway</a>&nbsp;making things much more plug and play as part of any API life cycle--something <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kinlane/tyk-api-management/master/_data/api-commons/tyk/apis.json">I've made even more discoverable using APIs.json</a>. Their approach provides a nice blueprint that all API providers should be following--well-defined APIs for all your services (open source if you can ;-).</p>
<p>I track on any service or tool I include in my research like it has an API. If it does have an API, I profile it like I did with Tyk. If it doesn't, I will harass them until they have an API. If you are building tools, or selling services to the API space, you should have an API, as well as provide OpenAPI and APIs.json definitions for all your goods.</p>

<p>I am approaching seven years doing API Evangelist. <a href="http://apievangelist.com">I have over 70 areas of my core API lifecycle research available on the website</a>&nbsp;and have four of those areas (<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">definitions</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, &amp; <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>) that I've been publishing industry guides for the last couple of years. In 2017, I want to take those guides, and hopefully a handful of other research areas to the next level. My guides have always been about the&nbsp;quantity of information, over the quality of the final guide. I want to turn that on its head and focus on the&nbsp;quality of information and presentation over the quantity, publishing an executive summary of each of my API industry research areas.</p>
<p>With my new guide, I am looking to add a touch of design, but I'm also looking to expand&nbsp;the exposure and storytelling opportunities for my partners in the space. Using Adobe In Design I have been able to handle the design enhancements, but I am in need of help making sure my industry guide are ready for consumption by a wider, and more mainstream audience--this is where you come in. I need your feedback. Seriously, I need you to help me with everything copy editing to being&nbsp;an overall critic--let me know what works and what doesn't--I'm looking to make this a community affair.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/">My API Definition research operates as a Github repository</a>, providing access to the data and content behind each area. I use <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">the Github Issues</a> for each of my API research like I would for any other project I'm managing using Github. If you have the time, I would be grateful if you would take look at my API definition guide&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">and submit a single Github issue with your&nbsp;feedback</a>,. I'm even willing to give some exposure in each edition, thanking the folks who helped out in the 'about page' of the guide. Also, if you help out enough I'd be willing to give one of the sponsor slots to your company, project, product, or service--seriously, I want this to be a community effort.</p>
<p>After&nbsp;a couple of weeks of beta testing each guide, and gathering feedback, I will be packaging the guide up for distribution through my partners, Amazon, and other distribution channels. I would really appreciate your help in fine tuning my work&nbsp;and making it something worthy of a more mainstream audience. I'll be repeating this process with my other industry guides for API design, deployment, and management. This will open up even further opportunities for exposure (if you are into that kind of thing). While the research portions of these guides are derived from my research, I'm looking for the stories, overall tone, and sponsor slots to be a community thing, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">so submit a Github issue</a>, and let me know what you think--I really, really appreciate it.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/27/an-example-of-an-api-service-provider-using-hypermedia/">An Example Of An API Service Provider Using Hypermedia</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aws-api-gateway-icon.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>There&nbsp;is a growing number of hypermedia APIs available in the wild these days. However there aren't a lot of examples of hypermedia API service providers making the API lifecycle&nbsp;more dynamic and living. When people ask me for examples of hypermedia APIs out there I like to have a handful of URLs I can share with them, providing a diverse set they can consider as part of their own operations.</p>
<p>One really good example of an API service provider putting hypermedia to use is Amazon Web Services--specifically with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/">the AWS API Gateway</a>. &nbsp;AWS describes it best in the documentation&nbsp;for the gateway API:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Amazon API Gateway web service is a resource-based API that uses Hypertext Application Language (HAL). HAL provides a standard way for expressing the resources and relationships of an API as hyperlinks. Using HAL, you use HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) to submit requests and receive information about the API in the response. Applications can use the information returned to explore the functionality of the API.</em></p>
<p>If you have used other common AWS APIs like EC2 or S3, then you know that they aren't the best designed APIs out there. They provide a lot of functionality&nbsp;but leave a lot to be desired when it comes to the actual design. The AWS API Gateway API is a well designed, highly functional API for managing the operations of your API. With each API call, you get the desired response, along with a collection of links defining what else is possible.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7e8fd8654b0b76eeda769862c59cb10d.js"></script>
<p>I wish that all tools in our API toolbox were designed like the AWS API Gateway is. In this single API call you can see how hypermedia contributes to the life cycle of any API being managed. You can manage access, and evolve into a staging or production environment, and the other possibilities available when each resource is put to work. Instead of having to go back to the API documentation to learn what options are available, they are given to you in a tailored collection of links.</p>
<p><a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/apis/">I have already added the AWS API Gateway to my list of hypermedia APIs</a>, but I will now also be referencing as a blueprint of an API service provider who is putting hypermedia to work in their API design. I think hypermedia helps make applications be more&nbsp;flexible&nbsp;and resilient, and I also think hypermedia does the same at the API level, allowing us to more honestly manage change across the API lifecycle.</p>

<p>I was playing with one of the <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment solutions</a> that I track on, appropriately called <a href="https://api-platform.com/">API Platform</a>. It is an open source PHP solution for defining, designing, and deploying your linked data APIs. I thought their list of features provided a pretty sophisticated look at what an API can be, and was something I wanted to share.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>&nbsp;API in minutes</li>
<li><a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/">Hydra</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>&nbsp;native support</li>

<li>100% open source (MIT)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of key elements here. API definition-driven with JSON-LD, Hydra, HAL, and OpenAPI Spec out of box. Containerized. Schema.org FTW! JWT, and OAuth. OWASP's security checklist. Postman Ready! These features make for a pretty compelling approach to <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">designing</a> and <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deploying</a> your APIs. While I see some of these features in other platforms, it is the first with an open source solution possessing such an impressive resume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to take this list and add to my list of API design, and deployment building blocks in my research. These are features that other API deployment solutions should be considering as part of their offering. This approach to API deployment may not be the right answer for every type of API, but I know many data and content focused APIs thatwouldl benefit significantly from a deployment solution like <a href="https://api-platform.com/">API Platform</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-two-arrows.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I was having a conversation about whether I should be putting my API definition or my API design work first--which comes earlier in the lifecycle of an API? The conclusion was to put definition first because you need a common set of definitions to work with when designing your API(s). You need definitions like HTTP and HTTP/2. In, 2017 you should be employing definitions like OpenAPI Spec, and JSON Schema. These definitions help set the tone of your API design process.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the biggest benefits of designing, developing, and operating APIs on the web has been forcing developers to pick up their heads and pay attention to what everybody else is doing and wanting. I suffer from this. Doing web APIs, providing my own, and consuming 3rd party APIs forces me to pay attention to providers and consumers outside my bubble--this is good.</p>
<p>Common definitions help us elevate the design of our APIs by leveraging common concepts, standards, and schema. Every time you employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a>, you have to think about folks in another time zone. Every time you use ISO 4217, you have to think about people who buy and sell their products and services in a different currency than you. When you use <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>, your <a href="http://schema.org/PostalAddress">postal addresses considers the world beyond just US zip codes,</a> and consider a world wid web of commerce.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">I am placing definitions before design in my API research listing</a>. In reality, I think this is just a cycle. Common definitions feed my design process, and the more experienced I get with design, the more robust my toolbox of API definitions gets. Ultimately this depends on what I'm calling a definition, but for the sake of this story <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">I am considering the building blocks of the web as the first line of definition</a><a href="http://webconcepts.info/">s</a>, then secondarily the definitions that are using OpenAPI Spec and JSON Schema as the next line of definitions. Definitions influence my design process, and the design process is refining the definitions that I am putting to work. </p>

<p>I have a regular call with a really smart API person who is trying to move forward a really cool project for the API space. It is some thought provoking voodoo and I need to be able to write about it--this is how I flush out my thoughts and move forward. He is not quite ready to talk about his project publicly, so I will just talk about and explore in terms of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist research</a> and how it applies to the area(s) of the API space he is looking to make an impact.</p>
<p>This topic spans several areas of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API research</a>, but if I had to give it a single label I would call it API awareness. When you hear me talk about my monitoring the API space, API awareness is the result. I wanted to try and communicate this from my vantage point but also share with other analysts, practitioners, and even the average individual online today. This is my attempt to distil my approach to monitoring the API space and establishing a sustained awareness of APIs at any level.</p>
<p><strong>Individual ("Normals")</strong><br />It may sound crazy to you, but everyone should be API aware. No, they should be paying attention to APIs like I do, or even at the level of the average individual working in the tech sector, but they should have a baseline awareness, and here is my attempt at quantifying that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs Exist </strong>- Everyone should be aware that APIs exist, and hopefully have one or two examples of what they can do in their business or personal lives -- even if it's' just pulling tweets, photos, or getting news updates via an RSS feed.</li>
<li><strong>API Integration</strong> - Everyone should be aware that they can move data and content between the online services they use and depend on. If you know APIs exist and are aware of services like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> or <a href="http://datafire.io">Datafire</a>, you will be more successful in what you do online.
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Portability -</strong> All online services should allow for the downloading of their data, allowing for the portability of all users data and content.</li>
<li><strong>API Discovery - </strong>With a low-level awareness of APIs and what is possible, the average individual should regularly be introduced to new APIs, and be given simple tooling and services for helping them in their discovery.
<ul>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Everyone should get exposed to what other people are doing with APIs, and be informed about new and interesting ways to get things done for fun or business.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals</strong> - Individuals within a company, institution, or online that can help with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Organizations</strong> - Organizations that can help individuals with API needs.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong> - Meetups, conferences and other events to learn about APIs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The more we expose the average person to APIs, the more they will be able to absorb and understand. I've turned hundreds of average, non-technical folks on to the concept of APIs, and have seen them become evangelists and even API practitioners. Some move into API focused roles, but many are just are more successful in what they are already doing, from social media work to sending out their weekly newsletter.</p>
<p>I've always put API awareness for individuals into the same bucket as financial awareness. You shouldn't have an awareness of the inner workings of banking and credit industry, but you should have an awareness that you have accounts, who has access to them, and that you can move money around, and have different accounts for different purposes, with different providers--the same applies to the world of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>API Practioners ("Not Normals")</strong><br />When I first started writing this post, I had this section broken up into three groups: 1) Provider, 2) Service Provider, and 3) Analysts. Much of it ended up being redundant, so I'm going to share the complete list of what contributes to my API awareness, and depending on where you exist in the API spectrum (gonna have to use this one more), what matters to you will vary. </p>
<p>This is a master dump of my research, and the approach I have used to track on in the world of APIs since 2010--an analyst 100K view. However, API providers, service providers, evangelists, and analysts should possess a similar level of awareness--maybe not at the scope I pay attention to but employing some of the same tactics, applied to a smaller group of APIs either internally or externally. Here is what I'd consider a comprehensive definition of my API awareness stack.</p>

<p>API awareness spans many stops along the API lifecycle, and across a variety of the most common, and critical building blocks of what drives API ecosystems. Awareness doesn't come easy. It takes time, and have access to the right information, and signals, potentially across many different entities and domains--aggregating, filtering, and ranking is essential developing and strengthening your awareness. In the end, even with the same signals and information available, there will be many definitions of what is the necessary awareness.</p>
<p>I am glad I didn't break this into different buckets for different people. I think that is a dangerous thing for us to do. I think people should be curious and have agency the decisions regarding which signals should feed their awareness. How many APIs. Which APIs. Which companies, news, events, and other areas. Investment, patents, and other legal aspects. I don't think that all individual should be bombarded with the more complex inner workings of the API industry I pay attention to, but they should be able to make the decision to move beyond a basic level of understanding, and become an evangelist, or analyst--quantifying and developing the awareness they desire or need to achieve.</p>
<p>I'll stop there. This is a good first draft of what I consider API awareness. At the individual API level, across a collection or industry of APIs, and even at the analyst levels, potentially paying attention to many different APIs across a variety of different industries. Before I put this definition down, I am going to take it and apply it in two other ways: 1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">Observability, "measure for how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs"</a>, and 2) Rating, "establish a rating system that articulates where an API or provider exists on awareness and observability spectrum". We'll see where it goes. Thinking about this voodoo is helping me better organize some of the existing parts of my research, and hopefully help my friend out in his work as well. </p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/walled_garden_blue_gray_circuit.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>It is a common tactic of older software companies to offer open source, services, and tools in a way that all roads just lead into their walled garden. There are many ways to push vendor lock-in and the big software vendors from 2000 through 2010 have mastered how to route you back to their walled gardens and make sure you stay there. Web APIs have set into motion a shift in how we architect our web, mobile, and device applications, as well as providing services to the life cycle that are behind the operation of these web APIs. While this change has the potential to positive it often it can be very difficult to tell apart the newer breed of software companies from the legacy version, amidst all the hype around technology and startups.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/14/api-lifemiddlewarecycle-api/">I've been having conversations recently which are pushing me to think more about middleware</a>, or what I'd refer to as API life cycle tooling. In my opinion, these are companies who are selling services and tools to the API life cycle, which in turn is fueling our web, mobile, device, and other applications. In my opinion, as a server provider, you should be selling to a company and API provider's life cycle needs, not your walled garden needs. I understand that you want all of a companies business, and you want to lock them into your platform, but that was how we did business 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The API service providers I'm shining a light on in 2017 are servicing one or <a href="http://apievangelist.com">many stops along the API life cycle</a>, supporting API definitions, and providing value without getting in the way, or locking customers in. They do this on-premise, or in the cloud of your choice, and allow you to seamless overlap many different API service providers providing a variety of solutions across the API life cycle. You will notice this patterns in the companies I partner with like <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">Tyk</a>, and <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">Dreamfactory</a>. I find I have a lot more patience when it comes to the whole startup thing if your service is plug and play and us API providers can choose where and when we want to put your tools and services to use.</p>
<p>I want my API service providers to behave just like they recommend to their customers--modular, flexible, agile, and providing a mix of valuable API resources I can use across my own API lifecycle. You'll find me doing more highlighting of what I consider to be API life cycle service providers who bring value to the API life cycle, with API definitions like the OpenAPI Spec as the center of their operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://box-api-navigator.com/files?init=true"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_13_at_10.20.02_pm.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://box-api-navigator.com/files?init=true">The document platform Box updated their developer efforts recently</a>, helping push&nbsp;forward the definition of what API documentation can be. I've long been advocating moving APIs out from the shadow of the developer portal, and make it more seamless with any UI, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/24/the-api-behind-every-feature-in-the-user-interface/">kind of like CloudFlare does with their DNS dashboard</a>. There is no reason the API should have to be&nbsp;hidden from users--it should be right behind the UI for everyone to discover.</p>
<p>Box does this. You can interact with files just like it is the regular interface. When push the get the folder items, upload file, or other option available to you in the documentation--you get example API request and response in the right-hand column. It is a blend of a regular UI, and some of the attractive and interface documentation we've seen emerge lately like <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc">ReDoc</a>. Making it easy to see and understand what an API does, while speaking in the context of solving a relevant problem for a human.</p>
<p>API documentation doesn't have to be overly technical and boring. It can look like a regular user interface, and the API can be right behind the UI curtain, providing a snapshot of the requests and responses that are doing the heavy lifting behind. I'm finally seeing the movement I have wanted to see with API documentation in 2017. I'm feeling like this is going to be common theme with the world of APIs for all of us--we will never see things move as fast as we want, but eventually the world evolves, and we will see investment in the areas that make a difference on the ground at API operations, and for the consumers who are putting APIs to work in their regular world.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/14/api-lifemiddlewarecycle-api/">API Life(middleware)Cycle API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_gear_life_cycle.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I have had a series of calls with an analyst group lately, discussing the overall API landscape in 2017. They have a lot of interesting questions about the space, and I enjoyed their level of curiosity and awareness around what is going on--it helps me think through this stuff, and (hopefully) better explain it to folks who aren't immersed in API like I am. </p>
<p>This particular group is coming at it from a middleware perspective and trying to understand what APIs have done to the middleware market, and what opportunities exist (if at all). This starting point for an API conversation got me thinking about the concept of middleware in contrast to, or in relationship to what I'm seeing emerge as the services and tooling for the API life cycle.</p>
<p>Honestly, when I jumped on this call I Googled the term middleware to provide me with a fresh definition. Middleware: software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications, especially on a network. What does that mean in the age of API? Did API replace this? There is middleware for deploying APIs from backend systems. There is middleware for brokering, proxying and providing a gateway for APIs. Making middleware as a term pretty irrelevant. I think middle traditionally meant a bridge between backend and the frontend, where web APIs make things omnidirectional--in the middle of many different directions and outcomes.</p>
<p>The answer to the question of what has API done to middleware is just "added dimensions to its surface area". Where is the opportunity? "All along the API lifecycle". Middleware (aka services & tooling) is popping up through the life cycle to help design, deploy, manage, test, monitor, integrate, and numerous other stops along the API life cycle. All the features of our grandfathers API gateway are now available as a microservices buffet, allowing us to weave middleware nuggets into any system to system integrations as well as other web, mobile, and device applications. </p>
<p>Middleware as a concept has been distilled down into its smallest possible unit of value, made available via an API, deployed in a virtualized environment of your choosing, on the web, on-premise, or on-device. This new approach to delivering services, and tooling is often still in the middle, but the word really doesn't do it justice anymore. I wanted to go through all the areas of my research and look for any signs of middleware or its ghost.</p>
<p>Some of the common areas of my research that I think fits pretty nicely with some earlier concepts of what middleware does or can do. I would say that <a href="http://database.apievangelist.com/">Database</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">Deployment</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com/">Virtualization</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">Management</a>, <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com/">Documentation</a>, <a href="http://change-log.apievangelist.com/">Change Log</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">Testing</a>, <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com/">Performance</a>, <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com/">Authentication</a>, <a href="http://encryption.apievangelist.com/">Encryption</a>, <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">Security</a>, <a href="http://command-line-interface.apievangelist.com/">Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com/">Logging</a>, <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com/">Analysis</a>, and <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">Aggregation</a> are some pretty clear targets. Of course, this is just my view of what middleware was to me, from say 1995 through 2007--after that, everything began to shift because of APIs.</p>
<p>As web APIs evolve the reason you'd buy or sell a tool or service to be in the middle of some meaningful action when APIs started being about <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">Software Development Kit (SDK)</a>, <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com/">Embeddable</a>, <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">Visualization</a>, <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com/">Webhooks</a>, <a href="http://ipaas.apievangelist.com/">iPaaS</a>, <a href="http://orchestration.apievangelist.com/">Orchestration</a>, <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">Real Time</a>, <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">Voice</a>, <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">Spreadsheets</a>,<span> </span><a href="http://communication.apievangelist.com/">Communication</a>, <a href="http://support.apievangelist.com/">Support</a>, <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/">Containers</a>, <a href="http://serverless.apievangelist.com/">Serverless</a>,  and <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/">Bots</a>. This is where things really begain working in many different directions, making the term middle seem antiquated to me. You are now having to think beyond just any single application, and all your middleware is now very modular, API-driven, and can be plugged in anywhere along the life cycle not just any application, but also any API -- mind blown. </p>
<p>The schism in middleware for me began<a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/13/the-reasons-why-we-pull-back-the-curtain-on-technology/"> when companies started cracking open the SDK and were using HTTP to give access to important resources</a> like compute with storage with AWS, and SMS with Twilio, offering a peek behind the curtain for developers. Then further expanding to regular humans with embeddable tooling, iPaaS with services like Zapier, and other services and tools that anyone can implement, no coding necessary. All of this was fueled by mobile, and the need to break down the data, content, and algorithms for use in these mobile applications. Things have quickly gone from backend to frontend, to everywhere to everywhere. How do you get in the middle of that?</p>
<p>Anyways. I'm guessing this story might be a little incoherent. I'm just trying to find my words for future conversations on this topic. As the regular world is confronted with this API thing, they have a lot of questions, and they need help understanding how we got here. Honestly, I feel like I don't fully have a grasp on how we got here. So writing about it helps me to think through this stuff, and polish it a little bit for the next round of conversations.</p>

Part of this work I had left a note for myself about finding / creating an OpenAPI Spec for the Data.gov API, which since it is a CKAN implementation should be pretty easy--I hoped.</p>

More <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2017/02/introducing-hubcommander.html">companies like Netflix are using as part of their continuous integration workflow</a>, something&nbsp;that<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/05/evolving-the-api-sdk-with-apimatic-dx-kits/">&nbsp;API service providers like APIMATIC are looking to take advantage of with a new wave of services and tooling</a>. This usage of Github goes well beyond just managing code, and are making the platform more of an engine in any continuous&nbsp;integration and API life cycle workflow.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist">I run all my API research project sites on Github</a>. I do this because it is secure&nbsp;and static, as well as introduces a very potent way to not just manage a single website, but over 200 individual open data and API projects. Each one of my API research areas leverages a Github Jeykll core, providing a machine readable index of the companies, news, tools, and other building blocks I'm aggregating throughout my research.</p>
<p>Recently, this approach has moved beyond the core areas of my API research&nbsp;and is something I'm applying to my API discovery work, profiling the resources available with <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">popular API platforms like Amazon Web Services</a>, and <a href="http://gsa.index.apievangelist.com/">across my government work like with my GSA index</a>. Each of these projects managed using Github, providing a machine readable index of the disparate APiI, in a single APIs.json index which includes OpenAPI Specs for each of the APIs included. When complete, these indexes can provide a runtime discovery engine of APIs&nbsp;used as part of integrations, providing an&nbsp;index of single APIs, as well as potentially across many distributed APiI brought together into a single meaningful collection.</p>
<p>I've started pushing this approach even further with <a href="http://adopta.agency">my Knight Foundation funded Adopta.Agency work</a>, and making the Github repository not just a machine-readable index of many APIs, I'm also using the _data folder as a JSON or YAML data store, which can then also be indexed as part of the APIs.json&nbsp;and OpenAPI Spec for each project. <a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/">I've been playing with different ways of storing and working with JSON and YAML in Jekyll on Github for a while now</a>, but now I'm <a href="http://jekyll.open.referral.adopta.agency/">trying to develop projects that are a seamless open data store, as well as an API index, providing the best of both worlds</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a model for delivering high performance and availability APIs. This is a model for publishing and sharing open data so that it is highly available, workable, and hosted on Github for FREE. Most of the data I work with is publicly available. It is part of what I believe in, and how I work on a regular basis. Making it available in a Github repo allows it to be forked, or even consumed directly while offloading bandwidth and storage costs to Github. The GET layer for all my open data project is all static, and dead simple to work with. Next, I'm working on a truly RESTfully augmented layer providing&nbsp;the POST, PUT, and DELETE, as well as more advanced search solutions.</p>
<p>I am using the Github API for this augmented layer. I am just playing with different ways to proxy it&nbsp;and deliver the best search results possible. The POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE layer for each Github repository data store in the _data folder is pretty straightforward. My goal is to offload as much of the payload to Github as possible, but then augment what it can't do when it comes to more advanced usage. I'm looking for each API index and data store can act as a forkable engine for a variety of stops along the API life cycle, as well as throughout the delivery of the web, mobile, and device-based applications we are building on top of them.</p>

<p>I was trying to explain to a business analyst this week the difference between SDK and API, which he said was often used interchangeably by people he worked with. In my opinion SDK and API can be the same thing, depending on how you see this layer of our web, mobile, and device connectivity. The Internet has been rapidly expanding this layer for some time now, and unless you are watching it really don't see any difference between API and SDK--it is just where the software connects everything.</p>
<p>For me, an SDK is where the data, content&nbsp;and algorithmic production behind the curtain is packaged up for you -- giving you a pre-defined&nbsp;look at what is possible, prepared for you with a specific language or platform in mind. Most of the hard work of understanding what is going on has been translated and crafted, providing you with a set of instructions of what you can do with this resource in your application--your integration is pretty rigidly defined, not much experimentation or hacking encouraged.</p>
<p>An API has many of the same characteristics as an SDK, but the curtain is pulled back on the production a little bit more. Not entirely, but you do get a little more of a look at how things work, what data and content are available, and algorithmic resources are accessible. You still get the view which a provider intends you to have, but there are&nbsp;fewer assumptions about what you'll do with the resources put on the interface, leaving you to do more of the heavy lifting with how these resources will get put to use.</p>
<p>Most of the early motivations behind choosing an open approach to web APIs over more closed and as proprietary SDK, pulling back the curtain on how we develop software, weren't entirely intentional. Companies like Flickr and Twitter weren't trying to make their mark on the politics of how we integrate software, they were busy and looking to encourage 3rd party developers to do the hard work of crafting the SDKs, and other platform integrations. The reasons for pulling back the curtain on how the sauce is made was purely about furthering their own needs, and not necessarily about moving the needle forward regarding how we talk about software integration--it was just business, enabled by tech (HTTP), and the politics came later, as a sort of side-effect.</p>
<p>Many traditional software developers&nbsp;and software-enabled hardware manufacturers have a hard time seeing this expansion in how we integrate with software&nbsp;and are usually still very SDK oriented, even if there are many APIs right behind their SDK curtain. They do this for a variety of technical, business, as well as political reason. It is my personal mission to help these folks understand a little more about this expansion in the software connectivity layer, and the benefits brought to the table by being more open. We need the client integration (SDK) and API to be loosely coupled from a technical, business, and political stance--to make things work in a web-enabled environment.</p>
<p>It isn't easy to help business folk see the importance of leaving this layer open. This is the damaging effects of the Oracle vs. Google Java Copyright, is it gums up and slows this expansion, something we need to encourage&nbsp;and keep open, even if the&nbsp;bigtechcos&nbsp;don't fully get it. We are going to need this momentum to not just keep the web, mobile, and device integration accessible and loosely coupled, but we will also need to help make sure the growing number of algorithms that are impacting our worlds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">are more observable as well</a>. Providers aren't going to be willing to pull back the curtain on the smoke and mirrors that are&nbsp;AI, machine learning, and other algorithmic varietals infecting our lives.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why we pull back (or don't) the curtain on technology, at the application, SDK, API, or&nbsp;algorithmic levels. I don't count on companies, institutions, and government agencies to ever do this for the right reasons. I'm counting on them doing it for all the wrong reasons. I am looking at incentivizing their competitors to do it, helping influence policy or law to direct the systems to behave in a certain way, and encourage companies to be lazy, and keep the curtain pulled back because it's easier. Getting a peek behind the curtain, or convincing some to pull it back is never a straightforward conversation--you often have to use many of the same tactics and voodoo employed by tech providers to get what you want.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/01/amazon-dash-ok-idea-dumb-implementations/">I have been kvetching about the quality of embeddable tooling out there</a>, so I'm working on&nbsp;discovering anything interesting. I started with bookmarklets, which I think is one of the most underutilized, and simplest examples of working with APIs on the web. Here are a couple of interesting bookmarklets for APIs out there:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/web/bookmarklet">Twitter</a></strong> - Probably the most iconic API and bookmarklet out there -- share to Twitter.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://pinboard.in/howto/">Pinboard</a></strong> - An API-driven bookmarklet for saving bookmarks that I use every day.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://jonudell.net/h/">Hypothesis</a></strong> - A whole suite of API-driven bookmarklets for annotating the web.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/bookmarklet.html">Socrata</a></strong> - A pretty cool bookmarklet for quickly viewing documentation on datasets.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://tincanapi.com/bookmarklet/">Tin Can API</a></strong> - A bookmarklet for recording self-directed learning experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you search for API bookmarklets you don't get much. Nothing stands out as being innovative. I will keep looking when I have time, and I'll keep curating and understanding any new approaches, and examples, and tooling when possible.</p>
<p>Ultimately it just confounds me, because a simple JS bookmarklet triggering one or more API interactions is a no brainer. We have examples of this in action, making an impact on login, sharing, annotation, and more, so why don't we have more examples? IDK. It is something I'll explore as I push forward my embeddable API research.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just missing something...</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time looking for logos of the companies that I write about. A lack of consistency around how companies manage (or don't) their logos, and make them available (or don't) regularly frustrates the hell out of me. While doing my regular work I found myself Googling for the Schema.org logl -- what came up made me smile.</p>
<p>When you Google for Schema.org logo you don't get the logo for Schema.org, <a href="https://schema.org/logo">you get the schema for a logo</a>, which is the image property of a thing&nbsp;and is used by brands, organizations, places, products, and services. I still had to actually do a separate search to find the Schema.org logo, but it did make me smile, and make me think even deeper about how we manage (or don't) our bits online.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org is so important</a>. It keeps popping up on my radar, and I'm seeing more examples of it being used as part of JSON-LD API and web search implementations. As I work on my <a href="http://openreferral.org/">human services data specification&nbsp;(HSDS)</a> project I'm going to carve off time to weave JSON-LD and Schema.org into my storytelling. I can't just show people Schema.org and expect them to understand the importance, I'm going to have to show them with meaningful examples of it working out in the wild.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/service-level-agreements-for-researchers-who-depend-on-apis/">I wrote about the need for service level agreements dedicated to researchers who are depending on APIs a couple weeks ago</a>, and while I was doing <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">my work profiling of AWS</a>, I came across their approach to supporting research. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/">Amazon has a dedicated program research and technical computing on AWS</a>, where they:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"helps researchers process complex workloads by providing the cost-effective, scalable and secure compute, storage and database capabilities needed to accelerate time-to-science. With AWS, scientists can quickly analyze massive data pipelines, store petabytes of data and share their results with collaborators around the world, focusing on science not servers."</em></p>
<p>Amazon has three distinct ways in which they are helping researchers, as well as the industries and people they impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/research-cloud-program/">AWS Research Cloud Program</a></strong> - The AWS Research Cloud Program helps you focus on science, not servers---all with minimal effort and confidence that your data and budget are safe in the AWS Cloud. Government and education-based researchers are eligible to receive program benefits. Apply to join the program, in order to access the AWS Research Cloud Handbook and other cloud resources built for researchers, by researchers.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/nsf-aribd/">AWS Research Initiative</a></strong> - The AWS Research Initiative (ARI) brings Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) together, with AWS providing AWS Cloud Services through provision of AWS Promotional Credits, awarded to NSF grant applicants to leverage Critical Techniques, Technologies and Methodologies for Advancing Foundations and Applications of Big Data Sciences and Engineering (BIGDATA).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/open-data/">Open Data</a></strong> - Organizations around the globe are increasingly making their data open and available for the public to discover, access, and use. This is fueling entrepreneurship, accelerating scientific discovery, and creating efficiencies across many industries. Amazon Web Services provides a comprehensive tool kit for sharing and analyzing data at any scale.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon helps researchers by providing them with cloud resources for doing their research, assisting them with the budget of it all, while also opening you up to other grant opportunities, as well as can provide you with a place to publish and share your open data, and put data from other researchers to work in your research. It sounds like a pretty fine start to a more formal API researcher &nbsp;blueprint that other API providers can consider as part of their own operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I have a base definition crafted (thanks, AWS!). I'll spend time looking for other implementations in the wild. Once I have a strong enough blueprint crafted, I want to start lobbying Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other leading social data platforms to consider. The data on these platforms&nbsp;provides an important look at the world around us, one that researchers should have access to, without costs, rate limits, or other obstacles in their way. Amazon's motivations in offering this type of package are clear--they want researchers to become customers. When it comes to other providers, I'm going to have to experiment with other incentive models--I am guessing they won't always be happy to get on board.</p>
<p>I will keep polishing the building blocks of my API research program as I find other examples of this. Once I have it refined a little more I will publish as one of my industry guides. Providing a basic blueprint that any company can follow when setting up their own API program for research, but also make it something any individual looking to lobby for this kind of change can use as well. Amidst all the capitalist frenzy within the tech bubbles, it isn't always easy to convince folks of the importance of this type of access--especially when it costs them money.</p>

API management always resembled its older cousin the API gateway for me, so <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">when companies like 3Scale</a> started offering a freemium model, that I could deploy in the cloud&nbsp;with a couple lines of code---I jumped on the API management bandwagon. It was easy&nbsp;and gave you all the service composition, onboarding, analytics, and metering tools you needed out of the box.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">I have been pushing on providers to provide an open source API management solution for quite some time</a>, and providers like <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a> finally stepped up to bring an enterprise-grade solution to the table, then solutions like <a href="https://apiumbrella.io/">API Umbrella</a> also emerged for the government. Now in 2017, we have several open source solutions available to us, which makes me happy, but what I really like is how modular, versatile, and API-driven they are. I'm spending time learning more about my partner's solutions, and today <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">I'm working my way through what is possible with Tyk</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://tyk.io">Tyk is what API management should be</a>. It has all the user and organization management and assists you with the onboarding, authentication, service composition, rate limiting, and analytics that are core to any API management solution. However, what is really powerful for me is that you can deploy Tyk anywhere in the cloud, on-premise, on-device, and all of its features are API-driven, and interconnected because of it's APIs, webhooks, and other orchestration features. APIs aren't just about deploying a web API on a server, and making it available through a single base URL--they are everywhere, and our management tools need to reflect this.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/tyk_variants_1200px.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>We don't just have a single API stack anymore and we use a handful of 3rd party APIs. We are weaving together many different internal and partner stacks, as well a mess of 3rd party solutions. Tyk is your simple API management on a device, in your data center, or in the cloud. Tyk is also part of your API stack--the API management layer portion. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/28/the-lack-of-an-api-and-healthy-partner-integrations-is-an-early-warning-system-for-service-providers/">I am constantly pushing on API providers to practice what they preach and make everything they do API first</a>--Tyk is that. All the resources for the applications you build should be APIs, and all the infrastructure you use to design, deploy, manage, and orchestrate those APIs should be APIs--if you are a service provider in the space without an API, you will not be competitive.</p>
<p>Anyways, full disclosure and all -- Tyk is my partner. I'm writing about them because they give me money. However, I am not in the business of taking money to write about products that don't offer a real solution. All four of the logos you see on the left hand of my site are companies with products that I believe in, otherwise, I wouldn't take money from them. Tyk's approach to API management&nbsp;represents where I think things should be. Open source. Modular. Composable. And, you pay for complexity and scale. API management being commoditized&nbsp;is a win for everyone in my opinion, but it's been a long road to get here, with a lot of casualties along the way. ;-)</p>

<p>It was an interesting journey getting the API specification formerly known as Swagger into the Linux foundation last year. After SmartBear donated the spec to the newly formed <a href="http://openapis.org">Open API Initiative</a>, I was considering joining the governing body behind the spec, but with all I had going on last year, I didn't feel it was the right time. Participating in governance groups hasn't really ever been my thing, and there are a handful of large organizations involved, and who am I really? I'm just a single person ranting about APIs. However, in 2017 I am changing my tune and will be joining the Open API Initiative (OAI)</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/19/focusing-on-common-api-definitions-schema-scopes-and-specifications/">It is an important time for API definitions</a>, and there is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/what-is-at-stake-with-api-definitions-at-the-moment/">a lot riding on the success of OpenAPI, as well as API definitions in general</a>. I feel like we need as many voices at the table as we possibly can. We need government agencies, enterprise, small businesses, startups, and individual analysts like myself. I feel pretty strongly that API definitions should be openly licensed, accessible, and following the most commonly used patterns available to us across the API sector. We don't need to all be speaking a different language when it comes to deploying compute resources or working with images, and API definitions are how we get there.</p>
<p>After a ramping up period, I will work with OAI on their marketing strategy, helping tell stories, and learn about interesting implementations and use cases when possible--dovetailing nicely with what I am already doing. I'll be tuned into the conversation about the spec, but will definitely be standing off to the side as an observer for quite some time. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/the-openapi-specification-version-30-highlights/">I'm pretty stoked with what they've done with version 3.0 of the spec</a>, and at this point, I have a lot to learn before I open up my mouth and chime in on anything. I'm just enjoying watching the personalities play out in the Slack room--this stuff should be a reality TV show, but that is another story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It makes me happy to be part of the Open API Initiative (OAI). As I work on my regular API Evangelist research, and move forward projects like <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral,</a> and their Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), the OpenAPI Specification is critical to everything I am doing. The OAI is extremley important right now, and I'm pleased to have a seat at the table of such an important organization, and learning from the other smart folks moving the specification forward. 2017 will be an interesting year for not just the OpenAPI Spec, but for all the services and topen tooling that is being built on the spec, as well as the wide range of industries being touch by APIs, and putting common API specifications, and schema to work.</p>

<p class="p1">I was a regular check-in&nbsp;with one of my favorite API service providers this week, talking about some of the new features they are rolling out in coming weeks, and they demonstrated for me why API definitions are so important in 2017. &nbsp;<a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> got their start deploying SDKs for your API, but have quickly moved into providing API documentation, testing, continuous integration, and some additional stops that they have planned for release in coming months.</p>
<p class="p1">As I was sharing how happy I was with their movement into new areas of the API life cycle, and praising their agility&nbsp;when it came to rolling out new features, they responded with:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The credit goes to machine-readable descriptions. Once you have them then there are endless possibilities. Thanks for motivating us to support all the description formats in first place :-)"</em></p>
<p class="p1">This is why being fluent in API definitions is so important to operating your API, or in APIMATIC's case, operating as an API service provider. There are an increasing number of API providers who support the importing and exporting of API definitions, but nobody has gone full API definition as APIMATIC as. They didn't just center their SDK, documentation, testing and continuous integration solutions around API definitions, they <a href="https://apimatic.io/transformer">exposed their API definition translation engine as a service called API Transformer</a>, allowing anyone else to follow their lead.</p>
<p class="p1">When people first learn about API definitions, the 101 lessons usually center around API documentation, and maybe secondarily the generation of the server or client-side&nbsp;SDKs. However API definitions are rapidly being used for every other stop along the life cycle from design to deprecation, as well as the unknown future stops along the way that only&nbsp;become possible because all your API resources are well defined, and machine-readable. It is this agility and flexibility that I want to incentivize, helping companies be as effective as APIMATIC has been when it comes to delivering new API-driven solutions.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_08_at_8.18.41_am.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/exploring-the-economics-of-wholesale-and-retail-algorithmic-apis/">I recently wrote about how Algorithmia offloads the compute costs around machine learning using AWS</a>, structuring their image style transfer modeling so that the consumer pays the cost for deploy an AWS GPU instance. It is an interesting way to shift the burden of paying for the hard costs around API operations.</p>
<p>Another interesting approach I extracted from a story I wrote yesterday is from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/open-data/">Amazon Web Services (AWS) with their approach to open data</a>. Amazon Public Datasets are available as <span>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots and/or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. AWS hosts the master copy of the dataset, and when you want to use, you fire it up in your AWS account, and get to work.</span></p>
<p><span>I find some of these approaches to managing, and offloading the heavy costs of working with algorithms, datasets, and other resources interesting. I especially find this approach interesting because it is in the service of public data, providing an option for how the private sector can help share the load in managing government, research, and other public data, and offloading the heavy costs to those who are going to put the data to use. </span></p>
<p>I will figure out how to add this into my API <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">monetization</a> and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">plan</a> research. Providing a list of these types of approaches to providing on-premise, wholesale, and containerized or virtualized approaches to making data, content, and algorithms available. I will definitely keep looking for unique approaches to API deployment like this--after a couple of these grabbing my attention, I'm feeling like I am seeing another shift in both the technology and business of how we deploy and consume APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://zapier.com/blog/push-by-zapier-google-chrome-extension/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/push_by_zapier_icon_button.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I would say that <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">embeddable tooling</a> is one of saddest areas of the API space for me in recent years. When it comes to buttons, badges, widgets, and other embeddable goodies that put APIs work, the innovation has been extremely underwhelming. Login, like, share, and a handful of other embeddable tooling have taken hold, but there really isn't any sort of sophisticated approach to putting APIs to work using web, mobile, browser embeddables.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/11/ipaas-in-your-browser-with-push-by-zapier/">The only innovation I can think of recently is from Zapier with their Push by Zapier solution</a> -- allowing you to orchestrate with the zaps you've&nbsp;creative, putting APIs to work using the variety of recipes they've cooked up. I'm thinking that I will have to step up my storytelling around what is possible with Push by Zapier, helping folks understand the possibilities. Push by Zapier is a Google Chrome extension, making it more browser than embeddable, but the approach transcends embeddable, browser, and even into the conversation (bot, voice, etc.) for me.</p>
<p>It's all about getting users frictionless access to API driven actions. Whether you are building Zapier pushes, Alexa Skills, or a Slackbot, you need to trigger, and daisy chain together API driven requests and responses ending in the desired location. I'm just looking for dead simple ways of doing all of this&nbsp;in my browser, embedded on web pages, and anywhere I desire. I'm just looking for a way to embed, link, and display the doorway to meaningful actions that anyone can implement, from wherever they want--where the action takes place is up to the API provider.</p>
<p>I want a vocabulary of simple and complex embeddables,&nbsp;either just HTML, some JS, and maybe a little CSS magic to round off. When I explain to someone in a Tweet or email explaining that they can publish a news article to a Google spreadsheet, I want my sentence to accomplish what I'm trying to articulate. I want to be able to speak in API--I want to be able to develop an IT operational outline&nbsp;and make it executable using <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">the wealth of API resources available to me over at AWS</a>. I want to be able to craft meaningful tasks, and easily share with others, replicated it for them, in their environment, using their credentials, without confusing the hell out of them.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am just ranting of this collision of these worlds as I am seeing unfold. I suspect the lack of innovation around embeddables&nbsp;is more about proprietary stances on APIs, and a platformification of things--meaning folks are investing in speaking in these ways via their channel, on their platforms, not an open web approach for everyone. I think Zapier has the strong lead in this area, with Slack, and Alexa trailing behind. The problem is that all the players are just to focused on their ow implementations, and not a wider web edition of their conversational interfaces. I'll rant in a future post about how this politics of API operations&nbsp;and closed views on API IP are stunting the growth in meaningful communication using API resources. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The "cloud" has done some very interesting things for individuals, companies, organizations, institutions, and government&nbsp;agencies, and is something that shouldn't be ignored. However, I watch organizations of all shapes and sizes make a similar mistake when it comes to outsourcing too much of their operations to vendors, and cloud services. Each organization's needs will be different, but technology leaders should be mindful of how they invest in talent, alongside how much they invest in external services.</p>
<p>I struggle with this in my own business on a daily basis, but I've also seen small businesses make the same mistake, as well as witnessed the damage of this all the way up the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in the federal government. The VA has outsourced it's technological soul to vendors, leaving the ability to make sound architectural choices to those who control the puppet strings outside of the agency. I'm seeing a lot of smaller organizations doing this same thing, but with cloud services (outsource 2.0), instead of the traditional software vendor (outsource 1.0)--outsourcing their technological soul to the cloud.</p>
<p>Outsourcing capacity is something I struggle with constantly. There is only so much I can do as a one-person shop, but there is also a limit on what I can spend on services in the cloud, creating a naturally occurring balancing effect. In addition to this natural effect, I am also constantly evaluating what I should be learning myself, and investing in my own internal capacity, as opposed to outsourcing it. I have to be extra careful regarding who I depend on because if service changes, is shut down, or maybe prices me out of range -- it could be pretty damaging to my operations. I am hyper aware of this vicious&nbsp;cycle when it comes to my dependence on the cloud or any single service.</p>
<p>I was just having a conversation around the hard decisions that a school district was having to make in this area. They have to make the big contract purchase, hire the talent&nbsp;or invest in talent locally. These are tough decisions to make, but in the end I always lean towards investment in on-premise capacity, working to be as critical as possible when it comes to adopting cloud services, and investing in only external expertise -- while there is no perfect answer, and investing in internal capacity might be costly, but this will help get you through hard times, that depending on the cloud services will not.</p>

<p>I have long been a proponent of the private sector sharing the load when it comes to managing public data and APIs. After leaving DC during the 2013 federal government shutdown I began evangelizing the importance of individuals and companies stepping up to help with the heavy lifting of making sure public data is available when we need it most--resulting in my Adopta.Agency work.  I feel pretty strongly that the federal government has an important role to play in this conversation, but I also feel that the private sector needs to step up and help--additionally, I also feel that is important that individuals step up and be present in the discussion.</p>
<p>Github plays a central role in my Adopta.Agency work. Any government data I turn into an API lives on Github as JSON, CSV, or other machine-readable format--taking advantage fo the Github platform for managing, as well as helping me eliminate or completely reduce the costs of managing public data. I spend money each month on hosting my public data work (it's my addiction), but I couldn't do it without a place to park it and offset storage and bandwidth costs. With this in mind, I'm spending time trying to find other services that public data and API folks can put to work for them, either eliminating or reducing the cost of managing open public data on the web.</p>
<p>My Adopta.Agency toolkit starts with Github and extends to <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/adopta-blueprint">the open source blueprint for adopting government data</a> (which lives on Github) - now I want to add some additional resources that folks can consider. First on my list is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/open-data/">AWS Open Data</a>, where organizations can publish their open data sets, and consumers can deploy datasets for use in their own AWS infrastructure--smart. Next up is <a href="https://www.google.com/publicdata/admin">Google Public Datasets</a>, where you can browse existing datasets and add your own. That is my list so far. I'm spending some time looking for other services that users can use for free or extremely low costs as part of their public data work, and need your help.</p>
<p>If you know of any other services that users can use let me know. I'm not just looking for storage solutions. Ideally, it would be a full stack services that public data advocates could use to acquire, store, management, and deploy public data as an API--additionally, any services that would help them throughout throught the API life cycle. I'm looking for a more formal and established approach, specifically something with a URL, logo, description and landing page that I can add to my Adopta.Agency Toolbox. If you have any questions let me know, you can leave <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/master/issues">any thoughts, issues, or suggestions to the Adopta.Agency Github issues</a>.</p>

<p>Telling the story of what your&nbsp; API accomplishes may seem like a pretty simple, straightforward thing, but you'd be surprised how many API providers DO NOT do this on a regular basis, or do not have dedicated stories, showcase, or similar section to their website. This is why I beat this drum on a regular basis -- if you do not tell the story of the cool things people are doing with your API or your API services, they will never know how your solution works, and will probably never think of your service again--even with they actually have that specific problem that you solve.</p>
<p>To help demonstrate this in a very meta way, I am going to showcase how my clients, showcase their clients. Deep man. Next up is my partner DreamFactory, <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/stories">providing six very compelling stories about how their API deployment and management platform is being put to use</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/stories/techego">TECHeGO</a></strong> - DreamFactory is at the core of TECHeGO's powerful ERP platform&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/stories/verizon">Verizon Cloud</a></strong> - Discover how DreamFactory gave Verizon Cloud a turnkey developer portal.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/stories/intel">Intel</a></strong> - Learn how Intel uses DreamFactory to expose legacy SQL data as a powerful REST API for AngularJS.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/stories/maxwell-lucas">Maxwell Lucas</a></strong> - Read how Maxwell Lucas uses DreamFactory to deliver a world-class travel advisory application for their enterprise companies.</li>

</ul>
<p>Honestly, this type of blog posts makes for easy content for me, and obviously, it makes my partner DreamFactory happy, but more importantly, it is yet ANOTHER reminder for you to tell the story of the people who are using your APIs and services. Telling stories is essential to you obtaining new customers, but it is also essential for analysts like me to understand the real things being done with your APIs, allowing us to cut through the hype of the tech space.</p>
<p>Take another look at your API storytelling apparatus. Do you have an engineering blog or a blog dedicated to your API? Do you have stories, testimonials, customer showcase, or other dedicated areas for telling stories about your customers? Do you actively share these stories via your company's social channels like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more? Just a few of the questions you should be asking.</p>
