{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am a big fan of APIs that do one thing and do it well, like Twilio.I had lunch with the team from a similar API yesterday, called Mogreet.The Mogreet API lets you send and receive text or multimedia messages and use the platform to transcode, host and send video, audio and images for your web or mobile application.When you think of the popularity of Instagram, the rebirth of Flickr and the ubiquitous value of photos and images online, it just makes sense that MMS is going to play a critical role in mobile app development in 2013.I have a daughter, who sometimes responds to my SMS, email, chats and facebook messages.</p>
