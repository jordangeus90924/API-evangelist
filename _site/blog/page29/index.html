			<p><em>09 Jul 2013</em></p>
			<p>APIs are providing much needed access and visibility into the backend technology that is increasingly driving our desktops, laptops, mobile phones and beginning its migration into our homes, cars and our personal self. APIs aren't just something for developers to play with, they crack open the often black box of IT and technology, making it accessible to everyone.

Without APIs, none of this happens. APIs provide visibility into what many businesses would like to keep hidden from us, taking away our privacy, ownership and ability to hold companies, government and developers accountable for what they do with our personal and private data, and ultimately how they extract value for our world.

APIs are not perfect, they can be used for bad, and just because a company has an API, doesn't mean everything is on the up and up. However APIs introduce the ability for us to have 3 legged conversations, where platforms, 3rd parties and end users can have conversations about how are worlds are being connected and accessed in real-time.

These conversations are critical to how our increasingly technology driven world will evolve. Technology can be good when it is applied in sensible, safe wayss, taking into consideration all parties involved. Without the oxygen and sunlight introduced by APIs, infections can be introduced that can prove bad for users, developers and even deadly to the overall platform.
I am all for APIs being used in our desktop, laptop and mobile computing and within the Internet of Things that is taking hold of our cars, homes and even our bodies. But let's make sure we do it in a way that promotes the healthiest ecosystems for everyone involved. &nbsp;
We will all be better off for it!

			<h3><a href="/2013/07/02/the-continuing-netflix-api-story/">The Continuing Netflix API Story</a></h3>
			<p><em>02 Jul 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I have written about the well publicized failure of the Netflix public API&nbsp;before, and how in the API space things are often not what they seem. By my measurement Netflix is a massive API success story, it is just not the classsic open API success story we all really want to be true.
In the end the experiment that was the Netflix API didn't pan out, but that is ok.  Netflix has found success with APIs internally, something I think will be the case with the majority of companies embarking on an API odyssey. And with Netflix continuing to tell the story of their successes and failures, everyone can learn from their hard work.
As I continue to follow the Netflix API story, I'm seeing new narrative emerge, one that is equally about open source software, than about open APIs. When I do my monitoring I am constantly seeing new blog posts coming from the Netflix tech blog, announcing the latest OSS release from the Netflix tech team.

Netflix is up to 34 public repositories currently, and before you dig into the details of their releases, Netflix also wins in the presentation of their Github open source site. Nice job!!
I wish someone would dive deeper into everything Netflix is releasing.  At first glance it looks like like everything I have been asking for when it comes to open source software for the API management space. Netflix isn't in the space of offering API management as a service, but they run one of the biggest API platforms out there--resulting in some serious skills, experience and technology.
If I had more time I'd go through the Netflix Open Source Center and see how it all applies to the larger API picture. As with the rest of the Netflix story, I'm sure there are some great lessons in what they are producing.

			<h3><a href="/2013/07/02/api-evangelist-healthcare-gov-and-hacker-storytelling/">API Evangelist, Healthcare.gov and Hacker Storytelling</a></h3>
			<p><em>02 Jul 2013</em></p>
			<p>I've been slowly evolving API Evangelist from a single site, into an interconnected network of individual API projects. API Evangelist started as a research project back in July 2010, making its shift to be a network of smaller, inter-connected research projects is fitting. While API Evangelist currently still runs on my home brew CMS, shortly it will finish the migration to completely run on Github, making it merely a "hollywood front" for what is currently 37+ API related, living research projects of mine. I call my evolving approach to projects, Hacker Storytelling. I made up the name, but the approach is borrowed from several other philosophies which starts with concept of data journalism, but then has also evolved from conversations last year in Washington DC from very smart folks including Ben Balter (@BenBalter), Gray Brooks (@gbinal), and the very forward thinking work of the Development Seed team. Then of course I add my own style and approach to what I've learned. As I move my own network of research projects to run on Github, using this new approach, I'm also seeing other positive signs coming out of Washington on the same front. First the White House Open Data Policy released in May was created and published on Github, but then I just finished reading Healthcare.gov: Code Developed by the People and for the People, Released Back to the People, by Alex Howard (@digiphile). His post outlines how the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)launched Healthcare.gov to support the Affordable Care Act -- AKA "Obamacare". The website was built iteratively, in public, over the last couple months and it was completely done using Github, using a similar approach to my Hacker Storytelling. Seeing all of this, really makes me hopeful for my next year in Washington. Alex does an amazing job of telling the story behind Healthcare.gov, I highly recommend reading his post. After reading, I wanted take a fresh walk through my...[<a href="/2013/07/02/api-evangelist-healthcare-gov-and-hacker-storytelling/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2013/07/01/the-resource-stack/">The Resource Stack</a></h3>
			<p><em>01 Jul 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I've been organizing much of my research around APIs into groupings that I call "stacks".  The term allows me to loosely bundle common API resources into meaningful "stacks" for my readers to learn about.
I'm adding a new project to my list of 30+ stacks, that is intended to bring together the most commonly used API resources, into a single, meaningful stack of resources any web or mobile developer can quickly put to use.
So far I have compiled the following APIs in 29 separate groups:

This is just a start.  I will publish a full stack, complete with logos, descriptions and links.  For now I'm just flushing out my thoughts regarding what are some of the top resources that are currently available for developers.
I will be making another pass over the APIs I track on in the coming weeks, as well as add to the list each week as part of my monitoring.
If you see anything missing, that should be in there...let me know!

			<p><em>01 Jul 2013</em></p>
			<p>As the API universe expands, I'm trying my best to stay in tune with where its going and try to help people understand the space, whether you are a newbie or API veteran--I want you to find what you are looking for at API Evangelist. To support the fast moving space, as well as my ADHD working style, I've broken up API Evangelist into individual projects. Each project runs using my Hacker Storytelling format, which in short means each projects lives as a Githb repository, allowing me to publish the research, data, short form and long form content to an open source repository that anyone can browse, fork and download. To help you (and me) see the entire API Evangelist network, i wanted to publish an outline of all 37 projects I'm curently working on: API 101 API 101 History of APIs API Management Using Github Provide APIs (Landing Page) Design Deployment Management Evangelism * Monetization * Security * Embeddable * Consume APIs (Landing Page) Discovery Integration Operations * The API Stack Backend as a Service (BaaS) Resource Stack (NEW) Payments * Social * Trends (Landing Page) Aggregation Reciprocity Real Time Single Page Applications Voice Opportunities (Landing Page) 3D Printing Home Buildings Automobiles Quantified Self Priorities (Landing Page) Federal Government State Government * City Government Education Healthcare University Libraries Data Analyze * Archive * Visualize * * Projects that are still in progress of being setup My goal with this new format that I've rolled out over the last six months, is to give me specific project areas to do research within, each week. Some projects will get love an attention, while others will simmer in the background--moving everything forward in small chunks. All of these projects are accessible via landing pages on API Evangelist, which I will be keeping as the main portal for the business of APIs. &nbsp;You can also find my work on the politics of APIs at API Voice, and you...[<a href="/2013/07/01/the-expanding-api-evangelist-network/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2013/06/29/trends-in-api-aggregation/">Trends in API Aggregation</a></h3>
			<p><em>29 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>One trend in API usage I'm closely watching is the aggregation of APIs by a new wave of startups. As the world adopts more cloud services, the need to aggregate content across multiple APIs is growing.
I'm currently tracking on 15 API aggregators, who focus on bringing together data and content in 10 areas:


Analytics
Cloud Computing
Cloud Storage
Financial
Government
Invoicing
Messaging
Notifications
Personal
Social

The companies I'm watching on may provide other services, such as integration or automation between cloud services.  However I focus on the aggregation of content and data, and the creation of new, aggregated APIs across multiple services.
Some comapnies also provide entirely new APIs with data, features and functionality that can only be uncovered by aggregating across multiple services.
In 2013 we will continue seeing API aggregation providers emerge, providing a new layer on top of the most popular API services that we are quickly growing dependent on.

			<h3><a href="/2013/06/27/webhook-as-a-service/">Webhook as a Service</a></h3>
			<p><em>27 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>
While I was at API Days this weekend in San Francisco, I managed to catch a handful of talks Saturday afternoon after I landed at OAK. While listening to each talk, I kept hearing one technical API building block, over and over--webhook.
Webhooks are a common way for API providers to make API integration a two ways street for consumer. Developers, or even non-developers, can setup webhooks via common API platforms, and receive notifications about different events and activities that occur.
Webhooks are also a common tool for API automation and reciprocity platforms like Zapier and IFTTT.  Users can setup webhooks, that respond to just about any action across multiple, API driven platforms.

After hearing webhooks mentioned so often, I wondered if anyone out there is offering web hook as a service (WHaaS) (LOL).  Sure enough, John Sheehan (@johnsheehan) pointed me to webscript.io.
Webscripts are short scripts, written in Lua, that run in the cloud servers, and can respond to any HTTP requests.
Exactly what I was looking for. I had heard of webscript.io before, but for some reason it didn't stick in my mind.  It is precisely the simple approach I was looking for, and has many common examples like sending emails, counters, parsing RSS and Tweeting.
I really like dead simple implementations like webscript.io, that solve real world problems in such granular, yet powerful ways.  Nice work @smarx.

			<p><em>26 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>I had several important things happen over the last week. One of them was sharing the stage for the first time with my partner in crime, Audrey Watters (@audreywatters). Although I spent most of the week in Washington DC, Tuesday night I flew out to Park City, UT and shared the stage Wednesday morning for a keynote with Audrey at InstructureCon, put on by the LMS platform Instructure. Audrey and I delivered a talk on education, the LMS and data portability. Audrey opened up and closed out the talk, you can read her perspective on Hack Education, but I wanted to make sure and provide the overview of my section, as described by Audrey as&nbsp;[Kin spoke here about the history of APIs and what APIs do.] To help understand how mainstream Internet technology has influenced the LMS and education portal history Audrey has laid out, I wanted to bring the history of the web API to the table, helping people understand what APIs do: APIs allow computers to talk to each other, and applications to inter-operate Websites deliver HTML for humans to read, and APIs deliver JSON for other applications to use The earliest approaches to APIs on the Internet, can be seen from providers starting in 2000, as Roy Fielding publishes his dissertation on REST. The early API pioneers were looking to enable commerce around their products, sales efforts and auctions using early web enabled APIs: 2000 - Salesforce - The CRM and sales management provider Salesforce was the first pioneer to begin using web APIs to start developing an ecosystem of integration providers, planting the seeds of what we'd later call Platform as a Service (PaaS) 2000 - Ebay - Ebay identified early on, the role web APIs could play in expanding its auction marketplace, allowing business and individual to manage their online auctions via a programmatic interface 2002 - Amazon - Early on the fast growing bookseller identified the potential of APIs...[<a href="/2013/06/26/instructurecon-keynote-kin-spoke-here-about-the-history-of-apis-and-what-apis-do/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>The news is finally out. I will be heading to Washington DC to spend a year as a White House Innovation Fellow. APIs, open data and our government has been a passion of mine for my whole career, something that has escalated over the last year with my work on the White House Digital Strategy and Open Data Policy. Now my passion for APIs+Government is being taken to a whole new level, and &nbsp;I will be heading to Washington DC, to join 41 very talented individuals from the private sector, to tackle some of the biggest challenges in our federal government. I will be enjoying the full backing of the White House, to employ APIs to help stimulate innovation within government. I will be specifically working on the Veterans Affiars (VA) modernization team with two other very talented individuals, Mollie Ruskin (@mollieruskin) and Ben Willman (@benwillman). We will be working on various projects, with the overall goal of streamlining the VA claims process. When I received the call from the VA, asking me to come to Washington and help, I could not say no. I'm pretty mission driven, when it comes to APIs, but helping out veterans and using APIs is the ultimate mission for me. I have not one, but two dads who were Vietnam Veterans. Both are passed on now, but I have personal experience seeing the VA process in operation. I couldn't think of a more important mission for me to embark on, but to help streamline this process. I will be keeping API Evangelist alive during my time in DC, but will not be taking on any new speaking engagements or projects. I will be dedicating myself 100% to my work at the VA. However I would do the agency a disservice if I did not maintain my awareness of the overall API space. Thank you to everyone who assisted in making this possible, and I look forward to this next...[<a href="/2013/06/24/api-evangelist-goes-to-washington/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I went to API Days SF yesterday. Unfortunately, due to an unexpected obligation on the other coast I was unable to make it in time for the Friday kick-off.  But after my plane landed at OAK yesterday I headed over to enjoy the last few talks, participate in a panel and network with everyone in attendance.
I really like the API Days format.  I've done all 3 of the events now including Paris, Madrid and now San Francisco.  Each event is an intimate mix of API experts, craftspeople and the API curious.
You can easily rub elbows with everyone and learn from everyone there.  All speakers are accessible, and the spaces are always small enough that you have some amazing conversations, while enjoying good food and drink.

I'd love to see more API Days pop up around the world, I really think it is a great format for introducing APIs into new region and spread the API best practices, knowledge and wisdom we often take for granted here in Silicon Valley.
The API Days event model is an open source approach to throwing API events, so if you think you'd like to throw your own API Days gathering in your city, you can!  The community is extremely supportive and we will do what we can to help make sure you are successful, you just have to provide the local ingredients.
I know there is another, original API Days Paris planned for the end of the year, but I'd love to see the format spread to other locations around the globe.
Thanks to faberNovel, Webshell and Parisoma for organizing and thanks to&nbsp;Layer 7 Technologies, 3Scale, Intel, SOA Software, Mulesoft, API Spark and Apiphany for supporting.

			<p><em>22 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>APIs are quickly moving into the mainstream. In 2012, companies, organizations and government agencies all took notice of the need for deploying and consuming APIs. In 2013 there is still a lot of evangelism to be done, to make people aware of what an APIs is, and why their company should have one, but I think we are approaching the phase where APIs will be the default for any company. If you frequent the tech conferences like I do, you've heard folks like John Musser say that in 1995 we were asking, "Do we need a website?", and by 2000 website was becoming the default. Fastforward to 2010, and we were asking, "Do we need an API?", and I believe by 2015 APIs will be default for companies, just like websites in 2000. APIs are built on HTTP just like our websites. They are not just a new technology trend. Your website is a critical part of your company, telling the world about your company, and the products and services you provide. If you are a company without a website in this century, you probably are pretty irrelevant in your industry. By 2015 if your company's products and services are not available in both HTML and JSON on the web, you will not be accessible via web and mobile applications, including voice enabled platforms such as Siri. Resulting in pretty much the same irrelevance as not having a website. I'm not saying there isn't a lot of work to be done, in educated folks about what APIs are, and why they are important. But as I leave Washington DC this week, and I'm seeing our federal government solidly on track to institutionalize APIs and open data into their culture and operations. Government is known for always being several years behind the mainstream when it comes to technology. So if your company is behind the government on APIs, you are seriously behind and may not be...[<a href="/2013/06/22/apis-as-the-default-for-companies-by-2015/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I went to Spain at the beginning of the month to speak at API Days.  While there I had the pleasure of connecting with the team from Apicultur.  If you are not familiar with Apicultur, they are a platform for linguistic APIs, providing resources ranging from word frequency, synonyms and sentiment analysis to word games.
Apicultur is relevant because language APIs WILL be central to evolution of not just mobile, but also the Internet of Things. Also, Apicultur isn't just trying to build the best linguistics API in the world, they are working to assemble a marketplace of the worlds linguistic API resources.
The value of the API resources Apicultur is developing attracted me to them, but then I learned more about their overall business model, and was really hooked.  They want you to hang your valuable linguistics API in their marketplace, side by side with the ones they develop.  They truly want to build the most valuable marketplace of API driven, language resources from around the world.
The Apicultur team is in San Francisco this weekend for API Days, if you are a complimentary API I recommend you connecting with them. Also if you have a business that could use the resources they offer, I also recommend reaching out.  You can ping them @apicultur or feel free to contact me, and I'll hook you up. Or maybe just head down to API Days at Parisoma.
What Apicultur is doing, reflects the next iteration of APIs from an all the APIs directory like ProgrammableWeb, to niche marketplaces of valuable resources developers will be needing to build the next generation of applications.

			<p><em>17 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Understanding our history is critical to understanding where we are going. &nbsp;I have been studying the history of web APIs for the last three years. Even though I have been through the API strategies of pioneers like Salesforce and Amazon several times, each time I go back through, I learn more. &nbsp;
In May I went back through the history of APIs and added several stories that I feel are key to introducing people to the API space, as well as helping developers and people who already work with APIs, about why this has all worked.
I break the history of APIs into 5 phases:

Commerce
Social
Business &amp; Marketing
Cloud Computing
Mobile

We are standing solidly within the mobile phase of APIs, looking forward at the next phase which is about the Internet of Things. The History of APIs is part of my API 101 series, which I publish to help introduce people to the world of APIs and prepare them for them for the API economy that will surround them.
You can download an updated copy of the History of APIs via this blog post, and I will be adding an entirely new white paper section in the near future. &nbsp;
Make sure and share the History of APIs with your friends and anyone you think would benefit learning about the space.

			<p><em>17 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I'm doing a keynote this weekend with the infamous, edtech rabble-rouser Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) at InstructureCon in Park City Utah, this Wednesday June 19th.
Audrey and I will be talking about the importance of data portability when it comes to education technology.  Instructure, the creators of Canvas, a next generation learning management system (LMS), has been so kind to bring us both out.
While Audrey and I spend a lot of time speaking at conferences, this is our first event where we will be both sharing the stage.  If you are unaware, Audrey and her&nbsp;Hack Education&nbsp;blog isn't just a partner in crime with API Evangelist when it comes to data portability, she has also played the role of my girlfriend for almost four years.
We are both super passionate about open data, open source, data portability, terms of use and privacy policies that protect and empower users. &nbsp;Because when it comes to education, those "users" are our kids, brothers, sisters, family and friends. Education is not just another Silicon Valley opportunity, it is way too important.
I'm stoked to be sharing the stage with Audrey in Park City, UT this Wednesday at InstructureCon.  And thank you to the Instructure team for believing in us and bringing us out to cause trouble in Utah.

			<p><em>17 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Coming on the heels of API Days Mediterranea in Madrid Spain, is the next event in the series, API Days San Francisco.  We kicked off the API Days event series in Paris, at the end of last year, and now after the momentum in Spain, API Days has picked up enough speed to hop the ocean and land in the heart of technology.
The lineup is pretty rock'n, with talks from Runscope, SendGrid, Layer 7 Technologies, Netflix, Intel, Apigee, DotCloud, Stripe, Mashape, Mashery, 3Scale, Zapier, APISpark, Singly, Salesforce, SOA Software, Apiary.io, Fitbit, SAP, Mulesoft, Apiphay, Webshell, faberNovel, Reverb and AngelHack.
The theme for API Days San Francisco is the API Economy, so it makes sense there are even VC's talking from True Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and even Alex William from Techcrunch will be there.
The headliner is ex-Calvin Klein underwear model, media junkie, stimulator of tech influencers and master of spin Mike Maney (@the_spinmd) of Maney Digital.  You can count on the event being a good time with the Spin MD, Mike Maney around.
API Days San Francisco is shaping up to be a pretty kick ass event.  I'd make sure you are there.  It is downtown SF, this weekend 6/21 and 6/22 at Parisoma.
I'll be there and look forward to seeing you there!

			<p><em>13 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>
In 2007, a new API-as-a-product platform launched, called Twilio, which introduced a voice API allowing developers to make and receive phone calls via any cloud application.  Over the last 3 years Twilio has additionally released a text messaging and SMS short code API, making itself a critical telephony resource in many developers toolbox.
Twilio is held up as a model platform to follow when evangelizing to developers.  Twilio has helped define which technical and business building blocks are essential for a healthy API driven platform, set the bar for on the ground evangelism at events and hackathons, and worked hard to showcase, support and invest it its developer ecosystem.

Alongside Foursquare and Instagram, Twilio has come to define mobile application development, helping push APIs into the mainstream.  While Twitter has sometime been held up as a cautionary tale when it comes to APIs,&nbsp; Twilio has demonstrated, that when done right, API driven ecosystems do work.
By 2011 the bar for delivering APIs, via HTTP, has been well established by early pioneers like SalesForce and Amazon, but Twilio has shown how mature the business of APIs has become with its evolution into the mobile period.&nbsp; However, mobile development via APIs, owes its roots to the foundation laid by the commerce, social and cloud API pioneers.

			<p>From Deployment to Management
I have broken out API design and deployment into individual areas, separate from API management. However they are all intertwined and overlap is inevitable, but it is important to understand the overview of API deployment, from framework to gateway and where it fits in with API design and management.
API deployment was born out of SOA and the enterprise, and the API gateways have the longest history in API deployment. But over the last 10 years a wealth of frameworks and scrappier approaches to deploy APIs build on HTTP has evolved considerably. &nbsp;
After 10 years of evolving API frameworks, and RESTful approaches a new breed of API providers have emerged to provide the next generation of API deployments that will drive mobile apps and the Internet of Things. All of this is making API deployment something anyone can do.
API Evangelist is about educating the masses about the potential of APIs, and understanding API deployment is something that any savvy business person should have a grasp of, even if you won't be getting your hands dirty with the actual execution.
Maybe you have a wealth of data locked up in databases that you need to make available for mobile or tablet apps, and you just don't have the internal resources to design, develop and deploy you APIs. Five years ago, APIs were definitely a purely technical initiative, born out of IT. In 2014 anyone with a little tech curiosity can understand what is possible, and begin to put a plan in place and achieve deployment.
Now you should have a 100K foot view of the world of API deployment, and should now look to understand what is involved with managing an API in the wild.

			<p>Download as PDF In the early days, APIs were just about deployment and consumption--you were doing one or the other.&nbsp; Then from 2006 to 2012 API management was introduced from providers like Mashery, then 3Scale and most recently Apiphany. In 2013 the API universe is expanding at a ever increasing pace, and the concept of API design is expanding, with new approaches, tools and even companies stepping up to provide services. I'm deciding to frame my API design research as everything that goes into planning and designing your API, as well as the resulting definition of your API, that will eventually become the&nbsp; API you will use in production, which also might drive your documentation and generate the code samples your developers will use to integrate their apps. Depending on our needs, API design may begin with learning about HATEOAS as part of your design constraints, or API design might simply be about generating a Swagger definition so you can generate interactive API documentation. Ultimately your API design will be the definition of each endpoint, its methods, fields and much more. In a technical sense it is a JSON or XML blueprint that describes your API, and in a creative sense, API design is an art form and can possess a technical beauty, one that will also speak to the value an API delivers to end-users. Thoughtful API design early on can save you a lot of mistakes down the road. In support of this, and as I do with al of my API research projects, I started a Github repository at design.apievangelist.com. This project is not meant to endorse any particular approach or methodology, but provide a single resource where you can find the best information on API design.&nbsp; For those of you who like to share via email and PDFs, I also published the API Providers Guide to API Design as a PDF, which you can download and share as you wish. &nbsp;...[<a href="/2013/06/13/api-providers-guide-api-design/">Read More</a>]</p>

Now in 2014 we are stabilizing again, and the API universe is expanding around the area of API design, with new approaches, tools and entire companies emerging to provide services that are dedicated to helping companies design the best APIs they can. I define the world of API design as everything that goes into planning and designing your API, as well as the definition of your API that will eventually be deployed as your production endpoints, drive your documentation, generate the code samples your developers will use to integrate, test, monitor, and allow your API to be found--through this lens, API design is fast becoming the driver for all areas of the API lifecycle. Depending on our needs, API design may begin with understanding HTTP, and REST, or may learning more about applying hypermedia as part of your design constraints, or API design might simply be about generating a Swagger definition, so you can generate interactive API documentation. I won&rsquo;t be going into the finer points of REST, Hypermedia or even Swagger definitions. My goal is to provide a 100K view of space, and highlight the various tools, services, and API design methodologies available today.

In November 2006, API the first API service provider Mashery came out of "stealth mode" to offer documentation support, community management and access control for companies wishing to offer public or private APIs--from blog post in TechCrunch titled&nbsp;API Management Service is Open for Business.
At this point in time, in 2006, we were moving from the social period of APIs into the cloud computing phase with the introduction of Amazon Web Services. It was clear that the world of web APIs was getting real, and there was opportunity for companies to offer API management as a service.

While there were tools for deploying APIs, there was no standard approach to managing your API deployment. Mashery was the first to bring a standard set of services to API providers, that would help set the stage for the future growth of the API industry.
It would take almost six more years before the API industry would come of age. The space we all know today was defined by early API commerce pioneers like&nbsp;SalesForce&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazon, social pioneers like&nbsp;Flickr&nbsp;and&nbsp;Delicous, and from Mashery who helped define what is now known as the business of APIs.
In 2013, Mashery was acquired by Intel, helping recently validate that the API industry truly has come of age.&nbsp;

			<p><em>10 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Enterprise content sharing platform box launched a new developer revenue sharing program for its API developer ecosystem, called $rev.
Box $rev is pretty straightforward.  You just integrate the Box API into your app, enroll it into the Box $rev program, and box will monitor, track and report your activity--sending you checks for up to 15% of the per seat price as a commission, each quarter.
As a PaaS provider, the core value driven by the box API is not about making money, it is based upon adding new users, and getting them to depend on box for their everyday needs.  Offering developers 15% of the revenue generated via the core box platforms makes a lot of sense.

This approach to revenue share won't work for all API providers, but is a great way to incentivize developers when you have a core platform you need to drive new users to.
I like the Box $rev model, because it actually incentivizes developers to build meaningful, engaging applications that users will actually adopt.
Its nice to see API value quantified in engagement, allowing us to move beyond the eye-ball based economy we are drowning in currently.

			<p><em>10 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>
In the last two years I've seen the emergence of&nbsp; cloud platforms that focus on helping data administrators, owners and stewards, generate APIs from their data sources.
The new cloud services like EmergentOne will mount a MySQL database, spider the tables, and generate a web API for you, while providing you the basic tools you will need to manage access and consumption of that API.
In the same spirit of helping data owners generate APIs, I'd like to see the same types of tools, but designed for books and their authors or publishers.  When I create a book and generate the ePub version, I would like to be able to upload it to a cloud platform, where the service would spider the ePub file and help generate a simple, but meaningful API for the book allowing developers to search, annotate and interact with the books content via web, mobile or tablet applications.

My thoughts are still in the idea stage, I have done very little research on what is out there.  But I would envision something like this would work well will existing platforms like Project Gutenberg.  As I do with all my ideas, I will share my thoughts here in real-time as I do the research.
I think in the future, providing default API access to all books will be critical to the syndication across all available distribution platforms.  You can find the seeds of this idea&nbsp; in what Pearson is doing with their product catalog.
As the publishing world slowly wakes up to digital distribution, APIs will become a common tool in the toolbox of authors and publishers.

			<p>
del.icio.us&nbsp;is a social bookmarking service for storing, sharing and discovering web bookmarks to web pages, that was founded by Jousha Schachter in 2003.
Del.icio.us implemented a very simple tagging system which allowed users to easily tag their web bookmarks in a meaningful way, but also established a kind of folksonomy across all users of the platform. Which proved to be a pretty powerful way for cataloging and sharing web links.

The innovative tagging methodology used by del.icio.us allowed you to pull a list of your tags, or public web bookmarks by using the URL http://del.icio.us/tag/[tag name]/. So if I was searching for bookmarks on airplanes, I could http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane and I would GET a list of all bookmarks that have been tagged airplane. &nbsp;It was simple
When it came to the programmatic del.icio.us interface, the API was built into the site, creating a seamless experience--if you wanted the airplane tags via HTML you entered http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane, if you wanted RSS of the tags you entered http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/airplane, and if you wanted XML returned you used http://del.icio.us/api/tag/airplane. This has changed with the modern version of Delicious API.
del.icio.us was the first, concrete example of how the web could deliver HTML content, alongside machine readable like RSS and XML, using a URL structure that was simple and human readable. This approach to sharing bookmarks would set the stage for future APIs, in making APIs easy to understand for developers and even non-developers alike. Any slightly technical user could easily parse the XML or RSS, and develop or reverse engineer widgets and apps around del.icio.us content.
del.icio.us has been sold twice since its early popularity, which included to Yahoo! in 2005 and AVOS Systems on April, 2011. However del.icio.us was one of the pillar platforms that ushered in the social era of the API movement, establishing sharing via APIs as critical to the API economy, but also showing that simple rules when it comes to API design.

			<h3><a href="/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">API Management Using Github</a></h3>
			<p><em>08 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>There are plenty of tools and services you can use to manage your API and its developer community.  But there is no platform that provides as much benefit and versatility as Github.
Github is a social coding platform that developers have grown to love and respect.  With a high level of adoption by developers, and the versatility of the features available on Github, API providers have developed many innovative ways to use the platform to manage an API.

I have documented eleven approaches to using Github for API management to date:

Design and Code
Documentation
Software development kits (SDK)
Code Samples (Gists)
Developer Authentication
Developer Profiling
Presentations and Guides
Issue Management
Roadmaps
Hackathons 
Terms of Service, Privacy, and Branding

This list does not represent all the uses of Github for an API, but the approaches I've seen used by open API providers.  Not all APIs are created or managed equally and these approaches to using Github can be applied in many different ways, even within private platforms.
Github is about social coding and file versioning, an approach that offers huge benefits to API management practices.  You want all aspects of your API operations to be social and versioned allowing it to evolve over time--Github handles this like no other platform.
Consider Github as the core of your API operations and think about which of these eleven approaches you can use to make sure your API is as successful possible.

I got an email from IFTTT last night, simply stating:&nbsp;
As of today, IFTTT has stopped supporting the Posterous Channel. The Channel has been removed, along with any Recipes that made use of Posterous Triggers or Actions.&nbsp;
If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at [email&#160;protected] Thanks for your continued support.&nbsp;
&mdash;The IFTTT Team&nbsp;
This announcement, follows a similar one a couple weeks ago, where IFTT also ceased support for channels that pull your data from Twitter. &nbsp;
Since Posterous is owned by Twitter, it's easy to see the parallels in the decision by IFTTT. &nbsp;

			<p>
I just got back from Madrid, Spain, where I spoke at APIdays Mediterranea.  I really enjoy the API Days format, because the events are small, intimate API learning and networking opportunities.
While at API Days I got to hang out with many of the usual suspects Andy Thurai of Intel, Guillaume Balas of 3Scale, Ronnie Mitra of Layer7, Bruno Pedro of CloudWork, Swift of SendGrid and API Days organizer Mehdi Medjaoui of WebShell.
I also had the opportunity to re-enforce some existing relationships in person, with Isabelle Mauny of WSO2, Jeremiah Lee a UX researcher from SF and Eduardo Basterrechea and Elena Alvarez of Apicultur.

API Days Mediterranea was a great introduction to the API innovation occurring in Spain, and a great opportunity to have conversations with companies and developers from the region, and hear the challenges they face in getting the word out about APIs in their country.
I really dig going to new regions and helping spreading the API gospel.  Thank you so much to Apicultur for bringing me out, and Webhsell and Fabernovel for helping organize.  Also don't forget 3Scale, Intel, Mailjet and WSO2 for organizing.
I can't wait for the next edition of API Days, the model really works well for planting the necessary seeds in new regions to get the API conversation going.  Next up is API Days San Francisco (no seed planting required), but there will be other cities added, so make sure and step up if you'd like to see API Days in your city!

			<p><em>02 Jun 2013</em></p>
			<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) recently filed a a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, urging the court to block copyright claims in the Oracle v. Google legal battle. The EFF approached me several months ago to provide feedback for the brief. I sent over my research and published some of my thoughts to Help EFF Make Case For No Copryight on APIs and why API Copyright Would Restrict API Interoperability and also lent my support as one of the Signatories to the Computer Scientists&rsquo; Amicus Brief. Here is a summarized version of the arguement: As computer scientists, amici have relied on the open nature of APIs and the programs built on them to create and operate new software. Amici depend on APIs remaining open to sustain wide spreads compatibility standards used by startups and incumbents alike. Reversing the District Court would dangerously undermine the settled expectations of computer scientists who rely on the open nature of APis. Uncopyrightable interfaces were essential to the development of modern computers and the Internet The BIOS of the Original IBM-Compatible PC Major modern operating system reimplement the ground break UNIX API The C programming language became universal because of its uncopyrightable interface Computers rely on the uncopyrightable nature of APIs and network protocols to communicate over the Internet The uncopyrightable nature of APIs for the industry standards for cloud computing Uncopyrightable interfaces spur the creation of software that otherwise would not be written Uncopyrightable interfaces allow software that makes different systems compatible Uncopyrightable interfaces help programmers develop completely new capabilities for software Copyright in interfaces would creat an "orphan software" problem Uncopyrightable interfaces protect both developers and users The orphan software problem disproportionately affects the public sector Conclusion: The freedom to reimplement and extend existing aPIs has undoubtedly led to robust software and hardware industries, but also to an explosion of technological advances that do more than merely increase companies' bottom line.

Have you checked out what the Webshell.io team is up to lately? &nbsp;I know I haven't been in there for a couple months, and it looks like they've been heads down making some interesting improvements.
New Cloud IDE
Rather than re-invent the wheel, Webshell has integrated Cloud9&nbsp;web-based IDE, into the API scripting platform:

New Documentation
They overhauled their platform documentation on the continuous mission to make them more valuable by developers:

New API Explorer
They've changed the API explorer making playing with APIs a better experience.

New Codecademy Lesson
They have created "Webshell 101" course, providing an easy way to understand how Webshell works:

That is four pretty significant building blocks from the Webshell platform. If your not familiar with some of the innovative API integration Webshell is doing, I recommend checking them out. &nbsp;Also if you haven't taken a fresh look in a while, like me, I recommend taking a moment.
The Webshell team gets the future of API usage, what they are doing via their platform represents a meaningful blend of the technology, business and politics of APIs, providing a model for the programmable web.

			<p><em>29 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>I've been tracking on what I call API aggregation for some time now. I started seeing the API aggregation trends in 2010, then I saw this pick up in 2011 with the emergence of providers like Singly and Adigami. While many new companies provide you with interoperability and automation between multiple APIs, I consider aggregators to be about bringing together multiple APIs into a single aggregated end-point for developers to use, then also providing potentially new APIs that are only possible, because of the aggregation. Last year, after I started spending more time in Washington DC, I met a talented group of folks who were playing around with the idea of an aggregate API for federal government. In the last couple weeks it looks like they were serious about it, and launched the debut version of Fed{API}. Fed{API} is looking to make government data more accessible and reusable by taking data from multiple sources, some easy to pull and some much more difficult, then collect, correlate and catalog into a single, aggregate API stack that developers can put to use. I'm a big fan of API Aggregation. I think this is the future of standardizing APIs and data across many sources, but as I'm watching providers tackle this, you begin to realize what a massive undertaking it will be. And FedAPI is looking to do this by opening up federal government data, which by itself is a massive challenge. So FedAPI is tackling two pretty massive problems, as a core business model. Even with the massive challenge ahead, I will be supporting FedAPI 100%, and doing what I can to make sure their initiative is successful. To do so, I think they will have to get two other groups involved: Other API Aggregate Providers - FedAPI needs to make sure and reach out to Singly, Temboo, Adigami and the other API aggregators and see what they can learn, share knowledge and wisdom. Aside from FedAPI,...[<a href="/2013/05/29/api-aggregation-for-federal-government-with-fedapi/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Expansion is in the air. Quarterly reports are in, we are moving into summer and companies like Twilio, Evernote, Salesforce and Foursquare are expanding and growing at healthy, steady paces. Mobile is king. I'm having trouble keeping up with the new mobile players in different niche areas, as well as all the big players paying strong attention to the mobile space including Yahoo, SAP, Intel and beyond. BaaS will continue to be a dominate theme throughout 2013. The Internet of Things is prominent with tech blogosophere coverage, webinars and new companies rolling out IOT APIs and technology. &nbsp;As we see the rhetoric step up on autombiles, homes, buildings and other fast growing IOT areas we'll continue to see new companies and investment, the trick will be to sort through it all and make sense. API management is definitely on everyone's minds. I'm seeing existing PaaS platforms make plays with API management tools, new database to API discussions and all the big players are as active &nbsp;as ever, even Mashery and Layer 7 after their recent acquisitions. API testing, monitoring and other developer focused tools is my favorite new area to research lately. I'm seeing an explosion in this area with high profile launches from Runscope, TheRightAPI and a strong presence from existing players like SmartBear and Pingdom. A new area I'm adding to my API trends monitoring is around what is being called Single Page Applications (SPA). There was a great talk by Steve Willmott of 3Scale this week at Gluecon on the relationship between SPA and APIs. But I'm also seeing major movement from devs and API providers in use of SPA oriented frameworks and libraries like Angular.js, Ember.js, Knockout.js and Backbone.js. Beyond testing and monitoring, security is an important theme. As the API space expands, the concern for securing APIs and their accompanying web apps is growing. We are seeing major providers continue the roll-out of two-step verification, as well as security and...[<a href="/2013/05/28/the-api-stack-for-may-20th-2013/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>Over the last year I've worked hard to standardize and automate as much of my monitoring of the API space as I can. The amount of information I was monitoring daily was getting overwhelming--I needed to scale what I do, so I created what I call my API Stack Ranking. The API Stack Ranking is not meant to be a top 25 list, it is meant to be a ranking that I can sort companies by each week, giving me a meaningful stack of companies, who are doing interesting things in the API space. Each week I publish my API Stack, but you can also see this influence on any of my research areas. &nbsp;If you go to API management or the Backend as a Service (BaaS) research projects, the providers are sorted by their ranking for the week. In addition to sharing my stack each week, I'd like to also share the criteria I use to determine my stack. &nbsp;Currently I bundle my signals into three areas: Internal - Signals within control of the companies I'm monitoring Has a Blog Number of Blog Posts Has a Twitter Account Number of Tweets Has Github Account Number of Github Repositories Number of Commits Across Repositories External - Signals from the public, outside of the companies control that I'm monitoring Number of Twitter Followers Number of @Mentions for Twitter Blogsphere (Techcrunch, GigaOm, ReadWrite, etc) Posts Social Bookmark (Hacker News, Reddit, StumbleUpon) Links Stack Exchange Reference Number of Github Followers Number of Github Stars Number of Github Forks Analyst - Signals that are dependent on what I personally see and feel is important Curated News Curated News I Write Notes About Syndicate to Twitter Syndicate to LinkedIn Syndicate to G+ Publish story on API Evangelist Vote Up&nbsp; Vote Down My API Stack Ranking is always in flux.

			<p>I'm adding some new BaaS features I found in a recent press release from BaaS provider AnyPresence titled, "AnyPresence Launches 4th-Generation Mobile Backend-as-a-Service Platform with Unparalleled Enterprise Capabilities", to my list of BaaS features. &nbsp;As I'm processing them I notice they are some pretty significant features: Application Cloning -&nbsp;For organizations looking to build multiple apps that have common core functionality with only minor variations, this powerful feature allows them to create a copy of an existing app along with all data source, object, and user interface definitions, saving significant development effort. Automated App UI Testing -&nbsp;Developers who use AnyPresence to generate a starter mobile app user interface (UI), now get the added benefit of functional test scripts for native iOS, native Android, and jQuery Mobile web apps. These test scripts can be run to ensure the app is interacting with backend functionality as expected, saving time in testing and improving reliability. Custom Server Extensions -&nbsp;While developers have always been able to add custom code to objects within AnyPresence, they can now create re-usable &ldquo;Extensions&rdquo; that can be shared across teams or lines of business. This also enables third parties to encapsulate their services as official AnyPresence Extensions, enabling a marketplace of add-ons that can be used across the AnyPresence customer base. Enterprise App Store Integration -&nbsp;AnyPresence now supports the ability to deploy apps to employees directly via enterprise app stores powered by Mobile Application Management (MAM) or Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendors. Apperian EASE is first MAM partner solution to be integrated directly with the AnyPresence Designer. Cloud Infrastructure Management -&nbsp;For the default cloud backend server deployment to Heroku, administrators can now control the performance characteristics of their app, and choose from hundreds of Heroku add-ons, directly from the AnyPresence Designer. This seamless integration enables developers to plan for the required capacity and usage of each individual backend server instance, and manage them from one central location.

			<p><em>27 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>I'm working my way through all the API management providers, making sure I'm up to speed on what service each provider is offering these days. As part of this work I've been playing with the Apiphany platform, using a demo site the Apiphany team was so kind to setup for me. Using Apiphany I can manage my APIs, and launch a portal which allows me to hang all my APIs, then manage all aspects of their operations. Apiphany focuses on the three main components of API deployment &amp; consumption: APIs - API resources and their operations you've deployed and would like to hang and manage via your Apiphany portal Products - Virtual products you create, which allow access to various combinations of API resources and operations Apps - Applications that are registered with the platform, and consuming APIs via various product subscriptions The way Apiphany sets up the systems is very intuitive, giving you quick, administrative control over the systems you will need to execute on either a very simple, or even a very complex API strategy. APIs Apiphany provides all the basics for API management, allowing you to add to endpoints, manage the title, description and manage operations for each endpoint, allowing you to define service operations to enable service documentation, interactive API console, per operation limits, request/response validation, and operation-level statistics. Beyond the basics you can mask APIs, implement sophisticated caching and import overall API definitions from a WADL, Google Discovery Document, Swagger or OData format. Products After you have all your raw API resources defined, you can move to define your "products", composed from your valuable API resources. The Apiphany product manager allows you to provide names and descriptions for your products, choose who has access and whether their are published or unpublished and the terms of use for any developer who subscribes to a product. API product management takes a lot of work, experience and creativity--the Apiphany management system makes it...[<a href="/2013/05/27/api-management-using-apiphany/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I have been using Github to manage my code for a couple years now, but in the last year I'm using Github more often for a variety of projects that don't always have code involved--examples ranging from hosting slide decks for my talks to repositories for my API research projects.
In the last couple months I've noticed I'm not the only one using Github to organize projects, check out of a few of these examples:



  
 White House Open Data Project - Using Github to publish and solicit participation around the open data policy for all federal agencies


  
Hackathon Guide - How to throw a hackathon guide, complete with an event website template that runs as Github page


  
Innovators Patent Agreement - A new way to do patent assignment that keeps control in the hands of engineers and designers, put forth by Twitter.


  
Germany for Laws - A repository containing all German federal laws and regulations in Markdown format



Github lends itself to managing markup and markdown documents in a very collaborative way, allowing for tracking issues and revisions along the way.  There is something about the open source process that introduces transparency and visibility into the document creation and management process.
I'm wll keep tracking on the innovative ways I'm seeing Github used.  So far I'm pretty impressed with the different ways I'm seeing Github used. &nbsp;If you know of any other interesting ways, please send my way.

			<p><em>25 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>I wanted to share a quick visualization of the beneifts of&nbsp;Barack Obama's Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API, following&nbsp;Executive Order 13571, and part of the Whitehouse CIO's strategy, entitled "Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" and the potential of the recent&nbsp;Open Data Executive Order and accompanying Open Data Policy. 
Each federal agency should have three things available online at their domain:

agency.gov/digitalstrategy/
agency.gov/data
agency.gov/developers/

Those are three pretty important signals in the API space. &nbsp;This represents each agencies technology roadmap, data and developer resources. Which can be some pretty interesting signals for the overall health of a federal agency.
To demonstrate, let's look at the Department of Energy.
Let's go to: &nbsp;http://energy.gov/digitalstrategy

&nbsp;
Next: &nbsp;http://energy.gov/data/

Then: &nbsp;http://energy.gov/data/

After the Department of Energy, let's take a look at another agency, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Let's go to: &nbsp;http://irs.gov/digitalstrategy


Next: &nbsp;http://irs.gov/data


Then: &nbsp;http://irs.gov/developer


Granted, these are two very different agencies.  But I can't help but think that the IRS should hand out a copy of the White House Open Data Policy internally, and figure out how they can begin to let a little light into their operations and culture.

			<p><em>25 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>I'm reading IRS: Turn Over a New Leaf, Open Up Data, from the Open Knowledge Foundation blog. I'll let you read it in its entirety, but these are the points that are sticking with me: One of Mr. Werfel&rsquo;s first actions on the job should be the immediate implementation of the groundbreaking Presidential Executive Order and Open Data policy, released last week, that requires data captured and generated by the government be made available in open, machine-readable formats. Doing so will make the IRS a beacon to other agencies in how to use open data to screen any wrongdoing and strengthen law enforcement. By sharing readily available IRS data on tax-exempt organizations, encouraging Congress to pass a budget proposal that mandates release of all tax-exempt returns in a machine-readable format, and increasing the transparency of its own processes, the agency can begin to turn the page on this scandal and help rebuild trust and partnership between government and its citizens. Making IRS data open won&rsquo;t solve every problem; the recent scandal has proven that the IRS must be more transparent about both the information it collects, but also how it manages that information. A commitment on day one to share the data it collects in a machine readable manner would show true leadership by Mr. Werfel and help solidify the Obama administration&rsquo;s legacy as an open government. From my vantage point, in the world of APIs--I can't help but feel the solution to our "big government" illnesses is a little API therapy. &nbsp;The Open Data Policy has set the bar, and its up to the individual agencies to pay attention. APIs are not just a technical band-aid. APIs start with a technical seed, but if a business or government entity internalizes the concepts around opening up, providing access, and setting up a feedback look with the public, partners or even with other departments, they will potentially let in a little sunlight.

			<p><em>24 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Salesforce is doing some pretty interesting stuff with the sandbox environment for DeveloperForce.
Using the DeveloperForce sandbox you can create copies of your data, allowing you to develop, test or train against, not just a sandbox, but a relevant and meaningful copy of your company's data.
The Force.com sandbox has always allowed you to create a separate copy of your data, but now they let you create sandbox templates, allowing you to create specific data sets that you can reuse in different ways.
Seeing this feature coming out of Salesforce has prompted me to take a closer look at their approach to the DeveloperForce sandbox environment.  I'm sure there are other features and approaches to sandboxing we can learn from the API pioneer.

This reminds me of the story I wrote about UC Berkeley's desire for An API That Scrubs Personally Identifiable Information From Other APIs.
As the API universe expands, I'm seeing a greater need for me to study and tell stories around API testing, monitoring, sandboxing and the best practices around API development and integration.

			<p><em>24 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I just had a demo of some of the new features in the WSO2 API Manager.   Since WSO2 is one of my partners, I have a regular call with them to discuss the space and I often get demos of their new products and features.
Today's topic was multi-tenacy in their API Management platform, meaning&nbsp;you can easily deploy multiple API portals using the platform.  Not every company will need more than one API portal, but for some companies that are further along, it provides a pretty sophisticated way to engage with API consumers.
When it comes to slicing and dicing your APIs, we usually segment our API resources by service level, apps and users.  WSO2 introduces a fourth layer--by the domain.  So now you can group API resources under domains, crafting different "API storefronts" for your consumers.
I'm still thinking through all of the opportunities with API management multi-tenancy, but at first thought, it will help me counteract many of the questions I get around a company's concern that APIs have to be public.  Most companies have learned about APIs from the popularity of public APIs, so I spend a lot of time explaining the opportunities for internal or partner APis.
The WSO2 approach to API management multi-tenancy allows me to help companies understand that unlimited ways they can provide access to their valuable resources in not just public, private ways, but to any group, user base or target audience in a very organized and branded way.
You can hear me, and Chris Haddad VP, Technology Evangelism at WSO2 discuss multi-tenancy as part of the&nbsp;Your API Branding Strategy webinar on Thursday, June 13, 2013.
Disclosure: WSO2 is an API Evangelist partner

			<p><em>24 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Cloud storage of documents is becoming commonplace. Individuals, companies, government and non-government organizations have increasingly seen the potential of storing files in the cloud using services like Amazon S3, Dropbox and Box.
As a web or mobile application developer, it is becoming more common to provide integration, syncing or even direct usage of popular cloud storage services like Dropbox as the application's storage system.
This last week I started playing with Dave Winer's (@davewiner) simple idea outliner, notepad, todo list and project organizer--Fargo.
What caught my attention is Dave's use of Dropbox as the central storage for the app.  It reminds me of another application I use called Prose.io, which uses Github as the central storage system for the app.
I really dig this approach to delivering, dead-simple, meaningful apps like Fargo, that don't re-invent the wheel and focus on delivering value on top of the existing tools and platforms we already use.
I asked Dave what his thoughts are on this approach, in which he simply replied:


@kinlane -- works like a dream
&mdash; Dave Winer â® (@davewiner) May 22, 2013


I like Dave's approach to app development which is about delivering simple, useful apps that that sensibly put APIs to use, and establish a foundation using open formats like OPML.
As the hardware and operating systems developers depend on continues being vritualized and migrating into the cloud, the usage of open formats and common, API driven cloud resources like storage from Dropbox, will be common among successful app developers.
I think Dropbox as your apps default file system is here to stay.

			<p><em>24 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>I'm increasingly finding a company's approach to using Github, a vital signal of the health of a company, their team, and the products and services they are delivering. An example of this is with social data platform, DataSift's new open source area. DataSift has thrown up a Github page which re-enforces the company's commitment to consuming and producing open source software, as well as a list of important, Github driven signals: Latest Updates - The latest repository updates acorss all of DataSift's repositories API Client Libraries - Java, Python, Ruby, PHP and other client libraries for the DataSift API Public Github Repos - Other tools and utilities that are avaiable via DataSift Github repositories Job Vacancies - A listing of current job openings at DataSift I think DataSift approach is a very meaningful demonstration in the potential of being "open". &nbsp;As a company, DataSift provides access to valuable social signals, that any company can access via their interface and API, allowing them to develop insight and intelligence. If you look closely at their approach to deploying their Github hosted, open source site, it provides four very critical signals. API client libraries, open source code projects, job openings and updates across the company's Github profile. Think about it. The number of platforms supported for an API, the number of public open source code projects and the number and type of job postings for a company are pretty significant signals regarding the health of a company these days. &nbsp;These can be pretty difficult areas to fake, and in many cases will quickly show the activity, growth and stability of a company. I like DataSift's approach to their Open Source area. It doesn't just provide code and tools for developers to be successful, it provides us a deeper look into how DataSift operates. &nbsp; Of the 1,640 tech companies I monitor, 751 of them have Github accounts. &nbsp;I think many of these companies can learn a lot from...[<a href="/2013/05/24/datasift039s-open-source-world/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>I'm working through the wave of API innovation coming out of our Federal Government recently. During normal days at API Evangelist, I'm pulling private sector API usage examples and crafting them into stories to help the Federal Government execute on their API own strategies. Today, I'd like to showcase something the Federal Government is doing, in hopes that more companies in the private API sector will emulate as part of their API strategies. The GSA's&nbsp;Digital Services Innovation Center has launched the Mobile Code Catalog, an open source catalog of web and native applications that government agencies can use to jump-start their projects. Think application showcase, but all the applications are open source and allow for your API developers to download, fork and re-use code. The idea of a code catalog is pretty interesting, and I see it as an evolution of several API building blocks I talk about--code samples, SDKs, starter kits and application showcase all rolled into one. Imagine if your API consumers can come into your developer area and not just find code samples, they can find complete applications that they can download, reverse-engineer and put to use. Talk about going from zero to API integration in as short of time as possible. I know that many API owners compete with their ecosystems, by deploying their own version of their mobile, web or desktop apps, but for the others a code catalog is an excellent way to facilitate integrations with your platform. Another cool thing about the Digital Services Innovation Center Mobile Code Catalog, is that the catalog itself is open source and hosted on Github. This is a whole other aspect of the innovation around a code catalog, that the catalog itself can be downloaded, forked and published anywhere on a public website or private portal. I envision hundreds of code catalogs available in the near future, across many business, government and NGO sectors.

			<p>I was looking through Steve Willmott's slide deck from his talk at GlueCon this week, called The API- &amp; App-ification of the Web. He talks about the evolution towards Single Page Web Applications (SPA). Which is the migration from static web pages and database driven web apps to dynamically driven HTML, CSS and JavaScript apps designed using popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries like: Ember.js - Ember.js is an open-source client-side JavaScript web application framework based on the model-view-controller (MVC) software architectural pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page applications[1] by incorporating common idioms and best practices into a framework that provides a rich object model, declarative two-way data binding, computed properties, automatically-updating templates powered by Handlebars.js, and a router for managing application state Angular.js - AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Google, that assists with running what are known as single-page applications. Its goal is to augment browser-based applications with model&ndash;view&ndash;controller (MVC) capability, in an effort to make both development and testing easier. Backbone.js - Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface Single page applications have benefits like speed, no page reloads, mobile optimization, real-time pushes, notifications and they just look freak'n cool. But there are also downsides like needing some healthy JavaScript talent to maintain, SEO issues and a general deviation from the linked, document driven web we are used to. The popularity of frameworks and libraries like Ember, Angular and Backbone, and the Single Page Application approach isn't something just developers are noticing. Some top platforms are seeing the potential, and providing code and toolkits for integrating using Ember, Angular and Backbone: At Crowdflower with&nbsp;Ember.js at CrowdFlower At Firebase with Firebase Bindings for Angular and Firebase Bindings for Backbone.js At Salesforce with&nbsp;Using JavaScript with Force.com &amp;...[<a href="/2013/05/23/ember-angular-backbone-single-page-applications-and-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>I just got back from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. I visited Dallas last night to help kick off the first gathering of the DFW API Professionals Meetup. We got together at Microsoft around 6PM and I talked from 6:30 until 8:00, evolving on my From Web, to ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld talk. The meetup was about 45 people ranging from developers to investors. I showed up with a lot of content, but I wanted to make sure and cover the full API spectrum, while also introducing some new content about specifically about API consumption. During the event I had some time to get to know the theRightAPI, Proxomo,&nbsp;Layer 7 Technologies&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pariveda Solutions folks--while connecting with the rest of the meet up group members. Then, this morning theRightAPI crew brought me out to Plano, TX to the AT&amp;T Foundry (@attfoundry), where I got to talk with Vincent Button (@vebutton) and Jennifer Conley (@jenniferconley). I was a little blown away by what I saw. It wasn't what I was used when visiting the campuses of big telco companies in the past. The facility was something you associate with Silicon Valley and Bay Area. Open layout with a variety of people working on things ranging from voice solutions to the internet of things. Afterwards, Jennifer walked us up to the Gravity Center, which has been provided access to AT&amp;T and Alcatel-Lucent resources to support multiple startups in the North Texas area. I got to meet to the BookShout team and hear about how they are navigating and working to change the book publishing space, while allowing people to discover books, and build social networks around books and authors. I'm pretty impressed with what I saw in Texas in the last 48 hours. I met some pretty tech savvy people building interesting startups, putting APIs to use in meaningful ways, and a community around them that is investing in what they are doing.

			<p><em>13 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>I encounter many enterprise folks who dismiss APIs as nothing more that just one of the technical building blocks of SOA. Folks who, no matter how much I explain, will never see APIs beyond a technical specification and implementation. API Evangelist solely exists to shed light on not just the technology of APIs, but the equally important business and politics of the APIs. It is the business and political building blocks that help the concept of API grow beyond just its technical roots. An API won't find success just because you made a resource available via a URL. An API is successful because it is logically priced, possibly has revenue sharing, code samples to jumpstart integration and a support and resource network that a developer can tap into. An API is successful because it is open and self-service, but sensibly secured, providing a terms of service that benefit API owners, and developers, while also protecting the interests of end users. APIs bring together a unique blend of technology, business and politics into a transparent, self-service mix that can foster innovation. As someone who is heavily invested at the enterprise scope, it can be difficult to see things through this lens sometimes. You will need to upgrade your prescription with the eye doctor. Why "API" is working is not just a REST+JSON technical answer, there is a dark matter that binds the whole movement together, while also providing the right about of lubricant and oxygen necessary for innovation. In the enterprise you will often see this dark matter as governance, in the world of APIs it will have a lot of the same characteristics as your governance, but it is actually the exact opposite of governance. I don't expect to convert all you enterprise folks to see APIs like I do. I don't think you are equipped to view the dark matter that keep the API movement expanding and moving forward.

			<p><em>13 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I've been tracking on a trend in the API space that I call API aggregation.  Companies like Singly and Adigami are aggregating APIs into more meaningful API stacks, than any single API provider can deliver on their own.
In my regular monitoring, I'm always on the hunt for examples of the benefits of API Aggregation, and last week I saw some pretty interesting payment gateway data being provided by payment API aggregator Spreedly--which definitely reflects the positive effects I'm looking to shine light on in the space. &nbsp;
Spreedly is a cloud based credit card vault that allows you to work with one or multiple payment gateways over time or simultaneously, and has published some pretty interesting analysis of failed transaction rates across multiple payment gateways.

I'll let you head over to Spreedly to read the analysis.  What I find interesting is that they are open to sharing this data with the public.  This type of information sharing by API aggregator providers is critical to the overall health of the space. I'm often frustrated by the lack of data that API providers share, because they so often are keeping their cards so close to their chest, trying to protect their valuable business data or often lack of business data.
There is huge opportunity for API aggregators to share information about their experience with the common APIs they integrate and aggregate with.  The whole industry can learn from this, but also work its way back upstream to the payment API providers, providing them with insight into how their APIs are operating, but also provide benchmarks of where they stand with their competitors, good or bad.
Let me know if you see any other examples of API aggregators sharing data like Spreedly.

			<p>
After looking through the list of folks who have RSVP'd for the DFW API Professionals Meetup in Dallas tomorrow night, it looks like an interesting mix of tech and business folk.  The tech group is definitely the larger, with a mix of mobile, web and enterprise.  The business folks look like a mix of VC, project manager, marketing and startups.
I'm heading out to Dallas in the morning, and I am spending my afternoon preparing my talk.  When it comes to meetups, I like to wait until the last moment, see who has RSVP'd and shift my talk to being more tech, more business or more API 101 depending on the audience.   I like the mix of people I'm seeing RSVP'd for tomorrow night.
I'm pulling together a talk from some of my regular material, but updating for what is going on right now.  Resulting in the following outline I'm calling, "From ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld":

			<p><em>13 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>As I'm monitoring the API space I'm trying to create meaningful grouping for companies to belong when tracking API trends. My groupings are sometimes in alignment with what we hear in the tech blogosophere, but other times I try new definitions to help expand my monitoring definition and see if I can identify emerging patterns like I'm seeing with BaaS. Each week I do a little more exploration in concept of API aggregation, and this week after studying payment API aggregator Spreedly, I'm considering adding a new, overlapping area with aggregation, called API brokers. Let's see if I can make this work. API aggregators like Singly are providing personal data access to popular SaaS platforms by aggregating APIs. You can pull a list of photos from Singly, for a user, and it could pull photos from Flickr, Instagram and Facebook. This is pretty straightforward API Aggregation. Other providers like Temboo, provide this functionality but focus more on the API interoperability or as i call it API reciprocity side of things. Temboo does aggregate multiple APIs like Singly, but focuses on providing interoperability as well as aggregation. While Singly does to, there are differences in their approach. Spreedly has all the telltale signs of an API aggregator. They allow you to program against 48 payment gateways in 71 countries. It has aggregation, but rather than interoperability it seems to be about brokering transactions. Spreedly can help you choose the gateway based upon location, cost and availability. Which has all the elements of what I'd consider an API broker. I envision other new API brokers emerging, in niche areas like images, video or messaging. Imagine if you could use Twilio, Tropo or other SMS API provider, but use through a broker who will give you the best availability and costs based upon various needs. This type of API aggregation is not meant for providing users with access to multiple cloud silos via APIs, it is more about...[<a href="/2013/05/13/adding-api-broker-under-monitoring-for-api-aggregators/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>Curently I'm immersed in discovering, vetting and tracking on signals that show me which companies are trending in the API space. I'm looking for signals that will tell me which companies are making movements on a week to week basis, and when the blogosphere and developer communities are buzzing about these companies and technologies. Three very important signals I use are blogs, twitter and Github. These tools provide me with great signals I can use to tune into what a company is doing, when they push code, write a story or tweet about it. They also provide me with signals of when developers are engaging with API owners, because they follow on Twitter and download, fork, favorite and follow Github repositories. However, in some scenarios a companies blogs, twitter and Github accounts can also tell me when a company has given up and has run out of money or just stopped putting energy and resources into a project. An example of this is with a company I came across during my monitoring last week, called RESTful Labs. RESTful Labs has all the eye candy to draw me in. I mean they have REST in their name, and they build tools for developers! RESTful Labs provides API analytics tools for developers. I'm pretty stoked anytime I find something like this, then I immediately look at the common signals: Blog - Check! - Last blog posted 11 months ago Twitter - Check! - Last Tweet 8 months ago Github - Check! - Last commit was 8 months ago On the surface, RESTful Labs has all the right signal generators in having a blog, Twitter and Github accounts. But immediately these signals start working against them, rather than the positive signals I would normally gather from someone having a blog, Twitter and Github accounts. It is clear that RESTful Labs WAS something last year, but now it is all but a ghost town. It is not a tool...[<a href="/2013/05/10/when-api-success-signals-begin-working-against-you/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Does anyone else notice the evolution of the Twitter developer area? The site has taken a page from the LinkedIn playbook and become more about embeddable buttons, badges and widgets than about APIs. &nbsp;

Granted, you can click on documentation and get at the REST API v 1.1. &nbsp;I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing. &nbsp;I'm a big supporter of embeddable strategies for API providers. I think that evolution is very telling of Twitter's API strategy and what type of "developer" they want to support with the API.
Whether or not you agree with Twitter's overall API strategy, there is a lot to learn from their approach to API driven embeddable tools. &nbsp;I will produce more pieces aobut their approach to cards, timelines, buttons and other embeddable tools.

			<p><em>08 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>Accounting API platform Xero has been taking a deeper look into the languages that their developers are using when integrating with the Xero API. Currently there are 1,600 active applications communicating with the Xero API, from a mix of Xero add-on partners to custom integrations engineered by 3rd party developers. &nbsp;But which programming languages were they using? To create a snapshot of what tools developers are using, Xero needed to find the best source to obtain this data. Xero doesn't ask developers which platform they use upon registration, and since Xero doesn't require any sort of user agent or other identifying signature, it was difficult to know where to best acquire the data they needed. The next best place to look for this data, is with the code samples themselves. It would be nice, if Xero code samples were hosted using Github where they could track downloads, forks, followers, etc. But the best they had, was the page views from the pages for each code library, within the Xero developer area. Using this approach, Xero was able to extract some pretty interesting data about which programming languages developers were clicking on. Identifying the growing dominance of languages like PHP and the emergence of newer approaches using Node.js. While Xero was able to learn a lot, I think we all should learn from Xero's story. There is a lot to be learned by other API providers: 1) API integration needs to be language agnostic 2) Working to understand which languages are beings used or in demand from developers, on a regular basis is important. This seems like a pretty basic topic to some of us, but when an API is born out of a company that has a single language focus, it can be difficult to understand the needs of developers who are using other platforms and languages. Make sure you prepare an approach to gathering and regularly evaluating data around which languages your API developers...[<a href="/2013/05/08/get-to-know-which-languages-your-api-developers-are-using/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>In the API space, we have to be constantly measuring and looking for signals that will help us understand where we should be focusing our resources, as part of an overall strategy. One of the ways we measure value within the world of APIs (and business) is using KPIs, or Key Performance Indicators. Using KPIs we strive to measure the Return on our Investment (ROI), as we gamble with the technology, business and politics of APIs. One approach to quantifying the value, that has emerged from API providers, API service providers and the tech blogosphere is using the "API call". It is simple. You launch an API, so you quantify it by the number of times someone calls it. Kind of like a page view, right? Out of this eyeball derived reality(which is silly since APIs aren't for humans), the API space has become obsessed with the number of API calls, resulting in what is known as the API billionaires club. The Billionaires Club is an elite group of tech providers who have billions of calls per month on their API. It is a pretty simple algorithm. Have API + Have Billions of Requests = Your In The Billionaires Club. And if you are in the billionaires club, you are successful. &nbsp;End of calculation. To quickly get to the point of my story, let's take one of my favorite members of the API billionaires club, Netflix. &nbsp;Billionaire Club Membership + Shutting Down Public API = Success. It is a different variation on the whole concept of measuring API success. The news, commonly held KPIs and definition of success doesn't immediately pan out in the whole Netflix story. Netflix, along with Twitter are both &nbsp;API case studies for the history books. Both of these API stories reflect the ups and downs of the API world, and the often bipolar nature of the public API ecosystem and schizophrenic nature of the tech blogosophere. In contrast, along with...[<a href="/2013/05/07/make-sure-and-have-multiple-kpis-for-your-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>When it comes to the Internet of Things, APIs have a bright future. I tend to focus on the greater good when showcasing APIs, but occasionally I get tripped up by the market potential of APIs. I came across the Baby Toys Get an App Extension post in the New York Times this week, and I can't think of a more lucrative market for API interaction via a smart phone, than a baby or toddler's toys. First, can you image every mom or dad in America with access to their kids toys via their iPhone. Talk about an emotional connection. You have a real-time chord that is attached to a parents heart string. So if you are at work, missing your child that is at home, in day care, or even when you are at home with them, you have the opportunity to interact with your child via their crib, playstation or other toy? I'm not even going to start profiling the toys and the opportunity here. Second, can you imagine the data available for toy, clothing and other manufacturers? You have a daily, permanent connection between a parent and their child via the toys that are most important to a child each day, and by default, what is important to the parent. With API connectivity between this toy and a parents smart phone via the home wifi connection, there is an unlimited flow of data about what impacts a child's life, and their parents world each day. As the connection between APIs and the Internet of Things comes into focus for me, I get excited about opportunities like connecting our children's worlds to our smart phone enabled worlds. Then as soon as I get excited, I immediately get freaked out. Think about the opportunity, for&hellip;well, exploitation. We need to make sure there are best practices for terms of use, privacy and security in these fascinating, and new possibilities within the API space.

			<p>BaaS stacks have the potential to be the operating of the next generation of computing. BaaS has a lot of the characteristics of what we have historically defined as an OS, but tailored for apps that run on devices and in the clouds vs the desktop. Windows OS -&nbsp;Think of what the Windows operating system did for computing. It brought together a meaningful stack of resources into a single stack that could be installed on the new world of personal computers (PC). &nbsp;Windows provided application developers with a single platform they could build apps, targeting PC users. &nbsp;Windows provided a basic set of API resources developers could use, but ultimately it was open for the ecosystem to innovate in any business sector they desired. Server OS -&nbsp;When it comes to the server, many developers have migrated from desktop to web via Windows server operating systems. &nbsp;While to others they think of other OS flavors like Linux, BSD. &nbsp;These server environments provide developers with a base operating system for interfacing with user management, file system, database access and other libraries or APIs to develop either server side, network or web applications. &nbsp; Cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) -&nbsp;Cloud providers have moved the OS into the clouds--enabling developers to build at three different levels, providing a base OS, with set of often API driven resources for delivering site and apps to end users. &nbsp;The operating system has moved onto the world wide web, allowing for an entirely different approach to application development, usage and monetization. Virtualized BaaS OS -&nbsp;BaaS isn't just a new type of business. &nbsp;BaaS is a new way to deliver operating systems tailored for mobile and the next generation of devices, sensors and the Internet of Things. &nbsp;BaaS delivers the compute, storage, messaging and other essential OS features, while also bringing together other, potentially distributed resources in a single meaningful system for mobile developers to operate on and provide a meaningful experience for their users....[<a href="/2013/05/05/the-future-is-about-virtualized-operating-systems/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>BaaS is an evolution. &nbsp;Its not a revolution, gamer changer or ground breaking new technology. &nbsp;It is a logical response to the demand for mobile applications and how to logically bring together individual API driven resources into a loosely couple stack, that will allow mobile developers to build apps more efficiently.

			<h3><a href="/2013/05/05/investment-in-baas/">Investment in BaaS</a></h3>
			<p><em>05 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>As BaaS evolves, we are seeing the huge investment from numerous start-ups, as well as grabbing the attention of a handful of larger tech companies, but we are also seeing the first signs of major investment in the space. &nbsp;

Facebook Acquisition of Parse -&nbsp;Facebook recently acquired on of the top BaaS providers in the space, Parse. &nbsp;While there has been rumors swirling around the tech space for some time, regarding Facebook's desires to manufacture their own mobile device and possibly their own mobile operating system to rival iOS and Android, the Parse acquisition seems a little closer to reality. Facebook's investment in the BaaS space acknowledges that mobile dominance won't always be about device dominance, and the potential of well tuned, meaningful, virtualized stacks of resources for mobile developers. &nbsp;Facebook is looking to invest in mobile and BaaS represents that path forward. &nbsp;
Intel Investment in BaaS -&nbsp;In the same timeline as the Parse acquisition, &nbsp;BaaS platform FeedHenry announces a 9M investment from Intel Capital--showing more investment in mobile by the chip-maker. &nbsp;Revealing more of the mobile aspirations of Intel, the chip-maker recently announced the acquisition of enterprise mobile service provider Aeopona.&nbsp;
Lucent Mobile Acquisition of Proxomo -&nbsp;Lucent Mobile, Inc. reached a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Proxomo Software, Inc., a BaaS provider. As part of the transaction, Lucent Mobile, Inc. a private investor-backed company will operate going forward under the Proxomo name.

This is just a small slice of the investment going on in the space. &nbsp;To understand the market opportunity, white papers such as the&nbsp;report&nbsp;published&nbsp;by&nbsp;MarketsandMarkets. will provide that, but to understand the innovation opportunity, much more experimentation and research needs to occur on exactly what resources current developers are needing to truly be successful.
The research and development environment for the future of API resources will play out within the BaaS industry, through the efforts of small start-ups as well as from the major tech companies.

			<p>The definition of what is a BaaS provider has not just an evolving meaning, but also means different things to different people. API Evangelist is looking to help define the space, and formulate a way for discovering new providers, while defining the different types of existing providers, potentially establishing a harder definition for BaaS.
When it comes to BaaS there are a handful of clear leaders who are dominating the space. &nbsp;These leading BaaS providers are delivering the features that developers are demanding, while also working define the best of breed services that are leading the space in new directions. &nbsp;
After reviewing the space, monitoring the blogging and tweet volume of each provider, their activity on Github as well as references to them in top blogs like TechCrunch and GigaOM, and discussion about them on Reddit and Hacker News, it is easy to identify the leaders. &nbsp;Because of their own efforts, but also the conversations of analysts and developers, a pattern for BaaS success begins to emerge.

			<h3><a href="/2013/05/04/what-makes-baas-relevant-to-apis/">What Makes BaaS Relevant to APIs?</a></h3>
			<p><em>04 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>Unless you are a BaaS provider or a mobile application developer, the linkage between BaaS and APIs may not be immediately clear. But once you study the space, you quickly notice that APIs are the heart of BaaS, providing platforms with the flexibility and resources they need to meet mobile developers needs. BaaS and APIs are working together in several ways: Native BaaS APIs - Each BaaS provider offers up a default set of REST APIs for manipulating core data and object stores, providing programmatical access to almost every part of the BaaS platform Custom APIs - Most BaaS providers allow for the design, deployment and configuration of custom REST APIs from data an objects defined via the system. Turning many BaaS platforms into API deployment frameworks, opening up a whole new channel for development Deploy BaaS Platforms&nbsp;- The growth in number of APIs resources, coupled with the BaaS movement opens up the opportunity for new providers to step up and deliver BaaS stacks, using their own API resources, bundled 3rd party APIs or a combination of the two. An API Blueprint - The patterns that are emerging among BaaS providers provide an excellent blueprint of what types of API resources mobile developers are demanding. &nbsp;Closely watching the BaaS space has potential to provide a blueprint of what API resources are in demand, which aren't and potential opportunities for new API resources. BaaS is a natural progression of APIs from single uses to meaningful stacks of resources for developers. As the number of APIs a developer might use in an app grew from 1 or 2, to potentially 10 separate APIs, the need for aggregation and consolidation of resources grew as well. &nbsp;Mobile app developers don't have time or resources to maintain infrastructure as well as discover, qualify, integrate and maintain relationships with 10 separate API providers. &nbsp; APIs have helped identify and make available essential resources developers depend on like compute, storage, messaging and...[<a href="/2013/05/04/what-makes-baas-relevant-to-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2013/05/04/what-are-the-other-approaches-to-baas-pricing/">What Are The Other Approaches to BaaS Pricing?</a></h3>
			<p><em>04 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>API calls and passing on cloud storage costs are the most common ways to approach BaaS pricing. &nbsp;But beyond these two areas, there are numerous other ways BaaS providers are pricing BaaS services for developers.
With mobile app users being the center of the world in mobile app development, it makes a per user charge charge for BaaS services seem logical. A per user fee, potentially couples a BaaS provider monetization strategy with their developers. &nbsp;In this approach a provider may assume their developers will be monetization each end-user of their platform, thus can afford to pay more as they add users.
Other BaaS providers state that charging developers based upon API calls and number of active uses results in a kind of success tax. &nbsp;Meaning the more successful your app is, the more active users and API calls you will have, equally a significantly larger BaaS bill. &nbsp;There is still a lot of open discussion around this point.
BaaS pricing is far from standardized. &nbsp;It is much more a reflection of the IaaS layer beneath the BaaS providers than it is about the end users of the platforms. However there is a lot of experimentation going on in Baas, resulting in numerous other approaches to pricing across 45 BaaS providers.

			<p>API Evangelist doesn't focus on market or investment opportunities. I keep an eye out for product and innovation opportunities, which are a much different beast. These represent places where there are gaps in the delivery of API driven resources that developers will need to deliver the generation of not just apps, but compute. There are numerous opportunities for innovation within the umbrella that is being defined as BaaS in the areas that are obvious and fast growing in market spaces. Mobile -&nbsp;We are 2-3 years into the solid growth of the mobile smartphone market. &nbsp;This is nothing new. &nbsp;But with the adoption rate, the hype and the potential within emerging markets, we can ignore the opportunity within the mobile sphere. As the demand for mobile apps grow, the demand for efficiencies in mobile app development will grow exponentially. If a business can efficiently go to market with steady flow of high quality apps designed for web, mobile and a wide variety of mobile platforms, it will succeed in the current space Tablets -&nbsp;Tablets are displacing the desktop, and even laptop computers. The world of developing apps for mobile is rapidly morphing into a blurry world of hundreds of different devices from iOS to Android. &nbsp;There is a lot of potential for delivering BaaS platforms that focus specifically on the needs of emerging tablet devices across manufacturers Readers -Devices are blurring the lines between phone, tablet and dumb terminals. Across the publishing industry, from providers like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Nobles, we are seeing reader devices like the Kindle and Nook. &nbsp;As we see publishing applications like Flipboard and Zite find an audience we will see a growth in demand for backend services that support reader and other consumption focused devices Niche -&nbsp;Most BaaS providers are about delivering a general purpose stack of resources, allowing developers to design, develop and deploy apps across any business sector. &nbsp;Among the current pool of BaaS providers there are already...[<a href="/2013/05/04/what-are-the-opportunities-in-baas/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>After reviewing the top BaaS providers like Appcelerator, Appery.io Kinvey, Parse and StackMob, a pattern of building blocks begin to emerge. Building blocks that BaaS providers are using to assemble their platforms into meaningful stacks that developers can put to use. &nbsp;While each BaaS provider has their own approach, a handful of common building blocks emerge, allowing a coherent definition of what is a BaaS provider to emerge.
Using this list of common building blocks I looked to find other companies that offer similar backend services, resulting in the discovery of 45 total BaaS providers. After reviewing each BaaS provider, each feature of their offering was entered into a database--uncovering a common blueprint, of which building blocks mobile developers are seeking.
Over 200 building blocks have been identified in over 40 areas, across 45 BaaS providers. 37 building blocks in over 18 areas have been identified as common between at least 3 providers before they are included within my common BaaS blueprint.
This common BaaS blueprint represents one potential blueprint for using APIs, that are just not about consuming single API for a mobile app, but aggregating them to improve the overall delivery, management and life-cycle of mobile applications.

			<p><em>04 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>The approaches to BaaS pricing are still evolving. &nbsp;Most of the providers have gone with an API call or storage cost approach to pricing, but there still is much debate about just which pricing model is most beneficial to developers and will ensure BaaS providers are profitable.
The struggle in BaaS pricing reflects a struggle between BaaS platform providers covering their costs, while generating a profit for investor,s and the demands of developers who are often needing to start with a freemium tier, but may have radically different needs once their applications are in production, serving potentially hundreds or thousands of users.
Today, you see most BaaS providers pricing reflect the platform in which they are built on. &nbsp;Many of the current BaaS providers operate on Amazon Web Services, so the BaaS pricing is currently reflecting their upfront platform costs, compute and storage.

While it is a positive for the space that analysts are identifying as a $7.7 billion opportunity by 2017,&nbsp;and that top players like AWS, RackSpace and SalesForce are noticing, it could point to the beginning of the end for many of the start-up BaaS providers.

Summing Up BaaS Appendix A: Full List of BaaS Features Appendix B: Curated News Sources &nbsp; Backend as a Service There is an emerging trend in mobile application development, that people are calling backend as a service (BaaS), also known sometimes known as mobile backend as a service (MBaaS). With the growth in the number of mobile devices like iPhone from Apple, Android from Google, Windows Phones from Microsoft and the historic contender Blackberry, a number of BaaS providers are emerging to meet the demand for building, deploying and managing the mobile app life-cycle. What is BaaS? BaaS is an approach for providing web and mobile app developers with a way to connect their applications to backend cloud storage and processing while also providing common features such as user management, push notifications, social networking integration, and other features that mobile users demand from their apps these days. This new breed of BaaS services are provided via custom software development kits (SDK) and application programming interfaces (APIs). BaaS is a relatively recent development in cloud computing, with most BaaS start-ups dating from 2011 or later. The global BaaS market is&nbsp;estimated to grow from $216.5 million in 2012 to $7.7 billion in 2017 from a report&nbsp;published by MarketsandMarkets. How Does BaaS Differ From IaaS and PaaS?

			<p>I sent three emails this morning to people, explaining what it is that I do and how they can get involved. This process reminded me that I need to do the same here via the blog on a regular basis, to help people understand what API Evangelist is, and my vision for it. &nbsp; Despite popular belief I do not evangelize any single API to developers, my role (self-appointed) is to evangelize all APIs to the masses, most importantly beyond the developer community--penetrating business, marketing and other key groups. At API Evangelist I monitor the entire API space. To do this I track on 2000 of the best of the APIs out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've gone through the entire ProgrammableWeb Directory and hand pick the ones that are worth paying attention to, and I continue doing this in real-time as they are added. Its not that the rest aren't worthy of use, just not an approach I feel is worth showcasing to other API owners. 700+ of these APIs have blogs, 1000+ have Twitter accounts and many have Github accounts. I monitor all in real time. I also track on 250+ blog feeds from mainstream tech blogs (TC, Gigaom, etc) as well as lesser known feeds. &nbsp; I watch all this in real-time and tag everything using a centralized system I've developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I derive my blog posts and generate what I call my&nbsp;API Stack. The API Stack isn't meant to be a definitive list of who are the best, in a single order, but a living stack of which APIs are worth paying attention to, and are doing innovative things on a week to week basis. I generate The API Stack using my home grown ranking system which is based upon 3 types of signals:&nbsp; Internal&nbsp;&nbsp;- Number of blog posts, tweets, github repos and other internal activity from the APIs themselves External -&nbsp;@mentions of twitter, stack exchange, hacker news, tech blogosopher, github repo follwers and...[<a href="/2013/05/02/what-does-the-api-evangelist-do/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>I am tracking on 2000 APIs that I have deemed worthy enough to pay attention, out of the 9000 on ProgrammableWeb, 13,000 in APIHub and numerous APIs in Mashape's marketplace. In addition to these APIs, I'm also closely watching 30+ backend as a service providers, 20+ reciprocity providers and emerging big data, analysis, visualization and other emerging platforms who are using APIs in new ways. I was reading some of the great research coming out of OPENi, which is a "Open-Source, Web-Based, Framework for Integrating Applications with Cloud-based Services and Personal Cloudlets"--specifically the post on OpenI API Framework: Studying the Landscape of Cloud-Based Services. What is great about OPENi, is they are doing all this research and planning, and sharing the process with everyone publicly. Which is great for everyone, but will take some time to play out, as they study, plan and execute in the space. As I watch aggregate API providers like Singly plow forward and reciprocity providers like Zapier deliver some amazing integrations, using APIs, and bridging some of the most meaningful cloud platforms in our world--I can't help but think about how much redundant work is going on amongst startups. When it comes to the definitions of specific APIs, the nuances of their interface and authentication, each of these service providers is doing their own work, in a silo. In a perfect world, API providers would provide Swagger definitions, standard oAuth implementations, etc. API owners would do a lot of the legwork for these providers. &nbsp;As we know, this isn't the reality, and each of these aggegrators, reciprocity providers, analytics tools are all mapping these API connections on their own. I can't help but think about, how if providers stepped up, communicated with each other, they could establish some sort of commons for all of these API definitions to reside. &nbsp;They could colloaborately develop a way they could identify the meaningful APIs, hang Swagger definitions and code for connecting and authenticating...[<a href="/2013/05/02/startups-need-to-work-together-on-api-definitions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
Hey everyone.  I'm heading out to the Dallas-Fort Worth area the week after next, Tuesday, May 14, to kick off the DFW API Professionals Meetup.
TheRightAPI&nbsp;team were so kind to invite me out to speak, hang out and talk APIs, to help kick-off the area API group. Both&nbsp;TheRightAPI&nbsp;and backend as a service (BaaS) provider Proxomo are sponsoring the shindig.
The group will be meeting at the Microsoft Campus, 7000 Texas 161, Irving, TX.  We are thinking we'll kick it off with food and drinks from 6:00 - 6:45 PM, and I'll start talking around 7:00 PM.
After that we can just hang out and talk about APIs and see what all y'all are doing with APIs in Texas.  Ping me if your in the DFW area, so that I know you will be there.
Look forward to seeing you there and connecting.

			<p><em>02 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>I had a question from an API owner land in my inbox. It is regarding the amount of attention and resources that should be spent on on-boarding new customers. Directly from the email: How would you suggest companies place a quantifiable value on free API users? I know that it is very important to have a lot of people use your API so that they can make great things with your API and also give people a chance to really understand the value of what the API offers, but do you have any thoughts on how companies should decide how much to spend on an API conversion (AdWords, Hackathons, etc.) Let's first address the freemium part of the question. It is my opinion that every API should have a freemium layer. But only as one part of a well planned developer incentive ladder. This freemium tier is the top layer of your funnel. It will provide a way for people to test drive your API, understand what it does and the value it can deliver in their world. Your freemium layer should be easy to access, no billing required and provide a sensible access to your API resources--also your freemium tier should never appear as if it is in danger of going away. &nbsp;But freemium should be that first step, with clear, meaningful next steps towards on-boarding users as paid customers. Provide clear paths to becoming a solid, revenue generating and contributing participant in the platform. Make it clear to developers that at a freemium level they don't get support, that they have to pay to get that. Don't let this tier of users dominate you. With this said you better have good docs, code samples, active forum, FAQ and other essential building blocks for your self-service, freemium customers to use. But the amount of resources dedicated to your freemium customers should be minimal. In my opinion, your resources should go into supporting your paid...[<a href="/2013/05/02/how-much-do-you-spend-attracting-and-supporting-freemium-api-developers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I don't personally use Parse or any other backend as a service (BaaS) provider to build mobile applications. I'm just playing role as analyst when it comes to the backend as a service space, but I am a developer so I can tell when any technology provider is speaking to developers or just marketing and hock'n their wares. Each week I monitor the tech blogosphere, the API space and where it has expanded into the backend as a service space and driving mobile development. I pull 300 + feeds from random blogs and 700+ feeds from APIs providers. I see the contrast between what Techrunch, GigaOm and NextWeb produce alongside what API and BaaS providers publish to their blogs. Day after day you can really start smelling the bullshit. The positive side is that this high profile bullshit really makes good quality posts, that are actually about solving problems, stand out. I see a lot of posts come out of BaaS providers, and day after day, Parse is producing high quality posts, such as&nbsp;Versioning and Verification for your AWS Security Group Configuration and Six Creative Ways to Use Push Notification Marketing in Your Mobile App. When you read their blog, it is mostly posts that are about solving problems that developers are facing, and goes beyond just using Parse. There are a number of reasons Parse was an attractive investment for Facebook, but I think the Parse blog is a very positive signal that Parse is more than just about building a company for acquisition--Parse is building a platform that solves developers problems. Another important aspect of this, is they tell the story of how they do this in real-time. &nbsp;Without telling the story, you can be doing some amazing things and nobody will know about it--Parse gets this. Another sign of Parse's conviction, is the blog post rhythm hasn't changed since the acquisition of Facebook.

			<p><em>30 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>Listening to an episode of Traffic and Weather yesterday, renewed a concept that John Sheehan(@johnsheehan), founder of Runscope made in an article he wrote for NextWeb back in March. In the post, John walks us through his &ldquo;Three Commandments for Using Someone Else&rsquo;s API&rdquo;, which, after listening to him talk about his story on Episode 8 of Traffic and Weather, I couldn't stop thinking about commandment #2: Thou Shalt Not Forego Talking to a Person An open API is a great way to test drive an integration, but it does not absolve you from the responsibility of building a relationship with the provider. If you can&rsquo;t reach someone, that should be all the reason you need not to use that API. This commandment comes out of Johns unique experience which spans: Twilio - Experience managing large, successful developer ecosystem IFTTT - Experience being consumer of not just one, but many APIs Runscope - Providing tools that make API developers lives easier This experiences is what make John&rsquo;s perspective unique. He doesn&rsquo;t just understand delivering APIs and managing developers, he knows what it is like to be a developer and consumer of APIs. Which I think makes him either just the right balance or he&rsquo;s his own worst enemy, not sure--could be both. Anyways, regarding John&rsquo;s commandment: Thou Shalt Not Forego Talking to a Person. In the past I have put a lot of pressure on API providers to consider different potential layers of their API ecosystem, and work hard to have a consistent approach to communicating, supporting and engaging with your developer ecosystem. While this all holds true, and API owners should focus on healthy developer outreach, it is a two sided coin, in which developers are accountable too. The target audience for API Evangelist is API owners, so I guess my point is that as an API owner you have to craft a healthy communication and support framework, but also explain to developers when...[<a href="/2013/04/30/api-commandment-thou-shalt-not-forego-talking-to-a-person/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I spend a lot of time on API Evangelist getting excited about APIs.  Going on three years doing this, I'm getting a little more hardened in my view on what is "good" in the API space.  Along with that evolution, I'm getting my priorities in order.

While I may get excited about cloud computing APIs or quantified self APIs, there are other areas I think are straight up priorities--ones that we can't ignore.  To support this I'm launching several research projects into areas I have labeled as API priorities:

Federal Government
City Government
Education
Healthcare
Libraries
Universities

These represent areas I'm actively doing research in, looking for the best APIs, tools, services, building blocks and news while also generating as much analysis and white papers as I can to help define what is going on.
As with all of the API Evangelist network of research projects, everything is a work in progress and represents what I have time to dive into.  If you see anything missing, or feel some priority areas are not represented, let me know.

			<p>I'm always looking for easy, dead simple approaches to explaining APIs to people. Having real world examples, that folks can relate with, go along way in helping people wrap their heads around the very abstract concepts that are APIs. While going for a walk today I was thinking back when I use to build technology for my parents trucking company, when one of the fuel expenses was for Commercial Fueling Network (CFN), which is a self-service commercial fueling station. Whether your a long haul trucker or local contractor, you can use CFN to get at an essential resource for your business, whatever the application. Any business can apply and join CFN, get a "key" to access fuel resources in a self-service way. APIs are the same approach to selling any "virtual" online resource, as CFN is to selling a "physical" fuel resource. CFN doesn't just put free gas alongside the road for anyone to take. They have a portal where you know to go to get your resources, providing you with a key to access the fuel resources you need. CFN then bills you for the usage of their resource. You can be sure CFN has extensive data on how much fuel they sell and who it was sold to. With virtual resources, whether you are a iPhone developer or website developer you can use APIs to get at essential resources you will need for your business, whatever the type of applications you are developing. &nbsp;Any developer can apply to use an API, and get a "key" to access the resources in a self-service way. The best part about the online approach is you can turn ANYTHING into a resource. Your resource can be data in a database, specialized code you've developed or interact with anything in the physical world. This example works well for helping people to understand how APIs work, by using a real world example they may have experience with.

			<p><em>27 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>As the universe of APIs expands, I&rsquo;m working to find new ways that I can discover, educate myself, then organize information around the most meaningful areas in the API space. As part of this effort I&rsquo;m reorganizing API Evangelist site into a network of small story groups, so that I can focus on a specific piece of this expanding API universe. Each portion of API Evangelist will run using what I call my Hacker Storytelling format, where I use Github Page, Jekyll along with a variety of JSON driven widgets that tell a story around a specific topic. The first story group I&rsquo;m tackling is redefining two of my main sections which I had called &ldquo;service provider&rdquo; and &ldquo;tools&rdquo;. My original intent was to find resources people could use to deploy APIs, and if it was an online service I put it in service providers and if you could download and install, it went under tools. I&rsquo;m abandoning this approach and dismantling these sections and breaking them into goal oriented stories: Design Deployment Management Evangelism Monetization Discovery Consumption I don't have evangelism, monetization or consumption ready to go yet, but design, deployment, management and discovery are coming together nicely. You will be able to get at news, analysis, services and tools within these areas, as well as some overall thoughts about each area of the API universe. I'm doing this to help me focus on each aspect of the API space, allowing me to see just the news and the best of the companies who are active in that area. This approach really helps me curate and write very focused stories and white papers that serve each topic. I hope it offers similar value for you. My objective is to allow people to find information from two main areas, either using APIs or providing APIs. You can then navigate to individual areas within those two goal areas, with some overlap between them.

			<p>It is has been a while since I updated any of my research around APIs &amp; the Federal Government. In May 2012, I started monitoring the progress of the White House Digital Strategy, where I setup a monitoring system that pings all 246 agencies to see if they have published their digital strategy yet. As we approach the one year anniversary, I expect we'll see a lot more news emerge around what various agencies are doing as part of the original mandate by the White House. As of today there are now 23 federal agencies who have published their Digital Strategy at their domain. I have published all of my research around my APIs &amp; the Federal Government research at a permanent Github repository. I will continue pushing all my research, curated stories and analysis there in real-time. I have also published a handful of JSON data sets I have generated as part of the research: Publish List of Federal Agencies Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Social Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy &amp; Social You can find the JSON data for these areas, along with the PHP script I used to harvest, store and publish this data using the JSON version of each agencies Digital Strategy. While you can pull a list of federal agencies via from the&nbsp;Federal Agency Directory API, and each agencies social data using the&nbsp;Federal Social Media Registry API, the logos included with each agency is something I hand-rolled, so you won't find it anywhere other than here. &nbsp;I gave the data to the GSA, and I hope they incorporate the agency logos into the Federal Agency Directory API.

			<p>There was a lot of buzz in the API space over the last two weeks. I'm not a big on being first with news from the world of APIs, I leave this approach to the tech blogs like Techcrunch, RWW, GigaOm, The Next Web and others. I'd rather simmer on things for a bit, think beyond the press release, and craft a post that offers value beyond the initial announcement and the churnalism. To get everyone up to speed, four major things happened in the API space over the last two weeks: Intel Buys Mashery Computer Associates Buys Layer 7 Technologies MuleSoft Acquires ProgrammableWeb 3Scale gets $4.2M in Funding There is no arguing that these are some pretty significant signs the API industry is picking up the pace, especially when you have companies like Intel and Computer Associates taking notice and making investments. I've been tracking on the space for 3 years now, with round-ups of API service providers in 2011 and 2012. For 2010, 2011 it was all an uphill battle, but in 2012 I started seeing things heat up with the introduction of several new API service providers,&nbsp;then really stepping up in November 2012 with the acquisition of Vordel by Axway. But, the last couple of weeks are pretty outstanding, with not just acquisition of two separate API service providers, but also the fact that one of them is API pioneer Mashery, being purchased by chipmaker Intel. Love or hate Mashery, they help define the space and have been at it a while a while, and we all have an industry, partly due to their work. VC Cycles More Than API Cycles Personally I feel the recent acquisitions are indeed positive signals for the industry, but I think they are also just part of the natural cycle that is set in motion by the types of businesses, companies like Mashery and Layer 7 are looking to build. These are companies that are designed...[<a href="/2013/04/25/after-last-couple-of-weeks-it039s-clear-there-is-big-opportunity-in-the-api-space/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>Intel is reportedly buying API service provider Mashery for &ldquo;a range of $120 million to $180 million&rdquo;, according to ReadWrite(Web). As I reflect on this, two main questions come to mind: Was it a smart acquisition for Intel, and worth their money? Is this a logical move for Intel since they are a chip maker? Was Intel&rsquo;s acquisition smart for Intel? If they are serious about playing in the API game, which all signals I&rsquo;ve seen say yes, I think it was smart. They didn&rsquo;t buy Mashery for their tech, although their tech was a nice add-on to Intel's existing API Gateway.&nbsp;They bought Mashery to buy their market share. Is the acquisition worth 120-180M? I&rsquo;m not sure about that. I don&rsquo;t think Masherys current market share is worth all that, so I think this is an investment in the past and the future more than current market share. Mashery is the pioneer of the API space, owning that history has value, if you can deliver on the future of the API space. Which I think Intel is more capable of than Mashery was all by itself. Next is this a logical move for Intel? They are maker of physical things like motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphic chips, embedded processors, not of things virtual like APIs. Intel is known for making the thing essential ingredients &ldquo;inside&rdquo; our PCs, laptops, servers, smart phones and digital devices. They have been the driving force of &ldquo;compute&rdquo; for the last 40 years, basically my entire life. I&rsquo;ve heard lots of chatter today that Intel moving from building the physical ingredients, to virtual APIs is too big of a switch for Intel, and they will fail. Obviously I don&rsquo;t know shit about chip manufacturing, but if Intel wants to be the leader in the next 40 years of computing, moving from central processing units (CPU) to distributed processing units (DPU) makes sense.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>On a regular basis I review my API consumption to evaluate how I&rsquo;m using various APIs, and what I&rsquo;m paying for them. I depend on around 20 APIs to make API Evangelist work, and I need to make sure I&rsquo;m using them to their fullest potential while also being mindful of budget. As a part of my regular review, I am looking at the differences in pricing between three key services: FullContact API - I use FullContact for all my company and individual contact intelligence. I go through phases of light or heavy use depending on research projects I have going on. Full Contact provides me with per API call rates depending on the endpoint and call volume, and they limit me between four packages Trying It out (Free), Getting Started ($19/month), Gaining Traction ($99/month) and Rolling ($499/month) Alchemy API - I use Alchemy API to primarily pull text content from blog posts, so I can use it internally for indexing. With Alchemy I get access to three packages Free, Small Business ($250.00) and Basic ($800.00) AWS APIs - I use AWS for all my computer, storage, database and DNS API services. With AWS I pay by the resource, bandwidth transfer and storage and the other parts and pieces or specific actions in cloud computing. There are no packages, just modular API resources I use and get billed for. I&rsquo;m just one use case, but figured I&rsquo;d share my thoughts on how I use these three API resources within my little world. For Full Contact the jump from $19/month to $99/month isn&rsquo;t too bad. I&rsquo;ll lump all my processing together into a single month and get lots of work done. So I tend to toggle each month between these two tiers based upon my needs. For Alchemy API I operate within the free tier and stick with the rate limit of 1,000 API calls per day.

			<p>I&rsquo;m a walking conflict most of the time. You should try being me, it can be tense about 40% of the time. I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of example of what I mean to help bring you a little closer to what I experience each day. I&rsquo;ll start with what I consider to be the 2nd most important API of all time (#1 being AWS), Twitter. I love / hate Twitter. They really deliver on everything around their API except in regards to: Rate Limits - Their rate limits suck! Competition - They don&rsquo;t approach potential competition sensibly Communication - They aren&rsquo;t good communicators Other than those three "simple areas", Twitter delivers a damn good API. I find it very hard to criticize what they do, except for the fact that having suffocating rate limits, and shutting off access for integrations you view as competitive, can well, be a pretty quick downer. An example of Twitter in action is with their recent post about Symbols entities for Tweets. I love this idea, I&rsquo;m working through thoughts that are similar, when it comes to markup APIs or what I&rsquo;m calling dictionary APIs. I think that a dictionary, symbol or other lookup functionality around an API is cool and has a lot of potential...right up until the point you realize they are have been sharecropping a lot of this innovation from the Twitter Ecosystem. In the end, I just have to live at odds with the way I feel about Twitter. I can&rsquo;t stop showcasing the cool stuff they are doing, just because I do not agree with their approach to API rate limits, communication, competition and sharecropping (or is it cropdusting?) Another similar conflict in my life is around the Pearson API. As a company I&rsquo;m not 100% in agreement with what Pearson is up to, but from an API perspective, I am a big fan of the companies approach.

			<p>Obligatory spider web photo, because Jim and Audrey did too! The ability for me to own kinlane.com, point it at a server, host a website and a blog has been an critical part of my online world and professional career for over 12 years now. My blog goes back to June of 2007, but I have had a site and portfolio up there since around 2000. Having control over my domain has enabled me to store years of my writing, research and projects in a central location that I have control over, allowing me to land jobs, contracts or evolve into entirely new domains that have expanded my audience in ways I never imagined, like with&nbsp;API Evangelist. Anytime I can teach this approach to someone else and empower them to own their own domain, I&rsquo;ve jumped at the chance, resulting in numerous individuals who have their own thriving domains--including my girlfriend Audrey Watters with her blog Hack Education. Understanding what is necessary to purchase, own and manage your domain, servers, sites, applications and other portions of our digital lives is something everyone should do! But be careful, you just might change the world, and make a significant impact like Audrey (@audrewyatters) has. Last weekend while at MIT, I had a chance to work on a project that takes this concept of owning your domain and looks to make it an educational resource anyone can take advantage of. I ended up at the MIT Media Lab after being summoned for an&nbsp;open learning hackathon&nbsp;by MIT and Phillip Schmidt (@schmidtphi) of&nbsp;P2PU. &nbsp;During the event&nbsp;I had the pleasure of plotting and scheming with infamous technology educator Jim Groom (@jimgroom) and education rabble rouser Audrey Watters on an&nbsp;idea Jim brought with him, that was born out of the University of Mary Washington Domain of One's Own Project.

			<p>I wrote yesterday&rsquo;s piece on API education with Codecademy back in February. I didn&rsquo;t publish because I wanted to do more research on suggested areas of improvement for the Codecademy team to balance my criticism. The point of yesterday's post was not to bash Codecademy, it is to incentivize them to make their platform better. Until then, I can't really recommend as an API building block. The publishing of my post yesterday was triggered after seeing an example of what is possible after seeing another learn to code platform called Studio Sketchpad by Ari Bader-Natal (@studiosketchpad). Studio Sketchpad is an open studio platform for creating beautiful code, aiming to be a open studio for individuals learning to sketch beautiful code on the web canvas--built on a mashup of the Sketch from Processing and the Pad from EtherPad. Studio Sketchpad, while still a work in progress has many of the essential elements I feel should be part of any learn to code with API tool. Learn By Yourself - You can select lessons and learn online at your own pace Learn With Instructor - You can learn in real-time with the assistance of instructor Create Lessons - Instructors can build and record lessons and publish to a gallery, providing code walkthrough, with audio (using SoundCloud), complete with playback Cloning - You can clone a sketch (lesson) and tweek, edit and make learning more hands on Versioning - You can see the, interact and fork sketches at any point in the evolution of the script Embeddable - You can embed the sketch within your site, allowing for use on your site Render - All code renders so you can see the results of the lesson and your modifications Share - Allow you to share to your social networks Export - You can export code lessons to use outside of Studio Sketchpad Licensing - Sketches are openly licensed allowing for reuse, remix and learning I found nine additional...[<a href="/2013/04/10/some-suggested-elements-for-online-api-education-platforms/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Last week Twitter expanded its Twitter Cards initiative to allow 3rd party app developers to include links to download apps within Tweets, opening up new opportunities for app discovery via Twitter.  Yay, for app developers...
I won&rsquo;t try to explain the history of Twitter's approach to their ecosystem, their tight fisted approach to Twitter Cards, and how it affects this latest app discovery announcement.  Matthew Ingram does an amazing job (as always) of capturing the essence with Twitter plays its platform hand, and it is the one holding all the Cards.
My point is, their announcement isn&rsquo;t that exciting. Could you imagine what would be possible if Twitter decide to actually use an open standard like Open Graph, and allowed developers to innovate within Tweets using Twitter Cards?
I fully understand Twitter wants control over their platform, and I don&rsquo;t deny any platform the right to assert control.  And yes, Twitter allows their approved partners to play in this arena.  But that isn&rsquo;t open! &nbsp;And, it isn&rsquo;t part of the OG vision that Twitter was built on.
In my opinion, Twitter is missing out on soooo much opportunity for innovation in the space that exists within a Tweet.  Sure, not every developer idea would be good or even viable, but without opening it up, we will never know what is possible, and what end-users would want and embrace. &nbsp;It is all up to Twitter.&nbsp;
So much missed opportunity for innovation, in the name of control. :-(
Correction:&nbsp;I call Open Graph a Standard. &nbsp;I should have said protocol. &nbsp;I will leave as is, and just admit my error.

			<p><em>09 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>How To Get Your Grandma, Mother, Daughter and Sister to Understand APIs? You stop using gendered approaches when explaining what an API is.  I&rsquo;m not going to cite any of the past or recent examples of this (you know who you are). And I don&rsquo;t care "how you didn&rsquo;t even mean to do this", when you wrote your API example.  There really isn&rsquo;t a line between sexism and ignorant sexism.
If you really want everyone to understand what an API is, provide well written, plain english examples, that are framed around solving a problem your grandma, mother, daughter or or sister will understand--using problems they truly face in their lives.
It really is that simple.  As long as you are using gendered terms to describe what we are doing, you are raising the barrier to entry. &nbsp;And when you do this, you are talking down to a person and making them feel small, stupid and all the other power trips that go with sexism.  And yes, those thing are still there even if you "didn&rsquo;t mean to do it".
So let &lsquo;s make sure and keep API examples about solving problems and putting the valuable API resources to use, and not about gender, and get EVERYONE on board.
End of story! And if ever step over this line, call me out. I welcome it, cause I'm not perfect or exempt.

			<p><em>09 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>As I do with many of my stories, I&rsquo;ve been stewing on the news that online education platform Codecademy started offering API programming lessons for popular APIs like Twilio and NPR back in January. While at first glance this seems like an important evolution in API education, I wanted to really think through all the details of API on-boarding before I passed judgement. Codecademy&rsquo;s claim to fame is a pretty slick code view where you can edit your code and then a view window, which will process and run your code, letting you know if you&rsquo;ve done it right or not. Each class is broken into several lessons, allowing you to finish at your pace, with a accompanying Q&amp;A forum, glossary and scratch pad--with a badge showing you passed the course. Codecademy offers API classes for YouTube, SoundCloud, Parse, Twilio, SendGrid, NPR, Sunlight Foundation, Bitly, PlaceKitten and Stripe APIs and handful of others, with each class using Python, Ruby or JavaScript as the programming language. &nbsp; I think Codecademy is a novel idea for helping existing developers understand the ins and outs of learning a new programming language or learning an API, using their wizard driven, code tutorials. But it shouldn&rsquo;t be the only tool in your toolbox for helping people understand your API. First I don&rsquo;t think people (especially non-developers) want to &ldquo;learn a programming language&rdquo; or want to &ldquo;learn an API&rdquo;. In my opinion, APIs are about opening up access to resources that anyone can take advantage of, even non-developers. Because many APIs are built on HTTP and use simple key authentication, it makes them extremely hackable and something that anyone can put to use. I don&rsquo;t think we need to require people to be programmers to use APIs, we can allow varying grades of coders, scripters and hackers to put APIs to use to solve problems they face in their everyday worlds.

			<p>I get a lot of inquiries from API owners about how they should price their API access in a way that will make sense to developers, but also help them generate revenue from their valuable API resources. As most of us are still trying to figure out sensible pricing for our new APIs, or better understand how to adjust and evolve pricing to better suit existing developers--Amazon is busy reducing their cloud API pricing. &nbsp; I got a simple email from Amazon today: Dear Amazon S3 Customer, We are excited to announce that we are reducing&nbsp;Amazon S3 request prices&nbsp;in all nine of our regions. We are lowering the prices for GET requests by 60% and the prices for PUT, LIST, COPY, and POST requests by 50%. For example, in the US Standard Region, we are reducing the price of every 1,000 PUT requests from $0.01 to $0.005 and the price of every 10,000 GET requests from $0.01 to $0.004. We are happy to pass along these savings to you as we continue to drive down our costs. The new lower prices for all regions can be found on the&nbsp;Amazon S3 pricing page. New prices are effective April 1st and will be applied to your bill for all requests on or after this date. Sincerely,The Amazon S3 Team These price reductions are becoming more frequent across the numerous AWS APIs I depend on like S3, EC2 and RDS. &nbsp;I have been an S3 user since 2006 and EC2 since 2008, and I didn't see price reductions at all in the early days, but they seem to be a common part of doing business in the cloud today. The obvious explanation is that competition in the cloud space is heating up, especially with Google stepping up their game, but I think there are other lessons for API owners here.

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming professionally since 1988, so I&rsquo;ve been around quite a few developers in my career. There seems to be a lot of moments lately that cause me to look back at this career, reassess what I've learned, and adjust the direction I'm going with this mined wisdom. &nbsp;This week I&rsquo;m reflecting on the recent insanity around Adria Richards, my role as the API Evangelist, and spending time thinking about the tech space's inclusiveness as I&rsquo;m hanging out with my 12 year old daughter for spring break. Throughout my career, in just about every position I&rsquo;ve taken, whether as a programmer, manager, lead, architect and VP, I&rsquo;ve encountered developers who are challenged by me, my role, skills and approach to tech. I can remember 3 separate roles I&rsquo;ve had where one of my first assigned tasks was to fire a developer who had made everyone&rsquo;s lives miserable, because before I came along they couldn&rsquo;t fire them (him), because they were dependent on them for their skills. Quality technical talent is hard to find, and many companies can&rsquo;t afford to lose the talent they already have. No matter what the personality defects or the workplace issues might be. Many developers know this and work it to their advantage, taking advantage of power they possess for their own selfish goals. This power struggle does not just exist between developers and non-developers. As a programmer I encounter developers who always have to one up you, and make you feel stupid for what you don&rsquo;t know. It might be a programming language, database platform, technical library or just the fact you use Windows vs Mac. Some programmers can co-exist, but many feel the need to challenge others, while assuming a defensive position around their established fiefdom. Outside the corporate firewall I see this behavior extended to online interactions, where programmers make non-developers feel insignificant for what they do not know, and belittle other developers for what skills they...[<a href="/2013/03/30/usually-when-developers-are-mean-it-is-about-power/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I read your Terms of Service is one of the biggest lies on the Internet.  We agree to terms of service for each and every service we use online, without ever reading and understanding exactly what we are agreeing to.
This is one of the most damaging aspects of online life, as through this process we are giving away our rights, ownership of our data and allowing for our privacy to be compromised each and every day.  While not all services are abusing this, there are many online services that use this to their advantage, in an effort to maximize the amount of value they extract from their platform and end users.
Service providers have to go further in educating users about the terms of service they are agreeing to.  There is a great example of this in action, via an article in NextWeb called &ldquo;now THIS is how to write your startup&rsquo;s Terms of Service&rdquo;.  The post showcases how real-time sharing platform Heello has provided plain english descriptions, next to each &ldquo;legaleze&rdquo; paragraph in their terms of service.

This is nothing new. You see it with other providers like Tumblr.  But I think it is a very simple enhancement to API terms of service that can have a huge effect, and begin leading us in a more healthy direction when it comes to educating end-users about the TOS they are bound to.  While companies need the protection of a legal terms of service, there is no reason you can't provide your end users with a translated, plain english version. &nbsp;It doesn't take much work, and really sets you apart from other API service providers.
Do you know of any other examples of online services going above and beyond to help educate end users about terms of service?

If you aren&rsquo;t familar with The Noun Project, it is a innovative visual language project, that is creating a library of icons that will enable people to visually communicate and interact around the globe. Direct from The Noun Project about page: Humans have been using symbols to communicate for over 17,000 years because they are the one language everyone can understand. Symbols can transcend cultural and language barriers and deliver concise information effortlessly and instantaneously. They allow people to communicate quickly, effectively, and intuitively. And for the first time ever, this language is being combined with technology to create a social language that unites the world. The Noun Project wants our feedback on what a Noun Project API might look like and what we would use it for. &nbsp;So, I wanted to take a moment and share my thoughts, about what I would use The Noun Project API for, and some thoughts about what the endpoints might look like. Embeddable Normally an embeddable strategy for an API is in the background, relinquished to just one of the tools in the toolbox. With the Noun Project I think a healthy embeddable strategy would be front and center, providing a wide array of buttons, badges, widgets and other items users could syndicate across the web. The library of embeddable tools should be open for submission, much like the core of the Noun Project. Designers could generate custom button sets, badges and other embeddables for users to choose from. The Noun Project's embeddable strategy would make the Noun Project API accessible to everyone, even non-developers. Builders and IDE A Noun Project API would enable a next generation of mobile and web application apps, as well as other visualization and big data analysis tools to integrate consistent imagery. Makers of integrated development environments (IDE) could provide button, icon and other UI components with a wealth of meaningful icons, that...[<a href="/2013/03/28/the-noun-project-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

I depend on If This Then That (IFTTT) to move data around the cloud. &nbsp;I syndicate blog posts from API Evangelist to Blogger and Tumblr. &nbsp;This isn't just blind syndication, it is SEO and also plan B scenarios to make sure my content exists in multiple areas.
When it comes to the IT decisions for API Evangelist, I carefully evaluate what services I use. &nbsp;If I begin to depend on an account, after 6 months I need to start paying a fee to secure some sort of quality of service (QOS). &nbsp;This is how I roll.
Not all platorms allow for this. &nbsp;In my opinion, all FREE platforms should have relief valves for users like me, who want to move to some sort of paid account, assuring me some sort of service level agreement (SLA) or I'll move away.
For example: Once I started using Evernote regularly, I moved to the premium level. &nbsp;I bought into Pinboard at an early rate, once I was hooked. &nbsp;Inversely, I can't pay for Twitter, Facebook and some Google services. &nbsp;Today it is about IFTT.
In light of me losing Google Reader I'm taking a hard look at all my services. &nbsp;IFTT is on the chopping block.
I have about 20-30 jobs running at IFTTT, moving data around between my cloud services, in a way I depend on. &nbsp;I need to move this into the realm of premium or paid services. &nbsp;
What are your thoughts? &nbsp;Sell me on your service.

			<p><em>26 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I spent some time drinking IPAs and talking education technology with Audrey (@audreywatters) and a friend of ours Adam Wendt (@skinnyblimp), the COO of&nbsp;Iris Educational Media last week. IRIS Educational Media is a behavioral research and development company that provides educational resources for parents, parent educators, K-12 school staff, including teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals, and direct support employees. During our discussion, Adam was describing how he wanted to make Iris Media resources available for people to use on any platform, by providing valuable embeddable tools and resources for organizations and professionals to use on their own sites and portals. As Adam was talking, of course I&rsquo;m thinking API. An API would not just a way to drive their own line of embeddable tools, but would also allow for other 3rd party developers to build specialized tools and widgets for other platforms that Iris Media might not have awareness, time or resources to focus on. Wanting to be available on numerous platforms is easy, but actually delivering on them can be costly and time consuming--APIs are a way to share this load with a 3rd party community. An API could power Iris Media&rsquo;s syndication similar to Youtube. The Youtube API, plus a robust embeddable tool strategy is behind the massive syndication and growth of the popular video platform. Iris Media could go further with its own API, by integrating a partner layer within their API platform, and provide developers, organizations and educational professionals the ability to earn revenue by syndicating or developing widgets and applications on top of the Iris Media API. This revenue could go a long way in ensuring some of these essential educational professionals organizations stay in operation and continue making an impact. Engaging with people like Adam, who are truly making a difference in priority areas like education, is why I continue doing API Evangelist. APIs can help Iris Media be more successful in reaching its audience, but also empower the huge number...[<a href="/2013/03/26/embeddable-api-conversations-with-adam-of-iris-media/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
A roadmap is an essential part of a healthy API ecosystem.  The transparency and communication that come with providing a roadmap for your API and open data initiative will go a long way in building trust with your community.
The City of Philadelphia is sharing its roadmap of data sets that it intends to open in the coming months, by providing a release calendar using cloud project management service Trello. In addition to seeing the datasets the city intends to release, you can also see any data sets that have already been published.
According to the open data roadmap, Philadelphia is releasing data on street closures, energy consumption, evacuation routes, campaign finance, bike racks, budgets, expenditures and city employee salaries to name just a few.

This type of transparency doesn&rsquo;t just build trust with citizens and developers, it provides an incentive for the city government to deliver high quality public data, in a meaningful and timely manner.    There is still a lot of work to be done once this data is available, in order to develop quality analysis, visualizations, other APIs and tools that can be used in mobile and web applications. But what Philly is doing is a great start.
The City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s approach to its open data roadmap is good to see.  It is something all cities should have, as well as all API owners.  Your roadmap will set expectations within your community, guide your own initiatives and provide a healthy blueprint for moving your efforts forward.

			<p><em>25 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
NASA has a pretty cool challenge going on, to create an API for SkyMorph, a database of optical images and catalogs generated by the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program.  According to the NASA description, SkyMorph provides:
access to imagery by time and position or searching by specific asteroid or other moving object. The time dimension, unique to SkyMorph, allows users to discover changes in the intensities of stars, e.g. supernovae, or to discover moving objects, e.g. comets
NASA is challenging us to help build a RESTful interface that would enable developers and citizen scientist to access SkyMorph imagery, lowering the barrier of access to the data and encouraging innovation around the program.
Ok, how cool is that!  APIs that enable everyone to help track on and understand objects in the sky, along with NASA.  It is projects like the SkyMorph API Challenge that keep me excited about APIs.

			<h3><a href="/2013/03/21/interactive-api-documentation-with-swagger/">Interactive API Documentation With Swagger</a></h3>
			<p><em>21 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>It is becoming more common for API providers to deliver documentation using what's known as interactive API documentation, instead of the usual static API documentation. Understanding how to use an API can be tough sometimes, and rather than just reading about it how it works, interactive API documentation allows you make real calls against an API, while learning about the interface. While there are several approaches to delivering interactive API documentation, my personal favorite is using Swagger. Swagger comes built in with 3Scale, which is the API management platform I use for the API Evangelist API, but Swagger is available for anyone to use as an open source project. Interactive API documentation using Swagger starts with a Swagger definition, which is a JSON representation of an API endpoint. In this case, the endpoint is for accessing my blog posts: This JSON describes everything about my very basic endpoint, which allows users to query almost 3 years of API Evangelist blog posts. Using this definition, Swagger generates the following API documentation automatically: As someone learning about the API Evangelist Analysis API, this describes the endpoint, which fields are required to make an API call, but it doesn&rsquo;t just describe this with text, it provides an interactive interface in which I can enter my API keys, provide a query value and actually make a request against the API: So I don&rsquo;t just learn about the API endpoint. I learn about what keys are needed and fields are present that allow me to request different information of the API endpoint. It allows me to actually see the request to the API, the resulting body of my API request. This type of hands on learning is essential to onboarding new users with your API. I can read your API documentation and not see the value, but when I am walked through how to build a request, and actually see the value returned in real-time, it changes the game.

Way to go brogrammers. &nbsp;You made sure a bright light in evangelism was partially dimmed tday. &nbsp;Really? With all the shaming that goes on targeted at women, you don't have balls to take a little shaming when you arer being a sexist pig? &nbsp; C'mon...ummm have some balls?
As I've said it before, us guys are going to have to eat shit with a side of humble pie for many years to come to balance this whole sexism thing out. &nbsp;Let's own it.
All it would have taken is a humble apology from those gentleman in response to the Tweet, then some healthy discussion about why what they said was wrong, and move on kids. &nbsp;
I sure hope the hacker news crowd steps up and defends every woman that is shamed by guys now, as they seem to be a defender of this now. So if you Tweet out shaming a woman in a career changing way, know hacker news will be all over you...right? &nbsp;Right?
I just want to make sure you know I support you Adria. You are not unemployed, you've been promoted to new levels of evangelism. Let me know how I can help.

			<p><em>21 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I'm tracking on a new wave of application frameworks and API centric architecture patterns, that are not just helping deliver the next wave of web &amp; mobile apps, but also bridging, aggregating and providing interoperability and transformations between APIs platforms. One company I've been watching closely is Seabourne. The Seabourne team has an approach to application development that follows a very interesting set of principles: Information Flows Instead of Pipelines - Information operates in &lsquo;flows&rsquo; where inputs and outputs are flexible and happen at any point. Flows are fluid and flexible, unlike structured, point-to-point pipelines Data has Multiple Owners - Information flows are composed of multiple streams of data owned by different partners and vendors. Any process must accommodate multiple canonical sources for different information Use APIs to Move Information - By using APIs to move information around, we decouple the data from the underlying technology and vendor, and make it possible to combine information from different technologies. APIs provide a flexible, low cost base to grow the system and meet changing needs Integrate Data Across Systems - Information lives on multiple systems inside and outside the organization. There is tremendous value to be had from combining multiple data sources together into a single information stream Translation Rather Than Standardization - Information is stored in multiple structures and formats. Any effort to manage information should focus on translating between structures rather than trying to develop a common schema I think that pretty much describes the challenges we face building web and mobile apps today, and Seabourne's approach isn&rsquo;t just about building apps, it is about organizing resources from multiple providers to build the best app you can. To see it in action you have to check out the project they just implemented using their approach called GovInfo. Using GovInfo, anyone can sign up to receive alerts from more than 100 different federal agency websites. GovInfo gets its information from a large number of sources ranging...[<a href="/2013/03/21/app-design-with-an-acquire-process-publish-api-architecture/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
It was inevitable.  API Evangelist now has its own API.  I had a couple partners ask for more sophisticated access than provided by RSS or JSON dumps out of my platform. &nbsp;So I launched a handful of API endpoints, allowing you to get at information from my world.
I currently have 13 endpoints providing access to the core of my platform, in 8 key areas:

APIs - Name, logo and description of the 2K APIs I'm activtely monitoring
API Stack - Access to my weekly and monthly API stacks
Analysis (Blog) - Access to my entire blog catalog
Service Providers - Access to all API service providers I track
Tools - A full catalog of all the API tools I've found
Curated News - Title and links of news that I personally curate from my 2K+ feeds
Notes - Notes I make during my daily and weekly curation
Building Blocks - The common building blocks I've identified after looking at 2K top APIs

There is a lot more data behind my firewall that I want to open up.  I do a lot of research on top APIs like Twitter and Google as well as trending areas like aggregation,&nbsp;backend, reciprocity and real-time service providers.
I will also be opening up API endpoints into the site traffic for apievangelist.com, apivoice.com and my other properties.  And toying with opening up some collections of my personal data like calendar, projects, checkins and other aspects of my world.
Currently I&rsquo;m only issuing keys to API Evangelist subscribers and partners, but let me know if you are interested in getting at any of my data.  Eventually I&rsquo;ll make much of it openly available, but I&rsquo;m still formulating my approach, and playing with different service compositions--so things will change.

			<p><em>19 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I had a demo of a new data extraction service today called Import.io. The service allows you to harvest or scrape data from websites and then output in machine readable formats like JSON. This is very similar to Needlebase, a popular scraping tool that was acquired and then shut down by Google early in 2012. Except I&rsquo;d say Import.io represents a simpler, yet at the same time a more sophisticated approach to harvesting of web data and publishing than Needlebase. ExtractUsing Import.io you can target web pages, where the content resides that you wish to harvest, define the rows of data, label and associate them with columns in table you where the system will ultimately put your data, then extract the data complete with querying, filtering, pagination and other aspects of browsing the web you will need to get at all the data you desire. ConnectAfter defining the data that will be extracted, and how it will be store you can stop and use the data as is, or you can setup a more ongoing, real-time connection with the data you are harvesting. Using Import.io connectors you pull the data regularly, identify when it changes, merge from multiple sources and remix data as needed. Put The Data To WorkUsing Import.io you can immediately extract the data you need and get to work, or establish an ongoing connection with your sources of data and use via the Import.io web app or you can manage and access via the&nbsp;Import.io API--giving you full control over your web harvesting connections, and the resulting data. When getting to work using Import.io, you have the option to build your own connectors or explore a marketplace of existing data connectors, tailored to pull from some common sources like the Guardian or ESPN. The Import.io marketplace of connectors is a huge opportunity for data consumers as well as data scraping junkies (like me) to put their talents to use building unique and desireable...[<a href="/2013/03/19/web-harvesting-to-api-with-import-io/">Read More</a>]</p>
