<p>title: ‘Incentivize API Developers With A Mozilla Open Badge Program’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/mozilla-open-badges.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://openbadges.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/mozilla-open-badges/mozilla-open-badges.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>Last week <a href="http://openbadges.tumblr.com/post/45364274104/introducing-open-badges-1-0">Mozilla launched their new Open Badges platform</a>, as an open standard to recognize and verify learning.  I immediately started thinking about how it could be applied to APIs for incentivizing developer participation and success.
<p>I&rsquo;ve come across other badge programs, but Mozilla is the first open approach I&rsquo;ve seen, providing free software and an open technical standard, that any organization can use to create, issue and verify digital badges.
<p>So I was thinking, as an API owner, you could use Open Badges to structure a series of rewards for developers who reach important milestones integrating with your API, and engaging with your ecosystem.
<p>Some examples badge-worthy milestones might be:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Achieve X amount of API calls</li>
<li>Published application to showcase</li>
<li>Published open source code library</li>
<li>Developed more than one application</li>
<li>Revenue generated from application</li>
<li>Supporting the forum and conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>It would take a bit of planning to developer the right approach to badging for each API, as goals would be different for each provider. But, providing badges could provide an incentive for developers to work towards meaningful goals you have tied to important KPIs for your API strategy, While also providing an easy way to track your most knowledgable and potentially trusted developers.
<p><a href="http://openbadges.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/mozilla-open-badges/mozilla-open-badges-diagram.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>If API providers start issuing sensible and consistent badges for API knowledge it would also provide additional ways to measure the size and overall health of the API developer community.  I could envision badges that would serve specific business sectors or even around city, state and federal government APIs and civic efforts.
<p>I will add Mozilla Open Badges to my list of <a href="/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a> and explore other ideas about how an API provider can establish badge programs to incentivize and reward healthy API developer activity.

<p>Google launched a <a href="https://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/03/build-collaborative-apps-with-google.html">Realtime API for the Google Drive Platform</a> today.  It is the API version of the same functionality available on Google Drive, that allows for you and other collaborators to type, edit, annote and chat with each other within a Google Doc.
<p>To use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/" target="_blank">Google Drive Realtime API</a> you add the Google Realtime Javascript library, then you can give any local object on an HTML page realtime behavior.  The JavaScript library and Realtime API handle network communication, storage, presence, conflict resolution and sync changes using what they call a CollaborativeString object.
<p>The Realtime API isn&rsquo;t just for documents, it can be used for productivity apps, games, entertainment and much more.  The only limitation is a developers imagination within their own applications.
<p>Google gives a <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/realtime-quickstart">quick start</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/reference/">documentation</a> and other resources to get you going, and they provide a pretty cool <a href="https://realtimeplayground.appspot.com/">realtime playground</a> for building stuff with the API in a hands-on, interactive environment.
<p>There are other players in the realtime space already, like <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> and <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>.  Google&rsquo;s entry into the arena is a signal that there is developer demand for realtime tools and provides validation for the other startups.   I&rsquo;ll play with Google Drive Realtime API some more and talk with the folks at Pusher and Firebase and see what their thoughts are and how it compares.

<hr />

<p>Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt">@audreywatters</a>) forwarded a very interesting series of tweets to me yesterday from software artist, writer, and educator Jer Thorp (<a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt" target="_blank">@blprnt</a>):
<script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>Has anyone written about APIs as art objects?
&mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt/status/313713240943247361">March 18, 2013</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>(We make APIs for almost every art project we build - in some ways the APIs themselves are the most interesting/poetic parts)
&mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt/status/313714968379940865">March 18, 2013</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>It feels to me the API could become a medium for artists in the same way that the algorists embraced the algorithm in the 70s.
&mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt/status/313716173973897216">March 18, 2013</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>The APIists. You heard it here first.
&mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt/status/313716358242238466">March 18, 2013</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>The API's ability to bridge platforms/devices/languages is almost inherently interventionist.
&mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt/status/313717301008535552">March 18, 2013</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<p>What a fascinating thought. It is so close to how I see APIs in my minds eye.  A single API design can hold so much beauty, information, expression and emotion.  Imagine if you hung the API design for each iteration of the Twitter API on a wall.  There is so much to interpret.  It expresses the vision of Twitter founders and employees, it is in direct response to a million developers and the needs of 500 million users around the globe. &nbsp;What an impression!!!
<p>While JSON might be the only way we have to visually describe an API, each web, mobile app and data visualization could also be considered an artistic representation of the Twitter API.  You could fill an entire gallery with JSON representations of each endpoint and each of its versions, applications, and visualizations.  Creating interactive art exhibition of the Twitter ecosystem.
<p>I remember back in 8th grade(1984) I was in my social studies class with Ms. Schuler.  She brought in some fractal prints, she said were created by her mathematician boyfriend.  She walked us through how each visual was actually a math problem.  This was the same year my math teacher Mr. Hathaway got around 20 Commodore Vic 20s, which he didn&rsquo;t know how to setup and run, so a handful of us stayed after school and helped setup the lab.  At this point in my education I hated math, and without seeing the beauty of the fractal, I may never have developed a passion (obsession) for computing.  My counselors told me I&rsquo;d never have a career in computers, because I was so poor at math. Ha! Eat it middle school counselors!
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/washington-crossing-the-delaware-cropped.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>Jer Thorp&rsquo;s tweets really resonate with me.  APIs are a technical, business and political representation that can interpreted in so many different ways.  When I read a <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">swagger definition of an API</a>, images begin to form in my mind around the intent of the APIs author (think girl in red dress from the Matrix).
<p>Sometimes an API will invoke kindergarten images in my mind telling me the designer didn&rsquo;t have the experience it took to represent their information and resources properly.  Other times they invoke very precise images, almost too precise, alerting me to the fact this API was designed by another application and not a human.
<p>On a very rare ocasion I will see an API design that you can tell was hand crafted, with the love and care of a individual or group of individuals who considered the needs of many end users, developers, and other consumers.  After several iterations an artful API representation will also begin to bear the technical, business and political imprints of its time.  Much like a painting will have certain styles, approaches, shapes, sizes, colors and materials going into the ink and canvas, or maybe markings of war, its owners or poor care.
<p>In my opinion APs are a very artful representation of sometimes very complex data or programmatic resources, that have the possibility to evoke very emotional responses from the developers that build on them or the from the end-users who are the intended audience.
<p>Thanks for planting this seed in my head Jer.  It is a topic I will visit often, as I&rsquo;m no doubt going to stumble across patterns and approaches that are more art than tech, as I&rsquo;m navigating this amazing API driven world I'm obsessed with.
<p>And remember you heard it from Jer Thorp (<a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt" target="_blank">@blprnt</a>) first!

<p>I would say the most common path to an API is from your company's database.  This makes database to API connectors, tools and services a pretty valuable area of the API space.  While there will always be high profile APIs dominating the tech blogosphere, most APIs will be launched quietly from small companies, by connecting them to various internal data sources.
<p>During <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, I met a new API service provider, called <a href="http://www.slashdb.com/" target="_blank">SlashDB</a>, that focuses on just delivering APIs from your database.  Once installed on any web server, SlashDB connects your internal databases and constructs a REST/HTTP web service, easily making database content accessible by URLs for getting, updating, inserting and deleting in a secure way.
<p>SlashDB provides connectors for Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostGreSQL, IBM DB2 and Sybase--covering the top 5 databases you will find in the enterprise or small to medium businesses.
<p>I notice that SlashDB also has Microsoft Excel connectors.  I will have to investigate this further and do another story on API deployment from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  I know this will sound insane to the RESTafarians, but I think much of the worlds data is locked up in spreadsheets, on individual computers, throughout companies around the globe.
<p>I've added SlashDB to my list of next generation API service providers like <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">EmergentOne</a>, <a href="http://apispark.com/" target="_blank">API Spark</a> and <a href="https://apiengine.io/" target="_blank">API Engine</a>. &nbsp;Check it out, and let me know what you think.

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-resource-to-last-mile.png</p>

<hr />

<p>This post is more rant, and about me working through my thoughts on this subject, which is why its on <a href="/admin/blog/kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a> and not <a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a> or <a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>. &nbsp;This post is an aggregation of ongoing thoughts I'm having around my role in the API space, a diagram I drew the other day while enjoying an IPA, and inescapable thoughts fueled up by a post by&nbsp;Patrick Meir over at iRevolution, called <a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/03/17/neogeography-and-democratization/">Crisis Mapping, Neogeography and the Delusion of Democratization</a>. &nbsp;
<p>Meir kicks up a bunch of thoughts related to how I perceive my role in the API space, which I believe is to help keep a certain amount of oxygen (aka open) present in the space, which I believe is the key ingredient in why the expirement we know as APIs is working. &nbsp;At first glance, API Evangelist looks like just a blog, but in reality it is a pretty complex system of data stores, API connectors, jobs and curation that I'm using to help draw a map of the API space that I can follow. Currently it looks something like this:
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apis-resource-to-last-mile.png" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apis-resource-to-last-mile.png" alt="" width="600" /></a>
<p>The way I see the space, is there are a shitload of resources, awaiting to be exposed via APIs that are both public and private resources. The stewards of these resources have the ability to select from tools and resources to deploy their API resources, using various building blocks for accomplishing this.
<p><strong>API as a Service</strong><br />Additional to standing up your own API, there is the phenonmenon known as BaaS, PaaS and SaaS. &nbsp;Many of these platforms can actually help you deploy API resources, while also consuming and deploying resources of their own. &nbsp;For example, Kinvey allows you to deploy generic APIs from data stores you setup on their BaaS platform, bt they also consume API resources and makes available to you from eBay, and other places, while also providing you with their own API resources that you can use to rapidly deploy mobile apps. This layer is complex, lots to think aobut here.
<p><strong>Top APIs</strong><br />There is a breed of API resources that are changing the landscape, both in whats available and how you do it. &nbsp;Leaders like Twilio, SendGrid, Amazon Web Services, Google and others are providing API resources and approaches to delivering API resources in ways that are influencing the API economy in big ways. &nbsp;These players stand out, and are worthy of identifying as separate group.
<p><strong>Discovery</strong><br />API consumers have to be able to find API resources. &nbsp;Historically we've only had ProgrammableWeb for this, but we are seeing growth in number of directories, IDE integrations and other evolutions in how we describe, share and discover APIs. &nbsp;
<p><strong>Enablers</strong><br />There are several evolving approaches to using APIs that deliver entirely new use cases for APIs, enabling new value that API providers and consumers can tap into. &nbsp;API aggregation from providers like Singly are bringing together existing API resources into easier to use, aggregated interfaces. &nbsp;Reciprocity providers like Zapier and IFTTT allow resources and value to transfer between API platforms in the clouds and behind the firewall. &nbsp;Application frameworks like <a href="http://ql.io/">ql.io</a>, are changing how we bridge APIs and rapidly build API driven web and mobile applications. &nbsp;Real-time providers like Firebase and Pusher are connecting and providing APIs that make the exchange of API driven resources real-time. &nbsp;These are just a of the few of the new areas of API enablement I'm seeing emerge.
<p><strong>Reseller</strong><br />Platform providers like BaaS, PaaS and Saas, plus the enablers, discovery services and top APIs all represent reseller and partnership opportunities for individual companies deploying API resources. &nbsp;This is the wholesale world of getting your API found as well as being baked into an existing consumer base. &nbsp;Without a reseller or partner layer to your API, you are just a single API in a ever growing flood of API resources.
<p><strong>Last Mile</strong><br />However, this is all just the piping or tubes of this fascinating new API driven economy. &nbsp;The entire purpose of having these API pipes is to deliver the "last mile". &nbsp;APIs began by delivering resources to distributed web sites, and enabling sharing and embeddable widgets and buttons. &nbsp;With the birth of the cloud, APIs began delivering wholesale infrastructure resources for use indistributed cloud environments. Then with mobile we saw the demand for APIs skyrocket--what will it do with big data, sensors, devices, cars, home and building and beyond?&nbsp;
<p>Which brings me back to my role as API Evangelist. &nbsp;I feel compelled to keep the discussion of the pipes occuring within all the "last mile" conversations. &nbsp;I understand the VC's and companies under their control want to monetize the last mile. &nbsp;This is fine. &nbsp;But I want to prevent the API pipes from getting paved over in the process. &nbsp;
<p>I want ANYONE to be able to get at the pipes behind the tablet applications their children use. &nbsp;I want ANYONE to be able to get at the data that went into any infographic, visualzation or report. &nbsp;I want ANYONE to understand the pipes that connect our physical worlds via sensors, devices to our online worlds. &nbsp;
<p>I want the pipes to stay open, accessible, transparent and part of ALL "last mile" conversations. &nbsp;Which brings me back to&nbsp;Patrick Meir article. &nbsp;There were several key quotes I'm processing in regards to how I view API resources, API pipes and the last mile API Products that are derived from them:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Feenberg&rsquo;s own view is constructivist, &ldquo;emphasizing that technology development is humanly controlled and encapsulates values and politics; it should thus be open to democratic control and intervention.&rdquo; In other words, &ldquo;technology can and should be seen as a result of political negotiations that lead to its production and use. In too many cases, the complexities of technological systems are used to concentrate power within small groups of technological, financial, and political elites and to prevent the wider body of citizens from meaningful participation in shaping it and deciding what role it should have in the everyday.&rdquo;</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;Meaning Hacking" is often hijacked by "Deep Technical Hackers"</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Democratizing information flows and access; promoting Open Data and Do it Yourself (DIY) </em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Innovation with free, highly hackable (i.e., open source) technology; letting go of control.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"the artful alteration of technology beyond the goals of its original design or intent,&rdquo; enables &ldquo;Deep Democratization"</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Freely pro-viding the hackable building blocks for DIY Innovation is one way to let go of control and democratize"</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The control over the information is kept, by and large, by major corporations and the participant&rsquo;s labor is enrolled in the service of these corporations, leaving the issue of payback for this effort a moot point. Significantly, the primary intention of the providers of the tools is not to empower communities or to include marginalized groups, as they do not re-present a major source of revenue."</em>
<p>There are so many lessons to be absorbed from CrisisMapping and Neogeography, when it comes to the API economy. &nbsp;Sorry for just posting these quotes as just a list, but I'm still absorbing and just needed them published in single place, so I can reference and re-read while thinking on this subject. &nbsp;(Thats right, I read my own blog!)
<p>I don't think there are any easy answers here. &nbsp;I just want to make sure we keep the conversation including the pipes and not just about the resources and last mile products delivered on top of the pipes. &nbsp;So we don't cutoff the oxygen needed for the API economy to work for EVERYONE!

<p>title: ‘Using The Crunchbase API’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/crunchbase-logo.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/crunchbase/crunchbase-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Audrey</a> came to me last night and said she had a project that she wanted to tackle, using the <a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase API</a>.  She wanted to pull a list of education startups that were founded in 2010-2012, showing their investments, CEO, founders and other related company information.
<p>A couple weeks ago, I helped Audrey download a PHP Twitter bot, reverse engineer and make it work for an objective she had around Tweeting random responses to a certain type of tweet.  I figured she was ready to see what it took to hack on an API and get the research data she needed.
<p>Audrey wanted to pull a list of startups that were educated related.  We started with the /search endpoint, using the query keyword &ldquo;education&rdquo;.   The query parameter appears to search the title, tags and overview of each Crunchbase entry, pulling way more than what we needed, 5700 in total.  Each search returned 10 startups, with a handful of fields for each company, not nearly enough information.
<p>To prove we could get what we needed, we took the first startup returned, grabbed the name and used it to perform a company /entity search, returning a wealth of information.  We had what we were looking for including date founded, amount raised, CEO, founders as well as description, logos, addresses and other vital company information.
<p>Back to the /search endpoint.  Each search only returned 10 results, when there were actually 5,700.  I looked at the documentation and the only parameter listed, was &ldquo;query&rdquo;.  No way to control how many results returned, paginate or otherwise.  So I start guessing, appending page=, and max=, maxrows=, anything to get more results.  Eventually I was able to change the page, so I was able to write logic to loop through each page, getting at all the results required.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/crunchbase/crunchbase-search-endpoint.png" alt="" width="500" />
<p>For each returned result from the /search endpoint, I would take the company name and perform a company search on the /entity endpoint.  However each call to the endpoint would yield a 301, redirecting me to another URL.  So the search for:
<blockquote><em>http://api.crunchbase.com/v/1/company/Noodle+Education.js?api_key=[key]</em></blockquote>
<p>Get a 301 returned, with the following redirect URL:
<blockquote><em>http://ec2-107-21-104-179.compute-1.amazonaws.com/v/1/company/noodle-education.js</em></blockquote>
<p>So for each /entity endpoint I would have to make two separate cURL calls to get a single record for a company.  An approach that is guarantee to get CrunchBase into the API billionaires club (as chatty APIs do), or at the very least generate a nice bill with their API management provider.
<p>Next, I needed to create a table to store the data in, I looped through the JSON object and spit out a list of fields, so I could generate a SQL script to create the table.  There were a few duplicate fields, but quickly got a table up and the data inserted.  The data is decent.  There are a lot of issues with absence of default values, empty objects with available images, addresses, etc.  But nothing I&rsquo;m not used to wading through, to get what I need from an API.
<p>With the /search endpoint based upon a single keyword search, that spans title, overview and tags, the search returned a lot of companies that didn&rsquo;t fit our search.  As we prepared to enter each record into a database, we would apply further filters, making sure there companies founded in 2010 or greater, and met other criteria, before actually inserting.
<p>Now we had a MySQL table filled with 772 education startups.  I exported as CSV, uploaded as a Google Spreadsheet, and shared it with Audrey.  Game over.  She had what she needed.  Overall it took about 3 hours start to finish, which she felt was tedious, and feeling there was a lack of clarity regarding the whole process--something she couldn&rsquo;t have done with me and my API programming skills.  This is a problem CrunchBase.
<p><a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/crunchbase/startup-ecosystem-visualization.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Audrey is your target audience</span>.  This needs to be dead simple.  She shouldn&rsquo;t have to blindly navigate the API endpoints, documentation, data structures and holes in the data.  These are things I&rsquo;m used to having to cobble together, but an analyst like herself, won&rsquo;t have the time and patience.
<p>I can tell the CrunchBase API was created by someone who didn&rsquo;t give a shit about the data, let alone use the API to build anything.  I saw a job posting from CrunchBase, so I know they are looking for someone to own the API.  I hope this person can become a steward for this great set of data, and make it into a meaningful API--there is a lot of potential there.
<p>Quick feedback for whoever takes the job, regarding some building blocks to focus on:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong> - Establish more meaningful names for the existing endpoints, while establishing some new ones</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Get the documentation complete!!  So what if you have I/O docs, if all the fields aren&rsquo;t defined</li>
<li><strong>POST / PUT</strong> - Al</li>
low folks to add and update data either after they curate and add to it, or from their own databases
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - Create a blog, that lets me know someone is home.  Its so evident nobody is. </li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Provide me with an active Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ account to interact with you on and share what I&rsquo;m doing with your data</li>
<li><strong>Branding</strong> - I need some guidance with branding of CrunchBase data, when I publish in the wild</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - Holy shit, the opportunity with badges, buttons and widgets around CrunchBase data.  This data is made for crunching and sharing in stories</li>
<li><strong>JS Library</strong> - You need a plug and play dictionary, demographic JavaScript library that allows bloggers, analysts, etc to embed on pages and provide a library with a rich set of demographic references, funding links and other vital data people will cite in stories and reports around the web</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet</strong> - From the I/O docs, provide export as CSV and to Google Spreadsheet.  Build Google Spreadsheet templates that allow users to enter their key into cell and it will pre-populate a spreadsheet with the data they are looking for, with the analysis, visualizations and other tools analysts will need</li>
</ul>
<p>CrunchBase is a goldmine of data.  As it is, I can make use of the data and generate value.  But the API won&rsquo;t remain at the center of that, I will extract the value I need and not return much to the platform, because well...it sucks ass.  I can&rsquo;t write back, and I do so much work to get the value I do, I feel like its mine after I&rsquo;m done. Especially if the platform has no person or personality that I consider an owner or steward. &nbsp;I don't feel beholden to give anything back. &nbsp;Just take...not good for your business.
<p>You guys have a lot of potential within the <a href="http://developer.crunchbase.com/io-docs">CrunchBase API</a>, I hope you dedicate the resources to make it work, and find a steward for the API that will actually care about what you have, and interact with your API consumers in a meaningful way.

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/braintree/braintree-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>Next generation payment provider <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank">Braintree</a> just launched a new JavaScript library that helps  merchants reduce their PCI scope in a flexible and testable way, which they are calling appropriately&nbsp;<a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/braintrust/braintree-js" target="_blank">Braintree.js</a>.  According to Braintree, the library:
<blockquote><em>...uses asymmetric encryption to prevent raw credit card data from passing through merchants' servers. It intercepts a form submit in the browser that contains sensitive data, encrypts that data with a public key provided to merchants by Braintree and then submits the form with the encrypted data to the server. Braintree retains the private key of the key pair so that merchants are unable to decrypt the encrypted fields server-side. Any string field in Braintree's API can be encrypted and encrypted values can be transparently dropped into any API call</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what I call a <a title="embeddable API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Embeddable">healthy embeddable strategy</a>, which includes buttons, badges, widgets and other tools you can build on top of an API or to support API integration.
<p>With the <a href="https://github.com/languages">rise in populartiy of JavaScript</a>, and the growth of platforms like Node.js, I predict that providing your API developers with standardized JS libraries that extend the value of your API will become commonplace.
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add a section to my <a title="embeddable building blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">embeddable building blocks</a>, for JavaScript libraries. I&rsquo;m seeing more API providers doing cool stuff in this area.  I will try and record as much of it as I can during my industry monitoring each week and provide resources for you to follow.
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the <a href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">potential of markup APIs and scripting platforms</a>&nbsp;in the past, which I think is a related example to what Braintree is doing--in which you can build JS libraries for your API users and extend not just the reach of the value generated by your APIs, but the expertise of your team.

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/pusher/cisimple-plus-pusher.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p><a href="http://blog.pusher.com/using-pusher-to-power-cisimples-real-time-api/">This story comes</a> from Phil Leggetter (<a href="https://twitter.com/leggetter">@leggetter</a>) over at <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>.  Its about a client of theirs, <a href="https://www.cisimple.com/">cisimple</a>, which provides continuous delivery services for mobile developers.  <a href="http://blog.cisimple.com/2013/03/06/check-out-our-shiny-new-api-and-pusher-integration/">cisimple just released a new API</a>, which gives mobile developers more control over the build processes for their mobile applications.
<p>Using the cisimple API you can kick off new builds and download artifacts from your mobile dev process.  cisimple is a very interesting API resource, that I will definitely be watching, and I&rsquo;m sure I will be writing about in the near future.  But what I really think is interesting is that cisimple is allowing clients to register for real-time updates via Pusher channels, using API tokens.
<p>This means that when you use cisimple to manage your mobile development, you now have a real-time push system that will send notifications when builds start, pass, fail, etc.  This opens up a whole world of human integration with the build process via desktop and mobile notifications, but also can be used in other systems that play a role in your dev cycles.
<p>The weaving of a Pusher real-time notification layer into the cisimple API is pretty innovative. Something I&rsquo;m sure will deliver huge value to their customers.   But think of the potential as a standard approach for all API owners?  You could offer developers real-time notifications about their own usage of your API, providing them with an intimate view of how their application(s) are using an API.  Addiitionally it seems like you could set up a pretty interesting system wide notification layer that would let you, as the API owner, establish notification channels regarding overall API usage, thresholds and other important signals from your platform.
<p>As I continue to dive into the <a title="real-time" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/realtime.php" target="_blank">world of real-time APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m surprised at the multiple ways in which we can truly deliver real-time value using APIs.  cisimple API + Pusher is in interesting addition.

<p>title: ‘Pinboard API Tax Proposal’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/pinboard-icon.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://pinboard.in" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/pinboard/pinboard_in_blue.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>Maciej Ceglowskiis, the founder of popular social bookmarking platform <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>,made an <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pinboard-dev/PidYOmyBaxI/mLDKIzC6olgJ" target="_blank">interesting proposal over on the Pinboard Google Group</a>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I've been thinking about imposing an API tax, the proceeds of which  would go into improving API infrastructure and offsetting operating costs, structured along these lines:</em>
<ul class="mainlist" style="padding-left: 30px; list-style: none;">
<li> 
<ul>
<li><em>API free to use for your own Pinboard account</em></li>
<li><em>Every API client making requests on behalf of someone else must register an app identifier</em></li>
<li><em>$20/year tax if your app makes requests for over 100 Pinboard accounts</em></li>
<li><em>$100/year tax if your app makes requests for over 1000 Pinboard accounts</em></li>
<li><em>Possibly additional price levels to waive certain rate limits</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Think of it as a road tax that then pays for further construction, repair, and  people in orange vests.</em>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that Maciej has a lot of experience to back his proposal, watching how developers use Pinboard for their own purposes, or on behalf of a user via a client.  I heavily depend on Pinboard for my curation at API Evangelist, so API access would remain free for me.  I&rsquo;m not sure how I would feel if I was building a client.
<p>On the forum, there is very interesting feedback from Matt Schmidt, developer of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pindroid">PinDroid</a>, the leading Pinboard client for Android:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I'm very much against this.  Why would you tax the makers of the apps that help drive use of your product, rather than the users themselves?  To extend your road use tax analogy, this is like taxing the car companies for their customer's use of the roads.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I offer PinDroid as a free, open source app and have no interest in making money off it, but I also have no interest in losing money on it.  Why not offer api access as a premium account feature (like archiving) for an extra buck instead?</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To be clear, if such a "tax" were to be implemented, I will have to stop developing and supporting PinDroid and take it off the market.</em>
<p>Matt provides some real life feedback, that I can&rsquo;t.  PindDroid is a vital player in the PinBoard ecosystem, that could be hurt by such a tax.  Free and open source code and clients are a vital aspect of any API ecosystem, you definitely want to understand how this layer will be affected by such a tax.
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pindroid"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/pinboard/pindroid.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>Maciej just made this proposal today, so the conversation is fresh.  Head over to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pinboard-dev/PidYOmyBaxI/mLDKIzC6olgJ" target="_parent">Pinboard Google Group</a> to weigh in.  I&rsquo;ll post another story after the conversation dies down, providing more thoughts about API taxes.

<p>In May 2011 I released a book called the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Business-APIs-1-Kin-Lane/dp/1461113881/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304210432&amp;sr=1-5">Business of APIs</a>. The book was intended to be an introductory walkthrough for non-technical people, to the world of APIs. I wanted to educate business, organizational and governmental leaders about the space, and the important role of APIs in having a healthy digital strategy.
<p>Its coming up on two years later, and I'm finally getting around to updating the Business of APIs. After a nice long walk on the strand with <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>, we have the outline for the next version:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>What is an API?</li>
<li>What are APIs used for?</li>
<li>The history of APIs</li>
<li>What goes into an API?</li>
<li>Do you need an API?</li>
<li>How do you get an API??</li>
<li>What are the common building blocks of an API?</li>
<li>What are possible business models for an API?</li>
<li>How do you evangelize and support an API?</li>
<li>Where have some APIs stumbled?</li>
<li>APIs, a new way of doing business</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the Business of APIs is the same. Help anyone, from any company, organization or the government understand what an API is, and why they are important. &nbsp;You don't have to be a developer to put APIs to use, this book is for everyone.
<p>Look for an updated version of the Business of APIs by June. I'll still keep it a simple guide to the space, but provide a whole lot more information that will help you understand the Business of APIs.

Site shutdown: March 31st, 2013".  Just getting that out of the way. While at the site, I ended up at the <a href="http://punchfork.com/goodies/badges">Goodies page</a>, which I think represents a nice set of basic embeddable tools for an API.
<p>First using Punchfork Badges, you can customize a badge, then copy and paste the embed code onto your blog's sidebar, or anywhere else you want it to appear:
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-badges.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>Then you can download a Punchfork logo (ok, its just one, but it gets point across):
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-logos.png" alt="" width="250" />
<p>Last, you can enter your address and request a Punchfork sticker to be sent to you:
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-stickers.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>These are all three, simple examples of a good approach to providing embeddable tools for users.  Badges are pretty straightforward, and it is sensible to provide logos and other images as part of a healthy branding strategy.  But the request for a sticker is something I haven't added to my listing of embeddable building blocks. After thinking about it, stickers are the OG embeddable tool.  Something your users can take offline, and embed anywhere.
<p>At some point I will do a roundup of all the embeddable building blocks, since I've been adding some new ones like sticker request form.

<p>I see a lot of new API platforms emerge, and often times you see them deploying their own solutions to problems that are actively solved by top API platforms, and are already adopted by common mobile and web app users.
<p>The best example of this is with authentication.  Its growing more and more common that you don&rsquo;t build your own login, you use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google or Github oAuth.
<p>It seems to me that when it comes to other common resources, the same could be applied.  So I&rsquo;m exploring what my essential stack of API driven resources might look like:

<p>I could do quite a bit with this assembled as a single backend stack, if it included a regular datastore, key-value store, user management and other essentials for building apps.
<p>It seems to me that new platforms shouldn&rsquo;t always create new silos, but bridge the existing ones that we depend on already.

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/node-js-logo.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/nodejs/node-js-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, the server-side software system designed for writing scalable Internet applications in JavaScript, seems to be getting more attention lately from top API providers because of its event-driven, asynchronous I/O that can minimizeoverhead and maximize scalability.
<p>Last week <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/#readme">Google released an official Node.js client library for accessing Google APIs </a>that supports authorization and authentication using OAuth 2.0.  Then earlier this week, Amazon Web Services announced that <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/03/aws-elastic-beanstalk-for-nodejs.html">AWS Elastic Beanstalk, their PaaS solution now supports Node.js applications</a>.
<p>While Google&rsquo;s deployment is a client, and AWS&rsquo;s is an application platform, they both have the same objective--enabling developers to build highly reliable, scalable, and cost-effective applications using APIs.
<p>Both Google and AWS recognize the potential for selling developers their valuable API driven resources, by providing them with Node.js solutions.  <a href="https://github.com/languages/JavaScript">JavaScript is the number one language on Github</a>, with Node dominating most starred and most forked overall categories, according to Github trends.
<p>I think that AWS and Github both send a good signal to other API owners, that they need to step up the availablity of Node.js resources for their API developer communities.

<p>One of the best aspects of being the API Evangelist, is I get to hang out with smart folks, doing gaming changing things across all business sectors.  Last week I was able to make it to the API Social, an event held in Berkeley by a group of API savvy faculty members.  This is my third one, and the group is up to some very interesting things.
<p>I had a conversation with one UC Berkeley analyst about a problem that isn&rsquo;t just unique to a university, but they are working on an innovative solution for.
<p>The problem:
<blockquote><em>UCB Developers are creating Web Services that provide access to sensitive data (e.g. grades, transcripts, current enrollments) but only trusted applications are typically allowed to access these Web Services to prevent misuse of the sensitive data.   Expanding access to these services, while preserving the confidentiality of the data, could provide student and third party developers with opportunities to create new applications that provide UCB students with enhanced services.</em></blockquote>
<p>The solution:
<blockquote><em>Wrapping untrusted applications in a "Proxied Facade Service" framework that passes anonymous tickets through the &ldquo;untrusted&rdquo; application to underlying services that can independently extract the necessary personal information provides a secure way of allowing an application to retrieve a Web User&rsquo;s Business data (e.g. their current course enrollments) WITHOUT exposing any identifying information about the user to the untrusted application.</em></blockquote>
<p>I find their problem and solution fascinating, I also think it is something that could have huge potential.  When data leaves any school, healthcare provider, financial services or government office, the presence of sensitive data is always a concern.  More data will be leaving these trusted systems, for use in not just apps, but also for analysis and visualizations, and the need to scrub personally identifiable information will only grow.
<p>I&rsquo;m still processing everything the team at UC Berkeley is doing, but want to write about as I&rsquo;m wrapping my head around it.  If you know of any other services out there that do similar things, let me know.  I&rsquo;m curious to hear about other approaches to scrubbing personally identifiable information as it leaves systems via APIs.

<p>It looks like the <a title="HTML5 document embedding platform Crocodoc" href="https://crocodoc.com/">HTML5 document embedding platform Crocodoc</a> is starting to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5358861">plan the next version of their API</a>.  The are being very transparent about the process (which I like), and putting out the word looking for some new team members to help them get the job one.
<p>Over the next couple weeks they want build an API that is simple and easy to use, but also capable of handling tens of millions of document conversations a month.  To help get the job done they are looking for:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Sales Engineers</strong> - Boots on the ground to let them know what people want and to help us engage the developer community</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Engineers </strong>- Help them open source the demos we build and design our client-side libraries</li>
<li><strong>DevOps Engineers </strong>- Help them build the infrastructure we use to convert millions of documents each month</li>
</ul>
<p>I found the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5358861">Crocodoc posting on Hacker News</a>, but I&rsquo;m writing about because I appreciate API owner sending out signals that they are planning the next version of their API.  This type of transparancy is not just important in helping you find talent to make it happen, it sends a signal to the community that you are beginning a planning cycle and can encourage community feedback and involvement. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The Crocodoc API reworking sounds like a pretty innovative project to work on, and the <a title="Crocodoc" href="https://crocodoc.com/about/" target="_blank">Crocodoc team</a> looks like a pretty smart team to get a chance to work with.

<p>Netflix has <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Changes_to_the_Public_API_Program" target="_blank">entered the final stages of shuttering its public API last week</a>.  Its been coming for a while now, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Upcoming_Changes_to_the_Netflix_API_Program" target="_blank">starting in June of 2012</a>, and now is official with the platform no longer accepting new API registrations.
<p>After reading about the changes to the Netflix Public API program on their blog, and hearing much of the news in response, <a href="http://www.rethink-wireless.com/2013/03/11/netflix-public-api-program-retired.htm" target="_blank">everyone seems to file this away, along with the Twitter API</a>--just another API platform screwing over its developers.
<p>As I do, I wanted to take a step back, look at the bigger picture and try understand what happened. &nbsp;On <a href="http://readwrite.com/2008/09/30/netflix_api_launches_tomorrow" target="_blank">October 1st 2008, Netflix launched their public API</a>, and they appear to have done everything right.  They had a blog, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Let_Us_Know_About_your_Libraries" target="_blank">solicited code samples from developers</a>, <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/App_Gallery_Open_for_Developer_Submissions" target="_blank">accepted application submissions</a> and even <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Finding_nice_applications_via_the_Netflix_App_Gallery" target="_blank">showcased the developers apps in the gallery</a>.  Netflix would even help <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Promote_Your_App_to_Netflix_Subscribers" target="_blank">promote your app to Netflix subscribers</a> and <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Untitled_1" target="_blank">threw hackathons</a>.  The Netflix API team worked to <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/API_Performance_Improvements" target="_blank">improve API performance</a>, communicate regularly, but really nothing that amazing happened.
<p>There were applications like <a href="http://instantwatcher.com/" target="_blank">InstaWatcher</a> and <a href="http://www.whichflicks.com/" target="_blank">WhichFlicks</a>&nbsp;(among others)&nbsp;developed on the API, but as Daniel Jacobson puts it, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/michaelhart2/api-strategy-evolution-at-netflix" target="_blank">a thousand flowers didn&rsquo;t bloom</a>.  In these situations its easy to blame the API provider, but developers didn&rsquo;t really step up and build anything that innovative and cool. So is this a failure of Netflix?  A failure of developers to innovate?  Or could it possibly be a third: failure of the API vision?
<p>I would say the demise of the Netflix public API is equal part Netflix and the developer, and just the nature of the industry it exists in.  It didn&rsquo;t take me long to look through the Netflix API blog, so I can tell they didn&rsquo;t put alot into evangelizing the API.   But I really can&rsquo;t find any innovation that occurred by developers as part of it, so I think us devs have to share some of the responsibility as well.
<p>Several of the blog posts covering the news last week, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013/03/08/netflix-changes-its-current-api-program-by-ending-it-will-no/" target="_blank">compared this to Twitter</a> which I think for the untrained eye of the mainstream tech blogosphere, this is easy to do.  But Twitter is user generated content, via one of the newest types of content platforms, and Netflix is heavily licensed and policed content from one of the oldest content platforms.  I think expecting public API success from Netflix and / or developers was a lot to ask.
<p>I love and believe in APIs, but I&rsquo;m not delusional enough to think they will work magically everywhere they are applied. However, even with the closing of the public Netflix API, I consider Netflix is an API success story.  Look what they&rsquo;ve done with their internal and partner APIs. They&rsquo;ve managed to scale not just from the data center to the cloud, but globally and across 800+ devices--while also <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/">sharing this knowledge and wisdom with the public</a>&nbsp;via their blog:

<p>When measuring the success or failures of API initatives, we can't use the same yardstick in all scenarios. When you look at the knowledge, wisdom and code that has come out of Netflix, there is no way you can say their API initiative is anything but a success. I don&rsquo;t see see Netflix as a case study in how to stream movies over the web via public APIs, but a deeply important experiment in how to deliver licensed content to over 800 devices, via the next generation of APIs. &nbsp;Something that probably isn't an edge case, it actually represents where we all might be headed in the near future.
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get caught up in the recent deprecation of the Netflix public API. &nbsp;There is so much going on! &nbsp;Let's get studying some of the knowledge and technology coming out of Netflix. I know its my motivation for writing this post, and doing this research.

<p>When it came to API focused events, the only conference there was to attend was the <a title="Business of APIs Conference" href="http://apiconference.com/">Business of APIs Conference</a>, from <a title="Mashery" href="http://mashery.com">Mashery</a>.  They have been putting on the conference(correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong) since 2007.  There wasn&rsquo;t much of an "API Industry" back then, and Mashery was definitely the pioneer in the space, getting the word out and along with <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, has done a lot to define the API space.
<p>Fast forward five years, and after the successful <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> in February (originally scheduled for November), there are now five API event series going on:

</table>
<p>It is exciting to see the explosion of events, and I&rsquo;m hopeful regarding how much progress will occur in 2013 with this many conversations going on.  It is also promising to see the international growth, with Nordic APIs happening in Scandinavia, API Days coming from France, Business of APIs in London and API Summit spreading the conversation from United States and Australia.
<p>With this amount of buzz, APIs will definitely continue its spread to the mainstream.  My only hope is that all the events make sure and represent the space well by being interoperable and sharing content, speakers and ideas openly so that the entire industry benefits.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/human-cutout.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>As the API movement marches forward, it continues to grind against the enterprise and its legacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</a>, which increases the frequency at which people ask me, <em>What is the difference between API and SOA?</em> This is not a technical explanation of the differences, but a philosophical one that many will argue does not apply, but in my opinion is the dark matter around the technological and business approach of SOA,  that makes API work.
<p>Many say that a web API is just one component in an SOA toolbox.  This is true.  Using HTTP for an API is not that novel in itself.  That is until it jumped out of the enterprise petri dish, got a little oxygen to grow, allowing the introduction of some new aspects that the industry and technology overlords of SOA would never have introduced on their own.
<p>While reading the <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/blogs/index.php/nation-building-in-the-age-of-apis/">Nation Building in the Age of APIs</a>, by Matt McLarty (<a href="https://twitter.com/MattMcLartyBC">@MattMcLartyBC</a>) of <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a> today, he reminded me that:
<blockquote><em>"Every paradigm shift in technology has been driven by both innovation&mdash;the new technology itself&mdash;and application&mdash;how that technology can be used.  In other words, there is a machine side and a people side to every technology change.  The technologists responsible for implementing these changes often bias towards their comfort zone&mdash;the machine side&mdash;and overlook the people side."</em></blockquote>
<p>He is right. &nbsp;APIs moves us closer to the people side of the equation, outside the technologists comfort zone, but I would also add that it moves it outside the business and industry leaderships comfort zone, introducing more balance that has the potential to make online communities, platforms and ecosystem thrive. Matt continues to say:
<blockquote><em>"Ultimately, the success of a company&rsquo;s API will depend on the creation of a diverse community for that API&mdash;end users, partners, developers, and more&mdash;as well as the adoption of a business model that allows the API to contribute to the company&rsquo;s bottom line."</em></blockquote>
<p>SOA does a damn fine job of looking after the platforms (business), the developers (technology), but doesn't always provide for the best interest of the user--aka human side of the equation.  APIs have allowed for valuable resources to flow around traditional IT bottlenecks, outside the firewall and be put to use by those who are potentially closer to the human problem that is being solved.
<p>API introduces newer pieces of the SOA puzzle, found within the OAuth security relationship, terms of use and privacy policies, self-service access, transparency, while also providing monetization strategies that encourage partner and developer innovation.
<p>At first glance, it is easy to mistake API as just part of the SOA toolbox, but there are other nuances that bring SOA closer to the users, and solving the real problems they face, by developers who understand.  In the end I don't really think it matters whether you call it SOA or API, just make sure you include the essential ingredients that have worked with "open" APIs, whether your API is public, private or evolving your partner relationships.

<p>As the API Evangelist, I&rsquo;ve made it my mission to go outside of the Silicon Valley bubble and educate the &ldquo;normals&rdquo; about the potential of APIs.  In doing this I have conversations with a wide range of folks from new startups, to the GSA in Washington DC.  One growing trend I&rsquo;m seeing is the number of VC and angel investors reaching out, to have me help them understand the API space and how it applies to their investments.
<p>I have a couple VC&rsquo;s I talk to on a regular basis, but I have a growing number of new ones who are investing more and more in technology companies and need to get a grip on this API world.  As a Terry Kearns from Oxford Strategic Advisors, LLC,&nbsp;put it yesterday:
<blockquote><em>"I wanna let you know I appreciate all the work you've done here. For a guy who is not a tech guy. You really help me out with a lot, your articles and information help me get my arms around this whole API world"</em></blockquote>
<p>That is my mission.  This is what I do.  Nobody pays me to educate people like this about the APIs space, but it is so critical that the folks who are investing in the next generation of healthcare, education, manufacturing and other business sectors, understand APIs, at least at a basic level.
<p>APIs are part of fundamental change in how we conduct business, not just in technology sector, but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVERY</span></strong> aspect of our government, business and even our personal lives.  Let me know how I can answer questions about your existing investment portfolio or regarding business sectors you are looking to invest in.
<p>Make sure your companies truly understand APIs, and you are making educated investments.

<p>Are you ready for more discussions about APIs?  I know I am. :) This time its from our Scandinavian friends, with four events in 2013.  <a title="Nordic APIs" href="http://nordicapis.com/" target="_blank">Nordic APIs</a> is a series of conferences and events held across Scandinavia which provides knowledge and information about APIs.
<p>API Evangelist is a supporter of Nordic APIs, and you will find me speaking at the 2 day event in Stockholm in September.  I will be speaking with Adam DuVander(<a href="https://twitter.com/@adamd">@adamd</a>) and John Musser(<a href="https://twitter.com/@johnusser">@johnusser</a>) of <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, Jacob Ideskog (<a href="https://twitter.com/@jacobideskog">@jacobideskog</a>) and Travis Spencer (<a href="https://twitter.com/@travisspencer">@travisspencer</a>) of <a href="http://www.twobotechnologies.com/">Twobo Technologies</a>, as well as the notorious Andreas Krohn (<a href="https://twitter.com/@andreaskrohn">@andreaskrohn</a>).
<p>I feel an awakening happening around APIs, and its not just a Silicon Valley thing.  People around the globe are becoming more aware of the potential of APIs.  I'm getting more and more requests from Europe and South America for API education, resources and tools.
<p>We need to support as many of these open, vendor neutral conversations about APIs as we can.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Nordic APIs series is looking for sponsors and support</span>.  If your company is looking to break into Scandinavia, you should be supporting Nordic APIs, because its guaraneed to be a couple hundred of the smartest folks across the Scandanavian API space assembled in one building.
<p>Head over to <a title="Nordic APIs" href="http://nordicapis.com/" target="_blank">Nordic APIs site</a> and contact them directly to see how you can support the conversations that will be occurring across Scandavia, and I look forward to seeing you there.

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.zypr.net/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/zypr/zypr-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m working through lists of APIs and API service providers who I&rsquo;ve rated pretty highly because of their work in the past, but red flags have gone up because I&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t seen a blog post, tweet or commit from them lately.  One of the service providers I&rsquo;m reviewing is <a title="Zypr" href="https://www.zypr.net/">Zypr</a>, which providers voice enabled architecture built on popular APIs.
<p>Zypr fits in with my vision of where APIs are going, because Zypr is doing the same thing as aggregation, automation and other trending service providers, but the end goal is this use case is voice.  In Zyprs own words:
<blockquote><em>Zypr aggregates proprietary 3rd party APIs, categorizes their functions, and then presents those functions through a single, normalized API. By aggregating and normalizing 3rd party APIs, Zypr creates a stable access point for devices and apps to access those services without concern for service and API changes.</em></blockquote>
<p>That sounds exactly like what <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> is doing, but with voice as the vehicle for making valuable API resources avilable on apps running via mobile phones, tablets and in our cars and homes.  I really like the Zypr graphic.  I will have to create a similar version to articulate some the API trends I&rsquo;m seeing.
<p><a href="https://www.zypr.net/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/zypr/zypr-voice-enabled.jpg" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>I hope Zypr is just heads down, working hard on their platform.  According to my API stack rank, there aren&rsquo;t very many positive signals coming out of the platform:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Last Blog Post - 09/28/2012</li>
<li>Last Tweet - 01/30/2013</li>
<li>Last Commit - 10 months ago</li>
</ul>
<p>What Zypr is doing is important--I hope they have enough runway to make happen. &nbsp;If they need to cut corners, they shouldn't replicate the service or client adapter portion of their platform, they could just partner with an existing <a title="API aggregator" href="/trends/aggregation.php">API aggregators</a>&nbsp;like Singly for these layers, as well as <a title="API reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity providers</a> like Elastic.io or Foxweave to migrate and tranform data. &nbsp;In my opinion Zypr should focus on how their engine works, and partner and generate open source to build the rest.
<p>Personally, I would like to see more competition in the space of API driven voice enabled architecture.  So far I haven&rsquo;t found any other players doing it at the same level as Zypr.  Let me know if you know of something. Siri is going to need some healthy competition.

<p>It was interesting to see Amazon step up in the advertising game with the beta release of the <a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank">Amazon Mobile Ads API</a> this week.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want Amazon getting into my space, when it comes to any API resource, especially advertising.  On the other hand, one can say that the space needs disruption with the dominance of Google with their multiple offerings:
<p><a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/amazon/amazon-mobile-app-distribution-dollar-sign-cloud.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a>

<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/creating_monetizable_applications" target="_blank">Youtube</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think we can expect some intense competition when it comes to advertising and specifically around mobile advertising APIs--battling for your eyeballs on smart phones and tablets in 2013.
<p>Another layer that will add to the competititiveness with advertising APIs is the fact that all three social media and networking giants have their own advertising APIs now as well:
<p><a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/amazon/amazon-mobile-app-distribution-people-devices.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/ads-api/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/programs/ads-api" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/blog/linkedin-ads-unveils-new-api-program" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With Google and Amazon both having devices in the game (Android and Kindle), it will be interesting how they partner with Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin for the social layer, and where all of this leaves Apple.
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget about the  me too category with <a href="https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/search-advertising/bingads-api" target="_blank">Bing Advertising APIs</a> and <a href="http://advertisingcentral.yahoo.com/api/overview" target="_blank">Yahoo Advertising Central</a>, or the potentially over <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/21/112-advertising-apis-google-adsense-google-adwords-and-feedburner/" target="_blank">100 other advertising APIs available via ProgrammableWeb</a>.
<p>Any way you look at it, 2013 will prove to be a very competitive landscape when it comes to web and mobile advertising, with so many heavyweight contenders with their own devices and API driven advertising platforms.  I think an advertising API roundup is in order, in the near future.
<p>I just hope that we start thinking beyond advertising when it comes to APIs and the monetization of web and mobile apps in 2013.

<p>I&rsquo;m a little behind in working through my list of new APIs to review.  So I&rsquo;m spending about 3 hours each day going through my list of new APIs accumulated from <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, Tweets, Bookmarks, Google Alerts and other ways I have for discovering new APIs.
<p>After looking&nbsp;through a couple hundred APIs, I&nbsp;wanted to share some things that stand out, and make me feel someone really doesn't give a shit when they hit publish on their API:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Your entire developer area is a PDF</li>
<li>Really long, incoherent URL for dev area</li>
<li>Dev area is just a page in your help directory</li>
<li>You put google ads on every page of your API documentation</li>
<li>No communication, support or contact information at all</li>
<li>Sign up form that pops up in my face as soon as page loads</li>
<li>Require an NDA before I register</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of things that make me give an API a C or D grade, which means you probably aren&rsquo;t on my radar. &nbsp;But then again if you don't have active blog or twitter or developers aren't talking about you, your API won't register on the radar even with a B grade.
<p>With tools like <a title="3Scale" href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a title="APIhub" href="http://apihub.com">APIHub</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> out there, it isn&rsquo;t hard to hang your API in a professional way, with minimal amount of effort and resources.
<p>After looking through hundreds of APIs I leave with the same feeling:  that there tons of good ideas out there, but 80% of them are just executed very poorly.

<p>ImpactStory simply has a &ldquo;<em>BETA - Send us Your Feedback</em>&rdquo; image in the top right corner of their site.  When you click on the logo, you are presented with a simple UserVoice form for submitting your ideas of where you think ImpactStory should take their platform.
<p><a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/analytics/impactstory/impactstory-beta-feedback-form.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>I think this is a pretty dead simple way of soliciting feedback from your community. Involving your users in your roadmap planning can go a long way in building goodwill with them, and encouraging participation and innovation in other ways.
<p>After I spend more time playing with <a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank">ImpactStory</a>, I&rsquo;ll do another post on what else they are up to, but at first glance its a pretty interesting approach to developing tracking analytics, visualization and other embeddable goodness using APIs.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/data-marketplaces/data-market-visualization.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the great coverage by Paul MIller over at Cloud Ave about whether <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/26791/is-infochimps-running-from-the-data-market-business/">Infochimps running from the Data Market business</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/25863/discussing-data-markets-in-new-york-city/">Discussing Data Markets in New York City</a>.  He&rsquo;s touched on any interesting topic around the viability of data markets as a business, and the fate of several of the most high profile players in the space.
<p>In 2011, when it comes to data API marketplaces and providers I tended to showcase players like <a href="http://factual.com">Factual</a>, <a href="http://kasabi.com">Kasabi</a>, <a href="http://datamarket.com/">DataMarket</a> and <a href="http://www.infochimps.com/">InfoChimps</a>.  In 2013, we&rsquo;ve watched Kasabi disappear, and the migration of InfoChimps from an open data market, to a enterprise data platform.  While Factual and Datamarket appear to be going strong.
<p>I think this reflects a common, lack of imagination by Silicon Valley because they are so focused on making money, they miss the need to support critical aspects of industries, that are required to allow for the growth they want to see.
<p>While I feel there is money to be made off data marketplaces, however right now I think it is critical that we invest in people standing up and exposing data, not just focusing on making money off this process at levels that VC&rsquo;s deem adequate.
<p>I make the same argument with API providers, its not that there isn&rsquo;t money in standing up APIs, but we need to heavily invest in the education of potential API owners and the healthy standing up of APIs. &nbsp;
<p>There will be plenty of money down the road from APIs and data marketplaces, but by always looking at it through a Silicon Valley perspective, we are going to stifle the oxygen necessary for a truly healthy, vibrant space.
<p>I&rsquo;m spending time looking through the API service provider space, and <a href="/2013/03/01/api-deployment-as-a-service/">last week I noticed the big gap in there being API deployment services vs. API management services</a>.  This imbalance is due to a gold rush by heavily VC funded API service providers looking to capitalize on the enterprise looking to proxy their existing infrastructure with a new breed of API services.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/data-marketplaces/data-markets.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;ve argueed this with execs at <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unamed&nbsp;API service provider companies</span></em>, on whether the next growth in APIs will be from new, API providers or from the enterprise.   I was told I&rsquo;m naive and it shows my inexperience that I think it will come from outside the enterprise.  While there will be money to be made off the enterprise evolving their existing infrastructure in this new way, in reality this is just a small evolution in business not anywhere near a revolution.  Where big change in business sectors and economies will occur is when companies, organizations and government who didn&rsquo;t jump on SOA bandwagon understand the value of opening up data, and making available via APIs in this new way.
<p>To get here we have a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LOT</span></strong> of work to do.  We need education, tools and services available to get these companies, organizations and government up to speed, publishing data and standing up APIs.  Once this occurs, there will be plenty of money to be made in mobile, tablet, devices, analysis, visualations, curation, syndication and other areas you hear Silicon Valley tooting about.  But VC&rsquo;s are focused on the end goal, not necessarily how we get there.
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to work making sure there are open source tools and content to help any company, organization or government group &nbsp;get their data marketplaces up and running.  Let&rsquo;s not focus on making a fortune from it now, let&rsquo;s just make sure it happens.  It&rsquo;s far to important to suffocate with short term visions of making profit.

<p>API driven analytics and visualizations is one of the new areas&nbsp;of API usage I'm tracking on.   There are many &ldquo;big data&rdquo; platforms emerging these days, but I&rsquo;m looking for dead simple tools and services anyone can use to generate analytics and visualizations via APIs.
<p>Think of <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity providers like IFTT, Zapier and Elastic.io</a>.  These new API driven service providers, make it easy to migrate data between cloud services, using a simple set of source API, triggers, actions and target APIs--with a dead simple icon and wizard based UI, allowing any user to put the platform to work.
<p><a title="Ducksboard" href="http://ducksboard.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-analytics/ducksboard-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I want this approach for embeddable analytics, visualizations and other widgets that are easily generated via APIs. Last week I came across a new platform called <a href="http://ducksboard.com/">Ducksboard</a>, which allows you to easily generate some pretty sophisticated analytical widgets from common API sources.  The platform even comes with a marketplace where you can find other widgets.  The only problem is that Duckboards is meant to generate dashboards, and not really open and portable widgets. &nbsp;We'll keep an eye on this platform, see where it goes.
<p><a title="Keen IO" href="https://keen.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-analytics/keen-io-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p><a title="Ducksboard" href="http://ducksboard.com/" target="_blank">Then last night I came across </a><a title="Keen IO" href="https://keen.io/" target="_blank">Keen IO</a>, an analytics Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform that lets developers build analytics features directly into their apps, from common API services.  Keen IO provides a pretty sophisticated workbench for building embeddable charts, metrics and other analytics or visualizations that you can render anywhere, using  iOS, Android, JavaScript, Ruby, Python and Java libraries they provide.
<p>At first glance, this space can feel just like earlier waves of widget building platforms of the Web 1.0 &amp; 2.0 worlds.  But I think we hadn&rsquo;t reached critical mass, in the number of available API resources, as well as an awareness of APIs in general, in order to realize the true potential of widgets. I think we are getting closer in 2013.
<p>I&rsquo;m optistic that a new breed of API driven analytics and visualization tools will emerge making dead simple, icon based interfaces that allow anyone to generate useful widgets from valuable API resources and embed them anywhere on the open web or in private portals.
<p>Are there any other similar platforms that I'm missing?

<p>Hands on, interactive tools are proving to be the most useful way to learn about an API--empowering users to see it in action, and witness the value it delivers.  Many companies are doing this by providing API explorers, consoles, interactive documentation and other hands-on tools that allow you to see how any API actually functions and learn about the API in realtime.
<p>One of the latest companies to do this is <a title="MMS API Provider" href="http://www.mogreet.com/">MMS API provider Mogreet</a>, which has stepped into the API explorer game with their own API tester allowing anyone to visually build an API call that sends multimedia messages, as well as take advantage of the 25 other methods available via the API platform.
<p><a href="http://www.mogreet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/mogreet/mogreet-api-tester.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>The API tester is available for all users via the developer dashboard, providing a hands on way to learn about the Mogreet API, all available endpoints, understand which parameters are required or optional, experiment with alternatives and quickly make the calls and see the result, understanding the value and operations before you get to work coding around the API.
<p>While I think using an <a href="https://apigee.com/docs/consoletogo/">API explorer like Apigee&rsquo;s</a> can provide value, but I also recommend rolling your own toolkits that might speak specifically to your target audience.  I think a standard API console or explorer can help developers understand the operations of an API, but I think the right GUI tool can help any user understand the potential your API offers.  Which might make the difference between an integration project getting funded or not, with decision makers properly understanding how your API can be put to use.
<p>Nice work Mogreet team!

<p>title: ‘API Pricing On Complexity, Speed and Support At Apicultur’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apicultur-logo.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apicultur/apicultur-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>How to structure pricing for an API is one of the top 5 questions I get from people who are currently planning their API strategy.  In my opinion, there is, and never will be a one size fits all API pricing strategy.  What you charge for your API resources should reflect their value and how they are accessed and used by your target consumers.
<p>The Backend as a Service (BaaS) space is working hard to differentiate themselves in 2013 with <a title="baas pricing" href="/2013/02/07/which-baas-pricing-model-is-better/">different approaches to pricing of mobile backend resources</a>.  Amazon is still shaking up the API space with new services, pricing models and the price reduction of API resources at a dizzying pace.
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting the <a title="apicultur" href="https://store.apicultur.com/">Apicultur</a> team while in Paris for <a href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a>&nbsp;last October.  Apicultur is a linguistics API platform, that is pushing the boundaries of what is an API platform as well as how you price language API resources.
<p>Apicultur recently shared some of the thinking behind the <a href="https://store.apicultur.com/site/pages/prices.jag" target="_blank">current version of their platform pricing</a>&nbsp;where they&nbsp;structure the price depending on three factors:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Complexity of the API</strong> - Some APIs perform a very simple task (like removing commas from a text) while others deal with more complex task (like extracting if the opinion expressed in a particular text is positive or negative)--the "bigger" the API, the pricier it gets</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> - The max speed by default is one call per second. In order to get more calls per second, Apicultur ask for a prepayment that is discounted from the final price at the end of the month (i.e., is not an extra price, is just a prepayment as a commitment). In addition, there's a discount at the end of the month for users for those who get a speed  limit feature</li>
<li><strong>Support -&nbsp;</strong>The basic support offered is the community support. For more support, special fees are offered</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apicultur/apicultur-pricing.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>Apicultur feels that by keeping the everything priced at 10,000 API calls, keeps things easy to understand as well as being fair for small and large projects. &nbsp;Leaving the costs spread between the varying value of individual API endpoints, the speed at which you need API calls and for overall support.
<p>Small projects can register for the free account, which gives you up 20&euro; a month in calls without requiring a credit card, allowing developers to try an API before giving personal information and committing. I find it very interesting they call it a free account, while still applying a price to the value users are getting.
<p>Apicultur has put a lot of thought into how they structure their API pricing.  I think their approach can help other API providers think about the value each of their endpoints offer, as well as other areas you can monetize, delivering more of what your API consumers need, while also bringing in revenue to make sure your API initiative is successful.

<p><a title="Twitter Counter API" href="https://twittercounter.com/pages/api"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/twitter-counter-api-2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I stumbled across the <a title="Twitter Counter API" href="https://twittercounter.com/pages/api">Twitter Counter API</a> in my monitoring for the <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> this morning.  The Twitter Counter API allows you to retrieve key metrics on any Twitter account like username, url and avatar. &nbsp;All data you can get via the Twitter API, but with Twitter Counter API you get additional information like account growth statistics and ranking, that Twitter doesn't provide at all.
<p>I find it fascinating that someone can build an API to augment an existing API, which is why I keep talking about it, I guess :) We are seeing a more standardized version of this with API aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a href="http://adigami.com">Adigami</a>, where they not only aggregate APIs from a variety of sources, they also build entirely new APIs based the added value that is created after they are brought together.
<p>Thinking about if further, it would be cool if you could submit your API to be listed in your parent API providers API area.   Think of <a title="APIHub" href="http://apihub.com">APIhub</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a>, but every API area would have its own 3rd API marketplace.  API providers often allow 3rd party developers to submit code libraries and samples to be listed as resources, as well as applications for listing in an application showcase. So it makes sense to potetially allow for your developers to submit APIs for validation and publishing into a designated area.
<p>It seems to me that we shouldn&rsquo;t exist as islands, we should be able to invite in other API resources built on top of our APIs, or that compliment our APIs.  We should also have terms of use and pricing models that invite others to take our API resources and deploy in other ecosystem, building the next wave of <a title="BaaS Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/baas.php">BaaS providers</a> that will be delivering specialized stacks of resources for developers to efficiently build mobile and web apps.

<p>title: ‘I Want An API’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tag-cloud-i-want-api.png</p>

<p><a title="I Want An API" href="http://iwantanapi.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-i-want-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I feel we have done a good job explaining what is an API, why people need APIs, and providing services to manage APIs, but we are falling short on delivering information, tools and services for deploying APIs.
<p>First I want to acknowledge that many companies have established IT resources, in the form of technology talent, and internal systems they can put to use when deploying APIs.  This post isn&rsquo;t for you.  This is about individual problem owners looking to deploy APIs, who most likely have little or no access to traditional IT resources for a variety of reasons.
<p>You want to deploy an API, because you havplease some data, content or other resources you need to make accessible to partners or the public, allowing for integration into other systems or be used in the development of web or mobile applications or possibly even data analysis and visualizations.
<h2>Machine Readable</h2>
<p>As much as I love APIs, I suggest everyone consider your overall objective behind launching an API.  You may not need an API, you may just need to make your information machine readable and available on the open Internet.  Technically, this isn&rsquo;t an API, but publishing your data or content in a machine readable format like XML or JSON can accomplish many of the same goals of an API, without the overhead of an API.
<p>Many tools you use every day like Microsoft Office, Google Apps, Salesforce provide tools for publishing data and content in machine readable formats like CSV, XML or JSON, much like publishing or printing as a PDF.  Not everyone needs an API, but everyone needs to understand the how-to, and the benefits of making machine readable a default in all business, organization, government and even individual processes.
<p>PDF made data and content portable, for humans. But a PDF does very little good for other machines, websites and mobile apps.  CSV, XML and JSON make data and content portable, while also making them machine readable.  Please consider this simple evolution, while planning your API.
<p>Machine readable will go far to increase efficiencies, interoperability, transparency and innovation within many existing government, organizational and business operations.  By providing data, content and other resources in CSV, XML and JSON they can be easily used across mobile, web and data implementations.  However in other situations there will be a higher need for more advanced interaction with data and content in the form of querying, filtering, transformations as well as the need to secure resources, limiting who has access and to what scale.  This is where we start moving beyond just machine readable, and into a truly needing an API.
<p>When it comes to API deployment I would put users into two distinct groups:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Technical</strong> - You have skills and resources to architect, design, develop and deploy infrastructure, code to meet your API needs</li>
<li><strong>Non-Technical</strong> - You do not have the resources to assemble and execute an API strategy, making a cloud service an optimal route</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are about making critical assets and resources available to technical and non-technical groups. &nbsp;APIs are often about circumventing some of the ways technology bottlenecks can slow us down. &nbsp;It is important that there are not just a wealth of cloud services for non-technical folks to deploy APIs, but also a buffet of openly licensed, downloadable tools that anyone can put to use when deploying an API.
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>You have some technical resources and the know how (or willingness to learn), and you want an API.  Ideally there would be open source tools available for you to download and implement:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>CSV to API&nbsp;</li>
<li>Database to API</li>
<li>Developer Portal&nbsp;       
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Docs&nbsp;</li>
<li>Code&nbsp;</li>
<li>Support&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Registration</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Key Management&nbsp;</li>
<li>App Management</li>
<li>Billing</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools would allow you to assemble your own API strategy in the language and platform of your choice.  There should be educational materials helping you understand how to implement individually or collectively as a single platform.
<h2>Non-Technical</h2>
<p>You do not have the technical resources or time to implement your own API Strategy.  You need a dead simple, software as a service implementation.  You can see examples of this with the latest breed of API service providers, <a href="http://emergentone.com">Emergent One</a>, <a title="API Spark" href="http://apispark.com/">API Spark</a>, and <a href="https://apiengine.io/">API Engine</a>.
<p>We are just seeing this new breed of API service providers rise to meet the demand of not just API management, but now also API deployment.  Making API deployment accessible to anyone, not just developers or companies with necessary resources.  This will make the benefits of APIs accessible to the everyday problem owners, who often are restricted by IT bottlenecks or entire lack of IT resources.
<p>Making data and content from a spreadsheet or existing database, machine readable by default or deployed as an API, allowing for more sophisticated interactions, should be as easy as deploying Wordpress for your blog.  You should be able to go to a service provider and get exactly the hosting, deployment and management options you desire, or you should be able to download and install on your own infrastructure, giving you the control you desire over storage, hosting and access.
<p>I&rsquo;m adding a new project area to API Evangelist called&nbsp;<a title="I Want An API" href="http://iwantanapi.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">I Want An API</a>, where I&rsquo;ll be working to help define this space, and bring together other people to assist in developing the resources and tools we will all need to easily launch an API.

<p>There are numerous companies, with existing IT infrastructure, who are looking to deploy APIs in 2013. These companies will be deploying APIs using their existing technology teams, or depending on one of the <a href="/serviceproviders/">17 API management service providers</a> available.
<p>This market is ripe for the <a title="3Scale" href="https://3scale.net">3Scale's</a> of the world to provide valuable services to, but for many companies, organizations and government agencies who need to deploy APIs this year, API deployment will be about taking an existing database or multiple databases, and open them up to the public, partners, 3rd party developers or possibly just provide access to a remote department or branch of their company in the easiest way possible.
<p>Not all companies will have the resources, or the need to deploy full blown API programs. &nbsp;They just need a dead simple database to API solution that will quickly expose their data over the web in a secure way.  Until recently this solution wasn&rsquo;t available in the cloud, but a new API service provider called <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a> has stepped up to fill in the gap.
<p>Emergent One is a cloud service that allows you to connect to your company's MySQL, PostgreSQL or Amazon RDS databases, then generate a REST API from your existing data stores.
<p>Using Emergent One you can define a new API, connect to your database using an agent or direct connection, then define your API resources complete with meta data, sub-resources, in-line resources, fields and computed fields.  Pretty much all you will need to make a clean web API from a database.
<p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/emergent-one/emergent-one-api-resources-from-database.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>Once you have your API resources defined, Emergent One provides you with a developer portal around these APIs, and the ability to provide developer registration, then issue keys they can use to access your data--providing the openness you desire, while keeping things secure and within your control.
<p>The developer portal is complete with documentation, explorer console and code libraries for iOS, Android and in Ruby.  Emergent One allows you to bind your own DNS to your endpoints, and also provide paid plans, complete with billing management.
<p>Emergent One is a perfect service for any company looking to develop and manage APIs from your local databases.   The only thing I would say is missing is support tools, to help you interact with your developers after you launch your API. &nbsp;But I'm sure its coming.
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/17/api-management-platform-emergent-one-launches-free-tier/">happy to see the Emergent One platform has a freemium tier</a> giving you up to 5,000 API requests a month, a business tier for up to 2.5M requests a month, as well as an enterprise tier with sales support for all levels of needs. &nbsp;The freemium tier will be critical for businesses to play with, and get to know better.
<p>The Emergent One admin needs a little polishing, it could use a more dashboard like feel for the home page, but overall the Emergent One team nails it!  Providing dead simple, yet robust API deployment from your MySQL, PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS databases, in a way that anyone can put to use.
<p>If your company is looking to deploy and API using a database, and don&rsquo;t have the resources internally to make it happen, I definitely recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a>.

<p>I try to keep <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> a place where API newbies and API experts can both find what they are looking for.  To meet this demand I&rsquo;m constantly moving the site around, trying to uncover more information, in a logical way that speaks to everyone.
<p>To change things up a little I moved a couple of the most important trends in APIs out of the <a title="trends" href="/trends/">trends section</a>, and put them on the right hand menu, making them accessible from any page.  There are four trends I think are important to how APIs are being used right now:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Aggregation</strong> - Merging various APIs together into not just meaningful new stacks of resources, but entirely new resources, as a result of merging</li>
<li><strong>BaaS</strong> - The promise of Backend as a Service is to bundle together resources developers need to build mobile apps more efficiently. &nbsp;Some providers are rolling their own stacks, while others are using a hybrid approach with wise use of 3rd party API resources</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocity</strong> - The integration, interoperability, automation and transformation of data between cloud services, in a way that respects the relationshiop between user and platform, that uses APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Realtime</strong> - A realtime flow of data and resources using APIs and web technologies, meeting the demand of the API economy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-api-trends.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" />
<p>I feel these areas will represent a shift in how APIs are deployed and consumed to meet the growing demand for the data and resources driving web and mobile applications.  While the API should exist on its own, these areas represent an evolution in how APIs are bundled together into more meaningful stacks, new mashups of resources and providing the integration, interoperability, automation and real-time needs of  businesses in the API economy.
<p>In addition to these four trends, I&rsquo;m looking at several other ways APIs are being used in new and potentially powerful ways:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Voice</strong> - With the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, voice is the next generation of discovering and interacting with valuable API resources</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis</strong> - The era of "big data" is upon us, like it or not. &nbsp;APIs will provide the fuel for the analysis that occurs around the insane amounts of data coming online, but also being generated by new applications and devices</li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization</strong> - One fundamental aspect of the "big data" evolution is being able to visualize and communicate meaning derived from data, and keeping visualizations transparent and interactive using APIs is essential</li>
<li><strong>Syndication</strong> - We saw the power of skyndicattion using APIs with the Facebook Like and the Tweet button. &nbsp;APIs will continue to drive syndication and encourage collaboration on the open Internet in new ways</li>
</ul>
<p>These all represent some very important ways in which APIs are being applied across all business sectors.  All these trending areas are using APIs to deliver value to government, businesses and individuals, and if we are not careful we can focus only on the end value and forget about some of the important benefits of keeping open, accessible APIs that deliver the valuable resources needed. &nbsp;The open pipes will prove to be just as important as the end value in my opinion.
<p>We will need to make sure the backends to the mobile phones and tablets our families are using stay open and transparent, delivering the value while respecting our privacy and security.  There needs to be transparency and open access around all analysis and visualizations used in &ldquo;big data&rdquo; decisions in the coming years.  Infographics and industry reports without open and transparent APIs behind them offer little value in the API economy.
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing which of these trends continue to grow in 2013, and which ones go away, or even morph into entirely new trends.  This is what I love about the API space, the unlimited opportunity for change and evolution.  Which is why I keep the conversation going.

<p>APIs are all the rage, anyone should be able launch an API from CSV, Microsoft Excel, Google Spreadsheet or the common databases such as MySQL, PostGres, Amazon RDS, Microsoft SQL Server.  Right?
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching <a href="/serviceproviders/">API service providers</a> evolve for the last three years, helping companies be successful in managing their APIs.  But when you actually going through the list of service providers, looking for someone to help you deploy an API, there are very few options out of the box.
<p>The list of API Players coming from the enterprise:

<p>These enterprise players assume you will have existing infrastructure to publish web services, files and other message systems that they can connect with,  to deploy your new APIs that you will manage.
<p>The most recent generation of API service providers:

<p>Are pretty much the same.  While they may provide how to <a href="/2013/02/03/deploy-and-manage-api-on-amazon-web-services-aws/">guides for deploying APIs on AWS</a>, like 3Scale, the deployment of API endpoint is still your responsiblity.  You need to have existing infrastructure that will do it, or find the REST framework of your choice--both requiring you have the appropriate talent and resources.
<p>Next up you can, deploy one of the open source API solutions, to proxy and manage your APIs:

<p>But again, you need the resources and know how to implement, and they are generally management tools, so you still need to &ldquo;launch&rdquo; your own API endpoint.
<p>When you start looking at the next generation of API service providers like <a href="https://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a>, you can really maximize the design, planning, documentation and deployment cycle, but you still need to code up your actual API.
<p>After Apiary.io we start to get to the service providers who can deliver on my vision of APIs for the masses:

<p>It seems like we are getting closer, albeit its not as easy as I think it should be. We need a variety of service providers and open source solutions in this space, so there are numerous, dead simple cloud options for API deployment.
<p>Emergent One definitely was a pleasant surprise in my quest.  Their tool needs a little polish, but for deploying an API from a database like MySQL, Postgres or Amazon RDS, those guys nailed it.  It is the tool that I will be recommending when people ask me how to launch an API from their database. (story to come)
<p>I'd like to see the Emergent One approach to a dead simple cloud service for going from Microsoft Excel, CSV and Google Spreadsheet.  Maybe there is, and I&rsquo;m missing it.  Something like CKAN as a Service.  I think there is some more research to be done on this.  Of the 3 data API providers I used to showcase:

<p>Only <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> is still deliving in this space, bringing open data to municipal, state, and federal government.  Kasabi closed down and InfoChimps is focusing on the enterprise big data.   I don&rsquo;t think there is big VC money in the data API space, but it seems like there is still opportunity.
<p>It seems backwards to me, but it seems from 2005-2010 we needed to define and prove there was API opportunity, and in 2011 and 2012 we defined the API management space, so in 2013 are we needing to better define the API deployment portion of our industry?
<p>I will use Emergent One, APISpark, API Engine and Apify more, and do individual stories on them.  Then circle back around and see how I feel.

<p>I spent time this week looking at 20, of what I&rsquo;m calling <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">API reciprocity providers</a>, who are providing a new generation of what is historically known as ETL in the enterprise, to connect, transfer, transform and push data and content between the cloud services we are increasingly growing dependent on.
<p>With more and more of our lives existing in the cloud and via mobile devices, the need to migrate data and content between services will only grow more urgent.  While ETL has all the necessary tools to accomplish the job, the cloud democratized IT resources, and the same will occur to ETL, making these tools accessible by the masses.
<p>There are quite a few ETL solutions, but I feel there are 3 solutions that are starting to make a migration towards an easier to understand and implement vision of ETL:

<p>These providers are more robust, and provide much of the classic ETL tools the enterprise is used to, but also have the new emphasis on API driven services.  But there are 10 new service providers I&rsquo;m calling reciprocity platforms, that demonstrate the potential with offering very simple tasks, triggers and actions that can provide interaction between two or more API services:

<p>I consider reciprocity an evolution of ETL, because of three significant approaches:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Simple, meaningful connections with transfer and tranformations that are meaningful to end users, not just a wide array of ETL building blocks an IT architect has to implement</li>
<li><strong>API</strong> - Reciprocity platforms expose meaningful connections users have the cloud services they depend on.  While you can still migrate from databases or file locations as with classic ETL, reciprocity platforms focus on APIs, while maintaining the value for end-users as well as the originating or target platforms</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong> - Reciprocity focus on not just transmitting data and content, but identifying the value of the payload itself and the relationships, and emotions in play between users and the platforms they depend on</li>
</ul>
<p>This new generation of ETL providers began the migration online with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="Yahoo Pipes" href="https://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a></span>.  Which resonated with the alpha developers looking to harvest, migrate, merge, mashup and push data from RSS, XML, JSON and other popular API sources--except Yahoo lacked the simplicity necessary for wider audience appeal.
<p>While I feel the 10 reciprocity providers isted above represent this new wave, there are six others incumbents trying to solve the same problem:

<p>While studying the approach of these 20 reciprocity providers, it can be tough to identify a set of common identifiers to refer to the value created. &nbsp;Each provider has their own approach and potentially identifying terminology.  For my understanding, I wanted to try and establish a common way to describe how reciprocity providers are redefining ETL. &nbsp;While imperfect, it will give me a common language to use, while also being a constant work in progress.
<p>For most reciprocity providers, it starts with some ecompassing wrapper in the form of an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">assembly</span> which describes the overall recipe, formula or wrapper that contains all the moving ETL parts.
<p>Within this assembly, you can execute on workflows, usually in a single flow, but with some of the providers you can daisy chain together multiple (or endless) workflows to create a complex series of processes.
<p>Each workflow has a defining trigger which determines the criteria that will start the workflow such as new RSS post or new tweet, and with each trigger comes a resulting action which is the target of the workflow, publishing the RSS post to a syndicated blog or adds the tweet to a Google Spreadsheet or Evernote, or any other combination of trigger and action a user desires.
<p>Triggers and actions represent the emotional connections that are the underpinnings of ETL&rsquo;s evolution into a more meaningful, reciprocation of value that is emerging in the clouds.  These new providers are connecting to the classic lineup of ETL interfaces to get things done:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Files</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Web Service</li>
</ul>
<p>While also providing the opportunity for development of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">open connectors</span> to connect to any custom database, file, messages and web services.  But these connectors are not described in boring IT terms, they are wrapped in the emotion and meaning derived from the cloud service--which could have different meanings for different users. This is where one part of the promise of reciprocity comes into play, by empowering average problem owners and every day users to define and execute against these types of API driven agreements.
<p>All of these actions, tasks, formulas, jobs or other types of process require the ability to plan, execute and audit the processes, with providers offering:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Scheduling</li>
<li>History / Logging</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p>With data being the lifeblood of much of these efforts, of course we will see &ldquo;big data&rdquo; specific tools as well:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Synchronization </li>
<li>Data Quality</li>
<li>Big Data</li>
<li>Analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>While many reciprocity providers are offering interoperability between two specific services, moving data and resource from point a to b, others are bringing in classic ETL transformations:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Reformat</li>
<li>Aggregate</li>
<li>Sort</li>
<li>Dedupe</li>
<li>Filter</li>
<li>Partition</li>
<li>Merge</li>
<li>Join</li>
<li>Split</li>
<li>Convert</li>
</ul>
<p>After the trigger and before the action, there is also an opportunity for other things to happen, with providers offering:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Push</li>
<li>Events</li>
</ul>
<p>During trigger, action or transformation there are plenty of opportunities for custom scripting and transofrmations, with several approaches to custom programming:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Custom Scripts</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Command Line</li>
<li>API</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases the reciprocity provider also provides a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">key value store</span> allowing the storage of user specified data extracted from trigger or action connections or during the transformation process.  Introducing a kind of memory store during the reciprocal cycle.
<p>With the migration of critical resources, many of the leading providers are offering tools for testing the process before live execution:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Test</li>
<li>Debugger</li>
<li>Sandbox</li>
<li>Production</li>
</ul>
<p>With any number of tasks or jobs in motion, users will need to understand whether the whole apparatus is working, with platforms offering tools for:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are a couple providers offering completely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">open source</span> solutions, there are also several providing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OEM</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">white label solutions</span>, which allow you to deploy a reciprocity platform for your partners, clients or other situations that would require it to branded in a custom way.
<p>One area that will continue to push ETL into this new category of reciprocity providers is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">security</span>.  Connectors will often use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OAuth</span>, respecting a users already established relationship with platform either on the trigger or action sides, ensureing their existing relationship is upheld.  Beyond this providers are offering <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SSL</span> to provide secure transmissions, but in the near future we will see other layers emerge to keep agreements in tact, private and maintain the value of not just the payload but the relationships between platforms, users and reciprocity providers.
<p>Even though reciprocity providers focus on the migration of resources in this new API driven, cloud-based world, several of them still offer dual solutions for deploying solutions in both environments:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Cloud </li>
<li>On-Premise</li>
</ul>
<p>There is not one approach either in the cloud, or on premise that will work for everyone and all their needs.  Some data will be perfectly find moving around the cloud, while others will require a more sensitive on-premise approach.  It will be up to problem owners to decide.
<p>Many of this new breed of providers are in beta and pricing &nbsp;isn&rsquo;t available.  A handful have begun to apply cloud based pricing models, but most are still trying to understand the value of this new service and what market will bear.  So far I&rsquo;m seeing pricing based upon:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Seat</li>
<li>Assembly</li>
<li>Tasks</li>
<li>Connections</li>
<li>Extension</li>
<li>Sync</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Training</li>
</ul>
<p>Much like IaaS, PaaS SaaS and now BaaS, reciprocity providers will have a lot of education and communication with end users before they&rsquo;ll fully understand what they can charge for their services--forcing them to continue to define and differentiate themselves in 2013.
<p>One of the most important evolutionary areas, I&rsquo;m only seeing with one or two providers, is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">marketplace</span> where reciprocity platform users can browse and search for assemblies, connectors and tasks that are created by 3rd party providers for specific reciprocity approaches.  A marketplace will prove to be how reciprocity platforms serve the long tail and niches that will exist within the next generation of ETL.  Marketplaces will provide a way for developers to build solutions that meet specific needs, allowing them to monetize their skills and domain expertise, while also bringing in revenue to platform owners.
<p>I understand this is all a lot of information.  If you are still ready this, you most likely either already understand this space, or like me, feel it is an important area to understand and help educate people about.   Just like with API service providers and BaaS, I will continue to write about my research here, while providing more refined materials as Github repos for each research area.
<p>Let me know anything I'm missing or your opinions on the concept of API reciprocity.

<p>Making onboarding with an API as frictionless as possible is one thing I like to study and educate my readers about. While I was studying what I call the <a title="API reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">API reciprocity</a> space currently, which is an evolution of what is known in the enterprise as ETL, I came across a company called FoxWeave.
<p><a title="FoxWeave" href="http://www.foxweave.com/" target="_blank">FoxWeave</a> is a service that can migrate and synchronize data across all your cloud and on-premise apps and databases.  When I went to &ldquo;try it now&rdquo; at FoxWeave, I was told &ldquo;no signup needed&rdquo;.  But I didnt&rsquo; think much about it until I saw the temporary guest account popup.
<p><a href="http://www.foxweave.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/foxweave/foxweave-temporary-guest.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>What a powerful concept.  Evolving the freemium concept into the world of anonymity, allowing me to play with and understand your service before having to commit in any way.  One less piece of friction when I&rsquo;m trying to understad a new tool or service.
<p>Nice work <a title="FoxWeave" href="http://www.foxweave.com/" target="_blank">FoxWeave</a>.  Way to make interoperability and automation using APIs as frictionless as possible.

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/respect-my-authority.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>There is a great post by Lorinda Brandon (<a href="https://twitter.com/lindybrandon">@lindybrandon</a>) of <a title="SmartBear" href="https://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> on ProgrammableWeb today called&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2013/02/27/governance-vs-innovation-do-they-have-to-be-enemies/">Governance vs Innovation: Do They Have to be Enemies?</a>. &nbsp;She continues a conversation, from <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> around the word "governance", and how in the API space, this is often considered a bad word. &nbsp;
<p>I was moderating the questions for <span>Alistair Farquharson (</span><span lang="EN"><a href="https://twitter.com/afarqu">@</a></span><span lang="EN"><a href="https://twitter.com/afarqu">afarqu</a>)</span><span>&nbsp;CTO of&nbsp;</span><a title="SOA Software" href="http://www.soa.com/">SOA Software</a>, when&nbsp;<span>Irakli Nadareishvili (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/inadarei/" target="_blank">@inadarei</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> actually agreed that it is a bad word and asked if we need to evolve beyond it and not embrace it. &nbsp;I totally agree with Lorinda's approach to walking the line between governance and innovation, and look forward to more discussion around how to analyze API vs SOA principles within the enterprise--striking a balance that works for each individual approach.
<p>To help stimulate this conversation I wanted to break down the word, governance. &nbsp;In the context of IT, governance is:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>a concept used for activities related to exercising control over services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). The definitions of SOA governance agree in its purpose of exercising control, but differ in the responsibilities it should have. Some narrow definitions focus on imposing policies and monitoring services, while other definitions use a broader business-oriented perspective</em>
<p>With general definitions being:
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>the persons who make up a body for the purpose of administering something</li>
<li>the act of governing; exercising authority</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the illness around the word, when it is applied to APIs becomes clear when you start looking at the synonyms:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Governance</strong> - administration, authority, bureaucracy, command, control, direction, domination, dominion, empire, execution, executive, guidance, influence, jurisdiction, law, ministry, patronage, political practice, politics, polity, power, powers-that-be, predominanc</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong> - administration, care, charge, command, conduct, control, direction, governance , government, guidance, handling, intendance, manipulation, operation, oversight, rule, superintendence, superintendency, supervision</li>
<li><strong>Regulation</strong> - adjustment, administration, arrangement, classification, codification, control, coordination, direction, governance , governing, government, guidance, handling, management, moderation, modulation, reconciliation, regimentation, reorganization, settlement, standardization, superintendence, supervision, systematization, tuning</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's separate the potentially bad synonyms:
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/governance-bad.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">

<li>domination</li>

<li>politics</li>
<li>control</li>
<li>government</li>
<li>manipulation</li>
<li>oversight</li>
<li>standardization</li>
</ul>
<p>And the good synonyms:

<li>coordination</li>
<li>standardization</li>
<li>tuning</li>
<li>modulation</li>
<li>power</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel both power and standardization could be both good or evil, so I put in both categories. &nbsp;But overall you can begin to understand how governance is viewed in negative light in the API approach. &nbsp;People see it more about power and control, rather than the healthy aspects introduced API innovation. &nbsp;
<p>In my opinion, this word reflects on why API works in more scenarios than strict SOA. &nbsp;Too much control can stifle innovation, and if you are controlling for all the wrong reasons, it can be even worse. &nbsp;APIs require a certain amount of oxygen to grow and evolve before it can achieve a level of innovation, which is an aspect some business leaders have trouble grasping.&nbsp;
<p>Irakli and I both agreed that we need a new word, something that reflects the bottom up of API, not the top down control of SOA. &nbsp;Any ideas for a word that can keep be applied in a healthy way, but can institute many of the positive aspects of governance, without the potential innovation killing power and control?

<p>title: ‘Merging API Automation and Interoperability Into API Reciprocity’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/reciprocity-trends.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/trends/reciprocity-trends.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>While I&rsquo;m wading through dictionaries and thesauruses in an effort to find a <a href="/2013/02/27/what-is-better-word-for-governance-when-it-comes-to-apis/">more appropriate term &ldquo;governance&rdquo;, when looking at SOA governance through the API lense</a>--I figured I&rsquo;d flush out another area I&rsquo;m working to define a term that appropriately describes automation and interoperability using APIs.
<p>Yesterday I took a look at <a href="/2013/02/26/75-features-from-across-31-baas-providers/">31 backend as a service (BaaS) providers</a>, in hopes of understanding more about what value they provide.  Today I'm diving into the automation section of my new <a href="/trends/">API trends area</a>. While reviewing, I noticed the exact same companies that were under automation were also in interoperability.  So I set out to find a new word to apply to this next generation of ETL providers that are building bridges between cloud platforms using APIs, as well as legacy data connections.
<p>I have settled on the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reciprocity</span>.  The dictionary defines reciprocity as:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>the quality or state of being reciprocal : mutual dependence, action, or influence</li>
<li>a mutual exchange of privileges; specifically : a recognition by one of two countries or institutions of the validity of licenses or privileges granted by the other</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/trends/social-reciprocity.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>When you look in the thesaurus, reciprocity has a definition of "interchange" with synonyms of cooperation, exchange, mutuality and reciprocation.  Reciprocity is also a synonym of connection with a definition of &ldquo;person who aids another in achieving goal&rdquo;. With synonyms being acquaintance, agent, ally, associate, association, contact, friend, go-between, intermediary, kin, kindred, kinship, mentor, messenger, network, reciprocity, relation, relative and sponsor. &nbsp;(i love that "kin" is a synonym too)
<p>All of these terms apply to what I&rsquo;m seeing unfold with this new generation of ETL providers.  ETL is moving into the clouds, and out from behind the firewall, using the open web, cloud platforms and APIs, and now we have to <a href="/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">rethink ETL, and make it accessible to the masses</a>. Put it within reach of the everday problem owners.
<p>What I really like about reciprocity is it describes the mutual relationship between users and the platforms where their data and information resides.  Reciprocity describes the connection that has to occur between these valuable API platforms, and their users, in ways the ETL misses.  ETL stands for extract, transform and load, very technical and programmatic responses to moving my valuable resources, assets and personal information between the cloud platform I depend on daily.
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/trends/reciprocity-2.jpeg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p>In the physical world we have reciprocity agreements between countries to ensure free trade and a healthy balance in world markets.  This next generation of reciprocity platform providers will not just be extracting, transforming and loading data--reciprocity platforms will be the nervous system of the global API economy, moving valuable resources around the world while respecting relationships between users, developers and the platforms in a way that preserves maximum value for everyone involved.
<p>Now under the <a href="/trends/">trends section</a> you will just see one section for <a title="reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity</a>, that will house all 19 of this new breed of API service providers.  We&rsquo;ll see how things change, but for now I think reciprocity describes the value created by this new space, in a way that helps me communicate it to others.

<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/pics/apistrat-ecosystem-panel.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>We closed up the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apistrat&amp;src=typd">#APIstrat</a>) last friday with a panel called APIs, Platforms and Ecosystem, where I moderated a healthy discussion with Tyler Stalder (<a href="https://twitter.com/tylerstalder">@tylerstalder</a>)&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com/" target="_blank">Singly</a>,&nbsp;Seth Blank (<a href="https://twitter.com/AntiFreeze">@AntiFreeze</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="YourTrove" href="https://www.yourtrove.com/">YourTrove</a>,&nbsp;Asif Rahman (<a href="https://twitter.com/asifrahman">@asifrahman</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="NewsCred" href="http://newscred.com/">Newscred</a>, Orian Marx (<a href="http://alpha.app.net/orian">@orian</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a>,&nbsp;Travis Wallis (<a href="https://twitter.com/traviswallis" target="_blank">@traviswallis</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://peoplebrowsr.com/" target="_blank">PeopleBrowsr</a>&nbsp;around the very broad spectrum of APIs, platforms and the concept of ecosystems.
<p>One of the questions I asked the group was, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which of the three OAuth Legs is the most important?</span> &nbsp;
<p>To provide a quick primer for the portion of my audience that aren&rsquo;t OAuth geeks:
<blockquote><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth is an open standard for authorization that provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner</a></em></blockquote>
<p>Ok, what does that mean?  Think Twitter.  Twitter is server.  You are the owner of your tweet resources.  When you authenticate anywhere using your Twitter ID, that website or app uses OAuth to get access to your tweets, via the Twitter platform.  If you login to your Twitter account, click on settings and select apps from the left menu--these are apps and sites that have requested OAuth access <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> Twitter resources.
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/oauth/OAuth2.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" />
<p>OAuth is a relationship between you, your platform provider and various sites and apps that want to access your data via the API.  Sometimes these apps and your platform provider are one and the same, but the beauty of OAuth&nbsp;is that anyone can request access from you--access that you can revoke when you choose.
<p>Back to the panel at API Strategy &amp; Practice.  Every panelist, except for Asif Rahman of Newscred said that the most important leg of oAuth is the end user. This made me happy because it shows that, at least at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apistrat&amp;src=typd">#APIstrat</a>, people are concerned with the interest of the end user.  This is healthy.
<p>In reality, I worry that when platform discussions do occur, the conversation leans too much in favor of platform, then the developer, with very little to no involvement of the end user.  Think of the Twitter ecosystem discussions since March of 2010.  Rarely do you hear discussion about API access and ecosystem viability in the context of the end-users.  Platforms and especially developers are very good at being very loud in these conversations.
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/oauth/oauth-twitter-3-legs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>In my opinion all three legs of OAuth are equally important, with an emphasis on the end-user.  It is their resource right?  Or is it?  The only thing standing between healthy OAuth conversations and relationships is the platforms terms of use and privacy policies.
<p>The entire panel at #APIStrat agreed that we need more education for end-users about OAuth.  Now that we have OAuth 2.0 settled (in some minds), we need to get down to business <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">educating all three legs</span></em>&nbsp;around the process of OAuth and its best practices, empowering all three parties to be aware, and participate in ongoing conversations about how we are producing, storing, sharing, selling, licensing and consuming resources via APIs.
<p>We need to make sure API platform conversations have all three legs represented.  The success of any platform will depend on a healthy balance between a platform, developers and the end-users--with oAuth 2.0 being the best model we have to make this happen to date.
<p>Lets get to work.

<p>title: ‘Freemium API Tools Can Drive Experimentation And  Innovation’</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the power of the freemium model when it comes to APIs.  Nothing is as it seems when you are deploying managing or consuming APIs.  You have to have room to innovate and iterate without signing contracts or paying too much, before you find exactly the right integration or deployment that works.
<p>This freemium approach to APIs is one of the biggest reasons I&rsquo;ve been supporting <a title="3Scale" href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a> since early days of API Evangelist.  3Scale was the original API service provider to offer a truly freemium tier for anyone wanting to deploy an API, and remains passionate about this to this day.
<p>During the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC</a> last week, I had the pleasure of meeting the <a href="https://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> team, who share a similar perspective of the space, resulting in them launching a new suite of free tools that will help you develop, test and monitor while building API driven software.
<p>SmartBear has published four new free tools for testing and development:

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
<p>The goal of the new freeware initiative is to put robust tools for quality software development into the hands of developers and testers immediately while allowing them to upgrade to the feature-rich paid versions when it makes practical sense.  I sat down with Lorinda Brandon, Director of Strategy, SmartBear Software while at #apistrat, where she said:
<blockquote><em>The burgeoning API industry is a reflection of a new phase of innovation and collaboration in the software industry as a whole. Businesses and organizations are now sharing their data and functionality via APIs like never before, often for free. In fact, businesses are even inviting the developer community to come together in hackathons to build apps and mashups using their APIs. While we applaud the energy and pace, we also want to keep the focus on building high quality products. In 2013, SmartBear wants to empower this collaborative global community of developers to create high-quality, low-cost (or free) offerings of their own by making even more of our tools available for free through our Freeware Initiative.</em></blockquote>
<p>I agree 100%.  Freemium can be a critical marketing vehicle in the API industry, one that will bring attention to your tools and services, while also providing room for your customers to put tools to use in a meaningful way, that will truly add value to their world--without overcommitting.  Once a tool proves itself in someone&rsquo;s world, they can choose to upgrade and evolve to more premium offerings.
<p>All six tools from SmartBear will be added to my <a href="/apitools/">tools section</a>, which is meant to provide a toolbox of free and downloaded software for API owners and developers to take advantage of.  SmartBear says this is just the beginning and they will be adding more tools in the future.  As they become available I will publish and keep track of via <a href="/apitools/">API Evangelist tools</a>.

<p><a href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service</a> (BaaS) provider <a href="/serviceproviders/quickblox.php" target="_blank">QuickBlox</a> announced new <a href="http://quickblox.com/plans/">pricing plans</a>, which includes a free tier up to 10GB in traffic and storage, with unlimited API calls and push notifications.
<p>The BaaS space is heating up with lots of discussion about whether you should charge developers by active user, features, storage or API call--with each provider being pretty vocal about where they stand.  Quickblox is approach similar to <a title="Stackmob" href="/serviceproviders/stackmob.php">StackMob</a>, who refuses to charge based upon API call, atributing it to a sucess tax. But Quickblox is somewhat different, as they still charge for hard costs like bandwidth and storage--Stackmob only charges by feature.
<p>I'm trying to understand all the approaches to BaaS pricing, which was also a <a title="panel discussion last week at API Strategy &amp; Practice between Parse, Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii, Cloudmine and Firebas" href="/2013/02/25/the-baas-reality-tv-show-panel-at-apistrat/">panel discussion last week at API Strategy &amp; Practice between Parse, Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii, Cloudmine and Firebase</a>.  I don't think there is a one size fits all strategy here, but I predict the conversation around BaaS pricing will continue to heat up in 2013 as the market continues to define itself.

<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-transparency-report.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>After reading about <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/transparency-report-what-it-takes-for.html">Google&rsquo;s release of their transparency report last month</a>, I decided I would be <a href="http://apivoice.com/2013/01/23/making-transparency-reports-standard-operating-procedure/">addding API transparency reports to my list of essential building blocks</a> for API owners. Since I wrote that, I&rsquo;ve had a great post from EFF also <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/its-time-transparency-reports-become-new-normal">stating that its time for transparency reports to become the new normal</a>. &nbsp;Where the EFF outlines the illness in our current approach:
<blockquote><em>When you use the Internet, you entrust your thoughts, experiences, photos, and location data to intermediaries &mdash; companies like AT&amp;T, Google, and Facebook. But when the government requests that data, users are usually left in the dark.</em></blockquote>
<p>In the United States, companies are not required by law to alert their users when they receive a government request for their data, and in some circumstances, they are explicitly prohibited from doing so.   So it is up to us, the users to join organizations like the EFF and let all online service providers understand the importance of transparency reports becoming default operating procedure.
<p>Currently, we are only seeing transparency reports from providers like Google, DropBox, LinkedIn, Twitter and a handful of other service providers.  While I feel that all companies that run on users data should provide transparency reports, I&rsquo;m going to focus on making sure it is standard operating procedures with companies that deliver APIs.
<p>As a starting point for my API transparency report building block, I&rsquo;m using the <a href="http://www.skypeopenletter.com/">letter that was drafted by concerned privacy advocates who are calling for Microsoft to issue a transparency report on Skype</a>, which it purchased in 2011 for $8.5 billion.
<p>This letter states that:
<blockquote><em> Skype is a voice, video and chat communications platform with over 600 million users worldwide, effectively making it one of the world&rsquo;s largest telecommunications companies.   Many of its users rely on Skype for secure communications&mdash;whether they are activists operating in countries governed by authoritarian regimes, journalists communicating with sensitive sources, or users who wish to talk privately in confidence with business associates, family, or friends. </em></blockquote>
<p>The Skype effort provides a beginning list of items all transparency reports should provide:
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/electronic-frontier-foundation/electronic-frontier-foundation-logo.gif" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Quantitative data regarding the release of user information to third parties, disaggregated by the country of origin of the request, including the number of requests made by governments, the type of data requested, the proportion of requests with which it complied &mdash; and the basis for rejecting those requests it does not comply with.</li>
<li>Specific details of all user data a company currently collects, and retention policies.</li>
<li>The companies best understanding of what user data third-parties, including network providers or potential malicious attackers, may be able to intercept or retain.</li>
<li>Documentation regarding the current operational relationship between the company with and other third-party licensed users of company technology, including the companies understanding of the surveillance and censorship capabilities that users may be subject to as a result of using these alternatives.</li>
<li>A company&rsquo;s interpretation of its responsibilities under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), its policies related to the disclosure of call metadata in response to subpoenas and National Security Letters (NSLs), and more generally, the policies and guidelines for employees followed when a company receives and responds to requests for user data from law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States and elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your company is going to provide a service that users depend on, one that retains their personal data in any way--you should have a transparency report that educates users about how and what any government is accessing and using information about them.
<p>This applies to any data collected or transmitted via APIs from a platform via 3rd party platforms and services.  APIs owe it to end users to provide insight into how their data is being used by 3rd party application developers via oAuth, the same insight should be provided regarding how government organizations is accessing and using data as well.

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m currently tracking on <a href="/trends/baas.php">31 backend as a service providers</a>, in an effort to better understand how this new breed of platforms are helping developers build web and mobile apps.  After looking at all the BaaS providers, there are 13 clear leaders:

<p>My goal is to better understand what features are offered across these 31 BaaS providers.  To accomplish this, I spent no more than an hour per provider looking through their sites and playing with their products to get at least a basic understanding of their offerings.
<p>When looking for features I tried to standardize the best I could, but it is difficult when there are different approaches to the deployment of resources on each platform.  I found about 75 distinct features being offered across the 31 BaaS providers.  I&rsquo;m sure there are other features, and vital details missing, but I wanted to start somewhere.  Here is what I found, organized as best I could:

<p><strong>Marketplace</strong>
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<p>You can <a href="https://kinlane.github.com/backend-as-a-service/">view all 75 features at the BaaS Github Repository</a> I setup.  Let me know any that you feel are missing, and I&rsquo;ll consider adding.
<p>Next up, I will add the features into my BaaS tracking database and publish a breakdown of providers, with the features they offer.  Letting people search and filter, and also open up to each BaaS provider to comment and submit additional features they offer.

<p>One of the lively discussions at the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC</a> last week was the backend as a service (BaaS) panel I moderated towards the end of the first day.
<p>We brought together <span>Ilya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> to talk about the fast growing BaaS space.
<p>I kicked things off with some pretty standard stuff, by having each person introduce themselves and explain what they do.   Next I asked them to explain what differentiates themselves from the other folks on the couch.
<p>After that, things started heating up when I brought up a discussion about BaaS pricing, from an <a href="/2013/02/07/which-baas-pricing-model-is-better/">earlier online discussion about the mertits of user, feature or pricing base upon number of API calls</a>.  The common approach is user or api based pricing, with Stackmob focused on feature based BaaS pricing.
<div style="margin-left: 50px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>BaaS panel is actually really really interesting. Great line up. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23apistrat">#apistrat</a>
&mdash; Ilya Bagrak (@ibagrak) <a href="https://twitter.com/ibagrak/status/304716332983791616">February 21, 2013</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
<script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>The conversation was definitely lead by Ty Amell of StackMob, with pointed rebuttals from Ilya Sukhar of Parse, with Miko Matasumura of Kii in between, being very diplomatic while also throwing some jabs of his own. Morgan Bickle of Kinvey, Marc Weil of Cloudmine and James Tamplin of Firebase held their own, but it things were definitely overshadowed by the discussion by Ty and Ilya.
<div style="margin-left: 50px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="margin-left: 50px;">
<p>Super interesting trust issue: &ldquo;[What happens if your BaaS gets acquired and pulls a Posterous?]&rdquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23apistrat">#apistrat</a>
&mdash; r. kevin nelson (@rknLA) <a href="https://twitter.com/rknLA/status/304721926847340544">February 21, 2013</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
<script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Next the panel moved the discussion to the future of Baas, with direct questions about what potential exit strategies are for each of the platforms.
<p>At times the panel seemed like a reality show from the BaaS world or a daytime talk show featuring the leaders in the BaaS space.
<p>The Backend as a Service panel really showed the personalities behind the leading companies in the space.  I was so engaged in the conversation, thinking about the next questions I can't recall everything that was said. &nbsp;I remember some pretty sharp comments from both Ty and Ilya. &nbsp;I look forward to watching again when the video is ready from #APIStrat.

<p>I see a lot of dead simple, yet meaningful uses of APIs come across my desk (I don&rsquo;t have a desk, why do I keep saying this?) each day.  One I saw today is something every school, whether K-12, college or university should have.
<p>Using the UC Berkeley API, you can get a list of all departments:
<blockquote><em>_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/department?departmentCode=a&amp;app_id=309fe68e&amp;app_key=51b9d67dc4f0501eed763822a641b17b"_</em></blockquote>
<p>Then with the proper department code you can pull a list of classes:
<blockquote><em>_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/classoffering?departmentCode=ARCH&amp;app_id=your-id&amp;app_key=your-key"_</em></blockquote>

<p>The <a title="UC Berkeley API Management" href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley API Management Portal</a> is brand new, I&rsquo;m still working on separate story regarding their approach, but I wanted to talk about how good it is to see such straightforward, valuable uses of an API at a leading university.
<p>This simple example is something you should be able to do by default at all schools across the country.
<p>The best part is that the API team is actively communicating these uses of the API on Google+, which is how I came across the story.

<p>Its the Monday morning after the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>.  The conference went off without a hitch, and was exactly the conference I envisioned when 3Scale first contacted me seven months ago about the idea of putting on the event. &nbsp;In July of 2012 Steve Willmott the CEO and founder of 3Scale sent me an email stating:
<blockquote><em>..we're thinking of finally getting round to organizing an API focused event (conference) which tries to help spread knowledge about API, promote good practice and broaden the API tent beyond what it is today. The aim would be an event which combined both "business and practice" - meaning one element which tackles critical topics such as business models, strategy, success stories etc. and another which is about "what can be done with APIs" and "how to make it happen technically".</em></blockquote>
<p>Closing with:
<blockquote><em>The final important thing is we'd like it to be a very open event - with a range of supporters, speakers and attendees and - while vendors might sponsor - it wouldn't be a "vendor" event.</em></blockquote>
<p>To which I responded with:
<blockquote><em>Sounds like a great idea to me.  I'm in, and willing to help in any way I can.</em></blockquote>
<p>Of course I would be in.  I&rsquo;ve wanted this type of conference to occur for a while now, and what better way to make sure it happens right, than doing it yourself!  It was an amazing opportunity for me--there was no ignoring it.
<p>As many of you know the original conference was scheduled for November 1st and 2nd in New York, City.  But due to hurricane Sandy, we had to postpone the conference and we ended up rescheduling it for last Thursday and Friday, February 21st and 22nd at the same venue--the Westin Grand Central in NYC.
<p>In the end, the conference ended up with about 350 registered (<strong>SOLD OUT</strong>),with about what appears to be about 275-325 floating around each day, coming and going listening to <a title="talks from over 70 companies in the API space" href="/2013/02/12/companies-that-are-speaking-at-api-strategy-practice/">talks from over 70 companies in the API space</a>.  It was exactly the mix of folks I had hoped to see--ranging from marketing, advertising, business and developers who were new to APIs, to the moderately skilled players who were looking to polish their skills as well as being a who&rsquo;s who of API experts across the industry.
<p>I did not get to attend as many of the sessions as I wished, and due to event coordination I wasn&rsquo;t always present main stage to hear complete talks. But on Monday morning here is what&rsquo;s fresh in my mind:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Laura Merling</strong> - Its great to see Laura&rsquo;s approach to helping organize AT&amp;T&rsquo;s API strategy.  I look forward to closely following not just her strategy, but understand her tactical considerations for helping the telco giant successful navigate the API space.</li>
<li><strong>Jeff Lawson</strong> - Jeff never fails to deliver.  He always has informative talks that are entertaining, but also deliver vital overviews of the space. &nbsp;This time its all about software people!</li>
<li><strong>Payments Session</strong> - I heard from several folks this session was a very lively discussion between Paypal and the newer generation of payment providers like Stripe, Braintree and Dwolla.</li>
<li><strong>Security Session</strong> - Like the payment one I was not present, but I heard from several folks there was a pretty interesting exchange.  I look forward to the video.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Klabnik </strong>- Everyone needs to be exposed to Steve&rsquo;s extremely clear perspective of not just open APIs, but open software development.  His talks are never about product or companies, they are more a philosophical vision that is rooted in a healthy understanding of developers, development communities and how it dovetails into society, business and politics.</li>
<a href="https://3scale.net" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<li><strong>Backend as a Service Panel </strong>- I had so much fun on this panel.  I cannot wait to see the video.  The banter back and forth between <span>lya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> was priceless.  At times, it felt like reality TV show. There will definitely be more discussion about this panel.</li>
<li><strong>Jeff Meisel </strong>- I&rsquo;m captivated by the potential of National Instrument&rsquo;s Labview Tools API program.   His talk walked us through the potential from a platform that can provide any physically engineered object with an API.  Jeff&rsquo;s talk left my mind spinning with visions around the future of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>John Musser</strong> - John always delivers an education for anyone in the space, whether your novice, intermediate or expert.  And his 20 API Business Models in 20 Minutes continued this trend.  As someone who is immersed in the space as I am, I immediately recognize the amount of work and perspective that is needed to gather, organize and distill down a topic like this into a meaningful presentation.  Extremely valuable work.</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Jacobson </strong>- I thoroughly enjoy watching the evolution of not just Daniel&rsquo;s talks, but evolution of his and the Netflix perspective on APIs.  He talks about Netflix evolving beyond REST, and leaves it for you to decide if Netflix is just an edge case or signs what is to come in our every growing device driven, internet of things world.  I think we need to watch what Daniel and Netflix is doing very closely, and learn. </li>
<li><strong>John Sheehan</strong> - Dammit, I was running around during yours. I needed to watch this one--will wait for video.</li>
<li><strong>Albert Wenger</strong> - I&rsquo;m extremely fascinated with the VC perspective of all things API.  Especially one that is focused on the &ldquo;network effect&rdquo; like USV is.  I&rsquo;ve talked with USV and a couple of other groups in the last couple months regarding their portfolios and the overall APIs space, and I will definitely be talking to other firms in the coming months and writing more stories on this topic.  Extremely critical perspective of the space that I don&rsquo;t think is getting enough public discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Gray Brooks</strong> - APIs and the Federal Government is a piece of the API pie I&rsquo;m uber passionate about.  I thoroughly enjoy my regular discussions with the Senior API Strategist and the GSA and his talk delivered the mandate I feel is needed right now, not just for city, county, state and federal government to get on board with APIs, but also that us citizens become accountable for making this work as well!</li>
<li><strong>APIs, Platforms and Ecosystem </strong>- We closed up the conference with a panel made up of Tyler Stalder (<a href="https://twitter.com/tylerstalder">@tylerstalder</a>)&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com/" target="_blank">Singly</a>,&nbsp;Seth Blank (<a href="https://twitter.com/AntiFreeze">@AntiFreeze</a>) of<a title="YourTrove" href="https://www.yourtrove.com/">YourTrove</a>,&nbsp;Asif Rahman (<a href="https://twitter.com/asifrahman">@asifrahman</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="NewsCred" href="http://newscred.com/">Newscred</a>, Orian Marx (<a href="http://alpha.app.net/orian">@orian</a>) of<a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a>,&nbsp;Travis Wallis (<a href="https://twitter.com/traviswallis" target="_blank">@traviswallis</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://peoplebrowsr.com/" target="_blank">PeopleBrowsr</a>.  This panel closed up the event, leaving exactly the right tone with the audience I wanted.  Focusing at the heart of what makes APIs work, the relationship between platform, developers and users and what it takes to make it work in this new API driven world.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list doesn&rsquo;t even begin to sum up what happened at API Strategy &amp; Practice.  I will have to wait for the video to be produced from all keynotes, panels and sessions(which we will make sure and let you know when ready), to fully understand what happened across all four rooms of the amazing event.
<p>Beyond the keynotes, panels and sessions and moving into the networking opportunity that was #APIStrat.  I met so many people that I know online, but have never met in person, my head is still swimming.   Every couple hours I had to walk outside and get some air, so I could keep up with the conversations.  It makes me remember how important these events are to re-enforcing our existing relationships.  Online will never fully replace offline relationships, just augment them in new ways...or maybe offline augments online? &nbsp;Who knows!
<p>Next, I have to throw in a comment about the beer during the drinks reception.  Did you notice the IPA amongst the beer choices?  Nice work <a title="Ping Identity" href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping Identity</a> and the 3Scale team.  It is the little things that make these events successful.
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/augusto-marietta-mashape-apistrat.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>Ok. I know there was more, but I will be writing stories from now until the next API Strategy &amp; Practice in October or November (more to come), and this post is pretty long as it is.
<p>Anyways, I want to thank all the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">sponsors of API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> for making the conversation possible, and make sure the 3Scale team knows how thankful I am for what they did.  They took all the risk, while putting up with me and my shit, to make exactly the event I envisioned when we started all of this. &nbsp;It wouldn't have been possible without <a title="3Scale" href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a>.
<p>I wanted to leave you with wise words from <span>Augusto Marietti&nbsp;(</span><a href="https://twitter.com/sinzone">@sinzone)</a><span>&nbsp;the CEO of&nbsp;</span><a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com/">Mashape</a>. &nbsp;I snapped this picture exactly at the moment Augusto said:<strong>&nbsp;DON'T FUCK THIS UP!!</strong>&nbsp;
<p>I agree with Augusto. It is way too important. &nbsp;Let's make sure and keep these conversations going, so we do it right! &nbsp;

<p>The payment API provider Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/jquery-payment">released a jQuery payment tool</a>, a general purpose library for building credit card forms, validating input, and formatting numbers. The library was developed to support <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-checkout">Checkout</a>, Stripe's embeddable checkout widget.
<p>Simple, but extremely useful libraries like this can go a long way to introduce developers to your APIs and put valuable tools into their toolbox, that will help them be successful. &nbsp;Something that can go a long way in establishing a loyalty between you and your developer community.
<p>You can find a <a href="https://stripe.github.com/jquery.payment/example/">live demo</a> of the library, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment">source on GitHub</a>.

<p>Salesforce has a pretty cool <a title="code share" href="http://developer.force.com/codeshare/apex/resultspage?l=mru&amp;title=All%20Projects">Code Share</a>&nbsp;area within the DeveloperForce ecosystem, which allows developers to share code snippets with the rest of the community.
<p>Its a pretty cool way for anyone to share their techniques as code samples in a variety of languages, then letting the community vet the code, fork larger projects, and collaborate to improve the code for the greater good.
<p>Acknowledging that they don't have the internal resources to fully support the process, <a href="https://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/02/bringing-code-and-community-together.html">Salesforce has halted code samples submission, announcing plans to migrate the Code Sharing program to Github</a>.
<p>Github is already the largest code sharing platform, providing social tools that developers are used to.  Salesforce's publiclackowledgement that they don't have the internal resources to operate, the fact they identify the importance of such a program, and the decision to migrate to Github are all very savvy moves by the <a title="API Pioneer" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">API pioneer</a>.
<p><a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Github%20101">Github is one of the most important platforms you can use to support your API</a>.  Using Github to host all your API code samples and SDKs, whether they are generated internally or by your developers community is becoming more than a novelty, but an essential part of API operations.

<p>Google is using the <a href="https://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/02/udacity-html5-game-development-course.html">online learning platform Udacity to teach developers about game development</a>.  The new <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255">HTML Game Development course</a> (CS255), is the online classroom for the programming class, coupled with a series of study groups hosted at Google's San Francisco office and a contest providing developers an incentive to complete the class.
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/live/">Google is kicking off the course with a live session</a>, with Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun on Thursday, February 14th at 10:30 AM and the class<span>&nbsp;will be taught by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts">Colt McAnlis</a><span>&nbsp;(Developer Advocate, Chrome Developer Relations),&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts">Peter Lubbers</a><span>(Program Manager, Chrome Developer Relations), and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105495497383489174073/posts">Sean Bennett</a><span>&nbsp;(Architect, Udacity).</span>
<p>The HTML Game Development course from Google is an interesting approach to developer education by providing an online course bundled with in-person or streamed workshops and study groups, bundled with a contest to help motivate students.
<p>I may create a blueprint for other API providers to follow, when launching their own courses in a similar way to Google.

<p>I was checking out the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/02/three-new-aws-reference-architectures-for-e-commerce.html">updates to the AWS Reference Architecture</a>, where they provide blueprints for how you can use AWS. In this version AWS provides an e-commerce architecture reference--providing a system overview, a detailed architectural diagram, and a list of the AWS services used in the architectural approach.
<p>The AWS e-commerce architecture reference provides three separate areas:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web Frontend </strong>- This is a reference architecture for the web frontend of an e-commerce site. It makes use of Route 53, CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, ElastiCache, DynamoDB and CloudSearch</li>
<li><strong>Checkout Pipeline </strong>- This is a reference architecture for a secure and highly available checkout pipeline service for an e-commerce site. It uses the Virtual Private Cloud, the Simple Workflow Service, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, and the Simple Email Service</li>
<li><strong>Marketing &amp; Recommendations Service</strong> - This is a reference architecture for a marketing and recommendation service for an e-commerce site. It uses Elastic MapReduce, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, DynamoDB, and the Simple Email Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond providing the <a href="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/architecturecenter/AWS_ac_ra_ecommerce_webfrontend_14.pdf">detailed reference card</a>, AWS provides more information on a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-training/architect/">three-day course in AWS Architecture Training</a> that will be held in numerous U.S. cities this spring.
<p>I will add API architecture references as a <a href="/">building block for API owners</a> to consider when planning and managing an API.  If you can provide clear blueprints for developers to follow, you can increase the chances developers will be successful with integration of an API into their application or systems.

<p>The <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> is happening next week in NYC. I have had so much fun pulling together the schedule of keynotes, panels, sessions and the talks on the 429 - Too Many Requests stage. &nbsp;
<p>The number of requests we've received for sponsoring, speaking and attending has been overhelming. &nbsp;Resulting in a sold out conference, and an amazing lineup of speakers. &nbsp;I was spending some time tidying up the speakers page and sponsor page today, and was so impressed with the companies involved, I had to share.
<p>There are 72 companies represented at API Strategy &amp; Practice:

<p>I don't know about you, but I'm pretty blown away by the list of companies that will be attendance. &nbsp;I'm stoked we were able to pull together such an awesome lineup. &nbsp;I wish I could publish a list of companies who are attending, because that list would equally blow your mind. &nbsp;
<p>It's exciting to see the buzz around APIs in 2013, and I look forward to seeing you at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>.

<p>Palo Alto has opened up city data, including <a href="http://paloalto.opendata.junar.com/dashboards/8031/library/" target="_blank">operational data about the Palo Alto City Library</a>.  Using the Palo Alto City open data portal you can access machine-readable data sets about various aspects of library operations including visitor count, checkouts by type of materia, information and circulation services, programs attendance, website visitors count and how library funds are spent.
<p>The Palo Alto open data portal provides widgets with data grids and charts derived from data.  But you can also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/it/open_data/suggest_a_dataset.asp">request data sets</a> and access data via the <a href="http://paloalto.opendata.junar.com/developers/">City of Palo Alto's API</a>.
<p>The city hopes that it will increase community engagement by making data open and machine readable by default. The city is looking to throw hackathons that will develop solutions, and increase public engagement in city government, and ultimately save money and enhance city services.
<p>The City of Palo Alto open data portal is provided by cloud-based <a href="http://www.junar.com/">Junar Open Data Platform</a>.

<hr />

<p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/baas/openi/openi-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>The <a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space is picking up momentum in 2013.  I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 BaaS providers, in hopes of better understanding what is being offered in this space.  Today I came across an interesting new, open source BaaS platform, being developed in the European Union called <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank">OPENi</a>.
<p>The project describes itself as:
<blockquote><em>OPENi is a European Union ICT Framework Programme (FP7) Information and communications technology (ICT) Collaborative project. Over the 30 month project duration we aim to deliver an open-source, cloud based platform for integrating mobile services.</em></blockquote>
<p>With a mission to:
<blockquote><em>Our mission is to inspire innovation in the European mobile applications industry, by radically improving the interoperability of cloud-based services and trust in personal cloud storage through the development of a consumer-centric, open source mobile cloud applications platform.</em></blockquote>
<p>With the following objective:
<blockquote><em>OPENi&rsquo;s objective is to directly address the lack of interoperability between cloud based services and enable applications to access and use a broad spectrum of existing cloud based functionality and content, consistently across different devices and platforms, in a way that enables a user-centric application experience. Targeting the needs of Application Developers, Services Providers and Consumers, OPENi will realize its vision for user-centric, cloud-connected, mobile applications.</em></blockquote>
<p>OPENi is a 30 month project, we will have to wait and see what comes out of the iniative. With the EU approach to open data and data privacy, I think there is a lot of potential to deploy and consume APIs, as well as delivering API automation, interoperability and backend platforms that have a healthy, consumer-centric approach--which I believe will be good for business, because its good for ender users.
<p>In early 2013 the OPENi team will release software for the BaaS platform as an open-source project on github.com.  When released I will evaluate it side by side with the other BaaS providers I&rdquo;m tracking on.

<p><a title="Facebook launched a new video channel" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2013/02/06/a-new-video-channel-for-developers--facebook-developers-live/">Facebook launched a new video channel</a> last week, dedicated to keeping developers up to date on the latest news, tutorials, speaking sessions from the Facebook developer ecosystem.
<p>Facebook is going to provide content for web and mobile developers, with attention in other specialty areas like gaming and information for publishers.
<p>The first edition of the channel will be recorded live on February 19th, with Director of Product Doug Purdy, with the top 3 things every mobile developer needs to know.
<p>I'm adding a video channel to my list of <a title="API building blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a>.  I don't think you have to be a Facebook before you have your own channel.  Using Google Hangouts + Youtube is an easy way for any API owner to start their own video channel to support developers.

<p>title: ‘Bringing ETL to the Masses with APIs’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Tag-Cloud-API-Automation.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Automation.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately thinking about <a title="emerging trends in API usage" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">emerging trends in API usage</a>. One area I&rsquo;m tracking on, is around companies that are offering simple services that provide interoperability and automation between cloud platforms, using APIs.   The best known examples are from companies like <a title="IFTTT" href="https://ifttt.com">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, who provide end users with simple icon based tools for defining  tasks that move data between SaaS platforms.
<p>Its tough to define this space, which in enterprise speak is really just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">Extract Transform Load (ETL)</a>, which is historically a process to migrate information between systems in an enterprise, using data sources and web services.  But with the popularity of web APIs, we need to rethink ETL in the context of the cloud and update how we approach interoperability between the growing number of API driven platforms.
<p>Mike Reich of Seabourne, and I were discussing this last time I was in Washington D.C., and he currently has a great blog post on <a title="rethinking ETL in the API age" href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/">rethinking ETL for the API age</a>.  If you don&rsquo;t know <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a>, they are behind high profile government projects like <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a> and <a title="GovInfo" href="http://govinfo.io/">GovInfo</a>.  They have been doing a lot of thinking about how to acquire, process and publish content with APIs.
<p>To better help <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>&nbsp;better understand the space, I&rsquo;m watching 12 service providers that I&rsquo;m putting in a bucket of what I consider the next generation of ETL providers:

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
<p>I feel that this new group of ETL providers are focused sufficiently on the new world of API driven platforms, beyond just "data sources" and "web services".  There are more providers like <a href="http://apatar.com/">Apatar</a> and <a href="http://www.jitterbit.com/Solutions/etl-data-integration">Jitterbit</a>, but I feel these providers are more ETL than, than reflecting new breed of API interoperability providers (which I don&rsquo;t have proper name for yet).  One characteristic I&rsquo;m looking for is ease of use.  I think this new breed should be more for end-users, SaaS users and ultimately empowering the masses--not IT, which I feel ETL is designed for.
<p>This new generation of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/interoperability.php">interoperability providers</a> should be about solving the problems average users face when operating online and in the cloud, and not just extracting, transforming and loading--making ETL something anyone can understand and put to use. &nbsp;Further democratizing IT resources, which is a common theme with SaaS, APIs, etc.
<p>I think the new players like Zapier and IFTTT have to be concerned with getting too complex for everyday users, become more ETL, than being about solving end-user problems.  I think we will need very specialized, niche implementations--much like we are seeing with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/baas.php">BaaS</a> and the emergence of specialized versions like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">BaaS for gaming</a>.  Very niche versions of ETL like <a title="SortMyBox" href="http://www.sortmybox.com/">SortMyBox</a> and <a href="http://wappwolf.com/dropboxautomator/">WapWolf Dropbox Automator</a>, which focus only on solving file management problem users are facing, will be successful, because they are easy for users to understand and put to work.
<p>I think there is an opportunity to quickly build the next generation ETL solutions that solve a set of automation, integration and interoperability problems for a niche audience using the simple icon based format we are seeing from providers like IFTT and <a title="Elastic.io" href="http://elastic.io/">Elastic.io</a>.  If you are considering building one of these new solutions, make sure and evaluate existing open source ETL solutions like:

</table>
<p>Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel, by rolling out your own ETL framework if at all possible.  This will allow you to focus on the specific acquire, transform and publish needs of your niche audience.  Even some of the new breed of providers are providing open source tools, like the <a href="https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki">Geekier project</a> from <a href="https://rules.io/">Rules.io</a>, so do your homework. Also consider putting existing API aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> to use, providing faster acquire and publish API connections with popular APIs, while also standardizing the objects across all platforms.
<p>I can envision video, photo, quantified-self and other niche services emerge that will empower any user to put APIs to use and acquire, transform and publish the valuable data, information and other content that are central to our increasingly fragmented online lives.  These new solutions will be framed in easy to understand terms that speak to specific audiences,  putting valuable API resources within reach of the masses.

<p>title: ‘Which BaaS Pricing Model Is Better?’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/baas-trends.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/trends/baas-trends.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;ve been processing a <a href="http://branch.com/b/apicalls-successtax">conversation over at Branch</a>, that was triggered by a story in TechCrunch by Sarah Perez(<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa">@sarahintampa</a>) called, &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/stackmob-ratchets-up-the-competition-makes-api-calls-free-launches-a-marketplace-for-third-party-mobile-services/">StackMob Ratchets Up The Competition: Makes API Calls Free, Launches A Marketplace For Third-Party Mobile Services</a>&rdquo;.
<p>There are several layers to the convSteersation, the part I&rsquo;m focusing on is about how BaaS providers are structuring their pricing, in which Sarah Perez writes:
<blockquote><em>StackMob is now making API calls free. This latter news will impact the competitive landscape, which includes startups like Parse, Kinvey and others, all of which have traditionally charged developers as API calls increase alongside an app&rsquo;s popularity.</em></blockquote>
<p>Making the argument that:
<blockquote><em>Today, developers have to have an understanding of how many API calls they make, and if an app becomes really successful, developers are penalized for that with increased pricing.</em></blockquote>
<p>Sarah quotes StackMob CEO Ty Amell, saying that:
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t really all that fair, explaining that it doesn&rsquo;t matter to StackMob how many API calls the app makes &ndash; the cost to them doesn&rsquo;t really go up. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to us whether someone&rsquo;s making a million API calls or 20 million API calls &ndash; the cost is fairly manageable on our parts. So we felt like this was a blocker to innovation on the developer&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;And we feel like API calls are starting to become a commodity, where it&rsquo;s really how can you provide value beyond that?&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The conversation immediately begins on Twitter, with:
<blockquote><strong>Steve <span>Gershnik</span>(<a href="https://twitter.com/StackMobSteve">@StackMobSteve</a>) of Stackmob</strong> - @stackmob doesn't charge for 'active users' either. No success tax for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Joe Chernov (<a href="https://twitter.com/jchernov">@jchernov</a>) of Kinvey </strong>- but you charge for features. In the end, everyone charges for something. It's business!</blockquote>
<p>After this, the conversation moves to Branch.  I&rsquo;m not including full comments, because there is a lot of banter back and forth, discussing various claims BaaS providers make, that I feel are irrelevant to the more important, pricing story.
<p>The conversation continues:
<blockquote><strong><strong>Joe Chernov (<a href="https://twitter.com/jchernov">@jchernov</a>)&nbsp;of Kinvey</strong>:</strong><br /> If a developer prefers to pay by number of users, our model may work for them; if someone would rather buy features, then StackMob may make more sense. It's all good. Everyone has their own twist on pricing. Vendors should strive to highlight their own value without misrepresenting others'. Fair?  Steve Gershnik (StackMob):<br /> We don't charge per user. We don't charge per API call. We think those are outdated and archaic pricing models.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Miko Matsumura (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a>) of Kii:</strong><br /> I respect what @StackMob is doing but in looking at their pricing page, isn't it just segmenting everyone into a free tier and a "custom" Enterprise tier?</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>)&nbsp;of 3Scale:</strong><br /> Which model is best in our experience depends a lot on what type of market you're serving - individual developers tend to like by the drop because (start cheaply and scale). Large companies tend to like predictability so they can budget properly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Box.net is a storage company - yet, for all their enterprise accounts storage is unlimited. Variable scared their customers. Instead they charge by number of seats/users - something their enterprise customers CAN predict.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Thinking more abstractly: If a developer is successful, there will be some sort of increase in volume. Unless the PAAS service is truly magical that means extra cost for the PAAS provider.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can call this a success tax, but in my view what matters is not if there is more cost to the developer but if the unit cost goes down over time. I.e. As I succeed, I'm happy to pay you a bit more as long as you are not getting an increasing %age of the pie (and ideally if the %age is decreasing). If that %age increases I'll most likely ditch you for someone who offers me better terms at that point.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>QuickBlox(<a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBlox">@QuickBlox</a>): </strong><br /> Our pricing model is per API calls as well, we do it like that because it is clear for developers (and for our business model), also allows to create apps and prototypes that, in case they are not successful, the developers won't be charged. according to @jchernov</blockquote>
<p>Only Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii and Quickblox are represented in the <a href="http://branch.com/b/apicalls-successtax">conversation on Branch</a>.  So I wanted to see how each of the 20 BaaS providers I&rsquo;m tracking on, structure their pricing:

</ul>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find pricing for five of the BaaS providers, because they are in beta, but pricing by API call is definitely the preferred way for the rest of them, with 11 of the 15 using this approach.  The rest of them charge based upon a mix of number of users, number of apps, data and file storage, push messages, and email messages.  With Stackmob going with pricing based upon feature, add-on or premium services, which can also be from 3rd party services via the <a href="https://marketplace.stackmob.com/">StackMob marketplace</a>.
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t think there is one approach to API or BaaS pricing.  Seems to me, that different models will work for different industries, companies and even at the application level.  But I wanted to document this conversation for my <a href="/trends/baas.php">larger research project around the BaaS space</a>--maybe I will have more opinions after I dive in deeper.
<p>Let me know what you think about BaaS pricing.

<p>There is an interesting <a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/02/01/instadm-brings-private-messaging-to-instagram/" target="_blank">post on the Parse blog</a> about <a href="http://insta.dm/" target="_blank">instaDM</a>, which is a service built using Parse, the <a href="/trends/baas.php" target="_blank">BaaS platform</a>, that provides private messaging in the Instagram ecosystem.
<p>This is a very interesting approach to externally developing features for another platform or service.  I think Parse says it well:
<blockquote><em>Even the hottest new apps, however, aren&rsquo;t perfect and that&rsquo;s where clever innovators can fill in the gaps with a great idea. Parse-powered instaDM is one such innovation.</em></blockquote>
<p>On one hand, this approach is a gamble.  All Instagram has to do is copy what you've done, put it in the roadmap, and your done. &nbsp;Finished.
<p>On the other hand, I think this is a very realistic way of pushing a platform forward, by external developers, using APIs.  If an API provider is smart, when you have someone in your ecosystem roll out a valuable feature like this, you invest in their success.
<p>Building features that augment web or mobile apps like this demonstrate that API ecosystems offer a lot potential for innovation, and I have to say it is even more interesting that this is being built on Parse--probably a whole other story in itself.
<p>I don&rsquo;t think every idea that comes out of Silicon Valley should be VC size. APIs allow more lots of smaller, more sustainable features to emerge, that don't need large scale investment. instaDM is an example of this potential.

<p>Salesforce talked a little bit about its <a href="https://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/02/new-eclipse-plugin-available-february-15th.html">strategy around the development and release strategy around the Salesforce Eclipse plug-in</a>. &nbsp;Providing a little transparency into how they stagger its API releases as well as waiting to release their <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> plug-in, until API release is complete.
<p>I&rsquo;m more interested in this story from an <a href="/buildingblocks/">API building block</a> perspective.  An eclipse plug-in seems like a building block for only the most mature APIs out there, and especially ones targeting the enterprise.  An eclipse plug-in is not for every API, but I think I will add it as a building block to consider.
<p>It also seems like something a 3rd party provider could step up and find success with as well, by building a single or suite of Eclipse plug-ins that provide integrated API developer tools across popular or high value web APIs for Eclipse users.
<p>I believe IDE plug-ins for APIs will be one way we can provide API discovery solutions for developers, by bringing valuable, qualified API resources into their development environments.

<p><a href="https://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/01/new-simplified-adwords-api-pricing.html" target="_blank">Google is adjusting their pricing model for the Adwords API</a>, acknowledging that having a free usage tier is important. &nbsp;Making the API easier to access, while also ensuring a certain QOS.
<p>Google has opted to go with two levels of API access:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Basic</strong> - Basic access is provided by default and allows up to 10,000 operations per day</li>
<li><strong>Standard</strong> - Standard access is available to qualified developers and has no daily limit on operations</li>
</ul>
<p>With both basic or standard access, there are no charges for <a href="https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/" target="_blank">AdWords API</a> usage.  Google is just looking to maintain quality over which developers can hammer on the API, while acknowledging a free tier allows for experimentation and innovation. &nbsp;All you have to do is apply to be part of the standard level, if you reach limits of basic tier.
<p>This is a good model for even a totally open data of free resource APIs.  While you want your data and resources to be open, you also want to be able to offer a certain quality of service, and keep infrastructure costs to a minimum.
<p>To do this, you will need to to secure the API interface to some degree.

<p>title: ‘Open By Default for New Generation of API Integrators’</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/platform-stability.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
<p>I did a <a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">presentation at the DC API Meetup</a>, when I was in Washington DC last week. My talk was some of my usual material around the history, business and politics of APIs, but included a section on trends, where I covered some of the newer aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, BaaS providers like <a href="https://parse.com">Parse</a> and automation tools like <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.
<p>At the end of the meetup, we did a QA panel session, and Javaun Moradi (<a href="https://twitter.com/javaun">@javau</a>n), product manager at NPR digital, made a great point about the reliability and stability of this new generation of third party platforms building aggregate, backend, automation or other types of providers who are in turn, dependent on other API providers.
<p>Javaun questioned the reliability of this new generation of startups, who are newly funded, most likely not yet profitable, dependent on other APIs, and are most likely going to be acquired later on down the road, or go out of business when funding runs out.  Javaun felt that established players like Salesforce and Google are here to stay, you know they aren&rsquo;t going anywhere--where a new startup has greater potential for service disruption and instability.
<p>If you are building your app, and depending on an aggregate API service like Singly, or backend as a service (BaaS) platform like <a href="http://cloudmine.me">Cloudmine</a> or reliant on a automation platform like <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, you want to know the company is going to be around in a year.  Right?
<p>In my opinion, the number one way these new breed of startups can alleviate these concerns, is by solving developer problems, delivering value (which every company I&rsquo;ve mentioned is doing) and have a clear business model. Success is the best solution, right?
<p>Another way these startups can instill confidence in the developers who are building apps around around their services is to also offer open source options.  By offering API aggregation, backend and automation as a cloud service, while also as open source download and fork, this new breed of providers can do a lot to build confidence and goodwill with potential users.
<p>Some good examples of this are:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a></strong> - Singly AppFabric empowers you to add social login, sharing and friend finding into your mobile and web applications, and <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">Singly Hallway</a> is the open source version to help developers build amazing applications combining data from many sources easily, through one API.</li>
<li><strong><a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">OpenKit</a></strong> - Open source, cross-platform backend services for game developers.  It will be available as client and server download on Github, and no mention if it will be a cloud service</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://rules.io/">Rules.io</a></strong> - Rules.io is a rules and segmentation engine with companion <a href="https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki">Geekier</a> which is part of the rules.io service as an open source framework</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just just a couple examples of how startups are emerging to provide a new approach to rapidly and efficiently building web and mobile apps across many APIs.  These platforms are all about delivering the resources developers need to efficiently build and manage web and mobile apps, without the overhead of rolling out the infrastructure on their own.  With an open option, if for any reason the startup should change or go away, app developers have the option to put the open codebase to use.
<p>This approach will not be for all startups, but with the neck breaking pace in which startups are born, evolve and die, and open by default approached bundled with a healthy as a service option, looks like a positive approach for platform providers, developers, end users and the overall business sector.
<p>As more providers emerge in this space, I hope they choose to adopt an open by default approach.

<p>title: ‘Deploy and Manage API on Amazon Web Services (AWS)’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aws-logo.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a>
<p>For the longest time I would get asked, "Which API service provider should I use to deploy my APIs?".  This was a tough question, because historically the API management providers don't help you deploy your APIs, they only help you manage them.
<p>Deploying your APIs was up to you.  Generally you already had some sort of internal system that you would use to generate RESTful interfaces or you'd go find your own open source API framework and deploy.  Then you'd proxy or connect your API to one of the API service providers.
<p><a href="https://www.3scale.net/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>These lines are now blurred by providers like <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/">Intel with their enterprise API gateway</a>, and through API deployment resources from <a href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a>.  3Scale is investing in open source server technology for <a href="https://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGINX</a>, and blueprints for API deployment using Amazon Web Services.
<p>3Scale recently published a quickstart tutorial on <a title="how to deploy an API on Amazon EC2 for Amazon Web Services" href="https://www.3scale.net/2013/02/quickstart-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-an-api-on-amazon-ec2-for-amazon-web-services-aws-rookies/">how to deploy an API on Amazon EC2 for Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS), and manage it using 3Scale API management.  My favorite part is that everything in this tutorial is completely FREE.  A critical element to experimenting with APIs.
<p>The 3Scale, AWS walk-though provides details for:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Creating and configuring EC2 Instance</li>
<li>Preparing Instance for Deployment</li>
<li>Deploying a demo API solution</li>
<li>Enabling API Management with 3Scale</li>
<li>Implementing an Nginx Proxy for Access Control</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several important things going on here, beyond being able to do this for free with an entry level AWS and 3Scale accounts.  But I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, the value of this being free and allowing you to explore, experiment and iterate with your API--without spending a fortune!  This is critical to not just your API initiative, but contributes to a more healthy API space in general.
<p>After being free, you are using proven open source technology like Ubuntu for server OS and NGINX for your web server.  <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/15/3scale-launches-open-source-api-proxy-build-on-ngnix/">3Scale has invested in tools for NGINX</a>, rather than building their own proprietary solutions, because NGINX has been proven to deliver at scale and has large community to support it.
<p><a href="https://wiki.nginx.org/Main" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/nginx/nginx-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>Third, with this solution, you retain control over your infrastructure.  You are deploying on the proven Amazon cloud (which I hope you are already using in other areas), and you are connecting to free API management services with the opportunity to buy premium services.  You are not proxying all your data and valuable API resources through a 3rd party proxy.  You are connecting to the API management services you need like rate limits, access controls and analytics without giving up control over your data and resources.
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do the <a href="https://www.3scale.net/2013/02/quickstart-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-an-api-on-amazon-ec2-for-amazon-web-services-aws-rookies/">3Scale API deployment tutorial</a>&nbsp;myself, so that I know the process inside and out, have my own AMIs ready to deploy on AWS, and be able to walk others through, when possible.

I Think It Was The Sound Of A Walrus</a>, on NPR this morning.  It is about the <a href="http://macaulaylibrary.org/" target="_blank">Macaulay Library</a>, which is:
<blockquote><em>...the world's largest and oldest scientific archive of biodiversity audio and video recordings.

<p>The library's collection has a total of more than 7,000 hours of sounds, the result of an 80-year collaboration between the scientific community and the library's volunteer collaborators.  An amazing resource!
<p>I couldn't help myself, and emailed them, to let them know a web API of the audio and video collection would be a great addition.  If developers could build web and mobile apps around the sounds, it would extend the reach of the catalog exponentially.
<p>Of course you'd do it in a way that adds value to the collection and <a title="protect it as a brand" href="/2013/01/29/protecting-your-brand-with-api-branding-guidelines/">protects it as a brand</a> and priceless asset.
<p>The digitizing of the <a href="http://macaulaylibrary.org/" target="_blank">Macaulay Library</a>, making it available online is a great example of the potential of open content, data and APIs.  Our world is full of rich resources like this, we just need to digitize and make accessible in sensible ways that make them available to the widest audience possible.

<p>title: ‘One API Discovery Definition to Rule Them All’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/discovery-exploration.jpg</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/discovery/discovery-exploration.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />
<p>When I talk about API discovery, in-person at events, or on my blog(s), I notice people automatically default to thinking I mean a universal API discovery language that will work for all web APIs.  I think the technologists that operate in the API space are always striving for technical perfection--resulting in the discussions that you see around REST, HATEOAS, OAuth and similarly for this one about API discovery.
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the passion and dedication of the technologists in this space, but when it comes to API discovery, I&rsquo;m <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> talking about a universal language or approach.  I personally just don&rsquo;t believe there can be one definition to rule them all.  When I reference API discovery, I&rsquo;m focusing on API discovery at the provider level, and providing information and resources that allow people who launch APIs to be successful.  I have no interest in defining or support a world-wide or industry level definition for API discovery.  I leave these conversations to all y'all tech pundits.
<p>I am a fan of supporting API providers to do something, anything! Sure, it should be a standardized as you feel necessary.  I hope you use something that is already in existence like <a title="WADL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">WADL</a>, <a title="Swagger" href="http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">I/O Docs</a> (don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel), and make sure and look at the <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">approach Google is taking with their API discovery service</a>--as they have some experience in the field.
<p><a href="http://swagger.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p>In reality though, your motivation to develop JSON or XML definitions for your API will probably be to provide interactive documentation or allow for easy generation of code libraries for your API--not discovery.  With the API discovery conversation automatically defaulting to a universal definition by the tech pundits, API providers will often avoid these discussions, leaving it a lower priority when planning and implementing an API.  Much like with HATEOAS, without concrete examples of value, API providers won&rsquo;t see value in providing JSON or XML definitions of their APIs.  Interactive docs and auto generation of code libraries are clear value propositions, and show potential for bringing discovery back to the forefront.
<p>Once you have API definitions for all of your API endpoints, its pretty easy to publish a single manifest of all of your APIs in a single JSON (or XML) file in the root of your developer area.  Sure I would love all of these definitions to be the same, but I prefer a more pragmatic approach and will accept whatever a API service provider deems suitable for their APIs, and with the resources they have available.
<p>If you think about how web page discovery came together in late 1990s with Yahoo, then solutions provided by Google, and even new approaches from providers like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>.  When it comes to API search and discovery, we are in circa 1997, if we compare it with web page discovery.  You have directories like ProgrammableWeb, but you also have newer vendors emerging like <a href="http://apihub.com">APIhub</a>, who potentially bring a new perspective to the table.
<p>Since APIs are about &ldquo;programmatic discovery&rdquo;, I think how developers discover API will vary, occuring via these directories and hubs, but also occur via their chosen PaaS platform like Drupal, Heroku, Salesforce or with BaaS providers like Parse or Kinvey--as well as popular IDEs like Eclipse who allow for plugins.
<p><a href="http://apihub.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/mulesoft/API-Hub-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
<p>It will up to PaaS, BaaS or other 3rd party platform providers to assemble resource stacks that are meaningful to their community.  They will do the legwork to find best of breed API resources, which will be made easier if API providers provider JSON or XML definitions of their API resources, but not a requirement.
<p>I believe that similar to website sitemaps, API discovery will have wider definitions that some follow, with successful vendor specific implementations as well, but ultimately it will remain largely imperfect and some API providers will do well, and others will implement poorly. &nbsp;The markets will decide! (<em>cringe</em>)
<p>My object is to help the average API provider hear stories of other successful approaches, and identify the benefits, in hopes that they will implement something, anything! &nbsp;Allowing us to take baby steps forward in API discovery, not defining one definition to rule them all and nobody giving a shit, and we don't move forward at all.

<p>Master API architect at <a title="Layer7 Technologies" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7 Technologies</a> Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund" target="_blank">@mamund</a>) has a great post this week on <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/blogs/index.php/four-tech-related-trends-that-will-shape-2013/" target="_blank">Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013</a>.
<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that <em>"individual service deployments on the Web will get smaller and more numerous"</em>--he clarifies it with:
<blockquote><em>Influenced by the existence of the many mobile apps running on a single device, Web-based services will become small, single-focused offerings that (in the words of Doug Mcllroy) &ldquo;do one thing and do it well.&rdquo; This will also explode the number of available services. The advantage of this trend will be an increase in the agility and evolvability of service offerings. The challenge will be an increased need for governance at the &ldquo;micro-service&rdquo; level.</em></blockquote>
<p>I have to agree.  I think the smaller we can break resources down, the better.  Agility is key in the API economy.  But as Mike points out it won't come without its new set of problems, like life cycle, governance and discovery.
<p>Much like web pages, I think we'll still try to estimate the number APIs available, but there will be so many, we will lose track in the near future.  But we'll find an organic approach to designing, deploying, managing, discovering and consuming web APIs that strikes a balance.

<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that "server mash-ups will increase but client mash-ups will decline"--he clarifies it with:
<blockquote><em>The increasing popularity of languages like Node.js, Erlang and Closure will make implementing server-side mash-ups more efficient and easier to maintain than doing the same work within a client application; especially for the mobile platform. This will reduce the &ldquo;chattiness&rdquo; of client-side applications and increase the security and flexibility of server-side implementations. The result will be a perceived increase in responsiveness and a reduced use of battery power on mobile apps.</em></blockquote>
<p>As with my earlier post, <a title="individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous" href="/2013/02/02/the-scientific-archive-of-biodiversity-audio-and-video-recordings-needs-an-api/">individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous</a>, I agree 100%.  This is where I&rsquo;m going with my post this week on <a title="Virtual API Stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>.  With so many individual resources available on the web, in the coming years we&rsquo;ll see increased &ldquo;mashing up&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo; of new stacks, that are meaningful to a particular app or group of developers.
<p>An example of this in the wild is&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, with their API aggregation or mashup, which is available as a service, but is also <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">available as open source on Github as Hallway</a>.  Another recent example is potentially the <a title="OpenKit Gaming BaaS" href="/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">OpenKit Gaming BaaS</a>, which promised to be an open stack designed for game developers.
<p>My predication is we&rsquo;ll see many more returns from server side API mashups, than we did during the client side mashup gold rush days! &nbsp;Especially if providers open source these stacks, while also offering as a service.

Which is the whole basis for my story except I use <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a href="http://temboo.com">Temboo</a> as examples.  All of these providers are in the same space in my opinion, I think maybe they are just referencing what they are familiar with (as John used to work at IFTTT).
<p>Second they read in that I&rsquo;m envisioning some grand discovery language?  Not sure where this comes from.  I&rsquo;m just referencing that API providers can provide JSON definitions of their APIs, which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> happening with specs like Swagger, but not being done for discovery but for interactive documentation and code stub generation--the fact it is there is a plus for discovery.  But I have zero visions of there every being a grand &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for discovery, but I feel you can't argue Swagger is picking up momentum.
<p>John and Steve also reference that I&rsquo;m calling for a &ldquo;standardized building blocks API providers can jump on?&rdquo;  Not sure where this comes from.  My arguement is that API will play almost no role in this process at all.  They won&rsquo;t give a shit or prepare in any way.  It will be 3rd party providers stepping up and building these abstracted platforms around existing API providers.  Something we are already seeing with Temboo, Singly and yes IFTTT and Zapier as well as BaaS providers like Kinvey, Parse, etc.
<p>Then at the part they start talking about "API providers do not want to be commoditized", they lose me and deviate from anything I&rsquo;m talking about.  I agree that API providers don&rsquo;t want to be reduced to commodities.  This is just one possible path, and would not be for every API provider or reduce their existing retail relationship with developers.  We see it already happening with <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/07/25/sendgrid-partners-heroku-engine-yard-cloudbees/">SendGrid partners with Heroku, Engine Yard, &amp; others on email management</a>, and <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2012/twilio-partners-windows-azure/">Twilio partners with Azure</a>.
<p>So SendGrid won't be commoditized on Heroku? &nbsp;Twilio won't be commoditzed on Azure?
<p>Google your favorite API by name and add partners with, you will see API providers do care about partnering and reselling themselves, which brings you very close to the commodities line when you resell at that level. &nbsp;What I'm suggesting could just be interpreted as reverse partnering, where a 3rd party platform integrates the API, rather than API seeking partnership--which we see with Singly, IFTT and Zapier, they don't ask for permission from every API provider.
<p>While I listened further, the rest of the conversation had nothing to do with my post.  I blame my storytelling, as I&rsquo;m always trying to perfect how i articulate my visions and obviously I didn&rsquo;t clearly get my point across.  Since it was my first exploratory post on this subject, I will keep trying, and trying.&nbsp;
<p>I also have to call them out a bit, cause I heard standard over and over in the podcast, about building blocks, API interfaces and API definitions.  But if you look at my post I never even used the word standard or standardizing or anything.  So I think you guys read something that wasn&rsquo;t there, cause I am the last API guy who believes in standardizing in the web API space.
<p>With that said, I fuck&rsquo;n love that you guys are doing this!  Makes me happy! &nbsp;Thanks John and Steve!

<p><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/world-bank/The-World-Bank-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
<p>I had the pleasure of being on stage with <span>Tim Herzog (</span><a rel="user" href="https://twitter.com/tgherzog" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>tgherzog</a><span>)</span>, a Open Data Specialist from the <a title="World Bank" href="http://worldbank.com">World Bank</a> yesterday at the <a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">DC API meetup  at NPR</a>.  During the QA panel, at the end of the meetup, a question came from the audience, stating that open data from government is often boring, and thus is the reason much of what we see built on government isn't that exciting--alluding that there has to be more high value, exciting data that isn't being released.
<p>While I agree that much of the data made available from open government initiatives is boring and stale, and there are probably much better datasets available, I also think this is more of a storytelling problem, than a data problem.  After the question was asked, I quickly answered by pointing to my left at Tim Herzog, and said the World Bank does an awesome job at this.
<p>If you look through the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank data catalog</a>, and spend time looking through their blog, you see a symbiotic relationship between their open data, APIs and the stories they tell on the blog.  This approach is similar to what I'm calling <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>, the only difference is I am hosting all my stories on Github as individual repositories.
<p>If you look at the home page of the World Bank data site today, there is a link to the blog post, "<a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-data-tell-us-about-debt-of-high-income-and-developing-countries">What does data tell us about debt of high income and developing countries?</a>"  This is a great example of not just providing a dataset, but actually telling the story around the data, while providing tools that let you interact with the data, making everything a very hands on experience--increasing the chances users will make an emotional connection with the data.
<p><a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-data-tell-us-about-debt-of-high-income-and-developing-countries" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/world-bank/World-Bank-Exernal-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a>
<p>According to the blog post, the World Bank maintains two quarterly databases of information on external and public sector debt of many countries. The blog post narrates what the statistical data from the <a href="http://worldbank.org/qeds">Quarterly External Debt Statistics</a> (QEDS) and the <a href="http://worldbank.org/qpsd">Public Sector Debt Statistics</a> (PSD) databases tell us about trends in debt levels of some high income and developing countries, while also providing us with links to the data sets and JavaScript charts (using <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com">Tableau Software</a>) we can play with, making the story an interactive, hands-on experience.
<p>This is <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>.  It isn't just data.  It isn't just an API.  There is a story, giving the data context and meaning.  There are tools to help me play with the data, understand its value, with a link to the raw data for when I'm ready to get down to business.
<p>I strongly believe that Hacker Storytelling is the solution to the boring data coming out of government, non-profit organizations and even in the private sector.  Hacker Storytelling is related to data journalism, but goes further, empowering anyone to publish a dataset and tell the story around it.  Not just journalists or programmers.
<p>We need more open source tools that allow anyone to gather, curate and publish data, while also being able to wrap it in a story and bundle with interactive visualizations and tools that encourage exploration, remixing and sharing of these important stories that have the potential to solve real problems we face every day around the globe.

<p><a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">A new player in the </a><a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space has emerged, from former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFeint">OpenFeint</a> co-founder Peter Relan--called <a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">OpenKit</a>. &nbsp;The new BaaS platform is targeting game developers, providing cross-platform tools for both iOS and Android. &nbsp;The core features of the gaming BaaS platform are:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Cloud data sync</strong> - Save game progress in the cloud with data storage. Sync it across both iOS and Android devices for a consistent gaming experience</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards</strong> - Drop-in leaderboard SDK's for both iOS and Android. Give your users the opportunity to compete against millions of other players</li>
<li><strong>Facebook &amp; Twitter auth </strong>- Users login with familiar third party social networks like Facebook and Twitter. No need to create and manage accounts. OpenKit handles it all</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform support </strong>- OpenKit supports both iOS and Android. Our native SDKs are lightweight and will take just a few minutes to integrate into your game</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenKit represents a trend I&rsquo;m tracking on where people are pulling together specialized or <a title="virtualized stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtualized stacks</a> targeting specific groups of developers.  Early movers in the space like Kinvey, Parse and Cloudmine have generally catered to all types of developers by providing them a backend stack, that assists them in rapidly building mobile and web apps. So naturally the next step is to see more specialized stacks, for smaller groups of developers.
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to see that OpenKit is completely <a href="https://github.com/openkit">open source, readily available on Github</a>, as well as comes out of the box with a REST API.  <a title="open source baas" href="/2012/08/28/open-source-mobile-backend-as-a-service/">Open source BaaS is something I was identifying was missing from the space</a>.
<p>I will add OpenKit to my <a title="baas trends" href="/trends/baas.php">trends section for Backend as a Service</a>, where I&rsquo;m tracking on the BaaS space, and will dive in deeper and compare it with some of the other offerings we are seeing emerge.

<p>title: ‘A Conversation About APIs in Washington DC’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/dcapi-1.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/dcapi-january/dcapi-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I came to Washington DC this week for meetings with a couple federal agencies and a handful of private companies who contract with our government--including a conversation last night at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/events/97891662/">DC API Meetup Group</a>, which met at NPR offices downtown.
<p>The API Meetup started with pizza, a healthy selection of beer and networking with around 50 API professionals and API curious from around the DC area.  I was able to meet about 15 folks I know online, but have never had the opportunity to connect with in real life.
<p>Ben Balter (<a rel="user" href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>BenBalter</a>), one of the Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) kicked off the conversation with a presentation of some of the cool API discovery, CSV to API, DB to API and various tool he's developed during his time as a innovation fellow.  I totally dig Ben's style, in making very small, but powerful open source tools that can make a real difference in how government opens up data via APIs.
<p>I was up next, giving a talk titled, "<a href="/talks/apidays/business-models/">From Web, to Programmable Web, to Programmable World</a>".  I wanted to give everyone a healthy dose on the history of APIs, some views on where we are currently, and where API are going with an introduction to concepts like aggregation and automation.  The talk is meant to be a 200K foot walkthrough of the API space, which also reflects all of the sections available on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">APIEvangelist.com</a>.
<p>Next up was Gray Brooks from the General Services Administration (GSA) who walked through some of the open data and API initiatives coming out of the federal government.  He is overseeing some very important aspects of the <a title="White House Digital Strategy" href="/federal_government.php">White House Digital Strategy</a>, and is the point person for the execution of the digital strategy across all federal agencies.
<p>After Gray talked, Tim Herzog (<a rel="user" href="https://twitter.com/tgherzog" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>tgherzog</a>) the Open Data Specialist at the World Bank walked us through what the <a title="World Bank" href="http://www.worldbank.com">World Bank</a> is doing with their open data initiatives, which APIs are at the core.  He discussed how they couldn't have delivered their open data platform in the time and budget, without making it driven by APIs.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/dcapi-january/dcapi-7.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>Last up was Javaun Moradi (<a rel="user" href="https://twitter.com/javaun" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>javaun</a>)&nbsp;of NPR, who walked us through some of the lessons learned from deploying and managing the NPR APIs.  His talk was full of nuggets of wisdom, including "Don't build an API unless it solves a user problem" and "We drink our own champagne, because we don't make dog food!".  I'm hoping to spend more time this spring, doing a deeper dive into the NPR approach and share those insights in blog posts and ultimately a white paper.
<p>We wrapped up with the presentations, grabbed another beer, ate some more pizza and networked a bit--then came back for a QA panel with everyone who presented, moderated by Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>) of O'Reilly Media.  Alex did an awesome job at making the panel a conversation with everyone in attendance, encouraging open questions from the audience on APIs.  Alex is extremely knowledgable on not just open data and APIs, but how Washington DC operates, there is no better person to moderate a panel in DC.
<p>The DC API Meetup Group is something I will be coming back regularly to attend and hopefully have the opportunity to present again.  They are looking for speakers and sponsors for future events, so if you have anything you'd like to share or make sure your company supports these valuable API conversations, you can contact Patrick Svenburg (<a href="https://twitter.com/svenburg">@svenburg</a>), Head of Business Development &amp; Partnering at <a title="APIphany" href="http://apiphany.com">Apiphany</a> and organizer of the DC API Meetup Group.

<p>title: ‘Protecting Your Brand With API Branding Guidelines’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/power-by–drk.png</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://developer.active.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/Active-Network/power-by--drk.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
<p>One of the top five concerns I hear from companies considering APIs is regarding losing control of their brand.  With APIs being about access to raw data and resources, companies immediately think that developers will extract the value, without any attribution or reference to the companies brand.
<p>Even with this being a major concern, I see many APIs implement very poor branding guidelines, giving developers zero direction regarding how to properly provide attribution. &nbsp;This is a missed opportunity to not just protect the API providers brand, but actually extend it and increase its value.
<p>With this in mind, I'm always on the lookout for good examples of API branding guidelines. &nbsp;One recent example I came across while monitoring my <a title="API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>, is from the <a title="Active Network" href="http://developer.active.com/">Active Network</a> which provides activity and outdoor content via their APIs.
<p>Active Network starts with a great explanation of why they provide <a title="branding guidelines" href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines">branding guidelines</a>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>At ACTIVE Network, we want you to be able to create fantastic applications with the ACTIVE Network APIs. At the same time, we don't want users to get confused about who is responsible for the data they are accessing, so we have some brand guidelines.</em>
<p>Next Active Network explains to developers why branding guidelines are important to their own users:
<p><a href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/Active-Network/Active-Branding-Guidelines.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The ACTIVE brand holds credibility in the mind of the customer.  It serves as a seal of approval giving customers the confidence to transact through a trusted source</li>
<li>As a consumer utility, ACTIVE.com&reg; captures and records registration activity providing people with a record of their personal registration history if they need it at a future date</li>
<li>Transacting for an ACTIVE powered activity, tells your customer who they need to call if they need help.  ACTIVE&rsquo;s standard of excellence provides customers with 24/7 support 365 days a year</li>
</ul>
<p>Active Network also provides details on how to properly use their companies name (which I followed in my story), what attribution is required, and a complete branding kit for download as a zip file--containing the following key assets:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Branding Guidelines in PDF Format</li>
<li>Icon Image</li>
<li>Powered by Logos</li>
<li>Register Now Buttons</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a title="Active Network Branding Guidelines" href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines">Active Network Branding Guidelines</a> is one of the better implementations I've come across.  It provides a nice overview, with all of the details and assets needed to execute properly.
<p>Even if you aren't concerned about your brand when it comes to your API, requiring some attribution from your developers will at least help you market and advertise your API, and potentially bring in new API consumers.

<p><a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/01/28/announcing-the-app-net-file-api/" target="_blank">App.net has just released a File API</a> to add to their messaging and communication stack, allowing any App.net account to natively store files via the social platform.
<p>Each App.net account will be given a 10GB file storage area, allowing applications to read and write files, that can be linked and embedded within App.net communications.
<p>This approach reminds me of what I&rsquo;m seeing within the <a title="backend as a service" href="/trends/baas.php">backend as a service (BaaS)</a> space with other common developer resources like user management, object storage and key-value stores.
<p>App.net is just making sure developers have the resources they will need to be successful building web and mobile apps with the App.net API--a similar motivation for BaaS providers as wel as other API providers.
<p>While many developers are fine with using multiple API providers to get what they need, I can see an opportunity to provide the essential resources developers will need within the primary API that they are building their app around.
<p>As essential API resources are further commoditized, it seems like an opportunity for private label BaaS resources to emerge.  File storage could become something that any API provider could offer alongside their own resources, without having to reinvent the wheel each time.
<p>Maybe such services already exist under other names, and I'm unaware of it, but it seems like a great opportunity for cloud providers to step up and offer private label, backend resources for API providers to integrate into their platforms.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/Virtualized-API-Stacks.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>Up until now we tend to think of APIs individually--we approach integration in terms of the Twilio API, Twitter API or the Facebook API.  But as the number of <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">public APIs has grown beyond 8K</a>, and an <a title="unknown amount of internal and partner APIs" href="/2013/01/24/estimating-the-number-of-non-public-apis/">unknown amount of internal and partner APIs</a> become available, we are seeing new patterns of <a title="aggregation" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregation</a> and <a title="interoperability" href="/trends/interoperability.php">interoperability</a> emerge from companies like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, but also seeing <a title="automation" href="/trends/automation.php">automation</a> be added into the mix by companies like <a title="Temboo" href="http://temboo.com">Temboo</a>, and entire backend stacks from providers like Parse.
<p>These new aggregated or backend stacks of API driven resources can be as general as object and key-value stores, user management and other developer commodities we see <a title="backend as a service" href="/trends/baas.php">backend as a service providers</a> (BaaS) bring to the table, or they can be very personal like the photos Singly is aggregating across Flickr, Facebook and Instagram and with friends and followers across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
<p>As I see these new aggregate and BaaS providers emerge, at an ever increasing pace, I can&rsquo;t help but think--this still isn&rsquo;t fast enough (its my nature, you should try being me).  If I want common mobile developer resources I can adopt one of these new BaaS platforms like <a href="http://kinvey.com">Kinvey</a> or <a title="Parse" href="https://parse.com">Parse</a>, or if I need personal and social resources, which have <a title="fabric of mobile and web apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/11/13/the-api-fabric-for-next-generation-of-apps/">become part of the fabric of web and mobile apps</a>, I can go to Singly.  But what if I want a more specialized network, say just for <a title="education" href="http://hackeducation.com">education</a>?  I might need user management, object storage, key-value storage, access to commons social tools like friends and photos across multiple social networks, but I also need access to open courseware, teacher and student directories all via a very secure, auditable, efficient stack tailored just for K-12?  I will have to wait, for the next wave of startups to emerge.
<p>While in NYC on Friday I had a great discussion with Temboo about virtualization.  Not just the virtualization we&rsquo;ve come to depend on with cloud computing--which is the virtualization of compute, storage, and database resources, but the <a title="virtualization of network resources" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_virtualization">virtualization of network resources</a> and <a title="software defined networking" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking">software defined networking</a>.  Companies like <a href="http://nicira.com/">Nicira</a>, <a href="http://www.pluribusnetworks.com/">Pluribus Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.anutanetworks.com/">Anuta Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.aristanetworks.com/en/solutions/network-virtualization">Arista</a>, <a href="http://www.vyatta.com/solutions/virtual">and Vyatta</a> are emerging with new products that are allowing the virtualization of networking resource into new and meaningful network stacks for any possible implementation that you can imagine.
<p>After these conversation with the Temboo team, over the weekend I continued to think about the potential of virtualized API stacks.  Why can&rsquo;t I assemble my own API stack?  Why do I have to go to each API individually, or wait for new Singlys' to emerge in other verticals?  Why can&rsquo;t I assemble Parse, Singly, Twilio, Schoology, SendGrid into a virtualized API stack that provides not just ease of use, but the security I need to deploy a backend tailored just for K-12 education?
<p>In this vision of the future, API providers could focus on what they do best, and not worry about every use case out there.  Providers like Singly, Temboo, Parse can build abstracted layers on top of this. With this abstraction I wouldn&rsquo;t be limited to just the friends and followers features on Twitter or Facebook, I could take advantage of the next generation of friend discovery tools like what Singly is delivering--in addition to the value of individual API providers.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/trends/interoperability-trends.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>With a virtualized approach, I could build the stack that is most meaningful for my internal, partner or public developers and if one piece of my stack is proving unreliable, I can replace it with another.  APIs resources would be further commoditized, required to provide JSON definitions of their interfaces (or die a quick death), which virtual API stack platforms could use to discover and offer API resources.  <a title="API Ranking" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API ranking</a> algorithms would emerge allowing anyone to make sure they were discovering, selecting and using the best of breed API resources in the areas that matter for any vertical.
<p>With a virtualized API stack I could launch any specialized set of resources that I desired from the best of breed providers out there.  I could blend private and public resources together and in return offer them for use in private or public environments, further blurring the lines of what is an API and how they are consumed.
<p>As we see APIs continue to become a driving force in government, healthcare and education and bridge the online and physical worlds via our <a title="automobiles" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/automobiles.php">automobiles</a>, homes, <a title="buildings" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/buildings.php">buildings</a> and further grow within healthcare via the <a title="quanitfied self" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/quantified-self.php">quantified self</a>, potentially <a title="disrupt manufacturing with 3D printing" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/3d-printing.php">disrupt manufacturing with 3D printing</a> and drive everything around us with the <a title="internet of things" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/internet-of-things.php">internet of things</a>--the manual assembling of individual or even aggregated API stacks won&rsquo;t be enough.  We will need the ability to virtualize APIs stacks for any purpose within hours, not months or years.

<p>API ecosystems are all about research &amp; development, and an opportunity for incubating ideas and apps in a way that invites 3rd party developers and companies to develop innovative ways of using your company assets and resources.  I&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">incubation within an API ecosystem before,</a>&nbsp;and how companies are not just identifying developer talent and the best apps, but actually investing in companies via their API.
<p>A new example of this in action is Nike's&nbsp;launch of their&nbsp;<a href="http://nikeaccelerator.com/index.html" target="_blank">Nike+ Accelerator</a>--a partnership with <a title="Techstars" href="http://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a> that will host 10 companies for a three-month, immersive, mentor-driven startup accelerator designed to spur development on the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.nike.com/">NikeFuel, the Nike+ FuelBand, and Nike+ Running API platform</a>.
<p>The 10 partner companies will be given the following:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>$20,000</li>
<li>Access to the Nike+ APIs, Nike+ mobile SDKs, and Nike+ FuelBand Dev Kit (Beta) - you will be among the first in the world to receive this access</li>
<li>A Nike+ FuelBand for each team member</li>
<li>Tech support from experienced developers who've built companies, or built with Nike+ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</li>
<li>Code and solution reviews during the program</li>
<li>Mentor sessions with Nike executives and leaders in the start-up community</li>
<li>Two Investor Demo Days: one at the Nike World Headquarters and one in Silicon Valley</li>
<li>Real Access to Decision Makers</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/reeses-peanut-butter-cup.jpeg" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
<p>Then, at the end of the Nike+ Accelerator, each team will present to Nike executives, mentors, angel investors, venture capitalists, and tech industry leaders.
<p>As an API publisher have you considered a built-in accelerator or incubation program within your API ecosystem?  And while I&rsquo;m at it, has your incubator or accelerator consider a partnership program tailored for API publishers?
<p>Sounds kind of like a Reese's Peanut Butter commercial! :)

<p>I just added a new feature to the right hand menu, for the podcast <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>, a podcast about APIs and the cloud from John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) and Steve Marx (<a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>).
<p>I&rsquo;m big podcast fan, and I"m always looking for something I can listen to in the background while I&rsquo;m coding or writing stories. &nbsp;Traffic and Weather is great for this.
<p>The podcast dives into various topics ranging from Webhooks to oAuth, but keeps things light, where I think even non-technical folks can get up to speed on the latest in the space.  John and Steve make things very informative, while being friendly and keeping it conversational.
<p>I added a widget to my right hand menu, which will always pull the latest episode from Traffic and Weather.  You can also click on the logo to go directly to their site.
<p>Enjoy!

<p>title: ‘The Next Generation of API Discovery’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Tag-Cloud-API-Discovery.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/Tag-Cloud-API-Discovery.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>For the last seven years, when you wanted to find an API you went to <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.  It has been the definitive way to discover new APIs, and responsible for all the buzz in the space that has gotten the industry to where it is.
<p>Now that <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb is at 8400 APIs in its directory</a>, and adding 50-100 each week, it will continue to get even more difficult to discover APIs.  Even for someone like me who has looked at thousands of APIs, it can be very difficult and time consuming to find the API or APIs you are looking for.
<p>In 2013 there are even more ways to find APIs, new approaches that are looking to define the next generation of API discovery and consumption.  Currently I&rsquo;m tracking on 4 API directories in addition to ProgrammableWeb:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="APihub" href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a></strong> - APIhub is the best way to publish, discover and consume APIs. Search our database or browse through our most popular APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="APIs.io" href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a></strong> - APIS.io is an open source and free API registry service that allows developers to publish and discover REST APIs and interact with them online</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.exiconglobal.com/api-dir/">Exicon API Directory</a></strong> - Exicon helps marketers and enterprises find qualified developers through our online platform and advisory services</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mashape" href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a></strong> - Mashape provides a world-class marketplace to manage, distribute and consume both private and public APIs by developers from all over the world</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs.io and Exicon have the least amount of APIs available, but both Mashape and APIhub are currently leading, with Mashape possessing over 1500 and APIhub has over 13,000 APIs available.
<p>In addition to providing the ability to search APIs and browse by category, these new generation of API directories are providing sophisticated tools like interactive documentation, code samples and ways to follow, share, like--providing social interactions for API developers with API publishers.
<p>Beyond these new bells and whistles, what&rsquo;s next for API discovery?  To make developers lives easier they need programmatic ways to discover and understand APIs, as well as some sort of ranking to tell which are good and which are bad APIs.
<p>To provide interactive documentation, these directories posses JSON definitions of each API interface, using formats such as <a title="Swagger" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">Swagger</a> from Wordnik, which opens up the door for more sophisticated discovery in a programmatic way, and potentially directly from within your IDE.
<p>With the  data from the sharing, liking, following, page views and other signals generated via these API directories, there is a potential to develop some sort of ranking.  But we need more data signals from the space to truly develop a meaningful ranking.  I&rsquo;ve developed <a title="API Ranking" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">my own API ranking</a> to help me discover which APIs are trending based upon internal and external signals, allowing me to establish my <a href="http://apistack.com">API Stack</a>.  But its not enough either.  We need a lot more to be able to establish a meaningful way to rank APIs, that truly benefits developer efforts.
<p>As we are switching from showcasing the quantity of APIs, to better understanding the value and quality of APIs, we are going to need a new breed of directories.  I&rsquo;m excited by what I&rsquo;m seeing from these new API directories, and hopeful for what is coming 2013.
<p>Disclosure:  Both ProgrammableWeb and APIhub are API Evangelist partners.

<p>Google is migrating samples and tools for App Engine, BigQuery, Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage to a new Github account, they are calling the <a title="Google Cloud Platform" href="https://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/01/find-sample-code-and-more-for-google.html">Google Cloud Platform</a>.
<p><a href="https://github.com/googlecloudplatform">Google is going all in with its use of Github</a>, something I'm encouraging API owners to do.  They are working to manage all of their essential API tools there like their start projects, which show developers how to get started with Google APIs as well as other helper tools like the OAuth 2.0 Helper, that helps developers be successful.
<p>Github provides a lot of benefit beyond the obvious aspect of open sourcing your code.  Google is actively engaging with developers using Github alongside all of these open source projects.  If you think about it, this offers a more compelling way to engage with API developers beyond forums.  On forums you end up with a lot of general, sometimes senseless questions--Github anchors questions or issues and pull requests around actual code libraries, SDKs, starter kits and other integration areas.
<p>Github provides potentially more meaningful actions to occur between you and your developer community, beyond making code more accessible and openly licensed.  It is good to see Google going this route.

<hr />

<p><a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/sdk-bridge/SDKBridge-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p><em>This post comes from the&nbsp;<a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a>&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.</em>
<p>ProgrammableWeb is known for publishing the number of public APIs in its directory, and they regularly present an impressive&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r-l-utikkyk-hdhyyhjli-j/" target="_blank">graph</a>&nbsp;that shows how this number has increased exponentially over time. However, not all APIs are public, and ProgrammableWeb is not able to obtain information on how many non-public APIs exist.
<p>SDK Bridge writes API documentation as a service, and many of our customers have us document their non-public APIs. That puts us in a unique position to be able to estimate what percentage of APIs is public compared to non-public.
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>What exactly is a non-public API? For the purposes of this article, let's define a few terms.
<p><strong>Public API.</strong>&nbsp;A public API is an API where the documentation is freely available on the Web. Using the API may require registering and paying a fee.
<p><strong>Partner API.</strong>&nbsp;A partner API is an API where the documentation is not made available to the public, but is made available to select companies who have some kind of partnership agreement with the API provider. Typically the documentation is accessible through a password-protected website.
<p><strong>Internal API.</strong>&nbsp;An internal API is an API that is only used by developers who work for the company that provides the API. Typically the documentation is available only on an internal website.
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Since its inception in 2008, SDK Bridge has written documentation for 23 web APIs. (Web APIs are only a portion of the writing that we do for software professionals. We also write SDK documentation, IT documentation, and training curricula, as well as create video tutorials for developers.) Of these APIs, 12 were public, 9 were partner, and 2 were internal. The following pie chart shows the breakdown:
<table style="padding-left: 200px;" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="bottom"><img src="https://i6.createsend1.com/ei/r/97/AC3/A0A/061035/nonpublicapipie.png" alt="" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Web API documentation by type.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For the non-public APIs (partner and internal), it's interesting to note that 82% were RESTful and 18% were SOAP APIs. Also, 91% supported XML formats and 18% supported JSON formats. This suggests that non-public APIs have mostly made the transition from SOAP to REST, but have largely not made a transition from XML to JSON.
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Our data analysis indicates that roughly half of web APIs are not public. Two factors to consider:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The sample size is still fairly small. As time goes on and we get a larger sample size, we will improve the accuracy.</li>
<li>Companies may be less inclined to hire outside writers for non-public APIs than for public APIs. This means that our data could easily result in an underestimation of non-public APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for now, if you are looking for a rough estimation of the total number of APIs, you can take the number published by ProgrammableWeb and double it.

<p>There are <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/01/23/google-releases-new-government-surveillance-data-facebook-stays-mum/">stories on other blogs that state Facebook and other platforms should follow Google's lead with transparency reports</a> of their own.  I agree.  We will never see our government mandate industry leaders to do this, so us people have to lobby corporations to follow Google's lead.
<p>I see this type of transparency being critical to any company claiming they have an "open platform" or "open APIs".  I will be adding transparency report to my list of <a title="legal building blocks for API owners" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">legal building blocks for all API owners</a>.
<p>As more and more of our world, economy and daily lives moves online and are transmitted via APIs, investigations by our legal system and government are only going to grow.  We need to establish a way to report on these inquiries in real-time and in an open way like Google has been doing for two years now.

<p>I love to write.  My girlfriend has really help me kindle this passion.  Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/">@audreywatters</a>.
<p>After 2.5 years of telling stories on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a>, I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at organizing my ideas, and putting out stories that showcase the best (and worst) from the Business of APIs.  I&rsquo;ve gotten so efficient at it in 2012, I even launched <a href="http://apievoice.com/">API Voice</a> which is dedicated to the politics of APIs, <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a> which is dedicated to top APIs and <a href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hack Weekends</a> which is all about hackathons.
<p>When I meet people in the real world, I often hear, &ldquo;You sure blog a lot, I see like 5 posts a day coming from you!&rdquo;  I do write a lot, but it comes in waves.  I tend to write a lot of stories all at once, pumping out 15-20 pieces and then I trickle them out across the appropriate domain over the next couple days.
<p>In 2013, I&rsquo;m going to get even more efficient with my storytelling, with an evolved approach I&rsquo;m calling <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/">Hacker Storytelling</a>.
<p>The process is based upon dwhat I already do, but uses a new blend of:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Pages</strong> - HTML, CSS and text that frames a site, project or research</li>
<li><strong>Blogs</strong> - Chronological blog posts that walk through a project or research</li>
<li><strong>Presentations</strong> - Deck.js presentations that walk through a project or research</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - JSON, XML or database stores that drive the essence of a story</li>
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Simple, data and representations derived from APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I use these formats to tell stories across my blog, but in 2012 I learned some new techniques with existing and new technology that &nbsp;I have discovered, and will be employing a series of technologies that help me better deliver stories:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Github Pages</strong></a> - A quick, easy and lightweight way to host websites on Github allowing anyone to build site with HTML, CSS and Javascript.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme" target="_blank"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> - Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website.</li>
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mustache Templates</strong></a> - A simple way to render structured data from JSON files, using basic HTML templates for displaying--instead of pulling directly from database.</li>
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Deck.js</strong></a> - A JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations. deck.js is flexible enough to let advanced CSS and JavaScript authors craft highly customized decks, but also provides templates and themes for the HTML novice to build a standard slideshow.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default all of my projects start as a Github repository with a base Github Pages + Jekyll implementation I&rsquo;ve setup for my API Evangelist brand.   This will force me to be open and transparent by default.  I know this reality isn&rsquo;t meant for everyone, but for me, I hate seeing many of my projects never leave the firewall and end up being deleted from an Amazon EC2 instance in the dungeon of my IT network.
<p>All my projects will become <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> projects.  Some will have a single page, while others will have blogs, presentations and simple or complex data driven tools that help support the story.
<p>Currently I have four projects who live in this new format and are hosted entirely on Github:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a></li>
<li><a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com">Hack Weekends</a></li>
<li><a title="Hack Weekends Guide" href="http://guide.hackweekends.com">Hack Weekends Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://digitalstrategy.apievangelist.com">Digital Strategy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to be open by default, when it comes to content and data and make sure I share all of my ideas, in the widest and most shareable and remixable way possible.  My objective during my time on earth is to tell stories and write code that will make change, no matter how small.
<p>I believe that <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> will help me do this!  I hope it will help you too!

<p>Google has an <a href="https://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/01/join-google-drive-sdk-early-access.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GoogleAppsDeveloperBlog+%28Google+Apps+Developer+Blog%29">SDK early access program setup for the Google Drive platform</a>, and&nbsp;is inviting a select group of dedicated Google Drive developers to join the program. Giving them access to upcoming Google Drive SDK features and the opportunity to provide feedback.
<p>Google isn't accepting everyone--they will be screening applicants based upon the type and quality of the application, number of users, and ability to implement and provide feedback on new features as they're made available.
<p>An early access program seems like a good idea for API owners.  It gives you the chance to test out your alpha and beta APIs, client libraries, SDK's with a controlled audience, before you release them out into the wild.
<p>With the number of developers Google has, I don't think it will be a problem getting developers to sign up.  But it seems like something you could even pay developers for, if you have a shortage of good developers in your API ecosystem.
<p>An early access program fits right into earlier stories I've done on <a title="possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/10/24/incentivize-your-api-developers-to-contribute-with-lower-pricing/index.php">possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems</a>.

<p>WSO2's <a title="open source API management platform" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager">open source API management platform</a> for creating, managing, consuming and monitoring APIs, now has the ability to track API usage through Google Analytics.
<p>Since APIs are deployed using HTTP, the same transport we are using for websites, it makes sense that we should be able to see statistics for both our websites and APIs, side-by-side using Google Analytics.
<p>After creating a new profile for your API in Google Analytics you can put the tracking code into your WSO2 API Management interface and begin seeing real-time or standard (24 hour) reporting on API traffic in the Google Analytics interface.
<p>Since Google Analytics has an API and widgets, you will be able to use this data easily in other reports or system integrations that may need access to your API usage data.
<p>It is great to see innovation around API analytics and reporting, beyond the standard dashboards we've seen from most providers. I'd like to see more stories and scripts to help automate <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">API reporting using Google Analytics</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/23/api-ecosystem-tracking-with-statsd-and-graphite/">StatsD and Graphite</a> or platforms like <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a>.

<p>It is 30 days until the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in New York City</a>,&nbsp;February 21st and 22nd, and the event is now sold out!
<p>The event will be a 275 person conference focused on discussing the API industry.
<p>Since the event was postponed after Hurricane Sandy, the demand to get in and speak was overwhelming and conference tickets didn&rsquo;t last long either.
<p>We were able to keep almost all the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php">original session lineup</a> while make a couple changes and squeezing in a couple new speakers, where possible.
<p>I am really pleased with how the event has come together.  We have an amazing lineup and from looking at the attendee list, it looks like it will be a diverse groups of folks in attendance, discussing APIs.
<p>I look forward to seeing you all in New York!

<p>It has been a while since I provided an update on the White House Digital Strategy. &nbsp;I <a href="/federal_government.php">monitor the progress of federal agencies participation programmatically</a>, using JSON reports published by each agency at the agencies domain, /digitalstrategy.
<p>After running the script today, I notice 20 federal agencies with active footprints. &nbsp;There are about five more, but there are issues with the JSON version of their digital stratgies--I really want to focus on the programmatic value. So, across these 20 agencies I find 76 data API initiatives&nbsp;and 75 mobile API projects.
<p>To bring you up to speed, there are two specific milestones in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government Strategy</a> that specifically address API deployment:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>2.2 (Data) -</strong> Make high-value data and content in at least existing two major customer-facing systems available through web APIs, apply metadata tagging and publish a plan to transition additional high-value systems</li>
<li><strong>7.2 (Mobile) -</strong> Optimize at least two existing priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for improving additional existing services&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To help shed light on where these progressive agencies are going with both their data and mobile intiatives I wanted to break them out into separate groups, for each agency.

<p><a title="BaaS" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service</a> (BaaS), sometimes called Mobile Backend is a Service (MBaaS) is a growing trend I&rsquo;m monitoring at API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 providers in the space, with two newly added open-source BaaS platforms.
<p>Beyond the research, stories and analysis on BaaS, I just added a <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013/01/18/new-panel-at-apistrat-backend-as-a-service/">BaaS panel at the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference in New York City, February 21st and 22nd</a>.

<p>API play a critical role in BaaS platforms by providing interfaces for the common services emerging in the BaaS space, like object storage, user management and location, to name a few, but also bring in other 3rd party services like Twitter and Facebook.
<p>I will be moderating this new BaaS panel at APIStrat. Let me know if there are any questions about the space, you&rsquo;d like me to ask.

<p>title: ‘Moving From API Area to API Stack’</p>

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/API-Stack-Colored.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-stack/API-Stack-Colored.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>Finding APIs that compliment your API, and talking about the mutual benefits is nothing new.  When I worked with the <a href="http://mimeo.com">print API Mimeo</a>, I would write code that used Mimeo API in conjunction with <a title="Box API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=91">Box API</a> or <a href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=223">Dropbox API</a>.  Mashing up or bundling your APIs with other complimentary service can really help, when you are trying to explain the value your API delivers.
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to see patterns of even deeper integration and partnerships between APIs emerge--where one API provider will resell the API of another provider. &nbsp;APIs partnering with other APIs isn&rsquo;t that new, but reselling of each others API services to their developers is a fairly new concept, providing a potential new wholesale channel for API providers.
<p>One recent example of this is in a recent <a title="partnership between Singly and Cloudmine" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/11/12/teaming-up-with-cloudmine-for-backend-superpowers/">partnership between Singly and Cloudmine</a>.  Cloudmine is a <a title="BaaS Provider" href="/trends/baas.php">BaaS provider</a>, and Singly is provider of personal and social data via <a title="aggregate APIs" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregate APIs</a>. With the reseller approach, Cloudmine developers get a vastly improved stack to develop against, with <a href="https://cloudmine.me/">Cloudmine</a> providing all the essential BaaS tools developers are growing accustomed to, while also having access to 30+ social, personal and other aggregate API services provide by <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.
<p>The goal of this new approach is to provide developers with the most meaningful stack possible, in a single developer area.   A <a href="http://www.mogreet.com/">MMS API provider like Mogreet</a> could in theory, to better serve their developers, bundle image APIs like Flickr, Instagram and Facebook from Singly into their API area--providing a more robust stack to their developers who are building media enabled mobile apps.
<p>Now developers don&rsquo;t have to traverse to each API area on their own.  APIs can mashup, bundle and develop a stack, which includes their own APIs, but might also have APIs from potentially several other API providers. &nbsp; Obviously there are lots of details to work out around authentication, pricing, etc., but the potential is obvious.
<p>I&rsquo;m also talking with a linguistics API provider in Europe, and learning more about their partner program, which would allow for 3rd party API providers to submit APIs and sell alongside their own linguistics API. &nbsp;Opening up their API stack for new opportunities and innovation from 3rd party linguistics API providers--in languages, formats they wouldn't have resources to do themselves.
<p>As the number of APIs are growing, and we are seeing APIs aggregate via providers like Singly and through BaaS providers like Cloudmine, I think we&rsquo;ll see individual APIs become more portable, allowing them to be assembled into meaningful API stacks for developers. &nbsp;

<p>title: ‘Markdown APIs and Future of Reporting on Data’</p>

<hr />

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/markdown-icon.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>I just posted a story on <a title="how I like the Guardian&rsquo;s approach to data journalism" href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/17/the-guardian-is-brilliant-in-supporting-relevant-events-with-open-data/">how I like the Guardian&rsquo;s approach to data journalism</a>, and spending time evolving on last nights <a title="Markup APIs" href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">thoughts about the possibilities of Markup APIs</a>.
<p>As I&rsquo;m <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/02/all-side-projects-are-now-hosted-on-github/">migrating much of the front-end of my websites to run on a home brew of Github Pages, Jekyll and JSON fueled Mustache Templates</a>, I am seeing more of the potential of not just Markup APIs, but Markdown APIs that will run in a purely client side environment.
<p>Imagine if I could go to a provider like the Guardian, US Census or other high value data provider, grab a link to a Markdown API JavaScript file that is relevant to a story or report you are working on. &nbsp;With this Markdown API I would be given a whole dictionary of markdown you could use.
<p>An example would be, that when I wanted the 2010 population for New York City, I could just write [population|New York|NY|US|2010], or something like that and would print out the actual population for that year in NYC, with a link to the source.  Each time I used a markdown API it would add some sort of attribution to the source at the bottom of document.
<p>Seems like we&rsquo;d establish trusted, centralized sources of information, allowing anyone (even non-developers) to put open data and APIs to use via easy to implement markup or markdown APIs.
<p>Think of the potential if facts around the web actually had the backing of trusted sources, and were able to be embedded anywhere on the web, via apps or digital documents.
<p>It would be fun to create a markup and markdown API for API Evangelist, with a dictionary of terms, facts and other data that were relevant to the API industry.

<p>title: ‘API Management Platform Emergent One Launches Free Tier’</p>

<p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/emergent-one-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
<p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a>, one of the newest <a href="/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/" target="_blank">API management players</a> on the block, just announced a new free development tier.
<p>The Emergent One platform provides simple, cloud-based tools for connecting to your MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and quickly generating an API from your database.
<p>I didn&rsquo;t sign up for their service when they first launched, because they didn&rsquo;t have a free tier, and I&rsquo;m unwilling to put in credit cards and commit to brand new services. This is something I have problem with from running development and IT teams who use a wide variety of cloud services.  I would spend a great deal of time each month chasing down charges and other issues from cloud services that were being experimented with.
<p>The Emergent One approach to deploying APIs from common data sources, is one I think will resonate with users who aren&rsquo;t developers, but understand the importance of APIs, and are often restrained by unresponsive, limited or no IT resources.
<p><a href="https://emergentapi.com/cp/register?type=internal" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/emergent-one/Emergent-One-Get-Started.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>Emergent One one is responding to user requests for a cheaper tier that support entry level API users, which will allow them to tweak their API strategies before spending money.  This is something I think is mandatory for all API service providers, something <a href="https://3scale.net/">3Scale</a> were the first movers on, and we have seen <a href="https://apigee.com/about/pricing">Apigee</a> implement recently, as well as&nbsp;<a href="/serviceproviders/layer_7_technologies.php" target="_blank">Layer7</a> with their <a href="http://www.apify.co/" target="_blank">Apify</a>.
<p>I notice that in the email announcement of the 100% free tier, it encourages me to build new APIs at no cost, <strong><em>&ldquo;until launch&rdquo;</em></strong>.  I hope Emergent One will agree that a entry level pricing tier is not critical for users to get to know Emergent One, but essential for educating the masses about the value of APIs--allowing them to experiment. So le'ts please make sure it isn&rsquo;t only until launch.
<p>I&rsquo;m setting up some APIs, directly from one of my Amazon RDS instances. &nbsp; I'll let you know when ready.

<p>title: ‘An MMS API For The Next Generation of Mobile Apps’</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://developer.mogreet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/mogreet/mogreet-logo.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a>
<p>I am a big fan of APIs that do one thing and do it well, like <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>.  I had lunch with the team from a similar API yesterday, called <a title="Mogreet" href="https://developer.mogreet.com/">Mogreet</a>.
<p><a title="Mogree API" href="https://developer.mogreet.com/">The Mogreet API</a> lets you send and receive text or multimedia messages and use the platform to transcode, host and send video, audio and images for your web or mobile application.
<p>When you think of the popularity of Instagram, the rebirth of Flickr and the ubiquitous value of photos and images online, it just makes sense that MMS is going to play a critical role in mobile app development in 2013.
<p>I have a daughter, who sometimes responds to my SMS, email, chats and facebook messages.  Her attention span doesn&rsquo;t include always responding to her dad in "his" preferred formats. While she was visiting lately I sat on couch and watched her interact with friends and use her iPhone.   I noticed she communicated mostly in photos.
<p><a href="https://developer.mogreet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/mogreet/mogreet-api-mms.png" alt="" /></a>
<p>She communicates by taking photos and sending them, tweaking or distorting them and writing messages before sending, and spent a lot of time surfing and sharing silly photos from around the web--all in a social way via her smart phone.
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words.  I'm not good at math, but that seems 6x more valuable than a Tweet.
<p>When you start thinking about which killer features will emerge in our mobile apps this year, I&rsquo;m sure the majority will depend on photos or videos, making MMS a pretty critical API resources to have in your developers toolbox.
<p>After taking a look at Mogreet, I predict we will see them fueling the next crop of meaningful mobile apps, much like Twilio has done for the last two years.

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/scripting-platforms/markup-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>Over the holidays I added a <a title="new section to API Evangelist called trends" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">new section to API Evangelist called "trends</a>".  One of the areas I&rsquo;m tracking on is what I&rsquo;m calling &ldquo;<a href="/trends/scripting-platforms.php">scripting platforms</a>&rdquo;.  While you can program against any API using the language of your choice, these platforms are aggregating APIs and make available through a custom language stack.
<p>This approach is different than what I&rsquo;m seeing from <a title="aggregate APIs" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregate APIs</a> like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.  Scripting platforms may offer aggregate APIs, but are also providing a way to easily script against them, in new and abstracted ways.  I&rsquo;m <a href="/2012/12/19/taking-apis-to-next-level-with-api-scripting-platforms/">still trying to understand each company</a>, as well as the nuances between each approach--so stay tuned.
<p>In the last couple weeks, I&rsquo;m seeing a possible new approach to programming against APIs come into focus, one that is using HTML instead of scripting--using Markup APIs.
<p>After reading <a title="Building Bridges Between GUIs and Code With Markup APIs" href="http://www.toolness.com/wp/2013/01/building-bridges-between-guis-and-code-with-markup-apis/">Building Bridges Between GUIs and Code With Markup APIs</a> by Atul Varma (<a href="https://twitter.com/toolness">@toolness</a>) from Mozilla, you can really start seeing not just the potential around rich media and content like Mozilla is with its <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/">Webmaker platform</a>, but deliver any API resource in abstracted, simplified markup anyone can put to use--without knowing programming.
<p>Lyre Calliope takes this further discussing how, &ldquo;Webmaker could be an opportunity to define an embeddable API strategy for the entire web&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;a Singly Markup API would lower the learning threshold for anyone interested in remixing all of their personal information together in new ways&rdquo;, in&nbsp;<a href="http://captaincalliope.net/2013/01/15/markup-apis-and-the-readwrite-web/">Markup APIs and the Read/Write Web</a>.
<p>I envision Markup APIs, at their simplest working like <a href="https://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> where you can easily render data from JSON templates, or be as robust as what Mozilla is doing with their Webmaker platform. &nbsp;Making the web embeddable and remixable like Lyre says.&nbsp;
<p>While scripting platforms are providing an important evolution in APIs for developers, by aggregating top APIs into new resources, the Markup API approach is an interesting evolution in APIs for everyone. &nbsp;And with <a href="https://singly.com/docs/data/authorization#Browser-based-Client-Apps">browser based authentication solutions like Singly's</a>, we can make this a very personalized experience.
<p>I&rsquo;m still working to understand all the possibilities, but I think both API scripting platforms and Markup APIs will bring us closer to a truly programmable web that is acceptable by everyone.

<p>image: http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Google-Voter-Information-Widget.png</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/google/Google-Voter-Information-Widget.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>I stumbled across the <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Google Civic Information API</a> today, which allows developers to build applications around civic information including polling place, early vote location, candidate data, and election official information.  As soon as I landed on the home page, I scanned the left hand navigation, and noticed the option for "<a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/embed">embeddable tool</a>".
<p>As you know <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Embeddable">embeddable tools are are something I advocate all API owners</a> should consider when assembling the building blocks of your API.  I like Google's approach to the Google Voter Information Tool, which lets users look up their polling place, early vote sites, ballot, and election official information for the US 2012 General Election.
<p>To support the embeddable tool, Google provides a quick overview, with instructions for "quick embed" and more granular options allowing anyone to configure region, address, local and other advanced settings.
<p>Even though the 2012 election is over, I think Google's approach to providing embeddable tools with their APIs is potentially something that other API owners can follow, which will make your API accessible beyond just the developer community.

<p>title: ‘Netflix Storytelling And Why You Should Tell Stories of Your Platform’</p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-square.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>The mission of API Evangelist is centered around telling stories from the API space, shedding light on the innovative things developers and API providers are doing across all business sectors.
<p>Over the holidays I rolled my <a title="History of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs series into its own section</a>.  It can be very difficult to understand who the players were in the API game, last year, let alone 10 years ago.  If there aren&rsquo;t stories about what happened in 2001, it can be very difficult to piece together the history.
<p>In 2012 I also scaled up my API monitoring system to track the blogs and tweets of over 1000 APIs, providing a way for me to track activity across the space and establish my own <a title="API Ranking System" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API ranking system</a> resulting in what I cal&nbsp;<a title="The API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>.  This too is very dependent on API owners telling or sharing stories around their operations.
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking on over 1500 APIs and only 1000 have blogs and Twitter accounts.  With very few other signals to follow, such as stories in the blogosophere, social bookmarks on Hacker News and Reddit or QA on Quora or Stack Overflow--there isn&rsquo;t much to discover about these potentially valuable APIs.
<p>At first, I felt there was a flaw in the way I track on APIs.  If an API offers value, but there are no stories for me to track on, it won&rsquo;t show up on my radar--leaving me feeling my approach could be flawed.
<p>On the flip side, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/27/new-api-stories-in-2013/">going into 2013 I am eager to find &ldquo;new&rdquo; stories of APIs,</a> feeling like I&rsquo;m constantly telling stories of Amazon and Netflix--contrasting this with the lack of stories around 500 of my APIs, I felt there is an important link.  There is a reason I tell so many stories about Netflix isn't chance, it is because Netflix shares so much about its operations, providing fuel for my analysis and storytelling.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/netflix/daniel-jacobson-netflix.JPG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>To shed light on this, I sat down with Daniel Jacobson (<a href="https://fr.twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), Director of Engineering for APIs at Netflix and asked him, <strong><em>&ldquo;Why does Netflix share so many stories about their operations?&rdquo;</em></strong>
<p>It is very similar to why I tell stories on API Evangelist. &nbsp;Daniel asys it can be very positive to think about things, anticipating that you will share publicly, forcing you to see things in a different light.  That process can be very healthy, even without considering the after-effects of publicly sharing.
<p>Ultimately Netflix shares its stories publicly to set itself as a thought leader, providing a marketing vehicle for the company when stories get picked up by TechCrunch or Mashable, but also sending signals to the world that Netflix is innovating and is a great place to work--additionally providing a valuable talent acquisition engine in a time when competition for talent is high.  <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/15/why-rest-keeps-me-up-at-night/">Look at posts from Daniel, on sites like ProgrammableWeb</a>.  What do you see in the last sentence...&rdquo;<a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobsListing.html?function=Engineering">we are hiring</a>!&rdquo;
<p>Next I asked Daniel how, or if they measure and reported on the return on investment (ROI) from their public storytelling--number of hires, pageviews, syndication, etc.  He providing me with another link to talent acquisition--that ultimately they don&rsquo;t track on this, its based upon the response they get publicly and the feeling in their gut after each story is released into the wild.
<p>Daniel related this approach to strorytelling with their internal <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664">culture of freedom and responsibility</a>.  When you work at Netflix, there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> a lot of management and control, the culture is centered around good judgement, communication, impact, curiosity, innovation, courage, passion, honesty and selflessness.  In my opinion all qualities that can lead to good storytelling.
<p>The Netflix storytelling process isn&rsquo;t a PR stunt.  Its truly about a genuine desire to share the story of their operations, the successes and failures--demonstrating their expertise and thought leadership not just in the movie and TV industry, but across the technology sector.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-reed-hastings.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>API Evangelist is my learning and storytelling platform.  It is rooted in my learning in real-time, and my desire to share these thoughts, in hopes others can learn along with me.  I&rsquo;m not seeking pageviews, I just want to share my view of the space, showcase the good and bad across all sectors, helping lead, in hopes that I can contribute to making the space as healthy as possible.
<p>As an API provider, your blog, social networks, QA and forum activity is not just a PR mouthpiece.  It is how you will tell the stories around your platform, how you will share the value you deliver--educating users, developers and the public at large that you exist, and that what you are doing matters.
<p>Without stories, your platform won&rsquo;t matter now or in the future--no matter how amazing your technology is.

<p>I'm rebooting the marketing and PR for the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a> after the holidayz. After finding a new date for the event on February 21st and 22nd, we've gone through the session and speaker lineup and almost the entire line-up is coming back, with a couple of new entries including a new keynote from&nbsp;Jeff Lawson of Twilio.
<p>We had a whole bunch of new requests for speaker additions over the holidays, and while we tried to squeeze in where we could, with such a killer lineup and the fact that everyone was committed to the new dates, we had to decline some pretty good talks.
<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-home-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>Over the next week we are going through and confirming with all registered attendees to verify they will be attending, but since the event was sold out before hurricane Sandy, I expect we will be announcing the event as sold out pretty soon.
<p>The event is designed to be an intimate 2 days between 300 industry professionals in the API space. &nbsp;So I recommend if you are excited about APIs in 2013, make sure and head over to <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice site</a> and register before its 100% sold out.
