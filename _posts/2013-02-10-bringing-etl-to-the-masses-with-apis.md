{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m spending a lot of time lately thinking about emerging trends in API usage.One area I’m tracking on, is around companies that are offering simple services that provide interoperability and automation between cloud platforms, using APIs.The best known examples are from companies like If This Then That (IFTTT) and Zapier, who provide end users with simple icon based tools for defining tasks that move data between SaaS platforms.Its tough to define this space, which in enterprise speak is really just Extract Transform Load (ETL), which is historically a process to migrate information between systems in an enterprise, using data sources and web services.But with the popularity of web APIs, we need to rethink ETL in the context of the cloud and update how we approach interoperability between the growing number of API driven platforms.</p>
