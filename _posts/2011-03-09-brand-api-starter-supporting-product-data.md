{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been thinking aboutAdam Kleinbergs recents post,Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers andDigging deeper on Brand APIs.Hes right.The pace ofAPI development skyrocketed in 2010, and will continue in 2011.Brands that dont have an API will be left behind.I suggested companies get their feet wet in the API space by starting with a basic RESTful API that servers up data about their products.</p>
