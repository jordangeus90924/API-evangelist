{% include JB/setup %}<p>In 2012 I’m going to be stepping up my travel schedule.I”m planning on attending as many conferences, hackathons and meetups as I possibly can.My emphasis will be on hackathons and meetups, but there are still some very worthy larger conferences that I will make sure and be at.I believe that in 2012 there will be some serious innovation occurring around Hackathons in cities around the globe, and I want to be there for as much of it as I can.Tonight I added some filters to the events page so you can filter down by month, city, country and time period.</p>
