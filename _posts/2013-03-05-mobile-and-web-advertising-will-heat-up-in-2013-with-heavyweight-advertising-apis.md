{% include JB/setup %}<p>It was interesting to see Amazon step up in the advertising game with the beta release of the Amazon Mobile Ads API this week.I wouldn’t want Amazon getting into my space, when it comes to any API resource, especially advertising.On the other hand, one can say that the space needs disruption with the dominance of Google with their multiple offerings: Google Mobile Google Adwords DoubleClick DoubleClick Ad Exchange AdMob Adwords Youtube I think we can expect some intense competition when it comes to advertising and specifically around mobile advertising APIs--battling for your eyeballs on smart phones and tablets in 2013.Another layer that will add to the competititiveness with advertising APIs is the fact that all three social media and networking giants have their own advertising APIs now as well: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn With Google and Amazon both having devices in the game (Android and Kindle), it will be interesting how they partner with Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin for the social layer, and where all of this leaves Apple.Let’s not forget about the me too category with Bing Advertising APIs and Yahoo Advertising Central, or the potentially over 100 other advertising APIs available via ProgrammableWeb.</p>
