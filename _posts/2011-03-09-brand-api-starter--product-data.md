<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/brand-food.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I have been thinking about<a title="Adam Kleinberg" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamkleinberg">Adam Kleinbergs</a> recent posts,<a title="Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers" href="https://mashable.com/2011/01/04/brand-open-api-developers/">Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers</a> and<a title="Digging Deeper on Brand APIs" href="http://www.tractionco.com/blog/63-digging-deeper-on-brand-apis">Digging deeper on Brand APIs</a>.<p>
He's right.  The pace of API development skyrocketed in 2010, and will continue in 2011.<p>
Brands that don't have an API will be left behind.<p>
Where does a company start?   Start with what you know.  Your products.<p>
Make your product data available via a <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/">RESTful</a> API.  Provide the basics:  Names, Descriptions, and Images.<p>
Allow developers to sign up, and register for a key.<p>
Provide simple documentation describing how to make calls against your API,  sample code in PHP, Ruby, and Python.<p>
Setup an <a title="FAQ" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=132">FAQ page</a>, <a title="Blog" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=123">blog</a>, <a title="Forum" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=131">forum</a>, and support contact form.<p>
Establish a clear <a title="Terms and Conditions" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=150">terms and conditions</a> page, with clear <a title="Brand Guidelines" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=149">brand guidelines</a> regarding how users can use your product data.<p>
Brands should start simple, start with delivering basic information about your products through a RESTful API.<p>
You never know what you'll learn!
