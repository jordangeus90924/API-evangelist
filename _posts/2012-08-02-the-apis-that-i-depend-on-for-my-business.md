I maintain an active list of online services I depend on for my business, in Evernote. Each month I spend an hour or two maintaining this list, to make sure it is complete and actively change my logins when appropriate. As a recovering IT guy, and maintaining infrastructure for myself, but also [Audrey Watters][1]\--so I keep good tabs on the various services I use.

While going through this my services list this month, I added a new section to it, and started tracking if I depend on the service for their API. I have enough automated jobs running on top of APIs I needed to make sure I keep good track of which APIs I depend on. Here are some of the API I depend on to keep my business operational.

First I depend on a couple of key Google APIs:

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/gmail-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="50" />][2]
**[Gmail][2]** \- Integrate my daily emails, as well as email blasts with my administrative system

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-contacts-logo.png" alt="" width="50" />][3]
**[Google Contacts][3]** \- Keep business and individual profiles in my admin system in sync with my daily Google Contacts activity.

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-calendar-logo.png" alt="" width="50" />][4]
**[Google Calendar][4]** \- Publish hackathon calendars to Google Calendar as well as keep conferences, meetups and other events I pull through APIs and curate in sync

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-docs-icon.png" alt="" width="50" />][5]
**[Google Docs][5]** \- Publish copies of blog posts to Google Docs, as well as version of pages from my content management system to Google Docs

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-sites-icon.png" alt="" width="40" />][6]
**[Google Sites][6]** \- All of my research is in Google Sites. So I tend to publish lists of curated news, blog posts and other research to wiki pages under specific projects

Next, I would say Amazon Web Services delivers some pretty critical APIs I can't live without:

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/amazon-ec2-icon.png" alt="" width="40" />][7]
**[Amazon EC2][7]** \- I deploy and shutdown various EC2 instances for various jobs I run for API Evangelist. All APIs are managed on AWS EC2

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/amazon-s3-icon.png" alt="" width="40" />][8]
**[Amazon S3][8]** \- All heavy objects in my systems are stored at Amazon S3 including photos, PDFs, presentations and video

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/amazon-route-53-icon.png" alt="" width="40" />][9]
**[Amazon Route 53][9]** \- I use AWS Route 53 to manage the underlying DNS for all my applications and sites across multiple domains

Then there are an assortment of other APIs I use throughout my web sites and applications:

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/alchemy/alchemyAPI-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="75" />][10]
**[AlchemyAPI][10]** \- I use alchemy for content, keyword and author extraction on articles and site pages that I curate as part my daily routine

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/crunchbase/crunchbase-logo.png" alt="" width="75" />][11]
**[Crunchbase][11]** \- I pull company profiles from Crunchbase and use in my research and profile for API Evangelist

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/eventbrite/event-brite-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="75" />][12]
**[EventBrite][12]** \- I pull hackathons, meetups and conferences from EventBrite and use in my admin system

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/evernote/evernote-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="75" />][13]
**[Evernote][13]** \- I do all my note taking and recording of thoughts in Evernote, there are some folders I keep in sync with my admin system

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/flickr/flickr-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="75" />][14]
**[Flickr][14]** \- I've historically published a lot of public images to Flickr for SEO purposes, so many of my blog posts or events that I record a lot of images and video from get stored at Flickr using the API in my admin system

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/foursquare/foursquare-logo.png" alt="" width="75" />][15]
**[Foursquare][15]** \- I use Foursquare as a journal and pull the timeline into my admin system and apply as framework to my writing and traveling

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="60" />][16]
**[Github][16]** \- All my stories use Gists to display code and some of my larger productions have full repositories that I access via command line and via the API

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/paypal/paypal-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="75" />][17]
**[Paypal][17]** \- I handle subscriptions and white paper purchases via Paypal

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/pinboard/pinboard_in_blue.png" alt="" width="60" />][18]
**[Pinboard][18]** \- All my curation runs through Pinboard. Anything I bookmark while reading feeds or on the open web gets bookmarked with Pinboard, then with the API I pull into my admin system

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/programmableweb/programmableweb-logo.png" alt="" width="75" />][19]
**[ProgrammableWeb][19]** \- I use ProgrammableWeb's API to pull new APIs into my curation system

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/stackexchange/StackExchangeLogo1.png" alt="" width="75" />][20]
**[Stack Exchange][20]** \- I use stack exchange to monitor API activity on the forums and keep track of discussion counts for various APIs.

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tumblr/tumblr-logo.png" alt="" width="75" />][21]
**[Tumblr][21]** \- I assemble some curated posts and summaries and publish to Tumblr via the API

[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/tweet-bird-blue-white.png" alt="" width="60" />][22]
**[Twitter][22]** \- Twitter is central to my API monitoring, ranking and curation system. I depend on the REST and Streaming APIs

I depend on these APIs to run [API Evangelist][23], [API Voice][24] and [The API Stack][25] as well as support the other research and consulting that I do. Some of these services I pay for, some of them I use for free. Usually if a service sticks around in my world for more than 3 or 4 months I pay for some sort of premium account or access.

I’m sure I depend on a lot of APIs, partly because this is my game, I’m an API Evangelist. But it is also because APIs provide me with the data and resources I need to operate, and as a programmer I’m able to quickly put APIs to use for my business.

Tracking on the APIs I depend will be a regular part of my IT strategy, and I’m even going to publish this as a public page on my websites--showcasing what APIs have done for my business.
