        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/06/07/api-office-hours-with-google-calendar/">API Office Hours with Google Calendar</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Jun 2011</span>
        Google Calendar has a <a title="new feature for managing appointment slots" href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=190998">new feature for managing "Appointment Slots"</a>. These appointment slots are a great way to let others know preferred times when you are available.<p></p>
Open office hours are becoming a common way for API providers to communicate times when developers can connect with someone in person or online via chat for support. Google Calendar appointment slots area great way to manage API office hours.<p></p>
<strong>Creating API Office Hours
</strong>To get started, set up blocks of time you'd like to offer as API hours. Simply click anywhere on your calendar and then on "appointment slots. From there, create a single block of time or automatically split a larger block of time into smaller appointment slots if applies.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-1.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
<strong>Publishing API Office Hours</strong>
Every Google Calendar has its own personal appointments sign up page; you can embed it on your website or give the URL directly to registered API developers. You can find the URL for your appointment page at the top of the set-up page, which you can access via the edit details link.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-4.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
<strong>Signing Up for API Hours</strong>
When someone visits your sign up page, their calendar is overlaid for convenience and they can sign up directly for any available appointment slot.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-2.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
When they sign up, Google Calendar conveniently creates a new shared event on both of your calendars.<p></p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/office-hours/API-Office-Hours-3.png" alt="" width="400" align="center" /><p></p>
Making yourself available to developers is important.  API office hours can be used for premium support, limited time support, or just open time to share a pint with your developers and other people in the industry.

     <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/apple/apple-icloud.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />Lots of big news coming out of <a title="Apple's World Wide Developer Conference" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference</a> (WWDC2011) in San Francisco today.
</p>
<p>
     There were major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion. What really stood out was their new <a title="iCloud" href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>.
</p>
<p>
     iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for all music, photos, books, documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.
</p>
<p>
     Although this line of thought is nothing new, with Apple going all in…it means the cloud has gone mainstream.
</p>
<p>
     Get ready for some major growth in the cloud as Apple pushes it further, and other existing cloud providers try to compete.

Kandaswamy offered some practical advice for retail companies that are deciding how and where to start with their API deployments.  His suggestions included the following areas:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Product APIs</strong>- Make your product catalog available via your API is fundamental.</li>
	<li><strong>Store APIs </strong>- Give local store information including location and product availability is powerful.</li>
	<li><strong>Review APIs </strong>- Deliver practical product reviews in a usable way to help consumer make purchasing decisions.</li>
	<li><strong>Commerce APIs</strong> - Provide seamless purchasing and product fulfillment through at-home delivery, in-store pick-up, partner e-commerce sites, and web-based applications.</li>
</ul>
Those four areas just make sense, as they seamlessly bridge the physical retail and online retail consumer experience and extend the Best Buy brand in entirely new ways.  While there may be other innovative ways that retailers can utilize APIs, these are a great place to start.

        <div class="c1"></div>Providing some real-world examples, Mashery invited four leaders in the API space to speak:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Daniel Jacobsen" href="http://twitter.com/#!/daniel_jacobson">Daniel Jacobson</a>, Director of Engineering for <a title="Netflix API" href="http://developer.netflix.com/">Netflix API</a> who walked us through how APIs are allowing them to stream video to over 200 devices, resulting in Netflix dominating in their space.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Kumar Kandaswamy" href="http://twitter.com/#!/Kumar_K">Kumar Kandaswamy</a>, Director, <a title="Open API Platform Business for Best Buy" href="http://www.bbyopen.com/">Open API Platform Business for Best Buy</a> showed us how APIs have enabled them to extend their brand with the help of partners in ways they never could have done on their own.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Adam Kleinberg" href="http://twitter.com/#!/adamkleinberg">Adam Kleinberg</a>, CEO of <a title="Traction" href="http://www.tractionco.com/">Traction</a> and Mashable.com Tech Writer demonstrated why brands need to focus on having an open API for developers and not get lured into distractions like building apps for single devices.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Edwin Aoki" href="http://twitter.com/#!/edwinaoki">Edwin Aoki</a>, Chief Architect of PayPal/eBay explained how APIs enable you to be more agile, and accelerate new forms of business development, even when your building a global commerce platform where 18% of the worlds online transactions are conducted.
     </li>
</ul>I would say the one point I heard repeated over and over was the importance of understanding who the target audience of your API is. Designing and delivering your API in a way that caters to this audience will help keep development costs focused, network overhead as low as possible, and deliver exactly the tools and resources the most important segments of your audience will need.
<p></p>These were just some of the interesting insights given, into how some of the most successful brands in the space, are using APIs to enable better distribution to consumers, partners and expand their brands globally.

        <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/trojan-horse.gif" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I'm processing all my notes from the 2011 <a title="Glue Conference" href="http://gluecon.com/">Glue Conference</a>, which has been one of the most thought provoking events I've been to this year.<p></p>
The best part of events like Gluecon is you get to hang with some really smart and extremely experienced people.<p></p>
I'm working to understand a new perspective I was exposed to while listening to Mark Suster talk about the Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years.<p></p>
In his talk, he outlined three potential types of platforms:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Platform as a Service </strong>- Platform around core application or business as an API, allowing others to build businesses on top of, and make money.</li>
	<li><strong>Platform as an Extension</strong> - Platform around a core application that offers APIs as an extension for others to build on bringing value back to the core business.</li>
	<li><strong>Platform as a Trojan Horse</strong> - Platform that allows others to build on, taking the risk, and the core business benefits from any value created.</li>
</ul>
As I work my way through the hundreds of available APIS I will definitely be applying what I'm learning...<p></p>
What is the motivation of each of these API platforms?

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/06/01/open-vs-closed-apis/">Open vs. Closed APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/open-closed-sign.jpg" alt="" align="right" />With all the buzz around APIs these days, its easy to get swept up in all the hype around open APIs, and miss the mark with your own API deployment.
<p></p>So what do I mean by Open APIs? Open APIs are like Twitter, Twilio and many of Google APIs that are available for anyone to register for a key, and start programming against.
<p></p>Discussions around APIs tend to start here. People often hear about the popularity of these APIs and want to emulate that.
<p></p>If you don't directly have experience with API deployment, I recommend getting your feet wet with a more closed API deployment.
<p></p>Immediately, calling APIs closed sounds bad. Sounds like you are being selfish or exclusive and don't want anyone touching your APIs. Because of this closed APIs don't get the press coverage and discussion they deserve.
<p></p>In reality very few APIs find success in being open. Most API projects will get traction in sharing data and resources with business partners, and even internally between departments within a company.
<p></p>Closed APIs enable you to serve a very limited audience, maintaining control over your data and resources, which is a common concern with API deployment.
<p></p>Within this closed or controlled environment you can get your feet wet with API deployment, gain some experience, then maybe someday the right opportunity for an open API will come along.
<p></p>It's not about Open vs. Closed, its about doing what makes sense and possibly doing both in the long run. I would also like to see more open discussion around best practices with closed API deployment in the press an blogosphere.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/05/30/api-forums-using-get-satisfaction/">API Forums Using Get Satisfaction</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">30 May 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Get Satisfaction" href="http://getsatisfaction.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/get_satisfaction/get_satisfaction_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a title="Get Satisfaction" href="http://getsatisfaction.com/">Get Satisfaction</a> is one way to build API forums that enable productive conversations between an API owner and the developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>Simply engaging your customers in conversation won't earn you the respect of your community  and make your customers happy. Conversations are just a start, it's what you do with them that matter. Get Satisfaction was built on the idea of not simply creating conversations, but creating value from conversations.</p>
<p>Get Satisfaction focuses on outcomes in order to create value, as opposed to the confusing and ineffective taxonomy of traditional forums, it is focused on conversations around four simple, outcome-oriented topic types. This helps keep conversations focused and productive.</p>
<p>Working together with an API community to build a dynamic, social knowledge-base helps developers find answers to their questions on their own time, and often times much faster through traditional support channels. Every answer is publicly searchable, so there's never a need to answer the same question twice. This results in a dramatic reduction in the cost of API support, while greatly improving customer satisfaction at the same time.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/get_satisfaction/get-satisfaction-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Different topics inside of forums are full of opinions, wishes and wants. Opening a community conversation about your API roadmap can help you gather valuable market data you can quickly fold into your API development cycle, communications strategy or program schedule.</p>
<p>Another area often overlooked, is that opening an forum and inviting discussion about your API deepens user engagement, increases the amount of user generated content, and benefits your  search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. (Hopefully you have one?)</p>
<p>Direct interactiion with your developers through open and transparent forums increases satisfaction, loyalty and builds community. This community will give prospective customers a peek behind the curtain of how your API treats developers, make them feel like they belong, and creates a 2-way street of communication your entire ecosystem will benefit from.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Open Data Protocol" href="http://www.odata.org/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/OData_Protocol.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>There is an ever growing amount of data available today and much of this data is now being collected and stored across a wide variety of system, locked into specific applications or formats, making it difficult to access, integrate and share.
<p></p>The <a title="Open Data Protocol" href="http://www.odata.org/">Open Data Protocol (OData)</a> is a Web protocol for querying and updating data that provides a way to unlock data and free it from silos that exist in many applications.
<p></p>OData frees data by applying and building upon existing web technologies like <a title="HTTP" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>, <a title="Atom Publishing Protocoal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub)</a> and <a title="JSON" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/27/api-technology-json/">JSON</a> to provide access to information from a variety of applications, services, and stores.
<p></p>OData emerged from experiences implementing AtomPub clients and servers in a variety of products over the past several years. OData is currently used to expose and access data from relational databases, file systems, content management systems and custom websites.
<p></p>OData works to be consistent with the way the World Wide Web works, adhering to HTTP standards just like RESTful APIs. This reuse of core Web principles allows OData to provide data integration and interoperability across a broad range of clients, servers, services, and tools.
<p></p>OData is released under the <a title="Open Specification Promise" href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/default.mspx">Open Specification Promise</a> and allows anyone to be involved with OData implementations.

        <span class="post-date">28 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Evrythng" href="http://www.evrythng.net/index.html"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Evrythng-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>We are in the middle of an era of unprecedented growth in the number of available web APIs. In March 2011 <a title="ProgrammableWeb hit 3000 APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">ProgrammableWeb hit 3000 APIs</a> in its directory, and is already up to 3,287 APIs as of today.
<p></p>This is nothing. If you want a glimpse into the future of APIs, take a look at <a title="Evrythng" href="http://www.evrythng.net/index.html">Evrythng</a>.
<p></p>Evrythng allows you to create online presence for any sort of object - products, business assets, vehicles, trees, buildings, and beyond.
<p></p>Evrythng then gives you a management system to organise and operate an online presence forobjects, storing active profiles and updates, controlling access, and tracking usage. Evrythng creates a unique online identity for every object, providing a presence on the Web through a globally accessible URI.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Evrythng-Sensors.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Now this is where it really gets good. Evrythng also provides a RESTful API toolset and secure software �infrastructure' to share, manage and access real-time information about physical things.
<p></p>Using the Evrythng API, you can directly connect real world objects and databases to Evrythng, allowing developers to mashup object information, add and exchange information with other objects, then combine and coordinate information and interaction across multiple applications and interfaces.
<p></p>Evrythng wants to be the �Facebook for Things', giving physical things an individualdigital profile, and share real-time object information in a managed way.
<p></p>If you think there are a lot of web APIs now, wait until every object on earth can potentially be accessed through APIs.

     </li>
</ul>I don't feel the need to defend Google here, I wish to only defend APIs against people blaming them for what is the fault or responsibility of developers and API owners. I see this same line of attacks on APIs anytime an API company makes a change in their strategy, and developers freak out!
<p></p><strong>First</strong>, let's start with the claims that developers are having the rug pulled out from under them, and you can't build a business on APIs!
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/TweetDeck-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />This week I was fortunate enough to hear <a title="Mark Suster" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04AG3UHUIJE">Mark Suster of GRP Partners</a> talk at <a title="Glue Conference Mark Suster" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Gluecon on Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years</a>. One important point he made about business platforms and startups (ie. TweetDeck) is <strong><span class="c2">you need to have multiple data sources</span></strong>. Without expanding to LinkedIn, Buzz, and Facebook TweetDeck would have been left with only a single data source, and left completely vulnerable.
<p></p>This is a pretty basic concept when it comes to business. If I start a corner deli, and buy my food from a single food distribution company that delivers every Thursday by truck. Then one Thursday the truck doesn't come, and i'm left for the weekend without any food for my restaurant. Is it valid for me to claim that food distribution companies are no way to build a restaurant?
<p></p>Even in the case of TweetDeck, using a very unique API (ie. Twitter), they had to diversify with other services. If your building a business around Google Translate API, what sort of plan B and C do you have built into your code? Are you using any of the free or paid solutions out there like <a title="Translated.net" href="http://www.translated.net/en/translation-api">Translated.net</a>, <a title="Wordlingo" href="http://www.worldlingo.com/en/products/worldlingo_api.html">WordLingo</a>, <a title="Microsoft Translator" href="http://www.microsofttranslator.com/dev/">Microsoft Translator</a>, <a title="Apertium" href="http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Apertium_web_service">Apertium</a>, or <a title="ICanLocalize" href="http://www.icanlocalize.com/site/">ICanLocalize</a>?
<p></p>Please don't blame APIs because developers don't have a business strategy, or because bloggers are looking for a sensational headline.
<p></p><strong>Second</strong>, let's take a look at Google's approach to Google Translate API. The primary reason Google gave for depracting Google Translate API was:
<blockquote>
     <em>Due to the substantial economic burden caused by extensive abuse, the number of requests you may make per day will be limited and the API will be shut off completely on December 1, 2011.</em>
</blockquote>I can't help but think, this problem could have been curbed, by bringing Google Translate API under metered billing using the <a title="Google Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google Console</a>,as other APIs appear to be heading. This would give a low ceiling of free daily calls on the API, then make users pay for more access.
<p></p>Except I really don't think Google wants to make its money from translation services, they are focused on where translation supports their core business. World Domination! Wait, no maybe it is search.
<p></p>If you notice translation is still available in other areas like Google Docs API for translating documents on upload, and in Gmail for translating emails, and Chrome for translating web pages. And of course you can still use the <a title="web interface for Google Translate" href="http://translate.google.com/">web interface for Google Translate</a>.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-translate.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />So you will still see Google Translate in use where it supports Google's core business. I can see just about any other business making a similar decision.
<p></p>Also, Google did reach out to communicate the impending deprecation, they called my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>, and briefed her on the plan. I assume they reached out to others as well.
<p></p>I would add, that Google could do a better job of communicating their roadmap of various APIs and how they will work to support the core Google set of services, or be offered as a service by themselves. As I watch the Google API ecosystem being pulled together and organized, I still can't quite tell whether the vision is to purely serve the primary Google vision, or provide a wide set of APIs that developers can build businesses on, as recent moves with Google Console might suggest.

        <span class="post-date">27 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Seevl" href="seevl.net"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/seevl_logo1.png" alt="" align="right" /></a><a title="Seevl" href="seevl.net">Seevl</a>, a music discovery service that provides anew way to explore the cultural and musical universe of various artists, just launched an API with the assistance of <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>.
<p></p>When deploying the API, Seevl approached it a little differently than most. Instead of providing a separate API to access data, Seevl relies on content negotiation principles to deliver alternative representations of web pages.
<p></p>This means the entire Seevl website is the API and you can get JSON representations of almost every page in the site.
<p></p>Seevl relies on HTTP headers to let developers request data using a particular content-types, and authenticate using three parameters:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Accept</strong> - The content-type required
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>X_APP_ID</strong> - Developer application ID
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>X_APP_KEY</strong> - Developer application Key
     </li>
</ul>Here is an example search results for beatles using curl:
<p></p><script src="https://gist.github.com/996079.js?file=Seevl%20API%20Request" type="text/javascript">
</script>
<p></p>This approach is meant to make it easier for to developers focus on the development and let the Seevl client libraries handle the content-negotiation.
<p></p>The <a title="Seevl API" href="http://developers.seevl.net/">Seevl API</a> provides everal methods to search and pull specific data about individual bands and artists and related information.
<p></p>While this approach is nothing new, its an interesting way to provide users with HTML views and developers with the JSON representations of information stored in a database.

        <span class="post-date">27 May 2011</span>
        Google has had a busy year when it comes to APIs. So far this year they've launched 6 new APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Google Tasks API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/tasks/index.html">Tasks API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Books API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/books/">Books API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Pagespeed Online API" href="https://code.google.com/apis/pagespeedonline/index.html">Pagespeed Online API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Places API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/places/">Places API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Prediction API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/predict/">Prediction API</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Fusion Tables API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/fusiontables/">Fusion Tables API</a>
     </li>
</ul>As they add APIs to their directory they have also provided <a title="Google Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google Discovery Service</a> to help developers find APIs, <a title="Google Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google Explorer</a> to start working with APIs, and <a title="Google Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google Console</a> for developers to manage the APIs they integrate with.
<p></p>With the addition of new APIs, some of the older APIs are rendered obsolete with new versions of the API, while others are just shutdown for not getting traction.
<p></p>The following APIs are now deprecated but have no scheduled shutdown date:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Code Search API
     </li>
     <li>Diacritize API
     </li>
     <li>Feedburner APIs
     </li>
     <li>Finance API
     </li>
     <li>Power Meter API
     </li>
     <li>Sidewiki API
     </li>
     <li>Wave API
     </li>
</ul>While these APIs will be shut down per the deprecation policies outlined in their documentation:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Blog Search API
     </li>
     <li>Books Data API
     </li>
     <li>Books JavaScript API
     </li>
     <li>Image Search API
     </li>
     <li>News Search API
     </li>
     <li>Patent Search API
     </li>
     <li>Safe Browsing API (v1 only)
     </li>
     <li>Translate API
     </li>
     <li>Transliterate API
     </li>
     <li>Video Search API
     </li>
     <li>Virtual Keyboard API
     </li>
</ul>Google provides lengthy deprecation periods as long as 3 years in some cases, along with alternative APIs in other situations. The move is part of a larger effort to free up resources for other projects and make the overall Google API ecosystem a much more organized world.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/05/26/loggly-introduces-user-defined-variable-pricing/">Loggly Introduces User Defined, Variable Pricing</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Loggly" href="http://www.loggly.com/">Loggly</a> recently changed the structure for their cloud-based logging service from a tiered pricing, to a <a title="user-defined variable pricing structure" href="https://www.loggly.com/pricing/">user-defined variable pricing structure</a>.
<p></p>Users can define their own pricing tier using two key variables:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Daily Log Volume - 200MB to 8 GB
     </li>
     <li>Log Retention Time - 1 Week to 180 Days
     </li>
</ul>The pricing change was in response to a growing user base, and demand for volumes greater than 2GB/day.
<p></p>Loggly still offers a free plan which supports 200MB/day and retention of 7 days. There is also a beginning paid plan that starts with 200MB/day, but has retention of 15 days, starting at $8/month.
<p></p>Loggly is also adding support for secure syslog (TLS), HTTPs on web inputs, and log archives on all account levels including the free plan.
<p></p>This is a great example of Software as a Service (SaaS) and API service providers innovating around monetization and trying to find the best approach that fits their customers needs and the services they offer.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Games.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Tomorrow I'm participating in a session at <a title="Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers</a>.
<p></p><a title="Justin Tormey" href="http://twitter.com/#!/justintormey">Justin Tormey</a> of Alcatel-Lucent will be talking some about segmentation of API developers to focus on the different types personalities wtihin an API ecosystem.
<p></p>Focusing outside of Gluecon for a moment, Facebook has been doing a good job of this type of platform segmentation. Yesterday they launched <a title="facebook + Games" href="http://www.facebook.com/fbandgames">Facebook + Games</a>, a page created for the the Facebook games partner and business community. The Facebook Page will focus on social gaming innovation, directly from the Facebook Games Partnerships Team.
<p></p>I wrote about the the <a title="Journalist on Facebook" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/17/beyond-partners-and-developers-with-your-api/">Journalist on Facebook</a> page last month, and how Facebook is targeting media and journalist with a similar Facebook Partner Platform page. This was another example of their API platform segmentation.
<p></p>This type of segmentation is key to success within a growing developer ecosystem, not all developers are created equal. Make sure you identify the differences within your community, and provide resources targeted to these gorups.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/gluecon.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I'm preparing for another talk tomorrow at the <a title="Glue Conference" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/">Glue conference</a> in Colorado. Glue is a conference that assists architects, developers, administrators and integrators in solving problems around web application integration.
<p></p>Glue is about all of bits and pieces, APIs and meta-data, standards and connectors that will help us to glue together the varying applications of the new platform.
<p></p>I'm on a panel at Glue called, <a title="Whats Next for APIs" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Whats Next for APIs</a>?. I'm stoked to be invited along with some major players in the API space:

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Querly's aggregation of social media profiles" href="http://qwerly.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Qwerly-A-Data-API-for-the-Social-Web.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>The modern Web API got its start in CRM with <a title="Salesforce" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, and in E-commerce with <a title="Ebay" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">Ebay</a> and <a title="Amazon" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a>, but it really found traction with social platforms like <a title="Flickr" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>, <a title="Twitter" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-twitter/">Twitter</a>, and <a title="Facebook" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-facebook-development-platform/">Facebook</a>.
<p></p>If we want a glimpse of whats next for APIs we need to look at the areas where web APIs have been applied for the longest. We need to look at examples like<a title="Amazon's integration of their affiliate program with their Product API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/06/amazon-affiliate-is-integrated-with-product-api/">Amazon's integration of their affiliate program with their Product API</a>, and <a title="Querly's aggregation of social media profiles" href="http://qwerly.com/">Qwerly's aggregation of social media profiles</a> into a single API.
<p></p>The social space is an area where the future of APIs is being played out right now. Since the social arena has reached a critical mass in the number of platforms, users, mobile apps, and available Web APIs, the sector has matured beyond other industries, and offers great insight into what the future holds.
<p></p>I've talked about <a title="unified APIs that allow you to work with multiple APIs through a single interface" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/02/unified-apis-or-api-standards-the-race-is-on/">unified APIs that allow you to work with multiple APIs through a single interface</a>, and the <a title="potential of API discovery services for industry or common API areas" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/discovery-services-for-common-apis/">potential of API discovery services for industry or common API areas</a>, but Qwerly's approach offers another view.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/qwerly.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><a title="Qwerly" href="http://qwerly.com/">Qwerly</a> aggregates social profiles across many networks into a single dead-simple data API for the social web.
<p></p>With Qwerly you can get data about a user by querying the API with an email address or a social identifier, like a Twitter handle, a Facebook username or a Facebook ID, and the Qwerly API returns:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>the person's name
     </li>
     <li>their location
     </li>
     <li>a short description, like a Twitter bio
     </li>
     <li>their social networking profiles and usernames across the web, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks
     </li>
     <li>a score of their online influence among their peers, like <a title="Kout" href="http://beta.klout.com/home">Klout</a>
     </li>
</ul>Qwerly API responses are delivered in JSON, and you only pay for what you use. The API combines information from web crawling, public web directories, other APIs with powerful heuristics and spam-detection algorithms, delivering high quality results.
<p></p>Other industries and sectors can benefit from such data and service discovery APIs, deployed in a RESTful way, using a pay for what you use API pricing model.

        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-1.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I was writing a story for <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> tonight on the enhancements Google made recently to its API console.<p></p>
I hadn't properly covered the <a title="API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">API Console</a>, <a title="API Explorer" href="http://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">API Explorer</a> here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, so I took the time, played with more, and wrote up overviews for each.<p></p>
I noticed something while reviewing Google's recent efforts to organize their family of <a title="88 APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?company=Google">88 APIs</a>, and make it easier to discover, integrate, and manage for developers.<p></p>
Google is taking a similar approach to managing their APIs, as <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, and <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3Scale.net">3Scale</a> does for other API providers.<p></p>
<a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, and <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a> provide a wealth of knowledge when it comes to API deployment that very few companies can touch.<p></p>
Beyond expertise, they provide a set of <a title="common building blocks every API should offer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks every API should offer</a>.  These are tools like forums and blogs you can find elsewhere, but these API service providers deliver in a neat bundle ready to go for your API.<p></p>
But the real value they bring to the table, that you can't really find anywhere else is:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API Billing</li>
	<li>API Traffic Controls</li>
	<li>API Metrics &amp; Analytics</li>
</ul>
And Apigee has one other piece that Mashery and 3Scale do not.  They have an <a title="API Explorer" href="http://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
<a title="Google provides an API explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google provides an API Explorer</a>, and they have open sourced the code, and <a title="made it available at Google Code" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-apis-explorer/">made it available at Google Code</a>.<p></p>
Next the <a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a> delivers billing and traffic controls, if this set of tools were made open source, this would be huge for the API community.<p></p>
I've been a big proponent of the need for <a title="open source building blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/">open source API building blocks</a>.  I say this not to devalue what Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale bring to the table.  Their stuff rocks.  However there are many other API owners out there who aren't ready for a service like theirs, or can't afford, and a set of open source building blocks is needed.<p></p>
That leaves metrics and analytics.  I think an open source set of API analytics would be the biggest benefit to the industry.   Some APIs don't need billing tools, but everyone needs to measure and control traffic.    I have talked about the need for an <a title="open source set of aPI metrics and analytics" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">open source set of API metrics and analytics</a> before.<p></p>
So I guess I'm saying to Google, Please open source your API Console, like you did the API explorer.  It will benefit the community a great deal, we will deal with API analytics next.

        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        The <a title="Google APIs Explorer" href="http://code.google.com/apis/explorer/" target="_blank">Google APIs Explorer</a> is is a tool that helps you explore various <a title="Google APIs" href="http://code.google.com/more/" target="_blank">Google APIs</a> in a web interface without writing any code.<p></p>
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Explorer.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Google APIs Explorer allows you to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Browse quickly through available APIs and versions</li>
	<li>See methods available for each API and available parameters</li>
	<li>Execute API requests for any method and see actual responses in real time.</li>
	<li>Make pubic or authenticated API calls</li>
</ul>
The GoogleAPIs Explorer currently supports only JSON for responses and request payloads, even though some APIs support other data formats like XML and AtomPub.<p></p>
The Google APIsExplorer provides an quick access tool for developers to discover what APIs Google offers, and enables users to immediately start using.<p></p>
This type of discovery and instant visualization can be the difference between API adoption or choosing to go with an alternative.<p></p>
Google APIs Explorer supports the following APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Google Buzz API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/" target="_blank">Buzz</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Custom Search API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/customsearch/" target="_blank">Custom Search</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Diacritize API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/language/diacritize/overview.html" target="_blank">Diacritize</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Moderator API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/moderator/" target="_blank">Moderator</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Search API for Shopping" href="http://code.google.com/apis/shopping/search/" target="_blank">Search API for Shopping</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Language API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/language/" target="_blank">Language API</a></li>

        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-apis-discovery-filing-cabinet.png" alt="" align="right" />The<a title="Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/index.html">Google APIs Discovery Service</a> provides a set of web APIs for discovering metadata across Google APIs.<p></p>
The discovery service delivers a JSON-based API that provides a directory of supported Google APIs, and a machine-readable discovery document"for each of the supported APIs that includes:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>List of API resource schemas based on JSON Schema</li>
	<li>List of API methods and available parameters for each method</li>
	<li>Available OAuth 2.0 scopes for each API</li>
	<li>Inline documentation of methods, parameters and available parameter values</li>
</ul>
Developers can use the Google APIs Discovery Service to build client libraries, IDE plugins and other tools that interact with supported Google APIs.<p></p>
The Google APIs Discovery Service delivers two things for each supported API:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>APIs Directory Resource</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Identification and description information, including name, version, title, and description.</li>
	<li>Documentation information, including icons and a documentation link.</li>
	<li>Status information, including status labels, and an indication as to whether or not this is the preferred version of the API.</li>
	<li>Discovery document link, the URI of the discovery document for this API</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Discovery Document Resource</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Schemas, which is a list of API resource schemas that describe the data you have access to in each API</li>
	<li>Methods, including a list of API methods and available parameters for each method.</li>
	<li>OAuth scopes, which identifies the list of OAuth scopes available for this API.</li>
	<li>Inline documentation, which provides brief descriptions of schemas, methods, parameters and available parameter values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The Google APIs Discovery Service is part of a larger effort by Google to get a handle on their growing number of APIs.  Developers find themselves potentially using multiple Google APIs across many application or client projects.<p></p>
The Google APIs Discovery Service allows developers to find new APIs available in the directory and programmatically discover how the API authenticates, what methods, and parameters are available.<p></p>
Not many companies have the number of APIs that Google has, and would need an API discovery service.  But with the recent growth in web APIs there will be more of a need for API discovery services within specific areas or industries.

        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google_apis_box_sdk.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />The <a title="Google APIs Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/#project:111046942866">Google APIs Console</a> is an interface for developers to manage and view traffic data, authentication, and billing information for up to 15 Google APIs, and more coming soon.<p></p>
Developers can bundle a collection of APIs into a project, and manage the following project information:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Activated APIs</strong> - APIs can be activated to enable traffic monitoring, filtering, and billing, and API-specific project pages.</li>
	<li><strong>Traffic information </strong>- Console reports show traffic information for each activated API, and allow for capping or filtering of usage for each API.</li>
	<li><strong>Billing information </strong>- APIs now can have billing activated, allowing them to exceed the courtesy usage quota. Usage fees are billed using Google Checkout and charges are invoiced monthly.</li>
	<li><strong>Project keys</strong> - Each project can be identified by either an API key or an OAuth 2.0 token. Using this key/token in API requests will identify the project, and enable the recording of usage data, filtering restrictions, and bill usage to the proper project. Within the Console developers can  generate or revoke API keys or OAuth 2.0 certificates for specific application.</li>
	<li><strong>Team members </strong>- Team members can be established with read, write, or ownership access to each project's Console page.</li>
</ul>
The Google APIs Console supports fifteen separate Google APIs:

</ul>
The Google APIs Console provides a pretty comprehensive set of tools for developers and companies to manage their projects that integrate with various Google APIs.<p></p>
The traffic control and billing tools provide a peek into the future of how billing and monetization will occur for APIs as they become more of a utility in our every day lives.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Discovery-Service.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />I just wrote about the potential of<a title="open source billing and traffic control" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">open source API billing and traffic control</a> building blocks, if Google would open source their <a title="API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a>, like they did with the <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
I started bundling in thoughts on <a title="Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/index.html">Google APIs Discovery Service</a> into that post, but then realized it is a separate issue, needing its own blog post.<p></p>
First, Google isn't about to open source Google API Discovery Service.  They issue developers of the Google APIs Discovery Service a <a title="patent license" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/patent-license.html">patent license</a>.  I couldn't find any more details tonight, but I'm assuming it puts this service in a different category than the rest.<p></p>
I wrote an <a title="overview of the Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">overview of Google APIs Discovery Service</a>, but essentially it is a way to discover and describe Google APIs using an API.  Think <a title="Web Application Discovery Language (WADL)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, with a API to access, and focused only on supported Google APIs.<p></p>
As the number of web APIs grow, the need for a discovery APIs and a standard description language will only grow.  We wil see services like Google APIs Discovery Service popup within specific industries and API areas.<p></p>
You see potential for this with <a title="Mashery's API Netowrk" href="http://developer.mashery.com/apis">Mashsery's API Network,</a> and even more evidence with <a title="Mashape's Marketplace" href="http://www.mashape.com/index">Mashape's Marketplace</a>.<p></p>
There aren't many companies with the number of APIs that Google has, so you won't see any single company building an API discovery service like that.<p></p>
However, I'd like to see API discovery services for cloud computing, social media, location-based, and telcommunication APIs appear making it easier for developers to discover, build code libraries, and integrate with common APIs.

<p>Of course this is virtual warehouse space, but it has a lot of the same characteristics of warehousing for physical products.</p>
<p>Google provides a <a title="3D Warehouse" href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/">3D Warehouse</a> for users of its <a title="SketchUp" href="http://sketchup.google.com/">SketchUp</a> softare, and <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> provides a marketplace and warehouse in the form a <a title="Gallery" href="http://www.shapeways.com/gallery">gallery</a> for its creators.</p>
<p>Cloud Storage will definitely have a role to play in warehousing the growing number of 3D modeling files using platforms like <a title="Google Docs" href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>, <a title="Box.net" href="http://Box.net">Box.net</a>, and <a title="Dropbox" href="/admin/blog/www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>3D Warehouses need to provide search-able, sharable and collaborative spaces that are affordable for designers to store and retrieve their work.</p>
<p>As 3D printing becomes a larger part of the global manufacturing supply chain, virtual warehousing across the globe will also become necessary to provide localized storage solutions.</p>
<p>3D printing offers significant advantages over traditional manufacturing when it comes to warehousing, but it still will be a critical part of the <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>

Someones idea to recreate an existing object, or a vision of an object they hold in their head.<p></p>
The evolution of 3D modeling software and 3D printers is creating a whole new generation of designers and creators.<p></p>
These 3D creators come from many walks of life; architects, product designers, graphic designers, artists. and beyond.<p></p>
Creators can build entire finished products, ranging from dinnerware to architectural components.<p></p>
Creators can also build parts and pieces of finished projects from nuts and bolts to replacement parts.<p></p>
3D designers and creators are often independent hobbyists and freelancers, but there are also a growing number of agencies and larger shops that are evolving along with 3D printing.<p></p>
Creators are just the first link in an evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.

<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</a></strong> - SLS is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired 3-dimensional shape.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography">Stereolithography (SLA)</a> </strong>- Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process using a vat of liquid UV-curable photopolymer resin and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling">Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)</a></strong> - FDM works on an additive principle by laying down material in layers. A plastic filament or metal wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which can turn on and off the flow.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_object_manufacturing">Laminate Object Manufacturing (LOM)</a></strong> - LOM is a rapid prototyping system that layers adhesive-coated paper, plastic, or metal laminates are successively glued together and cut to shape with a knife or laser cutter.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are four of the common 3D printing methodologies and since the introduction of metal, 3D printing has moved past prototyping and art and has become a viable manufacturing technology.</p>
<p>3D printing processes and materials are the link that  allows virtual to become physical in the <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>

<p>Marketplaces will also go beyond showcasing 3D models, and actually act as marketplaces where items can be bid upon, creating virtual economies around 3D manufacturing.</p>

<p>File formats often depend on the type of 3D modeling software used, but there are many common formats:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>.<strong>stl</strong> - STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems.</li>
<li>.<strong>iges</strong> - The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) (pronounced eye-jess) defines a neutral data format that allows the digital exchange of information among Computer-aided design (CAD) systems.</li>
<li>.<strong>obj</strong> - OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted by other 3D graphics application vendors. For the most part it is a universally accepted format.</li>
<li>.<strong>3ds</strong> - 3DS is one of the file formats used by the Autodesk 3ds Max 3D modeling, animation and rendering software.</li>

<p>A 3D scanner is a device that analyzes a real-world object to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance. The resulting data can then be used to construct 3D models.</p>
<p>3D scanning is no replacement for a human designer, but can offer a good start creating a 3D representation.</p>
<p>Each 3D scanner has its benefits and limitations, and resulting data will always need much work before it can be used in 3D printing.</p>
<p>3D scanners can offer a lot of benefit in rapid prototyping, and reverse engineering of existing objects.</p>
<p>Just like 3D printers you will find a wide range of 3D scanners, in both functionality and price.</p>

Facebook employee Simon Cross developed a <a title="Facebook Graph API Explorer" href="https://www.simoncross.com/fb/graph/">Facebook Graph API explorer</a> for developers to use when working with the <a title="Facebook Graph API" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Facebook Graph API</a>.<p></p>
The explorer lets developers specify and endpoint, and generate a JSON response, with or without an user login access token.<p></p>
Developers can also use the <a title="Facebook Graph API Explorer" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/16/the-semi-unofficial-facebook-graph-api-explorer/">Facebook Graph API explorer</a> for working FQL, which is the Facebook Query Language.<p></p>

        Canada's <a title="Yellow Pages Group" href="http://www.ypg.com/en/">Yellow Pages Group (YPG)</a> launched a new developer ecosystem to support their local search and location based services (LBS) API, <a title="YellowAPI.com" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/">YellowAPI.com</a>.
<p></p><a title="YellowAPI.com" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/yellowAPI/yellow-api.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>YPG sees their developer ecosystem much differently than many other companies, they view the YellowAPI as a direct extension of its core business model, and the API dramatically extends the reach of its business network.
<p></p>Within many API communities, the API owners can often seem distant from developers, or even view the development community as a problem.
<p></p>As a developer I've experienced the limitations imposed by Twitter and Facebook, and I often feel ignored by Google when using their APIs.
<p></p>I see YellowAPI's strategy as the future of API ecosystem management.
<p></p>Developers can <a title="apply to be part of the YPG developer community" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/member/register">apply to be part of the YellowAPI.com developer community</a>, once approved they gain access to a wealth of resources, including consultation on application design, quality assurance, legal guidance, technical assistance and can receive funding assistance to take their applications live.
<p></p>In addition to these resources, YellowAPI.com provides opportunities for developers to monetize applications in the following ways:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Paid Search</strong> - Paying for volumes of high quality traffic from applications
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Wigets</strong> - Group buying solutions in Canada and "Deal of the Day" widgets
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Advertising</strong> - Platform specific digital ad network provided by Mediative
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Placement</strong> - Premium paid search using mobile placement products
     </li>
</ul>These aren't side opportunities invented just for the API, they represent YPG's core business.
<p></p><a title="Yellow Pages Group" href="http://www.ypg.com/en/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/yellowAPI/yellow-pages-group.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>Since YPG sees the API and its ecosystem as an extension of their core business, they are opening up revenue sharing opportunities for approved developers within its community.
<p></p>If the YellowAPI community is successful in building sustainable business applications, YPG benefits. And because of the forward thinking API ecosystem strategy, when YPG makes money, the API developer community shares in this revenue.
<p></p>How do you monetize your API, and where do your developers fit in?

Pearson's Plug &amp; Play Platform claims to unlock the company's large content bank which ranges from <a title="Dorling Kindersley (DK) Publishing" href="http://us.dk.com/">Dorling Kindersley (DK) Publishing's</a> illustrated guides to Pearson Education textbooks.<p></p>
The new API platform will allow developers to mash up Pearson content with other content and data to derive entirely to types of web, mobile and tablet products.<p></p>
Pearson's Future Technologies Group Product Manager, <a title="Diane Stepner" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dianas">Diana Stepner</a>, says:
<blockquote><em>We recognise the world has changed and our content needs to be available for innovative uses outside Pearson. Plug &amp; Play opens up opportunities for DK and Pearson to connect with developers who are seeking the rich content we can share.</em></blockquote>
Pearson will be running initial platform tests using DK's Eyewitness Travel Guide material, then moving on to a wider range of subjects from science and natural history to gardening, parenting and early learning.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/publishing/dk-publishing.gif" alt="" width="175" align="right" /><p></p>
While it sounds promising that the world's largest education technology company is opening up its content via an API platform, Pearson doesn't reveal much information about just what this will entail.  What sorts of content will developers have access to?  What will access cost?  How will developers be able to monetize and license their projects that are based on the API?<p></p>
More details will be forthcoming, as Pearson says the Plug &amp; Play Platform is slated for launch in early 2012.

Affiliate members can earn up to 15% in commission for referrals to the site that result in a purchase.<p></p>
Amazon also provides a <a title="Product Advertising API" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html?ie=UTF8&amp;pf_rd_t=501&amp;ref_=amb_link_84018271_9&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=&amp;pf_rd_s=assoc-right-1&amp;pf_rd_r=&amp;pf_rd_i=assoc_join_menu">Product Advertising API</a> for its more tech savvy affiliates to take advantage of.<p></p>

In addition to having access to the millions of products in its catalog, the Product Advertising API lets developers leverage Amazon's other features such as customer reviews, similar products, accessories, and listmania lists.<p></p>
The most important aspect of Amazons approach to its affiliate and API offerings is that it automatically formats the URLs returned by the API to include the associate tag, which is the piece that links a referral and purchase to a developers affiliate account.<p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/05/05/hazards-of-developers-evangelist-for-an-api/">Hazards of Developers Evangelist for an API.</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/mimeo_connect_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I'm working to make it easier to get up and running using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
One concept that is tough to understand at first, is that all printing starts with a Mimeo document.<p></p>
Then using the API you can either order that document as is, or merge one or many PDF documents with it, generate a dynamic document, then order this new document.<p></p>
As part of our API, we have a Document Listing Service, except it only pulls documents from a central account I have control of.<p></p>
So if you want to pull one of the documents you created, you have to actually pull the Document ID from your My Mimeo account.<p></p>
Sounds easy right?  Well its available in the URL, and in a properties screen for the document.<p></p>
The Document ID is a GUID, for those of you who don't know what a GUID is:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A globally unique identifier or GUID (pronounced /??u??d/ or /??w?d/) is a unique reference number used as an identifier in computer software</em>
<em>So a Document ID looks like this:</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301</em>
Except for some reason the one that shows in My Mimeo is missing the dashes, and doesn't work when you pass through the API.<p></p>
So I ask my API developer, where is the easiest place to get the Document ID?<p></p>
He says, "In the URL or as property of document".<p></p>
I explain it doesn't work without dashes.<p></p>
His response is, Developers will understand, and know to put dashes back in.<p></p>
And that is a hazard of putting developers as the public face of your API.<p></p>
They make a lot of assumptions based upon what they know.<p></p>
API Evangelists and developer advocates should definitely have programming skills, but ideally they should have a balance of proramming, business and marketing skills.

As an API Evangelist I look for other APIs that enhance the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>, and try to figure out how I can leverage this, or at least tell the story.<p></p>
<a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a> and the <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a> API have been two of my favorites so far. I also just finished a blog post about <a title="creating classroom and training materials with Crocodoc and Mimeo Connect" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=99">creating classroom training materials with Crocodoc and Mimeo Connect</a>.<p></p>

APIs enable new types of partnerships, and even allow API providers to work together and offer a more collective value.<p></p>
What other APIs do you think compliment each other, and should consider partnering?

        <span class="post-date">03 May 2011</span>
        In 2006, Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase <a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Biz Dev 2.0</a> in a blog post explaining how several small companies had approached Flickr wanting to provide services that the photo-sharing site didn't feature.<p></p>
She noted that Flickr executives had little time in their schedules to arrange meetings to hash out these partnerships, and instead encouraged companies to feel free to apply for a Commercial API key and build something off the API.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /><p></p>
<a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://caterina.net/archive/000996.html">Biz Dev 2.0</a>, she called it.<p></p>
Fast forward to 2011, APIs are a common part of the technology and business landscape.<p></p>
Some API providers have evolved their API offerings into platforms, and introduced self-service application development environments.<p></p>
From the pubic side, these are seen as service or application marketplaces where users can find add-ons they can use as part of the core web application.<p></p>
Think <a title="Google Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Marketplace</a>, <a title="Facebook App Directory" href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/directory.php">Facebook App Directory</a>, and <a title="Box.net OpenBox" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net OpenBox</a>.<p></p>
From the developers point of view these offer environments where they can easily build applications that integrate with an existing platform and user base.<p></p>
From the business perspective this is <a title="Biz Dev 2.5" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/bizdev-2-5-with-apis-and-self-service-platforms/">Biz Dev 2.5</a>.  Let me give you an example.<p></p>
When I started as API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> a project that was already in the works was commercial print integration with <a title="Scribd.com" href="http://www.scribd.com">Scribd.com</a>.   After serveral months of negotiations Mimeo was able to get a button within Scribd, Print to Mimeo.<p></p>
This happened before I was around, but right before I was hired Scribd updated their application to HTML5 and the Print to Mimeo disappeared.<p></p>
To get back on Scribd's development radar would take another round of outreach, discussion and integration into their development schedule.<p></p>
Next on my list of cloud storage provider integration after Scribd, was Box.net.<p></p>
Box.net has an API and a self-service application development environment called <a title="OpenBox" href="http://www.box.net/developers/actions">OpenBox</a>.  I can add my application and integrate it into Box.net without coordinating with Box.net staff.<p></p>
Once ready I can submit for approval in the OpenBox directory, or keep private and just send invites out to users with a link directly to my OpenBox application.<p></p>
I have someone I can email at Box.net and discuss business development opportunities, but I don't have to.  I can do all the work myself.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/box-net-250x161.jpg" alt="" align="right" /><p></p>
I'm able to build an application that uses the APIs of a leading web application provider, launch that application integrated into the platform, and access the existing user-base.   When users choose to use my application it adds actions or navigation options for them that are linked to my service.<p></p>
<a title="APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/api-listing.php">APIs</a> + <a title="self-service application development environments" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application development environments</a> allow for entirely new business opportunities without the overhead of traditional business development, and with deeper integration into partner platforms.

It recognizes that APIs drive much of the Internet from social media and cloud computing to mobile applications.</p>
<p>But while there is plenty of information to get the developer community up and running with APIs, there is a shortage of information that can serve to educate the <em>business</em> community about the business of APIs.</p>
<p>The necessity of having that sort of outreach is one reason why I use the term API Evangelist instead of Developer Advocate.  While yes, developers do still need advocates, I also feel that there needs to be more evangelism to the business community about APIs and their benefits as well.</p>
<p>So I've partnered with my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a> to develop a series of guides targeting the business community.  These aim to educate businesspeople about the coming <a title="API economy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>.</p>
<p>We have just published our first guide:  <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business-of-apis.php">The Business of APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the table of contents:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>What is an API?</li>
<li>Who uses APIs?</li>
<li>What type of technologies go into an API?</li>

<li>Building blocks for a successful API</li>
<li>Fostering an API ecosystem</li>
<li>BizDev 2.5</li>
</ol>
<p>An introduction to APIs, the book is aimed at a business audience, not the developer audience.  I believe that there are a lot of business owners, executives and decision makers out there considering APIs -- they've heard that it's "the thing to do" -- who need to be educated about how APIs work.&nbsp;<a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">The Business of APIs</a> is a primer for just that sort of person.</p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-storage/Box-logo-new.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /> As the <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> API Evangelist one of my jobs is to find other platforms, services and technology that goes well with the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="../../">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
One such platform that I've identified as a Mimeo.com partner platform is <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a>.<p></p>
Box.net provides a complete cloud storage platform, with a powerful developer platform and application directory called OpenBox.<p></p>
Mimeo.com provides commercial web to print services, and with Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API you can integrate print file management from Box.net<p></p>
<em>*** Heads up!! This requires basic understanding of box.net and programming with PHP ***</em><p></p>
To do this I sign up for a <a title="Box.net Developer Account" href="http://www.box.net/developers">Box.net developers account</a> and add new OpenBox application:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Name and Description</li>
	<li>Assign a description page for the application that tells about my printer.</li>
</ul>
An important part of this application is a callback URL for when users first add the Box.net application. This has to be a page you host that handles the Box.net oAuth, which gives this print file manager access to a users account.<p></p>
Another important part of each application are whats called <em>service actions</em>.  Service actions which will show up for any user who adds this application to their Box.net account from OpenBox.<p></p>
For my Open Box Application I create a new service action:  <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/Open-Box.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Service Action a title like, <strong><em>Send Print File toMimeo</em></strong></li>
	<li>Choose which document extensions my print file manager supports, PDF for now</li>
	<li>Enter a callback function which Box.net will send user when printing document</li>
	<li>Enter callback parameters such as URL, Title, Extension of Box.net file to be printed.</li>
</ul>
Save your service action, fill out any other relevant parts of your application and hit save as well.<p></p>
This creates your application at Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need put together the code that integrates Box.net with your Mimeo.com account using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
First you need the OAuth piece of code described above, you can <a title="download at Github" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Box.net">download this at Github</a>.  It requires the following files:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>box_config.php</li>
	<li>boxlibphp5.php</li>
	<li>class.curl.php</li>
	<li>index.php</li>
</ul>
This will allow your print file manager to OAuth with Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need the actual code that lets you pull the file being passed by Box.net and print uses Mimeo.com.<p></p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-storage/Box-logo-new.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />As the <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> API Evangelist one of my jobs is to find other platforms, services and technology that goes well with the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="../../">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
One such platform that I've identified as a Mimeo.com partner platform is <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a>.<p></p>
Box.net provides a complete cloud storage platform, with a powerful developer platform and application directory called OpenBox.<p></p>
Mimeo.com provides commercial printing of many types of bound documents including spiral bound, magazine style, and perfect bound, and with Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API you can integrate printing of these using Box.net<p></p>
<em>*** Heads up!! This requires basic understanding of box.net and programming with PHP ***</em><p></p>
To do this I sign up for a <a title="Box.net Developer Account" href="http://www.box.net/developers">Box.net developers account</a> and add new OpenBox application:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Name and Description</li>
	<li>Assign a description page for the application that tells about the printer.</li>
</ul>
An important part of this application is a callback URL for when users first add the Box.net application. This has to be a page you host that handles the Box.net oAuth, which gives this bound document printer access to a users account.<p></p>
Another important part of each application are whats called <em>service actions</em>.  Service actions which will show up for any user who adds this application to their Box.net account from OpenBox.<p></p>
For my Open Box Application I create a new service action:  <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/Open-Box.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Service Action a title like, <strong><em>Bound Document Printer @ Mimeo</em></strong></li>
	<li>Choose which document extensions my printer supports, PDF for now</li>
	<li>Enter a callback function which Box.net will send user when printing document</li>
	<li>Enter callback parameters such as URL, Title, Extension of Box.net file to be printed.</li>
</ul>
Save your service action, fill out any other relevant parts of your application and hit save as well.<p></p>
This creates your application at Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need put together the code that integrates Box.net with your Mimeo.com account using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
First you need the OAuth piece of code described above, you can <a title="download at Github" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Box.net">download this at Github</a>.  It requires the following files:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>box_config.php</li>
	<li>boxlibphp5.php</li>
	<li>class.curl.php</li>
	<li>index.php</li>
</ul>
This will allow your bound document printer to OAuth with Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need the actual code that lets you pull the file being passed by Box.net and print uses Mimeo.com.<p></p>
Here is a sample code file for doing this:<p></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/950054.js?file=Box.net%20-%20Mimeo%20Connect%20Bound%20Document%20Printer"></script><p></p>
The above code sample demonstrates how to build a <a title="bound" href="../../blog/blog_detail.php?ID=90">bound document printer using Box.net cloud storage and Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
With this bound document printer you can public books, magazines, newsletters, reports and many other types of bound documents.<p></p>
You can build any custom bound document with your Mimeo.com account, with specific binding, paper, folds, covers, and much more.  Then merge this document with any multi-page document from Box..net<p></p>
Any company can build a Box.net Cloud Printer and publish to the OpenBox directory, to allow commercial printing using<p></p>
