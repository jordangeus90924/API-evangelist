{% include JB/setup %}<p>This post comes from the SDK Bridge newsletter. I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.ProgrammableWeb is known for publishing the number of public APIs in its directory, and they regularly present an impressive graph that shows how this number has increased exponentially over time.However, not all APIs are public, and ProgrammableWeb is not able to obtain information on how many non-public APIs exist.SDK Bridge writes API documentation as a service, and many of our customers have us document their non-public APIs.</p>
