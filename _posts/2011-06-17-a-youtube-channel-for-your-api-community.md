<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/youtube-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />[Twitter][1] has launched a new building block for their API community, a [YouTube Channel][2].

The new [YouTube Twitter API channel][3] will contain interviews, tutorials and other video content that is produced in support of the [Twitter API][4].

Its a great idea. Perfect way to organize videos and presentations in a central location, as they are produced. Then users can come back at anytime and learn.

A YouTube channel for an API community could also be a great way to build community, by soliciting feedback on what type of content users want to see, or even accept submissions from your developers.

I added a [YouTube channel][5] to my list of [building blocks][6] that API owners are using.
