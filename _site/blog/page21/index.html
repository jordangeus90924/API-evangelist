			<p><em>29 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am currently trying to move forward the&nbsp;917 companies, from 223 business areas, with a total 882 APIs catalogued, and 407 Swagger definitions created, while working on a distributed way to understand where the profiling for each company is, and how far in defining this in a machine readable way. I had kicked off another prototype APIs.json type a few months back I'm calling api-questions to handle just this, in a way that allows me to ask human readable questions about APis, while also storing in a distributed, machine readable format that can be indexed via each APIs.json file. I have long tracked on what public APIs are doing in a database. I keep links to Github and Twitter profiles, blogs to pricing, and terms of service. I started publishing this information to APIs.json for the companies I track on a while back. I have the information, and I'm working my way through thousands of APIs, trying to make sure there is a complete definition available, I needed an automated way to help make sure I'm asking the right quesitons consistently of each API. So, in addition to my list of Swagger oriented questions, I've compiled a list of the most common APIs.json defined, API operations related questions that I ask: Is there an API? (the most important question of them all!) Is there an APIs.json File? Is there a blog? Is there a blog RSS feed? Is there a portal? Is there a platform description? Is there getting started information? Is there documentation for the API? Is there interactive documentation for the API? Is there an authentication overview? Is there self-service registration? Is there request for access? Is there code samples? Is there code libraries? Is there SDKs? Is there email for support? Is there an FAQ section? Is there a knowledge base? Is there a forum? Is there a Twitter account? Is there a LinkedIn account? Is there a Github account? Is there...[<a href="/2015/07/29/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis-the-apis-json-edition/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>I ask a lot of questions about the API space. In m quest to make sense of the growing number of APIs in the space, I partnered with 3Scale to define the APIs.json format. In the year since we launched, I've used it to help me define almost 1000 companies that I keep an eye on in the space.&nbsp; To be able to understand APIs at scale, I had to develop a way to ask questions about a companies API operations, while also asking them of my own APIs. This project was born out of some research into making API terms of service (TOS) machine readable, which led me to the project Terms of Service Didn't Read--a very important project you should know about. Long story short, I realized how much work it would be to make APIs TOS machine readable, and distilled things down to just be able to ask simple questions about APIs like: Is there self-service registration? Can I delete my account? Do I own my data? I then quickly realized the potential for my api-questions format, and that it could help me avoid getting tangle up in the legaleze of API TOS, and speed up making sense of how APIs work. I also saw that I could apply api-questions to other areas of API operations that I already track on like code resources, pricing, and support. api-questions would be a machine readable index of the questions I ask most about APIs, from A-Z.&nbsp; To begin with I compiled almost 60 of the most common questions I ask about APIs, and launched an API to support the adding, editing, and modifying of these questions. I broken these questions down into two groups: APIs.json Questions - Things I generally wanted to know about API operations. Swagger Questions - Things I wanted to know specifically about the API, and since I profile them using Swagger... I have started apply an api-questions approach to the...[<a href="/2015/07/29/asking-the-right-questions-of-api-operations/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>I did a napkin doodle the other day at my favorite local hangout during lunch and beers. I was thinking about the finer points of the API economy that I dwell on, and feel are important not just for API success, but also developer, end-user, and industry level health. In this doodle, I'm trying to think about where I need to focus my energy when working to keep the API pipes as transparent and open as possible. For me, this isn't just an API story, this is a story about the evolution fo the web, and ultimately a story of the journey humans are on, when it comes to defining our virtual self, that participates in the online domains that capture our attention on a daily basis. I wanted to better understand how companies are moving digital assets online, generating new resources, which are often times user-generated resources, empowered by developers. This is a complex world unfolding, and here was my attempt to better understand. I worked to distill this down, and represent the key actors, and struggles, we are facing as the API economy becomes a reality. Companies are moving more digital resources online, while also developing platforms for users and developers to generate, and work with valuable resources like images, text, videos, and more. These resources (or lifebits to users) live within the growing number of virtual domains. In the early Internet days, these resources were often static content, but around 2005, during the web 2.0 phase, things became much more more dynamic. This evolution continued with mobile, and is only picking up momentum with the Internet of Things. These resources x domains x users x apps x developers = the units that make up the API economy.&nbsp; The relationship between all the actors involved in the exchange of these units, are often being managed by oAuth, but also other more simplistic ways like keys, passwords, etc. Identity is king, of serious value...[<a href="/2015/07/27/politics-of-the-api-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>Most of the APIs you find out there are read only, meaning they act like a website and just allow you to retrieve data, content, and other media types, but usually do not let you read or write any data to them. I wrote a while back about&nbsp;augmenting a read only API with an external POST, PUT, and DELETE&nbsp;as I came out of the government, but wanted to update the topic, based upon some open data work I'm doing with RESTlet API Spark. I am preparing for my Restlet Summer of APIs webinar tomorrow morning, so I am publishing some open data files (CSV, Excel, etc.) to the platform, generating data stores, and ultimately APIs. A simple example of this in action would be with farmers market data from the US Department of Agriculture. There is a farmers market API, but it leaves a lot to be desired, something others, like Code for America have tried to solve, but I figured I could not just launch an API from the open dataset, I would make it read and write. Deploying an API with Restlet's APISpark is pretty straightforward, something I will build a more detail walk-through in the future, but to summarize, you just download the Excel file from data.gov, and upload to Google Spreadsheet. Once you have cleaned up the spreadsheet, fields, and other elements, you can connect to your Google Drive using API Spark, and generate an entity data store--you now have a separate copy of the Google Spreadsheet, stored on APISpark.&nbsp; Next, you can publish a web API using the service, something you can use to launch multiple versions, require authentication to use, track usage, and much more. The great part, is it doesn't just generate the GET for your API, you also get the POST, PUT, and DELETE. You have now have a full read and write API for Farmers Market dataset. You could now accept submissions from Famer Market owners,...[<a href="/2015/07/26/augmenting-data-sources-and-apis-with-post-put-and-delete-using-restlet-apispark/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>I was asked by folks at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide some feedback on the Envirofacts Data Service API, as they prepare to work on the next iteration. I took a quick glance at the landing page for their service, I saw a simple URL layout showing how to make API calls, and made an estimate that it would take me probably an hour or two (at the most) to profile the API. As I dug into the process of profiling the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API one evening in May, I realized I was wrong about the scope of the API, and became unsure how long it would actually take me. Then this work got lost in the shuffle of my summer, and is something I only recently picked up. I'm not happy if I can't provide an agency with some direction on where to go next, and after about 12 hours of work, I think I have some valuable feedback that they can run with. The&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API program consists of a single landing page, with an overview of how to use the API, and a myriad of pages below, that explain the underlying data model put to use. The API is what I consider a very resource driven API design, meaning it reflects the database resource it came from, and not much emphasis on how the API driven resources will be used. While the API does use the URL, it uses few of the other HTTP components that make some RESTful. I can see how the design would make sense to a database engineer, but will be a little confusing for API developers. After looking beyond this portal I have since found other possible APIs, but honestly they are often even more incoherent than the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API. I'm not trying to review the entire EPA API efforts, and will be specifically focusing on the resources available in the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service...[<a href="/2015/07/25/taking-a-look-at-whats-next-for-the-environmental-protection-agency-epa-envirofacts-data-service-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
API Evangelist has always been about helping on-board the masses with concepts involving APIs, something that takes a lot of work, because more often than not, an API is a very abstract concept, far removed from the everyday lives of normal people. When services like Zapier launched, I became very optimistic about how APIs can be put to work by the average individual, and today my optimism went up another notch, with the redesign of Blockspring.
The Blockspring home page image says it all in my opinion--valuable API resources, neatly available in Google Sheets, and Excel on the desktop, and in the Cloud with Office 365:

This is it! This is the window to the API economy that will be required to take things to the next level. Most of the worlds business is conducted through this interface, without drag and drop access to valuable API resources, the API economy is a non-starter.
I've been tracking on Blockspring for a while, and have been working with them to define machine readable API definitions in Swagger that they can use in their spreadsheet connector(s). However their site redesign really struck a chord with me when it comes to the API Evangelist mission, something I wanted to take a moment to share.&nbsp;

			<p>Bruno Pedro (@bpedro) who has been building APIs.json into his API Changelog service, made a pull request to the specification recently, pushing forward the link relation conversation for APIs.json. As listed in the specification, we have long intended to make APIs.json an official media type: 3.5. &nbsp;Media Type It is intended that if there is sufficient traction, the media type "application/apis+json" will be&nbsp;&nbsp; submitted to IANA as per RFC:&nbsp;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4288 However when it came to expressing your APIs.json as a link relation, we didn't even really have a plan in our road-map, resulting in a very generic allocation of a link relation for APIs.json. 3.8. Link Relation &nbsp;In order for an API to reference its own description, it is recommended that it include header or in-line references to the APIs.json file using the existing described by link relation: [Note, this is a generic link relation but seems to fit the bill] What Bruno is suggesting that we get a little more precise when it comes to our link relation, something the rest of the governing group for APIs.json agrees with. Here is the last update to the link relation: 3.8. Link Relation&nbsp; In order for a Web site to reference its API description, it is recommended that it includes a header or&nbsp;&nbsp; in-line reference to the APIs.json resource using the api link relation, e.g.:&nbsp; It is intended that if there is sufficient traction, the link relation &ldquo;api&rdquo; will be&nbsp;&nbsp; submitted to IANA as per RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988 As with the media type, we intend to submit the link relation to Iana, per its RFC. Bruno's pull request sets in motion the formal link relation, but then also escalates the media type submission as well.&nbsp; With the interest and usage we have seen in the first year of the specification, we are confident the API discovery format will get traction.

			<p>I open up my Thursdays to briefings, calls, demos and other phone, skype, and hangout related activities. This morning I received a walk-through of the JustAPIs platform from AnyPresence, taking my thoughts in a much different direction than in my conversation with Wavemaker, which was at the intersection of API design and API gateway in this new cloud-based, single page application design studio.&nbsp; JustAPIs is a downloadable, installable, portable, little API design, deployment, and management engine, which you can install on Linux, Windows, Mac, and even your Raspberry Pi. This represent the functionality I have in mind, when I think about the future of what is an API gateway--a little node that can put ANYWHERE to serve up, proxy, and manage my APis. I downloaded JustAPis, ran at localhost, and begin mapping it to a handful of my remote APIs, and crafting a couple simple APIs to understand what is possible. Its obvious there is still a lot of work to be done, as the whole management side of JustAPIs is under construction, but I like what I see so far. I like the micro gateway characteristic. I think it has potential in not just the API economy, but specifically in the mobile, and IoT layers of the API economy.&nbsp; As with my Wavemaker discussion today, there are aspects of JustAPIs I'd like to see a become a reaility, in the realm of hypermedia, discovery with APIs.json, and portability, and interoperability using API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, but it is a great start. JustAPIs is a significant movement forward in the evolution my perception of just what is an API gateway, and after talking with the JustAPIs team, I am confident that because of the extensibility available in the solution, it will become a ubiquitous layer of the API economy. JustAPIs dovetails nicely with other movements I'm watching in the API space around containerization, and software defined networking.

			<p>I open up my Thursdays to briefings, calls, demos and other phone, skype, and hangout related activities. This morning I received a walk-through of the Wavemaker Online platform, and got a look at the intersection of API design and API gateway in this new cloud-based, single page application design studio.&nbsp; I bitched a little the other day about the Amazon API Gateway released, talking about how I was underwhelmed, and I also blew some hot air about deploying APIs using a gateway solution vs. what I call farm to table API development, but ultimately I'm just pushing myself to think harder about how we not just deploy our APIs, but keep in alignment with our design, and management processes. It was interesting that more than one call this Thursday are in alignment with this journey I find myself on--good timing Wavemaker.&nbsp; The screenshot below from my WaveMaker Studio workspace tells an important story. This is API design, deployment, and management, all in the service of rapidly deploying a single page app client, via a single platform.&nbsp;While Wavemarker has their own gateway solution as well, the WaveMaker Online Studio has "gateway-esque"features in it, allowing me to design and deploy APIs in support of my single page application, and widget development. Wavemaker speaks the common gateway speak I would say that your average application designer would need to speak, allowing you to craft APIs for your apps from other web APIs, SOAP, APIs, feeds, and databases (the common gateway building block). You just define each of the resources you depend on, and they are available in your toolbox. I'm going to call this API gateway light(wish I had better word). This gateway is in the service of single page application development (which is another spect I like), and I'm assuming they could be part of your larger Wavemaker API strategy, but they might also never be used past this single implementation.

			<p><em>22 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>I was wallowing in the exhaust of my previous story on Amazon API Gateway, and talking with an API development team about their preferred way to launch an API today. Leaving me thinking...what is the better way to design, and deploy an API? Gateway or hand-crafted? &nbsp;Ok, cut to the chase, its a bullshit question, but for the sake of working through my own anxiety, I'm going to explore. For my audience, I'm going to oversimplify what an API gateway is by stating it is a hardware and / or software appliance you can you use to connect to any existing, internal system like a database, CRM, or other, and then quickly and efficiently design, deploy and manage APIs driven by these resources. Personally I am from the artisan, farm to table guild of API architects--I prefer to hand craft my APIs. Well OK, that is bullshit--I use an API framework, but I wire it up by hand to whatever is the original resource is (database, file-store, other API). This is just my style, and probably most aligned with the fact that I cannot afford any API gateway--something the release of Amazon API gateway has me thinking more about.&nbsp; My overall opinion of the gateways I've used is that they lack the amount of granular level control I desire--maybe this is just me. However this is something that is being re-examined for me because of the emergence latest cloud-based API service providers like Restlet APISpark, Wavemaker, DreamFactory, Apitite--and AWS. Honestly I think Amazon will skew the concept of what is an API gateway with their new offering, they just took the name to sell it to the enterprise. I guess I didn't even have a real point to this story. I just wanted to talk to my API therapist about my own enterprise API gateway baggage and PTSD, and justify my hippie dippe, artisan approach to APIs. Sucka...I got you to listen!! In the end...[<a href="/2015/07/22/thoughts-on-api-gateway-deployment-over-artisan-farm-to-table-api-design-and-deployment/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>I told a contact of mine at the Environmental Protection Agency I would provide some feedback for the next iteration of the Envirofacts Data Service API, and as I prepare my formal response, there is a huge opportunity for me to carve off some other smaller stories. These stories are what make API Evangelist go around--pulling off these nuggets of learningz, as I'm working with API various providers.&nbsp; A concept I work hard to help API designers and architect adopt is around experience-based API design over resource based API design. Something I learned from my friend Daniel Jacobson (@daniel_jacobson) at Netflix, but have been taking it in different directions to help designers and architects from smaller API groups, adopt this way of life--I feel like my work today on the Envirofacts Data Service API provide a great opportunity to move this conversation forward. When you land on the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API page, you are given a single base URL to employ when "constructing a search" for the API: Ok, not the best API design, a little confusing, but where do I find the list of possible values for every potential path variable? I scroll down and see some examples, but I have to read the opening paragraph again, before I find a link to the data model. Once I click on the text link, I'm faced with 20 separate "tables"--which in reality are 20 separate APIs, all housed under the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API. (who named this??) This is resource based API design. You craft an API, that either resembles, or in this case is exactly named just like your database, and its fields. This type of API design, while very appealing to database administrators (DBA), but will leave any new API developer and potential "customer", pretty lost, left with having to work overtime just to understand what is possible. (you can do more work on my behalf) I had no idea the&nbsp;Envirofacts Data Service API...[<a href="/2015/07/22/an-example-of-resource-based-api-design-over-at-the-envirofacts-data-service-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>As I tune into the fallout around the Reddit community, I think it is a good time to pull a story out of my notebook, that I began writing a month or two ago. These thoughts are born out of my post&nbsp;Ask The Stack When You Need API Support, where my friend&nbsp;Jeremiah Lee (@JeremiahLee) commented, disagreeing with my recommendation that API providers use Stack Exchange as part of operations.&nbsp; Jeremiah shares his story about how hostile Stack Overflow can be (I'll let you read his comment on your own), something that has been re-enforced many times along the way. While I still endorse Stack Overflow as a valuable building block for some APIs, I completely agree with Jeremiah about the overall community tone. While Stack Overflow is definitely a different beast, it suffers from some of the similar systemic illnesses, that Reddit does. I find some very valuable information on Stack Overflow, which I use regularly, but if you are looking to develop an API community, I can envision the community potentially working against you, in several ways. It really depends on your API, and the target audience you are trying to reach. Sometimes, the male dominated, "gamified community of meritocracy, where established members have many rules and politics", as Jermiah says, is exactly who you should be engaging, but you really need get to know the personae of your ideal customers, and decide on your own. For API Evangelist, both my storytelling, and the APIs I provide, I've long felt Stack Overflow is not my target audience. Similar to Reddit, Hacker News, and DZone, I get very little value from these communities. While I do find nuggets of information at these places, I do not post my stories, and engage in conversations there, because the hostility that can come from these channels I have found outweighs any value they might bring in traffic. I seek a much wider audience, than the individuals who often...[<a href="/2015/07/21/using-existing-online-forums-vs-developing-your-own-to-support-api-operations/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I have spent a lot of time thinking about API analytics. Understanding who is signing up to access API resources, and how they are putting those API resources to use, is one of the most valuable aspects of modern API management solutions in my opinion. The awareness derived from API operations that use analytics, can have the biggest impact on not just how you run your API, but how you craft your API products, tailor your monetization strategy, evolve your overall roadmap and company. API analytics was the topic of a webinar I conducted with WSO2, one of my partners, this morning. I've been invested in WSO2 since they first contacted me for feedback on their then upcoming release of their open source API management solution. During this mornings webinar, I gave the basics on "why" API analytics during this mornings webinar, then sat back and listened to&nbsp;Nuwan Dias&nbsp;demonstrate the "how" of it. First thing that caught my attention was the WSO2 predictive analytics, which is a concept I have to say I have never thought about, but will be pondering more around what this might mean (or not) to the business and politics of API operations. Another thing that caught my attention was an idea Nuwan shared during the QA, about API monetization at the API analytics layer--very interesting thought. While the conversation is not as far as long as I'd hoped by 2015, the concept of using API analytics to help you craft your API monetization strategy is pretty well established. API providers like 3Scale and WSO2 have been helping API providers understand the value delivered via APIs, while also providing a framework for crafting service tiers, pricing, and manage usage and billing for API consumers--what Nuwan is thinking about, takes this up another level. A generation 1.0 API monetization scenario might be an art gallery, who could have an API that feeds the gallery web or mobile app, and during the planning...[<a href="/2015/07/21/taking-api-monetization-to-the-next-level-by-monetizing-the-exhaust-around-api-consumption/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>I recently went through my API design research, updating and evolving it, to help me better understand changes in the API design space, while also sharing as much of the information as I can with my readers. One of the resources I include under my tools section are the increasing number of API design guides being published.&nbsp; Currently I'm showcasing the API design guides for 18F in the federal government, Heroku, and PayPal, then the other day my friend Holger Reinhardt (@hlgr360), formerly of CA Technologies, now the CTO at the&nbsp;Haufe Group in Germany, shared his teams API design guidie with me. The executive summary for the guide says it well: Purpose of this style guide is to gather a list of rules, best practices, resources and our way of creating REST APIs in Haufe Group. The style guide addresses API Designers, mostly developers and architects, who want to design an API. Intention is to ease the design process by providing helpful rules to create a successful API that your customers will love. One thing I really like, is they also added "please follow the guidelines but don't follow blindly! you can break the rules with justification". Overall the API design guide is full of very pragmatic API design theory, much of what I've heard before, but also emphasizes some very import, forward thinking aspects of modern web API as well.&nbsp; The design guide leads with some very sound API wisdom: You should think of an API like a product. Indeed a Business API is a product. Design your API with a customer, or at least with a customer in mind and Get Feedback. Do not implement API Management (use existing services) Every API MUST be described using a formal API description language API clients MUST use a self-service API portal to get access to the API via an API Key After that, they do not miss a beat going into REST principles stating: "All...[<a href="/2015/07/21/as-the-api-design-space-grows-more-companies-are-publishing-their-api-design-guides-to-github/">Read More</a>]</p>

All of my public web sites, research projects, API portals, and micro apps run on Github Pages, which means there is always a Github repository behind each website. I'd say 75% of my projects have a publicly available master repo, as well as a publicly available gh-pages repo. This approach to running public infrastructure, i feel does one important thing--it opens up all of my work for community contributions.
Beyond just accepting outside contributions, there are many other secondary effects to this way of operation. The first is that anyone can submit blog posts, pages, and any other data or content they desire. The second is that anyone can fix or correct anything you find across my network of sites and apps. Some of my favoritest grammar and spelling trolls in the world, have forked, and submitted pull requests to help edit my work. :-) &lt;3
I have had other grammar trolls who laugh at me when I suggest the fact that they can edit my work. I know that most of it is centered around insecurity in understanding Github, and Jekyll, but they also think it is ridiculous that I wouldn't polish my work, let alone ask others to do it for free. i mean c'mon!!
The API Evangelist network is an open workbench for the API space. I actively work here, to curate information, data, and content that is relevant to the space. If you see something missing, you can add it. If you see a typo, or grammar hiccup, you can correct. Remember the API space is yours too, and it is what we make it.
Thanks for your contributions--I depend on all of you to help me make sure API Evangelist is complete.&nbsp;

My storytelling on API Evangelist has two sides, one is about refining my own understanding of the API space, and the other is about refining, evolving, and helping make the stories I tell make sense to the widest possible audience that I can. I spent the week around a number of folks who had no idea what an API was, they had heard about them, but admitted that they really did not get what they were. Coming out of this experience, I felt the need to take another crack at the most fundamental API question out there--what exactly is an API?
APIs are just the next step in the evolution of the World Wide Web (aka WWW), which is virtual space where HTML documents are accessible via URLs on the Internet--which allows humans to browse, and consume (or create) information, data, and media (photos, videos, etc). APIs are the same thing, but instead of returning HTML for humans, it returns XML and JSON that is meant to be used by other computer systems, applications, devices.&nbsp;
Companies provide HTML web pages, so their customers can access information, data, and media. APIs enable companies to provide the same resources to websites, web or mobile application, and increasingly physical devices in our real world, like home appliances, our cars. APIs are not a single companies product or service, it is just the next evolution of the web, which gives companies a wider reach than just a single website.
In the early days of the web, only developers were using it, and now EVERYONE is using it. In 2015, we are just coming to the end of the phase where only developers are putting APIs to work, and we are entering the phase where API service providers like Zapier, APISpark, and Blockspring enable anyone to deploy, consume, and orchestrate with APIs--no programming required.

			<p><em>17 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>A core aspect of my mission as the API Evangelist is to help bring awareness amongst "the normals" of what an API is, as just how ubiquitous they are becoming. While I am excited about the potential of APIs in the hands of the developers, I am increasingly optimistic about the potential of APIs in the hands of non-developers. I think what developers have done with APIs is just the tip of the iceberg, when it comes to the API opportunity. What developers do with APIs is just one step forward in the evolution of software development and information technology, where APIs in the hands of the average citizen and business person has the potential to actually democratize digital resources--something you hear API developers and providers trumpet. The average individual and business person tend to be much closer to actual problems that need to be solved, rather than just looking to develop an app that reflects a developer's own interests. I've longed talked about the potential around&nbsp;API reciprocity providers like IFTTT and Zapier, and how they provide valuable services that help the average Internet citizen manage their online, businesses and personal lives. Another similar area of growth in the API space that is fast growing is around using APIs for deploying APIs, as well as being employed as an API client. This is something that is significantly picking up speed with the help of API service providers like Restlet APISpark, and Blockspring. Using Restlet's APISpark platform, anyone can deploy an API from a Google Spreadsheet, and using Blockspring any user can put the growing number of public and private APIs to work, in the environment that is most familiar to them--the spreadsheet. I'm working with Blockspring to define Swagger definitions for the best public APIs available today, which will significantly increase the momentum around API usage, amongst non-developers.

			<p>The story of Pinboard's sixth anniversary came up on my API monitoring this last week, and beside being funny as shit, it reminded me of how successful APIs can be, even when they do not follow traditional funding paths. Let me preface this with the fact I'm not against companies seeking funding, so that the usual suspects do not crawl up my ass. In my opinion, Pinboard is an important API economy story, and something I want make sure API entrpreneurs hear.&nbsp; First, I am a pinboard API customer. I was one of his early buy-in customers, and it has been a critical aspect of API Evangelist operations ever since. If you read stories on my blog, or read my API.Report, you are seeing the value exhaust generated by Pinboard. Pinboard is service that does one thing well. Maciej Ceglowski, the founder of Pinboard has done well in providing the social bookmarking service, complete with a simple, yet robust API. He has worked to optimize his business model, in an open transparent way, that doesn't negatively impact users, while also keeping the service up and running for six years--without taking VC money that could potentially change everything that is Pinboard.&nbsp; I used Pinboard along with AWS, and Instagram in my support of EFF in filing the Amicus brief in the Oracle vs. Google API copyright case, in addition to depending on it for my own operations. Pinboard is a cornerstone of my world, and I consider it to also be very important model for the API economy. Not every resource, available in the API needs VC funding, something that in my opinion has derailed some very valuable API operations.&nbsp; When crafting your own APIs strategy, and thinking through your business operations, please think of Pinboard. While the service may not be the shining unicorn Silicon Valley worships, it is an extermely valuable part of the API economy, a sustainable business for&nbsp;Maciej Ceglowski, and all without...[<a href="/2015/07/17/not-every-successful-api-needs-venture-capital/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>Those in the know with hypermedia, often express their frustration when it comes to the overall progress of hypermedia adoption, and the bespoke approaches of many API designers. while there are many hypermedia skeptics who just don't buy into the concept, I think there are many out there who would be willing to to apply common hypermedia patterns in their work, but face many challenges. I'd put myself in between those willing participants, and those in the know. I get the the concepts at play, but I wouldn't say I know what I'm doing. I am working to apply Siren, one of the leading formats, to my curation API. In my work, I do not struggle with a willingness to do it, I struggle with my high cognitive load.&nbsp; According to practioners, cognitive load theory&nbsp;is borken down into three types: Intrinsic - The effort associated with a specific topic Extraneous - The way information or tasks are presented to a learner Germane - The work put into creating a permanent store of knowledge, or a&nbsp;schema I suffer in all three of these areas, and I know many other people do, they are just not willing to admit it--I have no problem admitting to what I do not know, or do have time to learn. My cognitive load is extremely high, and I know almost everyone in the API world is in the same boat. Hell, everyone is potentially in the same boat, when it comes to Internet technology. There are some aspects of cognitive load I don't think we can solve 100%, we are just in an age of information overload, but I think there is some responsibility that hypermedia need to own. &nbsp; As I read more about cognitive load theory, I find that it "... has been designed to provide guidelines intended to assist in the presentation of information in a manner that encourages learner activities that optimize intellectual performance".

			<p><em>12 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am pretty demanding today, I just asked for sandbox environments to be default for all APIs, and now I'd like to see a universal /me API. I am profiling AngelList API, as part of my API Stack work, and while AngelList does not have it broke out as its own endpoint on the menu (it is just buried in the oAuth section), I thought it was worth breaking out all by itself.
At AngeList, when I hit the api.angel.co/1/me endpoint, it gives me back everything about me on AngelList. To make it work, I have to pass along a valid oAuth token, which I generated from my AngelList account, which is how the API knows who I am. As I was playing with this API, and breaking out as its own Swagger file, as part of my AngelList API profiling, I can't help but want this feature everywhere.
Wouldn't it be nice to be given oAuth controls for ANY account online, whether it was a tech company like Twitter, or a government agency like the US Census Bureau. Using oAuth, you could generate an App (w/ token), and easily make a call to /me, and find out everything a company knows about you, and I mean EVERYTHING. Using oAuth you could easily open up this access to anyone 3rd party provider you wanted to, for any period of time you desired.
/me, provides a very powerful endpoint to frame discussions about our digital self. As we continue to spread our lifebits across the Internetz, we are going to have to demand more /me endpoints for platforms, as well as oAuth control over the lifebit exhaust we generate--as a basic human right. I'll keep building on my own definition of what /me endpoints should be available, and who knows maybe someday a universal /me API will be a default approach for any online domain.

			<p><em>11 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am working through every endpoint of the AngelList API, making sure I make as many successful calls as I can, as I work to generate Swagger definitions for the API, using Charles Proxy. To support this effort I setup each endpoint in Postman, and populate enough detail about an API to make a successful call--which I record through Charles, and then import to generate a semi-complete Swagger spec. Some of the API endpoints requires adding and deleting of information. For example I will add a comment to my profile, then update in, and remove it, all in a series of API calls. Most of the time I can accomplish this without doing much damage to my live profile, but sometimes it requires sending messages to people, initiating processes that trigger other system aspects that I may not be able to undo. As I'm playing with the AngelList Reservations API, which&nbsp;"are non-binding commitments to invest in a startup's current fundraising round", I can't help but think how nice a sandbox environment would be, as well as some dummy data to help me in my API journey. Some APIs I play with provide a sandbox environment, but I'd say it is not a common enough occurrence.&nbsp; I'm seeing service emerge to cater to this need, as with Sandbox, which is a service layer of the API lifecycle I think will only grow in coming months. I can see the need to create simple sandbox for any APIs as you are kicking tires, but I can also see the need for sophisticated simulation environments built on top of common APIs, allowing some apps to test out more advanced, and specialized scenarios. If you need an example of this, take a look at what Carvoyant is up to in the connected car realm. While sandboxes, and simulations may not be as critical as in the world of cars, I think be critical for developers to build the next...[<a href="/2015/07/11/i-wish-all-apis-had-sandbox-environment-by-default/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I shared my view on the AWS API Gateway yesterday. I'm all about the AWS kool-aid (oh yeah!), but overall I was left underwhelmed. I feel the release of the API solutions represents a pretty significant milestone along the API highway, but overall I think we should be further on down the road.
There is much to celebrate about what AWS is up to. It acknowledges the need to deploy APIs from the common resources we have move into the cloud, and provides us some pretty forward thinking ways of crafting&nbsp;resource-based API that uses Hypertext Application Language (HAL). #WINNING
I'm sure AWS chose their wording very carefully when they named the project, but where the AWS API solution falls short for me, is with the concept of a gateway (that this moves us forward). I'm all behind what AWS is delivering for consumers, I just do not get behind paving over the lessons learned when migrating these legacy resources (holy shit--we have legacy resources in the cloud), and evolving them (along with our on-premise ones) towards a more sensible resource-based API-centric approach.
I just would like to see less gateway, and more HTTP, Hypermedia (Siren, Collections+JSON, JSON-LD), and API literacy along the way, something that could be incorporated into the road-map (wink, wink). While there are forwarding thinking aspects of the AWS API Gateway, I feel like it is more crafted to deliver what the enterprise will buy, and not necessarily what they need to put them on the meaningful API journey they need to be on--this feels more like a vendor journey to me.
As my friend Steve Klabnik says, it can be tough when your idols fail you--when we hold them up so high. Anyways, we are just getting started with AWS API Gateway, maybe there still is hope! ;-)

			<p><em>09 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>It has been almost 10 years since Amazon shifted the conversation on the Internetz, with their release of&nbsp;Amazon S3, and&nbsp;Amazon EC2&nbsp;-- showing us that web APIs were more than just a hobby thing you do in this new social kids game, but that you could actually deploy any digital resource, including storage and compute, at a global scale. As I process the release information about AWS API Gateway today,&nbsp;I can hear the echoes of Jeff Bezos's now mythical mandate:&nbsp; All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces. Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces. There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team&rsquo;s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what technology they use. All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions. Closing with: &nbsp;Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t do this will be fired. &nbsp;Thank you; have a nice day!&nbsp; In 2015, Bezos is now making this mandate to you, in your own business operations. If you do not embrace APIs, as the next step in the evolution of the web, you will not make the cut. Goodbye! In the early 2000's, it was unacceptable to Bezos that his businesses didn't operate in an API -entric way. By 2006, Amazon was leading by example, showing all of us how Amazon had identified essential digital assets, optimze their usage internally using APIs, and then externalize via a publicly available API driven platform--something we now call cloud computing. In 2015, AWS is continuing to define their core competencies as API centric services, but this time opening their methodology to you, so that you will embark...[<a href="/2015/07/09/the-new-aws-api-gateway-anyone-who-does-not-do-this-will-be-fired-thank-you-have-a-nice-day-jeff-bezos/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>When API Evangelist began five years ago it was a single research into the business of APIs, which ultimately became a research project which I called API management. Over the last four years, I have spliced off other areas of research including the elements of my core research into API design, deployment, management, integration, evangelism, and monetization.&nbsp; My goal with each research project, is to evolve my understanding of each area of the API space by identifying the key companies and organizations involved, the open tooling being developed and put to work, and some of the common building blocks that make up each area. For each of my research projects, you can visit its Github repository to get regular updates, but I find many people seem to prefer browsing a single, portable paper of my research. Each year I usually published a PDF version of each research project, something I have always intended to update regularly. However it seems, this is usually is an annual thing that I find time for in the summer. To helpl change this, I've evolved my own tooling for publishing for what I considers guides to my research areas, allowing me to more easily publish the information and content I regularly curate about the space.&nbsp; I just finished v1 of my paper API, which allows me to aggregate pages, organizations, building blocks, tools, and news that I curate, into field guides for my research. Using this new API, i intend to update each of my core research areas each month, getting more disciplined about distilling my research down to a single, coherent story.&nbsp; Here is a copy of my API design research as a single PDF guide, you can also find it on the main navigation for my API design research. Now that I have my paper API stabilized, I will going through API deployment, and management, publishing a research guide for each.

			<p><em>07 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>I got an email from Amazon Web Services this morning, regarding a set of API keys I setup a while back, for a prototype I was building. The project was over a year ago, and the keys have not been evolved, and managed like I do with the rest of my regularly used AWS API keys.&nbsp; Here is the email I received: We noticed that your account contains root access keys that are more than 1 year old. As a security best practice, AWS recommends removing your root access keys entirely and using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instead. At a minimum we recommend rotating access keys regularly or removing access keys if they are no longer in use.&nbsp;To help you determine whether your access keys are safe to rotate or delete, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) now reports the time stamp&nbsp;when access keys for an IAM user or root account were last used, along with the region and the AWS service that was accessed. These details complement&nbsp;password last used&nbsp;data to provide a more thorough picture of when an IAM user or root account was last active.&nbsp;To view your root access keys and when they were last used, go to the&nbsp;security credentials page&nbsp;in the AWS Management Console. After you have located the old keys, rotate or delete them by using&nbsp;these steps. Note that you can also view the access keys of an IAM user in the&nbsp;IAM console&nbsp;or see a snapshot of all the access keys in your AWS account by downloading an&nbsp;IAM credential report.To learn more, read&nbsp;Best Practices for Managing AWS Access Keys&nbsp;in the AWS documentation.&nbsp; I like the fact that they notify me about keys like this, and they provide me with links to resources where I can management my API keys, see when they were last used, and also provide access to best practices around key management.

			<p>I wrote about Intuit's acquisition of API reciprocity provider&nbsp;itDuzzit last summer, and earlier this month they made the acquired technology available as a new platform extension, they are calling&nbsp;Intuit AppConnect Beta. I have been tracking on API reciprocity providers for some time now, something you see API providers adopting at an increasing rate, as a standard building block for their API ecosystems. API reciprocity tools and services like Intuit AppConnect, help connect APIs, in ways that even non-developers can take advantage of, making the overall API conversation, available to a much wider audience. Intuit describes their new offerings as: Intuit AppConnect is an iPaaS (integration Platform-as-a-Service) offering that runs wholly on Intuit&rsquo;s AWS stack. With Intuit AppConnect, 3rd-party developers have a faster, simpler way to create integrations between their apps and QuickBooks Online &ndash; without needing to cut or deploy code, and without writing directly to APIs that might change over time. iPaaS is a huge growth area for the API industry. I choose to call this layer of the API world, API reciprocity, because if you don't make the approach about ALL parties involved, the platform, developer, and the end-user--it is just yet another IT effort. iPaaS is just the next step of ETL, where we move bits and bytes around online in the cloud as opposed to the corporate network. API reciprocity is doing this, but remembers those bits and bytes you are moving around, mean something to every human and business or organization involved. As I stated in last summer's post about Intuit's acquisition, API reciprocity is increasingly important for API providers who are looking to reach a wider business audience, elevating an API platform from just a developer thing, to a business thing--something that is essential to Intuit's small business audience. API providers who don't have the resources that Intuit possess can use popular iPaaS / reciprocity providers like Zapier, which is something I'm seeing become more common place--take a look...[<a href="/2015/07/07/intuit-baked-their-itduzzit-acquisition-into-their-platform-and-are-calling-it-intuit-appconnect/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>Building on what Orlando (@orliesaurus) brings up in his story on the missing brick in the API Industry, we are missing a common place to discovery and share common API designs--something I've been working hard on with my API Stack. As I read this piece from Microsoft Azure on&nbsp;Container Apps now available in the Azure Marketplace, I'm reminded of how robust the app deployment, and management ecosystem has become with the containerization evolution, but when it comes to API deployment we are still way behind the times. There are numerous containerized marketplaces of apps available out there today, what I am looking for is the same thing, but for common API patterns. After over 10 years of solid design, deployment, and management of web API patterns, we should have a wealth of API design patterns to choose from. I shouldn't have to launch my own user API, or image API, there should be the WordPress of APIs out there, ready for me to deploy. These APIs should be available with common API patterns, well defined using Swagger and API Blueprint, available in a variety of server side languages from PHP to Go. I should be able to search, and browse these APIs, and with a single click of a button deploy into my containerized architecture of choice, from Amazon to Google, and Microsoft to the Raspberry Pi in my living room--think Heroku deploy button. Ok, back to work on defining the common public APIs out there on my API Stack, could someone please get to work on this containerized API marketplace? I have a number of standardized API definitions I can share to get you going, and happy to focus on crafting any new ones you need, derived from common patterns I'm finding across my API Stack work. There is a reason we have the bespoke API design, and deployment way of life--everyone is lacking the marketplace of ready-to-go, containerized APis, that individuals, businesses, institutions,...[<a href="/2015/07/06/where-is-the-containerized-api-marketplace-that-businesses-will-need-for-success-in-the-api-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

I have encouraged anyone to step up and help me profile these companies, join the conversation via the Github issues where the API stack is hosted, resulting in some really nice folks jumping in to hellp me tackle the hard work. One of these brave souls who stepped up, and get their hands dirty is Bob Salita, who is also sharing his experience, via what he calls an "API Police Report", derived from his experience onboarding with APIs. I thought his condensed thoughts reflect what I see everyday as I onboard with new APIs, and was worth sharing. He starts with a simple question: What do developers want? To use your API. Duh! Don&rsquo;t get in their way. What do we force a developer do? Google for your website. Sign up as a generic user (usually unstated). Wait for email verification link. Click on verification link. Log into website. Find link to developer site. Find link to API documentation. Register app (usually OAuth). Figure out how to obtain API credentials. Find link to endpoints. Figure out how to use API credentials. Play in playground. Search for SDK in preferred language. Cancel dinner date. How can we improve onboarding? What you can do! Anticipate needs, minimize process: Big button showing &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;. No registration needed. Transfer to Playground with temporary key installed. Offer easy navigation to friendly API Docs, SDKs, permanent credentials. The anti-patterns to onboarding: Secret onboarding. No Google hits. No Developer or API link. No Sign Up button. No Sign Up imperative. No App registration link. No Get Credentials link. No Authorization procedure. No authorization endpoints (shhh, secret). No Rest API documentation link. No Curl link.

			<p><em>06 Jul 2015</em></p>
			<p>This is a guest post by&nbsp;Guillaume Laforge (@glaforge) of Restlet. He did a very cool API deployment project over the holiday weekend, as was good enough to share the details of his project as a story. I've been trying to make time to do more of these simple how-to API deployment guides like this, so I'm always happy to guest post these when they help users understand that they can deploy APIs--no developer necessary. For the 4th of July, to celebrate the United States&rsquo; Independence Day, Restlet built a fun little website and API to list all the fireworks in your area. You can see all the states where fireworks have been found, and lists of towns in those states where those fireworks were taking place. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s a Google Sheets form that you can fill in to submit fireworks in your area that were not mentioned. This fireworks app is actually an API with an associated website served by APISpark, using a Google Sheets wrapper for storing the data and receiving form submissions, and a Github file store wrapper to deliver the HTML / CSS / JavaScript assets. In this blog post, I will explain how to make your own APIs with their associated web elements. &nbsp; So it all started with this idea of listing all the fireworks. We also wanted to let people submit ones in their area, as it&rsquo;s difficult to find each and every possible event in the whole country. That&rsquo;s why we thought it&rsquo;d be important if we could use Google Sheets to store the data, as we can let people fill in the gaps in our listings thanks to a Google Form that automatically saves data in your spreadsheet. Thankfully, APISpark provides a Google Sheets wrapper which allows you to expose spreadsheets as a Web API. Having data served through a Web API is nice, but you won&rsquo;t cURL it to find an event nearby!

While I've come to feel that no API definition will ever actually be complete, I'm working to at least establish a healthy baseline for the APIs I am profiling, while also automating as much of the process as I possibly can. To help focus my work, I'm targeting 30 companies that I depend on to run API Evangelist, and one of the first APIs I wanted to harden my process on was the AlchemyAPI. The API is fairly straightforward in design, and operation, so it made for an easy target--so far here is what I have: AlchemyAPI (swagger) (apis.json) &nbsp; Alchemy Author Extraction API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Authors Extraction API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Combined Call API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Concept Tagging API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Entity Extraction API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Face Detection API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Feed Detection API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Image Link Extraction API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Keyword and Term Extraction API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Language Detection API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Microformats Parsing API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy News API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Publication Date Extraction API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Relation Extraction API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Sentiment Analysis API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Taxonomy API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Text Extraction (RAW) API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Text Extraction API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alchemy Title Extraction API (edit) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My goal was to index the AlchemyAPI operations using an APIs.json file, while define each of the APIs using Swagger.

			<p>In July of 2010, I started researching what would be the next step in my career. I was VP of Technology at WebEvents global, and was in charge of the technical side of running conferences for SAP and Google. I enjoyed the work I did, scaling the technology to support the events, using the Amazon Cloud and APIs, but I was not fully satisfied in the events industry.&nbsp; I clearly remember spending my Fourth of July weekend researching some possible next steps. Building on my strengths at the time, I looked at what I could do in the cloud computing space. My early research is still even online, forever preserved as a Google Site. The last update to the research was mid half way through July, when after a couple weeks of careful evaluation and contemplating, I saw the core of cloud computing was really about APIs. I had an epiphany -- APIs were central to the recent social and cloud evolutions in the Internet, and as I looked deeper, I saw that web APIs were also beginning to play a central role in the mobile evolution as well. As I continued my research in July of 2010 I also noticed that everyone was focused on the technical aspects of APIs, discussing, often arguing about the technical merits of REST, and very few people were talking about the business side of successful API efforts. Through my early research in cloud computing, and ultimately APIs, I had found my focus -- the business of APIs. My partner in crime Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) was also looking for her own direction, and we agreed that if she started Hack Education, I would help her run her server and other IT infrastructure, and if I started API Evangelist, she would help me learn to write, and craft better stories--some of the early stories were actually written or edited by her.

Anne was walking me through their latest rollout&nbsp;AudioSear.ch, a&nbsp;full text search &amp; recommendation API for podcasts and radio, that is API driven. One of the endpoints for the AudioSear.ch API allows for searching of people who are involved with the podcasts and radio programs that they are indexing. As we talked, she articulated that in order to help people see the value the AudioSear.ch People API, rather than just telling them about it, they were building micro applications, that demonstrated it.
This may seem obvious too many, but I've made a career out of shining a light on the obvious, and with APIs being such an abstract concept, little ideas like this can go a long ways. In this era of microservices, the concept of micro, portable, simple, and focused goes a long way, and what AudioSear.ch is doing with their people API is something that other API providers should consider as well.
Sometimes, the little things like a demo micro application built on top of your API can be the thing that plants a seed in someones mind about what your API does--a seed that over time could grow into something much, much more. I already advocate for other code related building blocks like SDK, PDKs, and starter projects--maybe I'll add micro apps as a building block and see if I can incite API providers to deploy more of them to support API operations.

			<p>I try to go through each of my areas of research as often as I can and update the content, as well as my understanding. Ideally I update the news each week, take a look at the organizations involved once a month, and evaluate the building blocks and tools each quarter. Unfortunately it doesn't always happen as planned, but as a one man operation, I think I do pretty well.&nbsp; I just went through my API design research, and adjusted my definition of what I felt needed be listed there. As I move API definitions to their own research area(s), I'm reconsidering what I want to keep an eye on when it comes to API design, and my current definition involves organizations who offer API design editors, either in the cloud or as download. They should allow you to add, edit, and manage the API details, then also provide the ability to import and export using common API definition format(s). Currently I have nine organizations represented, as part of my API design research: Apiary&nbsp;Apiary jump-started the modern API design movement, by making API definitions more than just about API documentation, allowing API designers to define APIs in the machine readable API definition format API blueprint, then mock, share, and publish documentation via a cloud platform. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apigee API Studio&nbsp;Apigee launched their API Studio out of their earlier Apigee-127 product, their work on the Swagger platform and editor, and their BaaS offering.

			<p><em>30 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am going through each of my research projects, and tightening things down, now that I have them all driven through my new, master stack of APIs. First up was API design, and the other day I spent time going through the organization I track on as part of my API design research, and today mission was to refine the tooling section.
Previously my tooling page was just an alphabetical list of tools, and I wanted to at least group things in a more meaningful way, reflecting how I break them down in my own monitoring system. So I reworked the publishing to allow me to group the tools by tags, resulting in the following list:





API Blueprint



API Blueprint
&nbsp;
API Blueprint is a documentation-oriented API description language. A couple of semantic assumptions over the plain Markdown. API Blueprint is perfect for designing your Web API and its comprehensive documentation but also for quick prototyping and collaboration. It is easy to learn and even easier to read &ndash; after all it is just a form of plain text. API Blueprint, its parser, and most of its tools are completely open sourced so you don't have to worry about vendor lock-in. This also means you can freely integrate API Blueprint into any type of product, commercial or not.

			<p><em>29 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I just read on Re/Code, that the Supreme Court declined to hear Google's appeal on the Oracle v Google case--prepare for the waves of stories from tech blogs, that this will suffocate the API economy. During the last response to the case by the US Solicitor General, I wrote about how I can't even argue the concept anymore, and nothing has changed for me.&nbsp; I just wanted to take the moment to remind everyone that this decision means nothing if we all share our API definitions, in open ways, using machine readable definitions like API Blueprint and Swagger. The disturbing move by Oracle to bring a lawsuit against Google, and the very unaware decision(s) made all the way up to federal level, will NOT bring down the API economy--your inaction will! If I've learned anything during my time defending APIs, as part of the Oracle v Google case, is that many of you are holding your API designs close to your chest, thinking maybe, just maybe, they are intellectual property we should protect, and can make money on, when we are the next unicorn start-up. You are willing to do this, even at the expense of the success of your APIs, ignoring that it creates huge amounts of friction with developers, and the businesses you are asking to integrate your APIs into their systems. When you bundle this with the large numbers of folks who don't even understand the difference between an API definition or design, and its code back-end, you end up with a very dangerous, controllable group of folks, who will slowly stifle, and potentially suffocate any momentum we have built with the API economy. It will be these groups of individuals and companies, who will blindly do Oracle's bidding, and make sure any democratizing power APIs had, stays in the hands of the powerful few.

			<p><em>27 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I wrote that&nbsp;we should be generating Slate API documentation from Swagger so we maintain a machine readable core the other day--while I love the look of Slate, I want to make sure all API meta data is machine readable by default. Shortly after publishing my post, someone kindly pointed me to a version of Swagger that was developed by&nbsp;Jens-Ole Graulund, which was exactly the evolution that I was looking for.
The more response, Swagger driven version of Slate API document is perfect!&nbsp;Giving API providers a more attractive, response version of Swagger UI (sorry Tony), while also keeping the core machine readable.--it is the best of both worlds! I plugged in one of my other complete Swagger definitions, and boom...I had a new version of my API docs.

Tips like this from my readers is why I blog about all my ideas out loud. If I kept my thoughts locked up, this type of discovery would never occur. I am going to play with deploying this version of the Swagger UI for my API stack, to see how versatile it is, and how well it works with my own site template.&nbsp;
I just wanted to put it out there that this new option for Swagger UI exists, in case you were looking for an alternate version of the Swagger UI. I predict this is the beginning of many different iterations on Swagger UI, resulting in one eventually that is themable. ;-)

			<p><em>27 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have been using the Atom editor&nbsp;when I work on local files on my workstation for some time now. With the latest version 1.0 release I took a fresh look at the architecture, and under the hood at the packages that make the platform so powerful, and extensible. One of the packages I was reverse engineering this weekend, is the&nbsp;Atom API Autocomplete Package. The&nbsp;Atom API Autocomplete Package is one of several autocompete packages that gives Atom some of that IDE feel when you are editing files. I like the feel of Atom autocomplete, and I really dig that this functionality is extensible via Atom packages. This experience got me thinking again about the IDEs role in API design and development, and how I'd like to see more API definition driven dictionaries, defined using APIs.json, driving IDE autocomplete features like the Atom editor has. Like everything in my world, my concept of APIs.json driven dictionaries is a work in progress, but to kick things off I launched a new API I'm calling my dictionary API, that helps me build and manage dictionaries that I can potentially use in an Atom autocomplete package. As I do with all of my work, I want to put my ideas out there early to get feedback, and stimulate other people's imaginations. To provide the content for my dictionaries, I am using Swagger, my primary API definition format. All I do is index any single, or collection of multiple APIs using APIs.json, and pass the URL to my new dictionary API, and I get back a JSON dictionary.&nbsp; This is my first draft of an potential dictionary output. I still have to get familiar with the Atom package design, and I've noticed different autocomplete packages handle their completions differently, but I at least wanted an automated way for importing Swagger definition(s), and create a single JSON dictionary that I could use as my Atom package completion store. My API will allow...[<a href="/2015/06/27/apis-json-driven-api-dictionaries-for-use-in-atom-ide-autocomplete-packages/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am a big fan of API documentation when done using Slate. It creates very beautiful, and easy to use documentation, that makes learning about an API much more pleasant. You can find some pretty good examples of Slate being used in the wild, with the&nbsp;Travis CI API, Dwolla API, and API Science API.&nbsp;
Slate goes a long way in standardizing the documentation for APIs, but I would like to see this go further. I am working to profile both Dwolla and API Science as part of defining the stack of APIs that I depend on to operate the API Evangelist network, and while I enjoy the attractive UX Slate brings to the table, I'm lamenting the lack of a machine readable API definitions along the way.
I have a set of import scripts I use to scrape API documentation, and generate Swagger definitions, which I will be using to auto-generate a first draft Swagger file for any API I come across using Slate for the documentation, but I'd like to see a formal solution emerge. It would make sense to have a Slate generator from Swagger, for the API providers who would prefer the attractive looking Slate documentation, over the more functionality interactive Swagger UI.
We definitely need to make sure API documentation UX is as polished as possible, but we can't lose any of the momentum we've gained from machine readable API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint. I have previously talked about moving forward the API documentation and UI conversation forward, and making sure Slate, and other attractive API documentation tooling, are interoperable with common API definition formats will be critical to keeping things moving forward.

			<p>This is one of several stories I am evolving as part of series I'm calling API fairy tales. With these tales I want to educate business leaders, technologists, and government about the importance of Application Programming Interfaces (API), and how they are being applied in almost every aspect of business occurring online today--providing simple examples that mainstream users can learn from, as well as retell in their circles. The Internet is slowly changing almost every aspect of our society, and a major part of this evolution is rooted in how we develop software, something that has been slowly building over the last 15 years, in the form of what is known an Application Programming Interfaces, or simply called APIs. This new breed of web APIs are providing access to data, content, and the other digital assets that are essential in building websites, mobile applications, and increasingly even physical devices. This modern web API movement is not some new software from a company like IBM, Microsoft, or Google, it is simply the next step in the World Wide Web, where you don&rsquo;t just surf the web, consuming HTML documents. In the API economy you navigate the Internet, creating, consuming, and interacting with not just HTML files, but any type of content, data, or digital resource that can be accessed via the web, desktop, and mobile applications that we increasingly depend on in our personal, and professional lives. APIs are being used by almost every type of company, across almost every industry, to deliver the web and mobile applications business and consumer users are demanding. Companies ranging from Amazon to AT&amp;T are putting APIs to work across business operations, and are something you increasingly see in governments as well, with APIs available for the city of San Francisco, New York, the White House, and across government of all shapes and sizes.

			<p><em>25 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>The concept of a form, is one one of those skeuomorphs, that have taken on an entirely new life on the Internet. The concept of a form is baked into HTML, PDFs, and many other commons aspects of our digital lives, while also still dominating many of the information exchanges in our physical worlds. There are a handful of APIs out there that let you build forms, and their are APIs that let you build forms for platforms like Drupal, but I have yet to see a platform that uses the concept of a form, as carrot to design, deploy, and manage your API--until now.&nbsp; I was introduced to Form.io at Gluecon this year, and was very please with the demo I was given (and my time playing with since). Form.io is a platform that enables developers to build web and mobile applications using a drag &amp; drop interface which allows you to create both the forms and the RESTful APIs all at once. I like this concept, because forms is something the average business user will potentially understand, and is something that has helped them also better understand web, PDF, and other digital platforms--whcih tells me it might do the same for the world of APIs. Form.io lets users craft their resources, from a forms point of view, allowing you to construct using common elements like email, password, address block, as well as being able to define the custom elements you will need. This is important because it is shifting API design to begin from the standpoint of how it will gathered or put to use, rather than just the system resource it came from like a database. This approach, in my opinion, has the potential to bring API design, closer to the people who are trying to solve everyday problems. Once you have crafted your forms, and the underlying resources, Form.io gives you the ability to publish an application front-end as an AngularJS...[<a href="/2015/06/25/looking-at-api-design-deployment-and-management-from-a-form-point-of-view/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am working to craft complete Swagger definitions for the 1000 companies in my API Stack, and what better place to start than with the APIs that I actually use on a daily basis. I am working hard to make sure all the APIs for my own master API stack are as complete as possible, but taking inventory of the public APIs that I depend on also makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; I've long kept a list of APIs that I use, for IT purposes, but I don't have a complete profile of all of these services. As with any vendo, I should have a complete profile of the APIs I depend on, with relevant support channels, documentation, code samples, monitors, and some of the other essentials I track on for other APIs in the space.

			<p><em>23 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As part of my monitoring of the API space, I keep track of new posts on CodeProject, and occasionally I come across an API integration project. Some of the times it references it as an API project, while most of the time it will just reference the platform being used, like a Magento Commerce project, or a Youtube project.
As I was reviewing a couple of interesting projects this week, I was thinking it would be nice to have a more modern, simpler version of CodeProject, but exclusively dedicated to APIs. The site could provide regular walk-through of API integration, aggregation, or reciprocity patterns. The site wouldn't have to do that many projects, just a couple a month would be fine to begin with, increasing the volume after things get going.&nbsp;
Another important feature would be the ability browse project by API provider, so you could find all the Twitter how-tos, or the Instagram how-to. The site would use Github to host each how-to, providing a simple, forkable way for API projects to submitting for inclusion by the community, while also empowering the audience to take each how-to-project with them.
I would totally love to do this idea, but I need another project like I need a hold in my head (any new ones). I would surely support anyone who setup a site like this, provide how-to, and help get the word out about it. ;-) I think you could easily monetize by getting paid to do how-to for specific APIs, and within specific business uses cases and industries.&nbsp;
Alighty, idea share, back to work.

			<p>I wrote a story yesterday about APIMATIC releasing a new API validation API to compliment their existing API client code generation API. I received an email from the APIMATIC team is how I found out about the API, but as I'm processing that story, and thoughts around what I'd like to see for API Changelog (something Paul of @BlockSpring brought up), I'm lefting thinking about how antiquated our whole world of API discovery is. As soon as APIMATIC updated their API Blueprint file, all who use APIMATIC, and us API pundits (clowns) in the space should, should receive a push notification. This type of notification is exactly what API Changelog does, but it does it based upon a document diff, rather than finer grain, machine readable detail like what is available in a Swagger or API Blueprint definition. This is something I know they are working on changing, using APIs.json.&nbsp; Using APIs.json, companies like APIMATIC can publish a machine readable index of API operations in a "known location", aka the root of their domain--in this case, it would be at http://apimatic.io/apis.json. This index lists all of the APIs, and their supporting elements, in a machine readable way, that companies like API Changelog could parse, and provide notification to API consumers, and the pundits like me--providing us with fine grain notifications like, change to existing API, addition of new API, or changes to parameters, data model, etc. I know API Changelog is working on all of this, but I wanted to recount, to keep the topic fresh in my head, and also acknowledge that one of the problems in all of this, is the initial discovery. API Changelog is good at tracking on known or existing APIs, but how do you find new APIs? This is a very manual process, but when you can just introduce a list of URLs, and look for APIs.json--the API discovery game will improve significantly.&nbsp; When any service like API Changelog,...[<a href="/2015/06/23/image-if-everyone-automatically-knew-that-apimatic-had-added-a-new-endpoint/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I wrote about the Global Change Information System (GCIS) API earlier this year, and how they what they are doing with their API design represent how APIs are the next step in the evolution of the web. If you have the time, go look at what they have done, it is mind-blowing. I am on their email newsletter, and have had their latest update in my inbox for a few days, with some thoughts attached to it I wanted to blog about, before I archived the email. I love that they provide updates like this via email, but ultimately this story is about how they are iterating on their API design, making it much more useful, and powerful along the way&mdash;with some elements I&rsquo;d like to see spread across other content and document based APIs. Maybe I should backup, and clarify what GCIS does. The platform &ldquo;use identifiers and semantic information to provide points of reference and traceability&rdquo; across the research from 13 US federal agencies, that researchers, citizen scientists, application developers or information theorists can put to work for them. With their latest release, GCIS provide a very approach to the relationship between publications and its references, enabling some interesting ways of getting at the information contained within publications. First, with any publication you can append /reference to any publication in the API, and receive a list of any references for the publication. For me, where things start getting cool, is that you can then also apply the same to a specific chapter in the publication, or even down to a particular figure. This is something I&rsquo;m trying to establish in a coherent way in my own systems. I&rsquo;m looking to apply this line of thinking beyond just references, and also make it work for specific companies, tooling, and what I consider to be common building blocks for each area of the API space I track on. Keeping an eye on projects like GCIS...[<a href="/2015/06/23/breaking-down-publication-references-with-the-global-change-information-system-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am partnering with the Restlet team to put on a Summer of APIs, a virtual API challenge. The goal with this summer program isn't to build apps on top of APIs, but build APIs that anyone can use, by crunching some valuable information resource, and make it easier to use in web and mobile, as well as potentially in embeddable tools, and even in spreadsheets--using APIs. I've gathered up some valuable sources of data, ranging from industry datasets from Data.gov in Washington DC to data sets that can help us with the water crisis out in California, which is included in detail about the program. I did a little homework for you, but dont' feel like you have to stop there, you can make any data, content, or other digital resource into an API during the Summer of APIs. With the summer of APIs we want bring awareness to the API design, deployment, and management tools that Restlet brings to the table, but we also want to increase the number of valuable APis out there, and potentially make a bigger impact. You'd be surprised how the right access to election data could shift an election, or the availability of health inspection data could save lives--so put some thought into the change you'd like to see. The Summer of APIs is not just for developers. Using Restlets API Spark platform, just about anyone can design, deploy, and manage APIs--without knowing how to program. All you need is a healthy curiosity about how to work with data, and make the time to learn the API Spark interface which walks you through everything you'll need to import the data, develop the APIs, and manage them. It doesn't hurt to have some coding expertise, but not a requirement. Head over to the Restlet Summer of Code website for all the details. If you need ideas for projects, feel free to tweet at me (@kinlane)--I have lots of ideas...[<a href="/2015/06/22/build-some-apis-with-restlet-and-api-evangelist-during-the-summer-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am working hard to establish a complete set of APIs for my own API stack which includes establishing complete Swagger definitions for the 25 APIs that I personally operate. These Swagger definitions are then used to generate Postman Collections, APIMATIC SDKs, and API Science monitors. I am also working hard to establish complete Swagger definitions for the 1000 companies in my API Stack, something I am partnering with APIMATIC on.&nbsp; As part of this work, both teams are working hard to evolve our tooling for working with, and validating API definitions. I mentioned a couple weeks back, when I shared client SDK research conducted by APIMATIC, that quality SDK generation is kind of the high water mark for measuring API definition completion--meaning if your API definition isn't complete enough to generate a functional SDK, you need to spend more time in your API design editor, until it is more complete. As I've been working to establish my own definition of what a complete Swagger definition is, APIMATIC has been hard at work doing the same, but applying to&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, and Google Discovery. Also at the same time I'm building my questions API to help me automate the validation of Swagger definitions, APIMATIC has been working on their own validation API, which they just added to their existing API client code generation API. If you are generating machine readable API definitions in&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, or Google Discovery, then you should be validating your API designs using APIMATIC. Once you know your API definitions are solid, then you should also generate all your SDKs with APIMATIC too--I am only about 20% the way through doing this for my API Stack.&nbsp; Nice work APIMATIC team. I predict by the end of the year we will have a full stack of APIs, and tooling, that helps us through almost every step of the API definition driven, API lifecycle.&nbsp; P.S.

			<p><em>21 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I create a lot of machine readable API definitions for the 1000 companies I monitor as part of my API Stack. I am using Swagger to define all of my APIs, providing me with a simple, yet powerful way to profile each of the APIs I'm working to understand better. If you aren't familiar with Swagger, it provides a handful of fields you can use to fill out the metadata profile for APIs, like title, description, etc., but where it really gets powerful is when you put the paths collection to work, outline the details of each endpoint. Most of the APIs I come across that are defined using Swagger, focuses on providing details on each path, including verbs, headers, parameters, and sometimes response status codes. When looking for the benefits of Swagger, many stop here. With basic metadata, and details about the paths, you can launch interactive documentation using Swagger UI--which is how about 80% of folks are using the API specification format. When it comes to Swagger, my own motivations are all about API discovery, so when crafting Swagger files for the APIs I track on, I can easily call it quits after defining the basic meta information, and path details, but all of this ignores some of the exremely valuable aspect of using Swagger--with the definitions collection. Using the Swagger definitions collection you can quantify the underlying data model across API operations, providing a machine readable profile of the XML and JSON that will be part of each API request and response. Once you have the underlying data model defined, including each parameter, description, and type, you can then link to each path and / or parameter, where the data model is being put to use as part of the request or response.&nbsp; Swagger definition collections are not a requirement for Swagger UI, or for API discovery currently, but if you want to generate high quality server side code, or client SDKs,...[<a href="/2015/06/21/the-swagger-definitions-collection-is-the-cherry-on-top-of-each-api-that-i-profile/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>Making sure the Swagger files I craft possess a complete definition for its underlying data model, one that is linked to each API path, and parameters where it is put to use, is important to me, but damn it is a lot of work. As I mentioned in my last piece I'm looking at the Twitter Swagger file, and my head starts spinning thinking about how much work it will be to hand-define all of the data models that used across the almost 100 Twitter endpoints. I quickly got to work finding a better solution--I landed on Charles Proxy. I had downloaded and installed Charles Proxy to better understand how we could map out the dark layer of the API universe, that the popular mobile applications we use depend on. When running, Charles proxies all the requests and responses my desktop apps, and browsers make on my local Macbook. I can also route my iPhone and iPad through the proxy, when I want to also record my mobile app usage. This is perfect for helping me map out the public APIs in my API Stack work! When the Charles Proxy is running, it saves an XML summary export to my local Dropbox folder, which then gets synced to the cloud via the Dropbox API. I am now working on a script that will keep an eye on my Dropbox folder, and process any new Charles export files it finds. As I process each file, I'm cherry picking from the domains of specific companies that I'm tracking on, pulling out the request and response information I need to craft a Swagger definition.&nbsp; To generate the traffic I need, I just load up any API I'm looking to profile in Postman, and started working my way through the list of endpoints, until I've covered the entire surface area of any API.

			<p><em>21 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am playing around with making several stops along the API life cycle more accessible, and machine readable using APIs.json. To help me in my work, I am using&nbsp;my own API stack&nbsp;as a proving ground, resulting in the&nbsp;addition of Postman Collections,&nbsp;APIMATIC SDKs, and&nbsp;API Science monitors over the last couple weeks. As I'm working through the 25 APIs I have, and almost 350 endpoints, making sure the Swagger definitions are complete,&nbsp;the latest evolution of my API management service composition is applied, APIMATIC SDKs up to date, and API Science monitors are setup, I stumbled across another critical stop along the life cycle--the IDE. I use Codenvy for my IDE. It allows me to easily manage my numerous APIs, and applications that depend on my APIs, in a single cloud based development environment. The definitions for my API stack, both front and back-end lives on Github, but I use Codenvy work spaces to manage each repo, the runners to design, develop, and test out my APIs, and apps, at various stops along the life cycle. As I was doing my work, I saw how non-linear the life cycle ultimately could be, and how the IDE is a window for several stops I am concerned with along it. While I am using Codenvy to design, develop, and deploy my own APIs, I am also using to evolve my own educational API integration projects. As part of this work,&nbsp;I am currently developing what I consider an API 101 stack of APIs, a common set of APIs, anyone who is just getting started with API integration would want to learn about--I am starting with the classics: Twitter Twilio Sendgrid&nbsp; I would consider these APIs to be messaging 101, and a good place to start for anyone looking to learn about APIs.

			<p><em>19 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am helping a client work through their monetization strategy for an API deployment service. To help me give me a starting point for the work, I wanted to take a look at a handful of existing service providers, that may not be a perfect match, but somewhat in the same realm--API deployment.&nbsp; For this phase of the work, I looked at six&nbsp;API deployment providers, who in my opinion have a pretty straightforward, modern approach to crafting, publishing, and sharing their pricing. It always amazes me how hard it can be to just find a companies pricing, let alone make sense of it...but I digress, that is another story. Here are the API deployment providers I reviewed: API Spark, with 5 pricing tiers, broken down by concurrent connection (based upon IP address), number of APIs, the entity and file storage across APIs. APItite, width 3 pricing tiers, broken down by number of APIs, API calls, data transfers, data storage (by row), whether the API is public / unlisted / private, and support InstantAPI, with 1 pricing tier, with incremental add-ons to get more API call volume, broken down just by the number of API calls, with an option to pay for custom domain. Sheetlabs, with 3 pricing tiers, broken down by storage, number of queries, spreadsheets, APIs, and users. Orchestrate, with 3 pricing tiers, broken down by number of APIs calls and applications, with options for Service Level Agreement (SLA) and support as well. Algorithmia, with 2 pricing tiers, broken down by an equal ratio of credits to API calls. You get 10K credits for free, and can purchase more at 10K per $1.00. I think these six provide a good test sample to kick of my research. Most of the other API deployment providers didn't have a straightforward pricing model, were open source, or just didn't seem like a good fit. &nbsp;As I looked through these companies approaches to monetization, I see two of...[<a href="/2015/06/19/initial-thoughts-around-monetization-for-an-api-deployment-service/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I use Gumroad for publishing of my white papers, and I also keep an eye on what they are up to as part of my API monitoring--they have a pretty useful publishing API. During my weekly API.Report this last week I came across their&nbsp;Gumroad Small Product Lab, a cool idea that I'd like to see happen in more API ecosystems, or maybe even across them.&nbsp; According to Gumroad the the Small Product Lab is a "mini course, community, launchpad, and contest to remove the unknowns and barriers to getting your work out in the world"--Ten days, ten actionable lessons: Day 1: Mark your calendars Day 2: What&rsquo;s your product? Day 3: Plan it Day 4: Create a style guide Day 5: Ready, set, go! Day 6: Share your process and progress Day 7: Decoding the pricing puzzle Day 8: Package it up Day 9: Prep for launch Day 10: The launch and onward Gumroad is focusing on their customer base (media publishing), but the format is something I'd love to see occur in API ecosystems, helping developers and API consumers put API resources to work for them. It seems like something API providers could do quarterly, monthly, or some other relevant schedule, that would really help API consumers be more successful.&nbsp; The idea of a Small Product Lab, also seems like something that be done across APIs, help API consumers put multiple APIs to work, in the name of a single objective. This kind of approach seems in line with a lot of the micro service, and micro app discussions I am seeing going on across the landscape--when you learn to tackle projects / products in smaller chunks, the chances for success go up (failure hurts less too). Lots of good lessons to be learned along the way! Anyways, just shedding light on what is going on in the space, and putting the seeds for other ideas out there.

			<p><em>16 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've long advocated that an API Status page&nbsp;should be&nbsp;a required building block for any API operation. As I work on monitoring for my own master API stack, and as I read stories like&nbsp;Pingometer Keeps Your Uptime In The 9&rsquo;s With Twilio SMS, I'm thinking we need more that just a simple status report for our APIs. From an API provider standpoint, we should have a more nuanced view of our API availability, beyond just up or down--something popular API integration service providers like Runscope and API Science have been saying for a while. If our APIs are publicly available, I'm going to even suggest providers start actively sharing their API monitoring strategy, and resulting data with the ecosystem--something I'm going to also be advocating for inclusion in the APIs.json index. From an API consumer standpoint, you are going to want a real-time awareness about the availability of all the APIs you depend on, and much like the provider standpoint, this view needs to be more nuanced than just whether a service is up or down. Developers need to be making tactical, run-time decisions based upon API monitoring, as well as be able to make longer term strategic decisions about which APIs they depend on, based upon API monitoring exhaust.&nbsp; I like Twilio's style for showcasing Pingometer as a solution. I'm thinking every API provider should cozy up with an API monitoring service provider for their own needs, while also establishing an approach they can also share with their API consumers, to meet their needs as well. I'm currently adding API Science and Runscope as default building blocks for my API Stack, something you will find indexed as part of each of my services APIs.json file. I'm working to coherently separate out the benefits API service providers like API Science and Runscope bring to the table for both API providers, and API consumers, in a way that is also in alignment with a common set of...[<a href="/2015/06/16/going-beyond-just-api-status-and-providing-an-official-api-monitoring-services-with-your-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am partnering with APIMATIC to help establish a common set of complete, and validated API definitions for the almost 1000 APIs I track on as part of my API Stack. I am using my Questions API to identify what work is needed to be done, by asking basic questions about companies, via their APIs.json definition, resulting in quick tasks I can accomplish that help us achieve our goals. A portion of this work, involves making sure that the APIs in my stack are also linked to their SDKs.io profile. If an API in my stack doesn't have an SDKs.io icon, I know that I either need to search and find it in SDKs.io, or I need to publish a copy of the Swagger definitions I have to APIMATIC, and publish it to SDKs.io--then record the default SDKs.io page in my system, and republish. #hakunamatata Right now you will only find a handful of SDKs.io on the main listing(AngelList, Google, Eventbrite). I am just declaring that I will be doing this as part of the process moving forward. So keep an eye out for the SDKs.io icon, because it means that SDKs.io is in sync with the API Stack (or shortly will be). For all of my own internal APIs I will be actually generating SDKs using APIMATIC--for the APIs I profile as part of my API Stack work, I'll just make sure things are in sync with SDKs.io. Another problem you'll notice in this work, is the company vs. API aspect--meaning that some companies have the SDKs.io icon as one of its resource links, while some have it on the API itself. Look at AngelList and Google to see what I mean. This reflects the micro aspect to API definitions I've talked about before. It is common to look at a single API for each company, but through this work, I am trying to distill it down to the smallest possible unit of valuable...[<a href="/2015/06/16/add-sdks-io-url-for-companies-and-apis-that-i-track-on-via-the-api-stack/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I have been working hard to establish some sort of minimum viable definition for a complete Swagger definition is, and I think I finally have got to a point where I have it--at least enough to work through the next 100 or so APIs I'm targeting for completion.&nbsp; I originally identified almost 30 separate questions specifically targeting Swagger, but for my minimum viable definition I've isolated it to just 19. I automated asking of these questions, using my Questions API, and to test things out I applied it to my API API: API&nbsp;(APIs.json) Is there a Swagger definition? yes Is there a Swagger API title? yes Is there a Swagger API description? yes Is there a Swagger API host? yes Is there a Swagger API base path? yes How many Swagger API paths are there? 24 Do all Swagger API paths have tags? yes Do all Swagger API paths have summary? yes Do all Swagger API paths have description? yes Do all Swagger API paths have operation id? yes Do all Swagger API paths have parameters? yes Do all Swagger API paths have responses? yes Do all Swagger API response have references to definitions? yes Does Swagger APIs have security definitions? yes Do all Swagger API paths have security references? yes Is there Swagger API definitions? yes Do all Swagger API definitions have properties? yes Do all Swagger API definition properties have a description? yes Do all Swagger API definition properties have a type? yes &nbsp; In theory, I can run this on any APIs.json file, and it will return answers for any API that has a valid Swagger file present. My goal is to provide me with a quick action todo list for any API in my API Stack. Now I want some sort of way to certify that all these questions were asked, import the Swagger into Postman, or some other tool and actually execute a real call against each endpoint.

			<p>I have been talking about virtualized API stacks for a while now, slowly evolving my own view of whats next for the world of APIs, based upon what I'm seeing happen across the sector. I am working hard to convert my own master stack of APIs, in 25+ separate container driven APIs, which I can then orchestrate into other collections for my own use, as well as the needs of my partners, and wholesale API clients.&nbsp; The post&nbsp;Running DreamFactory as a Docker Containers came across my monitors this weekend, which for me is a sign we are getting closer to a version of the API economy that I think will actually scale. The days where you launch one API platform, with one or many APIs, and you only sell that service via a single platform domain, have peaked. The technology, business, and politics of your API operations will have to be flexible enough to be deployed anywhere, by any partner you wish to give access, in a way that maximizes the same innovation we've seen popularize the API movement. As John Sheehan (@johnsheehan) of Runscope says: Containers will do for APIs, what API have done for businesses over the last 15 years. In 2015 all your APIs need to be modular, and containerized using common approaches like Docker, alowing your API infrastructure to be deploy-able anywhere, anytime. Hopefully by now you have your API management and service composition house in order, and the business of your APIs can also scale to meet this new, containerized landscape. If you are worried about discovery in all of this, you better start talking to me about APIs.json, and making sure you use a common API definition formats like Swagger or API Blueprint&nbsp;across all of your APIs. Just like the early API providers like SalesForce, Amazon, and Twilio were able to out-innovate, and out-maneuver their business competitors using APIs in the last decade, companies who can containerize the approach...[<a href="/2015/06/14/dreamfactory-deploying-apis-in-docker-containers-is-how-the-api-economy-will-scale/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I work to chase an elusive answer to the question, what is a complete API Swagger definition, I'm also faced with what I know John Musser (@johnmusser)&nbsp;would agree is the age old question, what exactly constitutes an API? Is it the Twitter API, or is it the Twitter account, status, friends, media, etc. APIs? While this has been a tough question, facing anyone who considers API discovery, I think it is a question that is evolving as part of the current microservices conversation.&nbsp; One layer of the microservices onion is focused on breaking down services into their smallest possible unit of value (at least this is one of my takeaways). Doing this is an enabler all the other orchestration, devops, voodoo magic that represent the other architectural layers of the microservices onion. As I work to define Swagger definitions for the almost 1000+ companies in my API Stack, I'm working to employ this line of thought, and actively breaking down each API I profile, into the smallest unit possible, using Swagger. An example of this in the wild, is with the messaging API from TigerText, which could easily be a single API Swagger definition called TigerConnect API, but after breaking things down I'm left with six separate Swagger files: TigerConnect Events API TigerConnect Group API TIgerConnect Message API TigerConnect Metadata API TigerConnect Roster API TigerConnect User API Ultimately this is more work for me, but from an API discovery perspective, I'm looking to identify the small, most unique unit of value possible, which allows me to discovery, and organize APIs into extremely precise, yet powerful API menus. Right now this is a very manual process, but I'm developing tooling that will help me to "explode" existing Swagger definitions based upon unique API paths--we will see how that goes. Now I can evaluate TigerText's approach to user APIs, or metadata APIs, without wading through the actual messaging side of the coin. I am not in...[<a href="/2015/06/13/you-gotta-keep-em-separated-breaking-down-apis-into-smaller-swagger-files/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am working through each of my 25 APIs right now, tackling a list of changes that include some adjustment for an&nbsp;evolution in my service composition, generating Postman collections, APIMATIC SDKs, and API Science monitors--for each API. I was talking through the process of setting up my API monitors, and how I will be generating status pages for each API portal,&nbsp;with John Musser (@johnmusser), and he reminded me of the&nbsp;HTTP Archive (HAR) format.&nbsp; HAR is all about providing an archival format for HTTP transactions that can be used by a web browser to export detailed performance data about web pages it loads, which got me thinking about how we can use the existing format to record and quantify the exhaust from our increasing API activity. There are some areas of the HAR specification that wouldn't apply to this, but for the most part, it provides an existing format for collecting, evaluating, and potentially understanding the value we generate (or not) via our APIs in real-time. As I work through each of the stops along my API lifecycles (Postman Collections, SDKs, monitors, etc), I'm working to make sure the input and output from the stop is indexed as part of the APIs.json collection. In short, you will be able to find the Postman Collections, APIMATIC SDKs, and API Science monitors via the APIs.json index for each of my 25 APIs. Right now APIMATIC SDKs and API Science monitors just link to HTML pages for getting at details, but eventually I am looking to make this detail machine readable as well--this is why John and I started discussing HAR. To help me wrap my head around possiblities, I wanted to elevate myself and look at the the role HAR could play in the index of my APIs, and potentially the wider industries that I am building APIs.json collections for. As I look at the core of each of my APIs, Swagger very much represents the value that...[<a href="/2015/06/13/swagger-represents-the-api-value-possible-postman-is-unit-readied-as-transaction-and-har-could-be-evidence-of-value-actually-having-occurred/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I work to create Swagger API definitions for the almost 1000 companies in my API stack, I'm chasing an elusive definition of a complete Swagger definition for any API. Only a small portion of APIs I am defining using Swagger will reach an 80-90% completions status, in reality most will never be complete for reasons that are totally out of my control. When it comes to crafting API definitions for public APIs, I may be able to get the API definition complete in the sense that it has all the paths, parameters, responses, definitions, and security configurations, but if the API itself is missing pieces--the API definition will always be incomplete (in perpetuity). As I work to automate the questions I ask of Swagger definitions, helping me get to a more coherent definition of what is a complete Swagger definition, I can't help feel the need to offer API design tips to the API providers I am profiling. Honestly I have never considered myself a high quality API designer, I've been more business than tech, but I can't help pointing out the obvious stuff.&nbsp; I am still using my API definition tooling for my own goals around defining the API Stack, but because I'm building it all as APIs, I intend to open it up to others for analyzing their own API definitions, determining how complete they are, and potentially offering up tips on what could be done to improve them. A kind of self-service, API design tip API, that helps with some of the most common elements that are missing from API designs. In 2015, API definitions are opening up a buffet of services that are courting API providers ranging from mocking and deployment, to monitoring and security. I don't see why API definitions couldn't also allow for professional API designers to help API providers evolve their APIs in a more constructive ways, from the outside-in.

			<p><em>10 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>
When I started API Evangelist, I knew I didn't want to use WordPress or other common CMS, so I developed my own API, and page and blogging CMS. During the latest migration of my internal API infrastructure, I'm rebuilding everything as a single stack of APIs that I &nbsp;can use to operate API Evangelist. Part of this process is breaking down legacy systems, into the small possible unit of value, something I consider deeply as I rebuild each API.
It started with my link system, which I broke up into link, curation, keyword, and linkrot APIs. Now I'm eyeballing my legacy blog API, which historically I also use to publish news pieces to API.Report, and sections that I syndicate to white papers I have published. My goal with my blogging API is to get it down to its simplest possible functionality--publishing posts to my blogs.
With this in mind I forked my newer blog API, and labeled it my news API. Right now, my news API behaves very similar to my blog, but it already has new features like automated pulling of press releases, extraction of proper nouns, and a few other bells and whistles that make my news management workflow as painless as possible. Over time I may share some of the features with the blogging API, I think my news and analysis worlds will remain separate beasts, from here forward.

			<p><em>10 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I was recently reading about&nbsp;Google moving its corporate applications to the Internet, and as my brain works, began applying this ine of thinking to the world APIs. I am big advocate for companies being more transparent, and acknowledging that more and more of our ever day business occurs on the open Internet, and we should start treating it like we are. I think one statement in the Google paper says it well: The new model &mdash; called the BeyondCorp initiative &mdash; assumes that the internal network is as dangerous as the Internet.&nbsp; As the Internet penetrates more of our personal and business lives, the concept of a private, localized, and secure network, is fading. Even if a system is only accessible via a local area network, if any node on that network has Internet access, and delivers resources to web, mobile, and increasingly devices via DNS--it is operating on the open Internet. I am not saying that we need to put all our private information out on the open Internet, but I know too many organizations who feel pretty confident in their security through obscurity strategies, and that if things are kept hidden, and lightly secured, you are fine. Inversely they also claim that if you push directories of infrastructure out on the web, that you are just giving a map to the bad guys. This all just feels way out of balance to me. Ultimately I feel like an API first approach for all digital resources is the way to go. Acknowledging that all of these resources will use the open Internet as a transport, and require all systems, web applications, mobile applications, and devices to use the same API--proving a single surface area that a company can secure. With it being publicly available, but secured properly using a sound identity and access management approach, companies can easily bring in external service providers to audit and help secure.

			<p><em>10 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have had Cloud Elements under my API aggregation research for some time now, keeping an eye on what they are up to via their blog, Twitter, and Github accounts. Cloud Elements takes a handful of top API driven platforms, which they organize into their Elements Catalog, aggregating them into a single API driven platform. API aggregation is something I've been a big supporter of, and API reciprocity as with companies like Zapier, is something I feel compliments how we operate on the open Internet. Today, Cloud Elements made an interesting move forward with the ability to map new elements, via an API, which in my book moves them more into API reciprocity space, than it does aggregation--meaning you could in theory launch a specialized Zapier, using Cloud Elements.&nbsp; One additional thing that Cloud Elements does that I think is significant, is they aggregate API driven platforms (elements) into meaningful buckets like documents, messaging, CRM, social, and finance. Things that actually mean something to end users. With the Element Mapper, you now map to any API driven resource you need, all via the API, to solve precise business solutions, for specific business groups. Zapier has an API, but it focuses on the creation of new channels, and opening the potential for recipe development. What I like about Cloud Elements is they bring in the organizational aspect of it all as well, helping you establish some order. Establishing a stack of the APIs you depend on for your business, while organizing them in a meaningful and coherent way--all via an API. #Wining It makes me happy to see a provider like Cloud Elements doing what they do. I've seen a lot of aggregation and interoperability API service providers come and go (Yahoo Pipes, cough cough!!) I like the approach Cloud Elements is taking. They are paying it forward in my opinion, meaning they are building value on top of existing APIs, using a wide variety of...[<a href="/2015/06/10/api-integration-aggregation-organization-and-reciprocity-with-cloud-elements/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am currently trying to move forward the&nbsp;917 companies, from 223 business areas, with a total 882 APIs catalogued, and 407 Swagger definitions created, while working on a distributed way to understand where the profiling for each company is, and how far along the underlying Swagger definitions is. I had kicked off another prototype APIs.json type a few months back I'm calling api-questions to handle just this, in a way that allows me to ask human readable questions about APis, while also storing in a distributed, machine readable format that can be indexed via each APIs.json file. The other evening I publishd a walk through of a Swagger file. I wanted to create a simple walkthrough for my readers, but my primary goal was to break down the moving parts of a Swagger file, and try to quantity what elements I would need before I could call a Swagger definition "complete". Right now I have 28 questions to ask of each Swagger file: Do all Swagger API definition properties have a type? Is there a Swagger definition? Is there a Swagger API title?

			<p>I am slowly getting my new API stack in order, where I am close to opening it up for access to a wider audience. As part of this last round of work, I'm fine tuning my service composition strategy a little more. If you aren't familiar with API service composition, it is just about creating different levels of access to your APIs, and using my 3Scale API infrastructure I can easily break this down. The most common approach to API service composition you see out there is public and private, with maybe an additional partner tier. I'm taking a slightly different approach to defining my layers, and so far, her is what I have: Open - The completely open layer to my APIs that doesn't require any keys at all, like my website, but JSON. Retail - The retail storefront to my API operations that anyone can sign up for, and begin consuming my resources. Trusted - Same access to resources as my retail layer, but given higher rates of access to be able to make more calls. Wholesale - APIs from my stack, but running in someone elses infrastructure, alongside their own APIs. Partner - Access to almost all of my APIs, giving higher levels of responsibility for my partners in crime. Platform - The highest level access, giving my systems and applications the ability to get the resources they need. Personal - A private access level, giving me a layer across all my systems that is only for me to access. Almost all of my API consumers will begin as a retail user, and either stay there, or evolve into one of the other tiers. In the end I can custom tailor access to any of my users, and their applications, but I prefer establish specific layers for users to exist in--giving me clear security groups, that are also in alignment with my business goals.

			<p>As I go through the research from APIMATIC regarding automatically generating client code using Swagger, and I prepare to crank out Swagger definitions for almost 1000 companies in the API Stack, one big question I face is, what exactly is a complete Swagger definition? An incomplete Swagger definition does you little good. I've gotten away with just mapping out some API endpoints, verbs, and parameters, to add another dimension to my API monitoring, but without authentication details, status codes, and the underlying data model, you can't do much else that is meaningful with them--as the APIMATIC research demonstrates. We need to start refining not just a definition about what is complete, but tooling and services that can help us get to complete as fast as we can, and automate the certification of any API, using Swagger. I extracted version definition of what is a complete Swagger definition from APIMATIC's research that I recently wrote about: Valid JSON Correct BaseURIs Authentication Information Endpoints Verbs Parameters Schemas Satus Codes Data Models I would add that the basic elements of a Swagger specification, while maybe not critical to generating SDKs, are important to discovery, and other aspects of API operations.&nbsp; Name Description Tags Next I would say there is always the human element: API Designer Review - Sign-off from an API designer who compared the API definition to the actual API, while also rounding off any missing elements, and just giving the API design the love it needs. API Provider Review - Sign-off from the actual API provider. This will not be possible for all APIs, but having this is definitely a major score for the overall completion score. Then I guess we also need some sort of code level validation an API is complete. I guess this can be done manually during the human API design review, but ideally it would be something a little automated, and potentially generating some output from an API monitoring service provider...[<a href="/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I have met with the APIMATIC team several times over the last couple weeks to discuss the state of API definitions. If you aren't familiar with APIMATIC, they are a API code as a service provider, that generates high quality client code in several languages, if your APIs are defined using common API definition formats like Swagger (they are also the people behind SDKs.io).&nbsp;APIMATIC is as passionate about high quality Swagger definitions as I am, and have shared some really valuable research to help push forward the API definition conversation. In May, APIMATIC wanted to compare the quality of automatic code generation tools, using common Swagger specifications they found on Github. To set the bar for their research, APIMATIC established some basic operational parameters: Code generator must support Swagger file format Only client-side bindings are considered Must create complete libraries rather than just code snippets Only the following languages are considered: C#, Java / Android, Objective-C, PHP, Python Ruby While this research focuses on Swagger, I think the findings can be applied when thinking about other API definition formats like API Blueprint or RAML, but kicking things off with a focus on Swagger is wise. With a basic framework defined, APIMATIC picked four of the leading code generation tools out there currently: Swagger CodeGen REST United Restlet Studio APIMATIC As part of the decision to look at Swagger CodeGen, REST United, Restlet Studio, and their own APIMATIC solution, they provide a little detail on the code generation engines behind each solution: Swagger.io is the official host for open source Swagger CodeGen project REST United uses a customized version of Swagger CodeGen project and performs better than the official branch Restlet Studio uses Swagger CodeGen for Objective-C, but has its own CodeGen engine for Android and Java APIMATIC has its own CodeGen engine for all languages They took a sampling of Swagger specifications out of the thousands they found, and did a side by side comparison...[<a href="/2015/06/06/comparison-of-automatic-api-code-generation-tools-for-swagger/">Read More</a>]</p>

I recently added a new tool to my hacker storytelling toolbox, that allows me to easily assemble walk through, that help me guide my readers through a scripted series of steps around any of my research areas. I first did it to walk through what I'd consider to be my minimum viable developer portal, and now I decided to apply to my Swagger research.
I am working on a set of APIs that help me quantify whether a Swagger definition is "complete" or not, to help me tackle my goals around my API Stack research, and establish a rich set of complete, open API definitions that the community can put to use. What better way to quantify all the moving parts of Swagger, than to actually create a 101 walk through of its moving parts.&nbsp;
I added the Swagger walk through to my Swagger research, and will keep refining, and adding more information to it. I've managed to further evolve my definition of what constitutes a complete Swagger definition, allowing me to work towards a somewhat automated, API driven service that will help me understand how complete each Swagger definition in my API stack is, and where the work is that needs to be done.&nbsp;
The goal here is to get all the APIs for 900+ companies in my API Stack fully defined using APIs.json and Swagger, while also establishing a pretty robust set of tools and services for certifying Swagger definitions. If you want to get involved, there is a lot of work to be done, just visit the API Stack, and get involved via the Github repo.

			<p>3Scale and I have been working hard to craft APIs.json files for the top public APIs out there, including machine readable Swagger definitions, ever since we launched the open source API search engine APIs.io. We will keep working to define, and index the API space, but it is a lot of work ahead, and we could use some help. Over the last couple months I've had several conversations with folks about the need for Swagger and API Blueprints for popular APIs, so that the community can build valuable tooling and services on top of commonly used APIs. Two companies who I've been talking to are&nbsp;SDK generation service APIMATIC, and API spreadsheet integration provider BlockSpring. APIMATC wants see better quality Swagger definitions emerge, so they can build client SDKs that work, and make available via SKDs.io. BlockSpring wants to be able to integrate popular API content, data, and functionality into Google Spreadsheets, using their slick plugin. These are just two examples of services that are emerging to deliver much needed functionality on top of APIs -- if we can establish a rich, open, machine readable repository of API definitions, it will open up the flood gates for even more API tooling and services. #win I've added some new information to the API Stack to support this effort. So far I have&nbsp;917 companies, in 223 areas, with 882 APIs cataloged, and 407 Swagger definitions. I want all 917 companies to have all their APIs fully defined using APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprint by the end of the summer, as well as any important companies that are not listed. It is a lofty goal, but I think with some help, we can do it. As a working group, we have several challenges, that we are hoping to work out in real-time via the API Stack Github repository. First we have to actually do the heavy lifting of generating APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprints, but we also have to...[<a href="/2015/06/05/join-apimatic-blockspring-and-apievangelist-in-completing-api-definitions-for-1000-companies-in-the-api-stack/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>Darrel Miller(@darrel_miller) reminded me of the desktop development platform Electron the other day, with his story on Moving Beyond the Browser with JavaScript and Hypermedia. I had been eyeballing Electron as a potential candidate for my perfect API design editor, something I honestly don't have the bandwidth to build, but is something I enjoy pushing forward in thought. If you aren't familiar with Electron, it is what powers popular desktop version of the apps that I use most--Github, and Slack. The open source desktop framework, developed and maintained Github, allows you to deliver simple, easy to maintain desktop experiences, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript--powered by Chromium and Node.js. Electron is appealing to me because it allows me to use the tech that I am most fluent in, to deliver high quality desktop apps, but also as Darrel mentions in his story, it has the potential to improve on the quality of JavaScript apps we build--giving us C grade JavaScript people a framework to live within. ;-) I have a pretty clear vision in my head of the API design editor that I would like to see developed. I doubt this will be something I will have the time to develop personally, but I would like to encourage others to develop API design editors using Electron, and encourage a focus on it being extensible, allowing 3rd party, API driven API design features to be added--keeping the editor simple, with almost every feature living as an extension. I think the API workflow and life-cycle will be different for each API provider, and we need to be able to have the features that we need most, right at our fingertips. Through my profiling of 917 companies, in 223 business sectors, with 882 APIs cataloged, and 407 Swagger definitions so far, I intend to provide API design tips and dictionary functionality based upon popular / successful API designs.&nbsp; Anyways, back the actual work at hand.

			<p><em>04 Jun 2015</em></p>
			<p>Helping people understand the potential you see around a particular approach to API design, is hard stuff. Providing easy to follow stories, and implementations that the average person can follow is something I've dedicated myself to at API Evangelist, and something I'll keep working on when it comes to evolving API approaches like hypermedia.&nbsp; Hypermedia has long suffered from an image problem, something I feel can be remedied through a little hacker storytelling on the part of hypermedia API media type owners, API providers who bake hypermedia into their practices, and the developers who are crafting meaningful hypermedia driven experiences. In 2015 I feel like we are getting closer to fixing this, but as I said, this stuff is hard, and takes a lot of work. Until there are easy to follow stories, and examples of hypermedia in practice, only us in the know are going to care. I see a lot of potential ideas for hypermedia hacker storytelling in my head, but getting these out into stories, and into practice takes a lot of work, and massaging of ideas. One idea that was just moved forward for me, was derived from a post Audrey sent to me today,&nbsp;a story from Eater, called One Night Kachka. This approach to storytelling, provides me with a potential blueprint for evolving how I can tell stories using hypermedia APIs, and Single Page Apps (SPA). The Kachka story is full of rich structured data and content, providing a compelling timeline breakdown of a nights activity at a restaurant. There are so many interesting objects here that could be defined and woven together with a hypermedia core--then simply presented via a hypermedia client (aka Single Page App).&nbsp; Additionally you could generate an administrative SPA, allowing a user to be walked through the process of telling a story, adding the timeline elements, people, pictures, videos, and data around sales and activity--then point user towards the SPA client that allows them to...[<a href="/2015/06/04/storytelling-and-the-future-of-hypermedia-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>I wrote about a simpler example of API to SPA the other day, continuing my journey for apps, services, and tooling that easily deploys a Single Page App (SPA) or light-weight web and mobile clients from a single API, or many APIs. One of the reason I am so transparent about my ideas, is because I depend on my audience to help educate me about what is out there--one of my readers, who is always schooling me, pointed me at&nbsp;Project ReaCall.&nbsp; Jean-Jacques Dubray's (@metapgmr), Project ReaCall combines React.js and Swagger to make it easier for API providers to develop and evolve API Client SDKs (ACS). This is definitely the direction I'd like to see client SDK and SPA deployment space go. I will have to play with ReaCall more, and I do not have any experience with React.js apps, but it looks pretty easy to bind your API endpoints to specific components in a React.js generated app. Where this will get even more powerful, is when there are ready to go templates, and starter kits for developer to reverse engineer, and better understand how it works. I see that&nbsp;VIMOC Technologies' Landscape-Computing Architecture, and ambient computing API for city infrastructure employes ReaCall for their client deployment. Some more examples, demonstrating common API uses, and real-world client deployments would go a long way in on-boarding people with the approach. The API Evangelist network operates as almost 100 separate Jekyll driven sites / apps (some have more functionality than others), that run on Github Pages. I can easily envision other operators managing hundreds or thousands of sites, sub-sites, web, mobile, and devices based applications that are generated, maintained, and version-ed using the Project ReaCall approach. I'd also like to play around with defining web, mobile, or device application stacks using APIs.json, bringing together many disparate APIs into a single collection, and use ReaCall to deploy the application--essentially using APIs.json as the index for where each of the Swagger...[<a href="/2015/05/29/generating-single-page-apps-in-react-js-from-your-swagger-defined-api-with-reacall/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>My first emotion after reading the brief filed by the US Solicitor General, is that the federal government's stance is so wrong, antiquated, and shows how behind the curve our government actually is when it comes to the unfolding API economy around us. Then as with each moment in the past, associated with this very important legal case, I become tangled in the web that is politics and intellectual property (IP) law in our country--leaving me confused, betrayed, and embarrassed for the industry that I take pride in being a champion for. It is easy to get caught up in the page view buzz, emotion, and hype of each of these episodes, but in the end I will just keep fighting for open API patterns, and Oracle's damaging stance, and the fact the federal government is a revolving door for industry, really is just par for the course--business as usual. This is not the first time, nor will it be the last time, that someone who does not understand APIs will be making laws that regulate how things work in industry. What is really frustrating is that this isn't just a single court case, it sets a very dangerous precedent that will impact every business sectors. Think of the role the web plays in our lives in 2015, and how important companies like SalesForce, eBay, Paypal, Amazon, Google, Twitter, and Facebook have been to the economy--you just dealt a potentially lethal blow to the next wave of these companies even existing, good job US government. The Solicitor General has no idea of the separation in the API layers, but most of the API industry doesn't see it as well, so why would I be surprised that the government isn't up to speed. Honestly, I cannot argue this case anymore. I do not believe in the bullshit rhetoric in the defense of IP in a digital age, I'm sorry.

At their worst, terms of service sound like an invitation to live in a police state. At their best, a terms of service document can reflect the personality of its brand (and Slack certainly has personality!). Until today, my favorite notable example has been Aviary&#39;s, who innovated around humanizing abstruse legalese into something much more friendly readable. 
The best APIs, like any good products, express the joy of the people who build them — bravo to Slack for breaking out of the mundane and making their ToS take a stand.

			<p><em>27 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>I enjoy playing with simple, meaningful ways of leaning about APIs. The other day, during the regular monitoring of the API space, I came across a simple dice rolling API, which I decide to map out using Swagger. Shortly after I did &nbsp;this, I saw Mike Amundsen post an ALPS representation of the Dice Rolling API. Around the same time, I then imported my Swagger into my Postman client, and exported a Postman collection. Once I had the three formats, I sat back to consider what each of these representations mean to me: Swagger - A map of the surface area that is dice rolling. Postman - A single representation of actions that can be taken--now. ALPs - A representations of the what it means to roll the dice. I am constantly working to evolve how I view the available API formats that are emerging throughout the space. I will be spending more time generating machine readable definitions for APIs in my stack, trying to push these definitions through these valuable filters. I do not think any single approach provides me with a definitive view of the resources I am describing, but at least give me with various lenses to look through, during my journey. Swagger left me feel like I am mapping out a vast expanse, but alone doesn't do much for me without more tooling to interpret the map. Postman left me feeling like I could do one thing, linked to the surface area I mapped with my Swagger, but was very confined to just that specific instance, within the world I have drawn with Swagger. ALPS left me feeling like I described something meaningful, closer to the actual experience of rolling a dice.&nbsp; Ultimately I do not see any of the emerging approaches to defining API driven resources as 100% the solution, or in black and white terms as wrong or right. I see Swagger as very much a bridge to a...[<a href="/2015/05/27/rolling-the-dice-swagger-postman-and-alps/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>One of my areas of research that got boost of energy at Gluecon last week, was the area of Single Page Applications, aka SPAs. SPAs are one huge area of potential growth for the API space, but like many other areas, they haven't seen the wider, more meaningful deployments, or adoption, that I had hoped for early on. I think up until now the definition of what an SPA is has been heavily dominated by the technical side of things, as opposed to the delivery side--SPA are still mostly about providing solutions for developers, over solutions for the end-user or business owner. When it comes to SPAs, I stay away from the more established frameworks, opting for a simpler design--minimal platform or framework adoption. Not that solutions like Angular and Backbone don't do amazing things, just at this point in my career, I'm looking to avoid the adoption, and resulting dogma and dependency that can often come from drinking a specific frameworks kool-aid. I guess the overall footprint needs to be small, before I will allow something to creep my day to day operational world. While at Gluecon, I was given a demo of a new product, which i won't go into detail about now, but I feel moves us closer to the vision than I have in my head. Many of the existing SPAs employ APIs, but I envision a world where you can design, deploy, and manage APIs, which alongside you can also deploy and manage simple, useful SPAs driven by your valuable API resources. I keep an eye on the SPA space, so I can be in tune with anything that emerges--hopefully my stories and research will also stimulate other solutions in the space as well. To help you understand the potential for APIs in the SPA space, I am talking about deploying a simple, and I mean as simple as you can SPA deployment, using an API that is defined using...[<a href="/2015/05/27/a-cleaner-simpler-example-of-api-to-spa/">Read More</a>]</p>

My goal is to not flame the haters, but educate everyone involved, both the people looking to learn about microservices, and those who are practicing microservices, so I'm hoping you will forgive me--my goal is not page views. I'm sticking to my goal of not making microservices a regular thing I talk about, but I wanted to share some observations after listening to folks talk at Gluecon last week--a week that was full of microservices love (and hate). In the past, I mentioned that I received a handful of emails, and DMS from folks letting me know I'm not doing microservices, and after Gluecon I think I have a beginning list of why I think people generally are telling me I'm doing it wrong. Tooling - People tend to identify with the tooling they use, and deeply associate the function with the tool. So if I don't use Puppet or Chef, I'm not orchestrating. If your not using Jenkins, your not doing continous delivery, and so on. This is dangerous for microservices storytelling, but also is something that will continue. Vendor - This is probably the most egregious reason I see people telling others they are doing microservices wrong, and is somewhat akin to the tooling item, but is really just rooted in selling you something. You will never do it right, unless you are their customer, so don't worry about it. Scope - You just aren't doing it at the scope someone else is doing it. Microservices is something large enterprises do, not small companies, or individuals. You have to be operating across many availability zones, many servers, etc. Horseshit. Microservices can be done at any scope, don't listen to them. Completeness - You are only doing some of the aspects of microservices. Maybe you don't need to orchestrate across many operational zones, and your traffic looks very different than some of the usual suspects.

			<p><em>26 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am going on five years of API Evangelist this summer, and I've been doing some reflecting about what the next five years will be about. While listening to my friend Mike Amundsen (@mamund), I had an idea, that I think I will evolve more during the operations of the next five years of API Evangelist (yes, sorry I'm not going anywhere). First, I want to clarify that when I started API Evangelist in summer of 2010, I spent a lot of time trying to create a logo, resulting in me creating this temporary (5 years) logo, that you have seen on my t-shirts for the last five years. After listening to Mike spin his yarn, I'm convinced that the next wave of growth for API Evangelist has very little to do with me, and my brand, than it does with the rest of the API community. I've spent a lot of time sharing stories, but for us to get to the next level, it has to be about the community sharing its stories, or we will never get to the scale all of us API delusionaries envision.&nbsp; To support this vision, I'm going to play with a new logo for API Evangelist, and print up a round of t-shirts with this evolution of the logo. I know I'll get a lot of flack from the restarfarians, and hypermedia folks about the design, but it is more about the storytelling, than it is about being technical, but in my opinion, they both work in concert. I've often answered, when people ask me what is scale for API Evangelist, that it is about having hundreds of people doing what I do, across many business sectors, around the globe--this new design reflects that. While this is a marketing effort for my brand, it realyy is about the next phase of growth for the space.

			<p><em>26 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I look at a lot of API documentation, something that until recently has been pretty static--pun intended. As an API consumer I really appreciate standardized approaches to documenting an API, like using Swagger or API Blueprint, but I also really enjoy when people go the extra mile to add little details, that make the experience a little more fun.
A recent example of this is from the Spotify API team. When it comes to the search endpoint for the Spotify API, they put in this little addition:
The field filter tag:new can be used in album searches to retrieve only albums released in the last two weeks. The field filter tag:hipster can be used in album searches to retrieve only albums with the lowest 10% popularity.
I love shit like this. It makes the often mundane world of APIs, a lttle more bright. It shows that there is a human beneath the very technical story that is often being told as part of API operatoins.&nbsp;
I don't about you, while I enjoy the self-service nature of APIs, where I don't have to deal with people and sales teams to be able to put a valuable resource to usee--I also enoy knowing there is a human behind the scenes. Especially if it someone who cares enough about an API enough to have fun, and enjoy themselves along the way.

			<p><em>23 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>While at Gluecon this week, one of the events I particpated in was the Swagger API Meetup, Tuesday evening. There was a small group of Colorado Bros (TM) there, admittedly there "just for the beers", who asked what is Swagger? Valid question, and something I'm always willing to help onboard folks with. First I made sure they knew what an API was, then simply stated, "Swagger lets you see the girl in the red dress" -- making a Matrix reference, hoping to onboard them with the concept of Swagger, via a familiar movie analogy.&nbsp; As I've spent time hand crafting the Swagger definitions for my 25 APIs, which includes almost 350 endpoints, the surface area of my operations have slowly come into focus. Before this, the only visual assistance I had was via any client UI I crafted on top of my APIs. My APIs are so much more than just the single client I had built for them, but this was the reality I had constructed. Swagger allows me to see my API, beyond just the 0s and 1s flying by on my screen, giving me a reference that helps not just see my own APIs, but also potentially share with others, and have a conversation around what is possible with my APIs. I'll keep working on this Matrix analogy to help people understand what Swagger is. If nothing else it will just open up a deeper conversation about what APis are, and the Swagger brings to the table. The ironic thing about this, and I know that my friend Mike Amundsen (@mamund) will agree, is that the girl in the red dress doesn't exist, and in fact API definitons are just a mental crutch, assisting us down a longer road, towards a deeper understanding of how we define our digital self, and the increasingly digital world we live in--I apologize, I get ahead of myself, let me keep with the stories at hand,...[<a href="/2015/05/23/swagger-allows-you-to-see-the-girl-in-the-red-dress/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I have written many times before about the right way to onboard with an API, as well as how not to onboard with an API. I see a lot of APIs, and can tell you which APIs have put thought into the process, and those who haven't. Helping companies smooth out the sharp edges on their API onboarding is something I spend a lot of time doing, so I work hard to make sure the topic shows up regularly in my writing. Today I want to highlight a slight different onboarding email I received from Weather2020: Hi there Mr. Lane!First off I'll get my lil bit of gushing out of the way. &nbsp;I really enjoy what you're doing out there in the world. &nbsp;I love your commitment and passion to the growing world and need for APIs and your focus on the narrative vs. straight technical details. &nbsp;So even if you find some reason to hate what we have going on here just please keep up the great work.But now without further delay, I generated a key that grants you an unlimited number of calls. &nbsp;That key is: c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3eeThe structure of our API calls are:http://api.weather2020.com/[APIKEY]/[LAT],[LNG]So a sample functioning call for us here in Kansas City is:http://api.weather2020.com/c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee/39.099727,-94.578567Just because you're obviously just a bit of an enthusiast I'll let you know I have 2 other call structures that deliver the forecast data based on zip codes and city names. &nbsp;I use them strictly for our internal purposes but I've enabled your API key to work with them as well. &nbsp;Just in case you want to play around with them. &nbsp;They're not that super impressive but involved a very different kind of internal data mapping so I'm mildly proud of em.http://api.weather2020.com/zip/c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee/90210http://api.weather2020.com/city/c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee/Portland,ORI plan to have some documentation at the root API domain very soon ( ie. here: http://api.weather2020.com ) . &nbsp;So hopefully none of the returned data is too much of a mystery. &nbsp;If you have any questions just...[<a href="/2015/05/15/a-unique-and-personal-api-onboarding-experience/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>This is a Github issue submission I received, in response to whether or not anyone is doing anything interesting with Swagger. In the lead up to&nbsp;talks about Swagger next week at Gluecon, in Colorado. I'm pretty impressed with this work at UCSB, and while I am processing it, I wanted to share with you, and hopefully stimulate others to share what they are working on behind the scenes, using Swagger--I've gotten some pretty cool submissions so far. We use Swagger in a series of on going research projects at the&nbsp;RACELab&nbsp;of UC Santa Barbara. Our research focuses on designing and implementing new mechanisms for governing APIs in cloud platforms. Following are some of our published works that make use of Swagger. Towards Automatically Estimating Porting Effort between Web Services APIs&nbsp;-- International Conference on Services Computing 2014 Using Syntactic and Semantic Similarity of Web APIs to Estimate Porting Effort&nbsp;-- International Journal of Services Computing, vol. 2, No. 4, Oct-Dec 2014 EAGER: Deployment-time API Governance for Modern PaaS Clouds&nbsp;-- IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering 2015, Future of PaaS Workshop REST Web Service Maintenance Through API Policy Enforcement&nbsp;-- UCSB Computer Science Tech Report In first two papers, we use Swagger as a mechanism for describing the syntax and semantics of web APIs. The base Swagger standard covers all the crucial syntactic features of the APIs. We extended the base Swagger specification to include some simple axiomatic semantics (API preconditions and postconditions). We use this syntactic and semantic information to measure the similarity between different API alternatives. In EAGER (Enforced API Governance Engine for REST), we use the base Swagger 1.1 standard to describe all APIs deployed into the cloud. We auto-generate Swagger descriptions from Java (JAXRS) source code at the compile-time using a custom Maven plug-in. Once uploaded to the cloud, we use Swagger descriptions to validate APIs, enforce policies on them and establish the backward compatibility between different versions of the same API. This way we can...[<a href="/2015/05/14/usage-of-swagger-for-the-apis-at-the-uc-santa-barbara-lab-for-research-on-adaptive-computing-environments/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am preparing to head to Colorado next week for Gluecon--one of my can't miss events in the API space. Gluecon is always a great place to be, to discuss the API space with the folks who are leading the charge, but this year is shaping up to be a particularly important one. There are number of things happening this year, primarily focused around API definitions, that stand to have a pretty significant impact on how the space operates. To help showcase the goings on next week, I wanted to walk through my schedule, which I think speaks for itself. Starting next Tuesday, May 19th, we have two events: APIStrat, API Definitions, Design, and The API Lifecycle Workshop from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM Swagger API Meetup from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM Then on the afternoon of Wednesday May 20th, I am moderating the API session track on the main stage: 1:30-1:45 -&nbsp;Track introduction, Kin Lane (@kinlane) 1:45-2:15 -&nbsp;API Readiness: Visualizing and Virtualizing -- Lorinda Brandon (@lindybrandon), SmartBear 2:15-2:45 -&nbsp;How REST APIs Can Glue All Types of Devices Together -- Jerome Louvel, (@jlouvel) Restlet 2:45-3:15 -&nbsp;Roll-your-own API management platform with nginx and Lua -- Jon Moore(@jon_moore), Comcast 3:15-3:30 -&nbsp;Discussion (with audience) led by Kin Lane (@kinlane) 3:45-4:15 -&nbsp;Building a Node.js API with Swagger -- Jeremy Whitlock (@whitlockjc) 4:15-4:45&nbsp;- Architectural Patterns for Scaling Microservices and APIs -- Lori MacVittie (@lmacvittie), F5 Networks 4:45-5:00&nbsp;- Track conclusion by Kin Lane (@kinlane) Then after the session I am doing a keynote on the main stage on the Tech, Business, and Politics of APIs in 2015, where I'll conclude the latest talk I've been doing around where I see the space going, rooted in stories out of the evolution of my own infrastructure.

Today I came across the Roll Dice as a Service API, a simple resource for rolling dice, while reading Today in Tabs. I love simple, micro API designs like this, and in addition to adding it to my database, I wanted to make sure I documented the API using Swagger.

You never know when an API will go away, so I wanted to capture a snapshot of the API as a machine readable API definition. The code behind is also open source, so I went ahead and forked the Github repository as well.
I would like to see more APIs like this. I think they are fun, and potentially very useful, depending on their function. I'd like to see a push button deploy on Heroku, and in Docker containers, so people could build little, localized API stacks.

			<p><em>11 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>I get hypermedia at a high level, but have no real experience designing or deploying a hypermedia API or client. For the longest time I just watched the hypermedia conversation from afar, but in the last year I have spent time learning about the different approaches, but I still have not gone as deep as I'd like. I'm looking to change this over the summer, and begin to add some hypermedia thinking to my own API design. To get started I've targeted my curation API for the addition of a hypermedia layer, and I'm choosing Siren as my hypermedia format. Siren spoke to me over some of the other approaches, but once I get my bearings I will look at tackling one or two more implementations. As I do with my other work, I'm just looking to share my thoughts in real-time, as I go along. First, the process is really helping me tight down my API design. This is something I feel going with an API first design approach using Swagger has helped me, but adding the Siren format to the design of my API is taking this to a whole new level. I still have a longs ways to go in crafting the Siren responses for my curation API, but so far the process of defining the entities, actions, and links is really helping me think through the overall API design--leaving very few loose ends. Second, the actions and links are also helping me really craft a more meaningful workflow around an API resource that I depend each day. This link curation API that I use in my daily, weekly, and monthly monitoring of the API space has an ever evolving workflow associated with it, but ultimately its been something I've kept in my head, or visualizing in the minmium viable (half-assed) clients I have built to help manage my world. This hypermedia learning process is forcing me to think it through, as...[<a href="/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am spending a small amount of time each week, adding a new hypermedia layer to my link curation API. My goal is to better understand hypermedia, while also improving the designs of the APIs that I depend on for my own operations. During todays work, I was looking for a more extensive example of Siren being used by an actual API provider, taking me beyond what Kevin Swiber (@kevinswiber) provides in his examples.&nbsp;
The example I found that has really helped me go from 0-60 when it comes to Siren (well maybe more like 0-15), was the TV and streaming video API platform Wurl. The API has a pretty robust example of Siren being used in the wild, allowing me to reverse engineer the design patterns and apply in my own way--this is one way I learn things, through breaking down other people's work.&nbsp;
Wurl has 11 entities defined, demonstrating the really versatile power of Siren in defining the resources an API is serving up. They have some really nice workflows around each video episode, allowing them to be organized into series, bundles, and providing user management and search. For me it is a great introduction into what hypermedia is, and more specifically what Siren offers, in a working, real-world example.
I only have so much bandwidth to spend on this work, but after getting my feet wet adding a hypermedia layer link curation API using Siren, and playing with the Wurl API, I've got a lof of new thoughts floating around my head around how I can improve my own API designs, and better present the large amount of information, visualizations, and other information available within my API curation lifecycle.

			<p>I had a great conversation with Chris Taggart (@countculture), the CEO of OpenCorporates, after his keynote at APIDays Berlin / APIDays Europe 2015 last week, about how they get the data they need, to make the change they want to see in how we do business globally. Us technologists get excited about the potential around the ingestion of large data files published by companies and governments, and the scraping of data where we can. All of this is definitely be part of the open data lifecycle, but often times the whole open data thing, comes down to the human variable. Almost every open data project I've embarked on, always has a portion of the process which involves me rolling up my sleeve, and cleaning up, and validating of data--there is just no way around it. Of course I do everything I can to automate the harvesting, mounting, processing, and cleaning up of data, but in the end most of the data I come across is just messy. This is just way things are, and while I'd love to not have to get my hands dirty, it is always a requirement to achieve my goal. This is why it made me happy to talk through some of OpenCorporates processes with Chris, and learn that they have pretty similar approaches. They can definitely automate the extraction of files, and large of amounts of data, but when it comes to normalizing it, they often have to depend on putting the data into small batches, publishing to Google Spreadsheets, and rely on humans to do the detail work--yes, humans still have a purpose, when it comes to open data! OpenCorporates tries to do as much of the heavy lifing as they can, but they still require on individuals, with as minimal amount of training as possible, to look at PDFs, HTML docs, and other files, and enter specific values into associated columns, and validate data that has been harvested--these...[<a href="/2015/05/05/sometimes-open-data-just-needs-that-human-touch/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 May 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I was taking a look at a new healthcare API recently, adding it to my stack, for deeper review at a later date. Whenever I add a company to my monitoring and review system, I go through the site to make sure they have some of the characteristics of a modern API. I am not interested in many of the APIs that I come across that are older web services, or just poorly done APIs. I want to make sure APIs have self-service registration, some web API characteristics, code libraries, support, and a minimum viable set of building blocks.
The API I was looking at is&nbsp;Validic, which bills itself as a "Digital Health Platform". I'm coming across a number of new API driven, healthcare platforms, like Validic lately. As I was adding it to my database I noticed the legal section in the footer, which had five elements:&nbsp;

Data Security Policy
Service Level Agreement (SLA)
Support Policy
Privacy Policy
Terms &amp; Conditions

Three of the five elements, I have as building blocks that I recommend for platforms. I'm taking note of two of the two that I do not have recorded, a data security policy, and support policy. While I think the stakes are a little bitter higher in healthcare, an industry that would require this added level of protection for the platform, developers, and users, I think these building blocks could be something I may include for all API providers.
I think having a support policy sets the bar, for how a platform will support its developers. I also find the data security policy very intriguing, setting the bar for how a platform will secure users data on the platform--something every online platform should step up and do, no matter what industry you are in. As I review the platform more, I will break down these potential new building blocks, and add them to my master list.&nbsp;

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE This is a review of the communication API platform CallFire, crafting a snapshot of platform operations, from an external viewpoint, providing the CallFire platform team with a fresh take on their API from the outside-in. The criteria applied in this review is gathered from looking at the API operations across thousands of API providers, and aggregating best practices, into a single, distilled review process. This review has been commissioned by CallFire, but as anyone who's paid me for a review knows, money doesn't equal a favorable review&mdash;I tell it like I see it. My objective is to help CallFire see their platform through a different sense, as developers might see their platform. It can be hard to see the forest for the trees, and I find the API review is a great way to help API providers see the bigger picture. I prefer to share my API reviews in a narrative format, walking through each of the important aspect of API management, telling the story of what I see, and what I don't see. Here is the story of what I found while reviewing the communication API platform for CallFire. OverviewCallFire makes for an easier review than some API operations, because the API is the product. As soon as you land on the homepage of the website, you begin your API journey as a potential API consumer. The first thing you read is "Over 2 Billion Messages Delivered&rdquo;, so you immediately understand what CallFire does, and the next thing that grabs your eye is &ldquo;Signup For Free&rdquo;&mdash;way to not miss a beat, CallFire. Next you see five simple icons, with simple text, breaking what CallFire does down: Text Messaging, Call Tracking, Video Broadcast, Cloud Call Center, IVR. Within the first five seconds you fully understand what is being offered, and given the opportunity to sign up. If that is not enough, you are also...[<a href="/2015/05/03/a-review-of-the-callfire-communication-platform/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>In 2010 I started API Evangelist, as part of my effort to better understand the world of APIs. I was looking to not just the technology of how it was done, I saw there were plenty of people doing this. I wanted to better understand the business of APIs, and how popular APIs were finding success with their business models, developer outreach, and other aspects of API operations--going well beyond just the technology. API Evangelist started simply as a blog. I was not a big fan of WordPress, as I knew it can be quite a security target, and as a platform, for a programmer like me, can be more difficult to get even the simple things done. With this in mind I started the first API Evangelist API, by following the same advice that I would be giving to my potential audience. api.apievangelist.com/blog/ Quickly I needed some additional APIs, to keep track of some of the players I saw emerging across the landscape. In 2010, the most important piece of the puzzle, when it came to the business of APIs (after the APIs themselves) was the growing number of API service providers, who were popping up to deliver much needed services to API providers. To support my work I added a couple more API endpoints. api.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/ api.apievangelist.com/apis/ Tracking on APIs wasn't that critical, as it was something ProgrammableWeb already did, but I still preferred to track on some addition details for my own needs. When it came to deploying my own APIs, I kept the as simple as possible, using the backend that I knew best -- the LAMP stack. I was already running several websites on Amazon Web Services, so I chose to deploy my servers and database using Amazon, using a pretty proven formula for delivering a backend stack. LAMP Stack - MySQL (RDS) + PHP / Linux (EC2) PHP may not be the choice of API champions, but I was fluent...[<a href="/2015/04/29/the-technology-business-and-politics-of-apis-via-a-community-driven-api-life-cycle/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>After recovering from an amazing week in Berlin for APIDaysBerlin / APIStrat Europe 2015, and catching up on some work, which included a 20 hour push to get the last weeks API.Report completed, I am now preparing for API Days Mediterranea, May 6th &amp; 7th in Barcelona, Spain. The event is billed as "The Independent Conference on APIs, NLP, and Language Technology", and brings together may of the leading API minds, but also the cross-over with APIs and language technology--something you won't see anywhere else. While the main event is next Wednesday and Thursday, things kick off the night before, on Tuesday, May 5th with some pre-conference workshops and partying at 3Scales office: 17:30 - Practical 3scale API Management Crash Course at 3scale's office (register) 19:00 - API Meetup Barcelona: Marketing APIs: Do's and Dont's and APIdays warm-up party at 3scale's office (register) Then starting Wednesday, the main event kicks off with many of the usual suspects, who don't just lead in the API industry, but also work very hard traveling the world evangelizing API best practices: Mike Amundsen (@mamund), CA Technologies - From Stacia to Hyperion and Back Again: A Hypermedia Hero's Tale Steve Klabnik (@steveklabnik), Hypermedia Evangelist - JSON API: your anti-bikeshedding weapon Bruno Pedro (@bpedro), Redbooth &amp; API Changelog - How to Automate API Discovery Andy Thurai (@andythurai), IBM - Machine Learning with IBM Watson and Alchemy API Tyler Singletary (@harmophone), Klout - Topics as an Engine For Insights Tony Blank (@thetonyblank), Context.io - The True Value Of Email Data Manfred Bortenschlager (@manfredbo), 3scale - What does it take to design and run a successful API program? It doesn't stop there. What really makes me happy about APIDays, is the increasing number of local, and regional API talent the event attracts. I see a number of other talented API prfoessional, doing some very interesting talks, ranging from the business of APIs to hypermedia. This is the most important aspect of APIDays in...[<a href="/2015/04/29/i-will-see-you-in-barcelona-next-week-for-apidays-mediterranea/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am still coming off the high that was&nbsp;@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe this last April 23rd through 25th in Berlin. There were a number of talks that I enjoyed, ranging from open data, to 3D printing, to hypermedia--too many to list. I love the German view of technology, data privacy, and generally on what is going on in the United States.
Other than the wifi issues, the conference was a success. We sold out the event, with 450 people in attendance (goal was 400), and even with the final day being on a Saturday, the turnout was very impressive. Each session I ran, was full of questions, with an IoT session, and another architecture session running 10 minutes over, because there were so many good questions, I didn't want to stop.

We are processing the videos from the conference, which I will spend time watching each one--telling stories along the way. So keep an eye out on API Evangelist, and on the @APIStrat blog for each video release, as we will be trickling them out as each video comes off the production line over the next couple of weeks. &nbsp;
Thank you to 3Scale, APIDays, and Commerce Tools to for making sure this amazing event came together. I'm just now getting my brain back in gear, so look for more &nbsp;@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat stories over next couple weeks!

Thank you so much Berlin! I look forward to coming back for the next event.

			<p><em>21 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>In addition to helping be the MC for the API event, one of the conversation I am facilitating at&nbsp;@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe this Friday in Berlin, is an open data discussion on the main stage. What better place to discuss the world of open data and API, then in Germany. The country has some of the strictest laws when it comes to protecting the privacy of German citizens, and when it comes to API access to data, I couldn't think of a better place to have an open discussion in 2015. I have invited two data specialists to the stage Friday afternoon: Ali Jelveh (@jelveh),&nbsp;CEO &amp; Founder Protonet GmbH and Free Your Data - &nbsp;Ali Jelveh is Co-Founder and Chief Revolutionary Officer of Protonet. Protonet builds Personal Severs for small and medium sized teams. The German-Iranian software engineer has been amongst the first developers at XING after dropping out of his college career. He is on a mission to transform the internet from centralization in the cloud to a state of distributed infrastructure and independent users. Jonathan Voigt,&nbsp;Digital Strategy Advisor / Country Representative of UN Influx -&nbsp;Jonathan Voigt is a startup founder, corporate entrepreneur and digital strategy advisor. Following a master&rsquo;s degree in innovation management, he co-founded a digital marketing start-up and is now supporting Germany's leading agency for digital transformation. In an honorary capacity, Jonathan is the German representative of UN Influx , a charity that organizes hackathons to help the UN and the public engage better with one another. I am looking forward to hearing what Ali and Jonathan have to say about open data, from a European perspective. To help stimulate the conversation, I've also invited one of our keynotes to join us: Chris Taggart (@countculture),&nbsp;EO &amp; Co-founder of OpenCorporates -&nbsp;Chris Taggart&nbsp;is the CEO and co-founder of OpenCorporates: The Open Database Of the Corporate World, which has worked with the open data community to build a database of over 25 million companies,...[<a href="/2015/04/21/my-open-data-panel-at-apidaysberlin-and-apistrat-this-friday-in-berlin/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I wrote a post the other day laying out what I'd consider a minimum viable footprint for API operations. My vision of just exactly what an API is, has gone beyond just the technical, ever since I started API Evangelist back in July of 2010. Early on I saw this was more than just about the API endpoints, and documentation, code samples, and many other building blocks were essential to the success (or failure) of any API platform, area, or ecosystem. This recent post was an attempt, here in 2015, to quantify what I would consider to be a minimum definition for API operation. After writing it I wanted to take another stab at actually creating a portal, that would stand up to the API rhetoric that I regularly produce. What better place to start, than my own personal master API stack, where I am&nbsp;working to get control over my own infrastructure. Once I got a version 1.0 definition, I forked it, and setup a default API portal that I am calling my demo APIs.json driven portal. I have published to Github, a version of my minimum API footprint, which I'm using APIs.json an engine. After looking at 10,000K+ APIs, I have a pretty good idea of what I like to see. This is my interpretation of all that monitoring of the space--a distillation of what I've seen while reviewing APIs. It isn't perfect, but neither is the space that we have, and my portal is just an attempt at quantifying what I'm seeing. I'm going to create a minimum viable Internet of Things (IoT) version of this portal as well, and use APIs.json to deploy different interpretations of what constitutes a minimum viable API presence. If you have anything you'd like to see in my base template, let me know. If you want to fork and add to, then submit a pull request, even better.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm very fortunate to be the API Evangelist, as I get to spend my days discussing, some very lofty ideas, with extremely smart and entrepreneurial folks from across many different business sectors. An ongoing conversation I have going on with Bret Tobey (@batobey), the CEO of Carvoyant, is around the big data generated around the Internet of Things. Many companies that I engage with are very closed about their big data operations, where Carvoyant is the opposite, they want to openly discuss, and figure it out as a community, out in the open--something I fully support. In reality, the Internet of Things (IoT) is less about devices, than it is about the data that is produced. If someone is exclusively focusing on the device as part of their pitch, it is mostly likely they are trying to distract you from the data being generated, because they are looking to monetize the IoT data exhaust for themselves. Carvoyant is keen on discussing the realities of IoT data exhaust, and not just from Internet connected automobile perspective, but also the wider world of Internet connected devices. If you want to join in the discussion, of course you can comment on this blog, and via Twitter, but you can also come to Gluecon in May, where 3Scale, API Evangelist, and Carvoyant will be conducting an IoT big data workshop, on this topic. If you aren't familiar with Carvoyant, they are an API-driven device that you can connect to your vehicle, if it was manufactured after 1996, and access the volumes of data being produced each day. Carvoyant's tag line says "Your Car, Your Data, Your API" -- I like that. This is why I enjoy talking through their strategy, because they see the world of APIs, connected devices, and big data the way I do. Sure there is lots of opportunity for platforms, and developers to make money in all of this, but if there is user generated...[<a href="/2015/04/17/thinking-through-how-we-handle-the-internet-of-things-data-exhaust-and-responsible-api-monetization-with-carvoyant/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was reading&nbsp;Obama administration agrees with Sunlight: Agencies should disclose what data they keep private, which is a topic I follow closely, as I'm passionate about government opening up their data inventory, but also because worked as a Presidential Innovation Fellow on helping agencies open up their data. I completely agree that agencies should have to disclose lists of even their private enterprise data repository, to help establish a clear picture of just exactly what is public or private government data. While reading the post, I noticed the statement that, "most agencies seem to have accepted and understood the need for this change, but some concerns have been voiced": The Department of Commerce, which holds a very sizable amount of data, has cited &ldquo;certain technological issues that are creating major barriers to creating the PDL as described [in OMB&rsquo;s guidance].&rdquo; This is a concern, but Commerce appears to be working through these issues with relevant officials in the General Services Administration and OMB. NASA has expressed significant concerns with the new process, specifically citing pushback and time constraints from its FOIA office and legal team. They claim that &ldquo;identifying and indexing our open data is our priority,&rdquo; and indexing its non-public data will take valuable capacity away. Fortunately, NASA has bought into the public process and are engaged in meaningful conversation about the agency's concerns on the Project Open Data Github. It is interesting that agencies cite the technology challenges in complying with open data mandates. In my experience working on opening up government data, right after the education of the average government employee, challenges imposed by the technology they use is one of the biggest hurdles. To make my point, you can't find "Export Spreadsheet to JSON" as a Microsoft Excel option. Most systems encourage the output of PDFs from core systems, which when it is combined with lack of open data export capabilities, makes opening up of inventories extra work.

			<p>I see a lot of software come and go. I adopt applications, tools, and online services for a variety of reasons, with some of these tools remaining a regular part my operations, with others coming and going with time. I'm currently abandoning Evernote, in favor of my own home brew note tool, while I'm also adopting a handful of new HTTP Client tools like Paw. There are a number of reasons these tools go away, sometimes the reason I needed them shifts, other times they evolve to a point where they are no longer useful to me, and other times they go away after an acquisition, or running out of money, and not being able to keep the lights on. In the end, when i find tools I believe in, and deeply integrate them into my life, and want to better understand how I can help ensure they will be successful. One tool that I am using as part of my daily operations is Known. If you are unfamiliar,&nbsp;Known it is a simple, social publishing platform for your blog or website. I'm am personally invested in helping the Known founders find the customers they need to be successful, and as part of this effort I wanted to practice explaining Known to my readers, while I also expand my own understanding of the role Known can play in my own operations. Reclaim Your DomainFor me, Known is about reclaiming my domain. Rather than posting tweets to Twitter, I post to Known, and using the Twitter API, Known publishes a copy of the Tweet to Twitter.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I get a number of folks contacting me about their API ideas, and email or call me, looking to schedule a meeting or briefing to discuss the API ideas. This is something I always reply with a request for existing links to the portal, blog, Twitter, and Github accounts of those involved. Even when companies are doing something interesting, I prefer to approach it like any random Joe or Jane would, from the public portal, with very little information up-front. Your overall approach to API, the value it delivers, and ease of integration should speak for itself, in my opinion. I am sure there are plenty of companies still who would prefer a briefing, meeting, call, or other personal touch, sales or pitch like engagement, but increasingly in an API driven world, a self-service, pull approach is preferred. A well done API shouldn't have to rely only on traditional marketing. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have these mechanims in place, but by pushing this approach on media, developers, and other potential consumers, you are doing yourself a disservice in many situations--going backwards, not forwards. There is also another group of people who contact me, who really don't have a thing yet. They are just looking for validation, and potentially stimulate discussions that will get them more attention from would be investors. As with the previous group, I think the "just do it" approach works best. You are going to stimulate much more meaningful discussions amongst investors if you are actually doing something, and generating real buzz amongst developers. Additionally you never know, you may be able to bootstrap and make it happen, without attracting major investment. I know many of you traditional busines folks are used to a push approach to getting your business out there, but when you are looking to make inroads in the API economy, your majority investment should be about creating a platform that people can visit, and pull the...[<a href="/2015/04/17/a-healthy-api-strategy-does-not-involve-scheduling-a-briefing-to-discussjust-do-it/">Read More</a>]</p>
