An API does little good if it can’t be found and put to use. Distributing an API, as well as the supporting operations around it, ensures that consumers can find it when building applications and integrations. It also means teams will be less likely to create redundant APIs. 

The distribution of APIs plays an essential part in both production and consumption. Developers’ lack of attention to distribution impacts discovery and feedback loops for APIs, limiting usage and depriving them of valuable information they could use to iterate and provide consumers with features they want. 

Developers can distribute APIs, but it is best done by product managers, marketers, and others who are more attuned to business needs. They will be sure to select the right metadata and ensure that portals, catalogs, networks, and content are closely aligned with business goals.
