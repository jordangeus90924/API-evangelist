{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m looking at new and innovative ways companies are building analytics and visualizations on top of APIs, and one of the new tools I’ve come across is ImpactStory.ImpactStory aggregates altmetrics: diverse impacts from your articles, datasets, blog posts, and more.But this post isn’t about ImpactStory, I’ll crunch what they do and write about in another post.This post is about their usage of feedback, helpdesk, and knowledge base management tool UserVoice, which is a service I always recommend to API owners looking to support different aspects of their API community.ImpactStory simply has a “BETA - Send us Your Feedback” image in the top right corner of their site.</p>
