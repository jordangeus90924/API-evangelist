{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m seeing a lot of talk about API automation using platforms like IFTTT and Zapier these days.It’s one of the fastest growing areas of my future of web APIs series.A sign of this growth can be seen by Sendgrid’s announcement of their partnership with Zapier: Zapier makes it easy to sync data between web applications.They allow SaaS users to create integrations that push data between different web applications without having to waste time coming up with complicated systems.Now you can easily connect to SendGrid along with hundreds of other apps without having to write a single line of code.</p>
