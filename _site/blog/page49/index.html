        <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/open-platform" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/guardian/guardian-open-platform.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Major newspapers having APIs is nothing new. We've heard stories out of the Guardian, New York Times and USA Today having APIs, but after several years where are these API initiatives headed? What is next? Is there innovation going on in the area journalism when it comes to APIs?</p>
<p>This dive into the world of journalism will take some time, but I will start with what I consider to be the leader, <a title="The Guardian Open Platform" href="http://www.theguardian.com/open-platform">The Guardian Open Platform</a>. The UK paper has all the essential <a title="building blocks I would want in an API provider" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks I would want in an API provider</a>, starting with a clean overview and getting started pages to get developers and data journalists up to speed.</p>
<p>The Guardian Open Platform revolves around two API resource, the Content API and Politics API and a vast data store of spreadsheets and other data sets that the Guardian has gathered throughout news cycles. There is an API Explorer which allows you to quickly get your hands dirty with the Guardian APIs, which is essential.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/open-platform" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/guardian/guaridan-data-visualization.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There is also a variety of code libraries including Java, Scala, Ruby and ColdFusion flavors, as well as an App Gallery showcasing what has been built on the Guardian APIs.</p>
<p>The Guardian Open Platform is supported by an active blog, forum and Twitter account, providing the necessary building blocks to build community around the API.</p>
<p>There appears to be some unique gems under the surface with the Guardian Wordpress plugins and their MicroApp Framework looks like it could be interesting, but I just don't see a lot of information available on it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/guardian">Guardian Github account</a> is pretty active, but most of it is around the Guardian front-end, not for any innovation that you'd expect around open data and APIs.</p>
<p>On the surface, the Guardian Open Platform appears to have everything you need for a successful API platform, but I just don't see anything that stands out and screams "innovation in journalism using APIs". With that said, I have to mention the <a href="http://n0tice.org/">N0tice</a> platform, which is a separate user generated content publishing platform that is developed by the Guardian Media Group.</p>
<p>Maybe there is more going on behind the scenes than I can find in the API portal, but currently it looks like business as usual in the Guardian Open Platform. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I think all newspapers should have this, but you'd think with the leadership position in the space, the Guardian would have some secret sauce simmering on the back burner. I will look at NYT, USA Today and other publications API initiatives, tae a look at N0tice and then come back and take another look before I wrap-up my state of APIs in journalism.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I use screenshots across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>. I take screenshots of stories I curated, companies I track on and API developer areas I'm monitoring. Historically I've used a variety of screenshot APIs, to generate the 1000's of screenshots I need to make my network function.</p>
<p>This last week I was running through my network, and noticed the screenshot API had stopped working. It isn't a critical piece of infrastructure so I've used free services and don't really feel the need to monitor in real-time, I just respond when I stop seeing screenshots on the news listing page.</p>
<p>This is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, and when I started looking for a new screenshot API I noticed the majority of them now charge, and was in a range I just didn't feel I couldn't afford being a one man show. I knew in the back of my mind that I could develop my own screenshot API solution.</p>
<p>After test driving several image libraries I settled in with <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>, which allows me to load and manipulate web pages in an object, and then take a screenshot of the web page in that state. I quickly wrapped in a web API using the Slim Framework in PHP.</p>
<p>Once I had the API deployed I wrapped with my <a title="3Scale API Management Infrastructure" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API management infrastructure</a>, which requires an API key before you can use any of my APIs. Next I updated my company, API and news screenshot tool to use my new screenshot API.</p>
<p>After I get some free time I will clean up the code and publish via Github, so others can deploy their own screenshot API and take the same path I chose.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/12/20/the-holy-grail-of-apis/">The Holy Grail of APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/15/irs-modernized-efile-mef-a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy-draft/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/bw-irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I look at a lot of APIs, I work hard to brainstorm ideas for potential new APIs, and I can't think of a more important API to not just the API economy, but to the overall economy, than an IRS API that would give citizens access to their income and tax history.</p>
<p>We know the APIs exists, since the same resources are made available via the <a title="IRS Modernized e-File System" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/15/irs-modernized-efile-mef-a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy-draft/">IRS Modernized e-File system</a> to tax professionals. I'm not talking about an API that gives access to every detail of my tax history, but the data I've entered into common forms like W2, 1099, and 1042.</p>
<p>This IRS API would provide simple REST API access to these values, along with an oAuth framework allowing any <span style="text-decoration: underline;">approved application developer</span> to access all or portions of our most relevant income and tax data. With oAuth being the access layer to all of this, it would give us, the citizen control over who has access to our history, and how applications can use it.</p>
<p>An IRS API would be used to streamline numerous processes like home loans, student financial aid and other transactions actions we take in our everyday lives. These transactions occur over and over each year, and require manual entry, manual validation and other often cumbersome interactions.</p>
<p>The introduction of an IRS API with oAuth, would also do amazing things for basic digital literacy around oAuth, and who is accessing to our vital information. This type of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/api-and-oauth-literacy-is-as-important-as-financial-literacy-in-the-api-economy/">literacy around APIs, oAuth, and data access</a>, is critical to not just a healthy API economy, but is quickly blending with the regular economy.</p>
<p>I'm not naive regarding the politics of such a move, which would uncover huge amounts of corruption, false statements, potentially disrupt existing jobs that are dedicated to these bureaucratic functions, and introduce a new wave of security concerns. However I think the benefits will outweigh the negatives and this represents the next generation of financial literacy.</p>
<p>It is up to the IRS to take the steps necessary to make such an API possible. The data is there, and we know existing web services are in place that facilitate these types of interactions. The IRS just needs to realize the importance role that web APIs and oAuth play in the current digital landscape, prioritize a simple web API design, oAuth deployment and supporting developer area.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/example-form.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm working on an <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">API design for the free application for federal student aid form</a>, also known as FAFSA, over the last couple weeks. I took <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/fotw1314/pdf/PdfFafsa13-14.pdf">the form</a> which had over 150 separate fields, and turned into a basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) API. I even added an endpoint that allows you to query and get a list of the fields.</p>
<p>The project is a proof of concept to show the Department of Education what is possible around a FAFSA API. I'm not sure if the API will ever be deployed or adopted by the Department of Education or if by other 3rd party providers, establishing a sort of federated FAFSA API network. My goal is to just generate the API definition with supporting server and client side tooling, to show what is possible.</p>
<p>As I assess my work over the last couple weeks on FAFSA, I can't help but think how this should be standard practice for all forms. If you do a simple search at google for "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=forms&amp;oq=forms&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i65j69i60l3j69i59.752j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">forms</a>", you get IRS forms, immigration, legal, voter registration and yes the FAFSA forms. It is clear that forms still dominate our lives--print and PDF.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that simple, open designs and tooling around forms would help us continue evolve the concept of the "form" beyond the just the PDF. Sure the PDF still has a place, and some tooling can work with consuming and publishing as PDF, but APIs could help us innovate around what is a form, how users enter their data into them, and take advantage of newer technologies like tablets.</p>
<p>In my opinion, every form should be an API. If you'd like help developing a new form as an API or evolving an older print or PDF form as an API, feel free to <a href="http://kinlane.com/contact/">reach out</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Pop Up Archive" href="https://www.popuparchive.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pop-up-archive/pop-up-archive-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time talking to folks on the phone, Skype, in Google Hangouts and in person about their API business models. Not everyone I talk with is willing to share their story public, so I'm also happy when I meet folks who are as open and transparent about figuring all of this out as I am.</p>
<p>This morning I spoke with Anne and Bailey over at the <a title="Pop Up Archive" href="https://www.popuparchive.org/" target="_blank">Pop Up Archive</a> about their upcoming API, and potential business model(s) for their API when ready. We talked about their immediate API release and then brainstormed about how to get the word out, how people might use the API, and possible approaches monetization.</p>
<p>The Pop Up Archive is an <a href="https://www.popuparchive.org/">audio transcription service</a>, allowing you to publish audio files and receive back full text transcriptions of the audio. It is a pretty straightforward service, and they will be releasing an API so others can use the audio transcription service in their own apps, as well as access the wealth of audio resources they are amassing in their archive.</p>
<p>Even with the straightforward nature of this upcoming API resource, the question of who will use this service, and what they are willing to pay comes up--something we spent the good part of an hour discussing. We should have recorded, then we'd have the transcription, but since we didn't here are some of my thoughts from today's discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Your API Is Tech and Business Research &amp; Development</strong><br /> The tech space moves fast, and success is all about getting your API up and running, allow for developers to use, even if it is just within a trusted group, then iterate and evolve as you gain more knowledge about what people want and how they will be using it. You can speculate from now until the cows come home about how people will use, but until you have it up and running you won't know for sure. When you approach your API with a R&amp;D mindset, you will be much more open to opportunities and more resilient when things go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Rolling Out With Minimum Viable Monetization Strategy</strong><br /> When you are pioneering into a new area of API resources, it can be tough to know what the market is willing to pay. Start with identifying your hard costs like compute, storage and bandwidth, tack on a reasonable profit and get your API open for business in a beta release. Make it clear that things will change, but let people start using your API, pay for basic services and begin understanding more about their usage and what your first wave of customers are willing to pay. Over time, you can evolve your monetization strategy, building on what your hard costs are, the value you deliver to your users, and ultimately what they are willing to pay for your service(s).</p>
<p><strong>Casting A Wide Net To Identify Target Audience Beyond Obvious Ones</strong><br /> When identifying their potential target audience, the Pop Up Archive starting with the obvious ones like radio and journalists, but then how do they potentially identify other areas, that aren't so obvious? You do this by first by getting your API up and available in some sort of private beta. To support the API release, publish a blog and twitter account and get to work telling the stories of your API, which Pop Up Archive has done. Then get to work telling the details of every step of your journey, and every use case of the obvious target groups. These stories will become your net, and the wider you cast the net, including as many keywords as you can, and the number of stories you tell, the wider possible audience you will draw in. The Pop Up Archive introductory video says that if you don't provide text representations of your audio, they won't be found in searches--when it comes to APIs, if you don't tell stories of the problems your API solves, users will never find it when searching for solutions to their problems.</p>
<p><strong>Not All API Consumers Are Created Equally</strong><br /> When identifying your API consumers make sure you get to know their needs and goals. In the case of the Pop Up Archive, some users may be using the API for audio transcription, while others may be using it to gain access to the rich library of audio uploaded by other users. These two groups will have radically different needs, and possess very differ thresholds of what they will pay for API access. While it makes sense to charge audio transcription users for the heavy lifting of transcribing, you want to incentivize archive users to access, syndicate and share as much content as you can. Why even charge them? With a proper branding strategy these users can become the marketing vehicle of the API, building directories, sites, widgets and other content syndication that could potentially drive new users to the API.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pop-up-archive/pop-up-archive-tapes.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Anne and Bailey are doing a great job of approaching their API strategy in a very open and agile way. The worst thing any API provider can do is approach their strategy with a very rigid view, thinking they understand exactly how developers should use an API resource. The Pop Up Archive has built a great service that does two things, and does them well:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Audio Transcription</li>
<li>Audio + Transcription Archive</li>
</ul>
<p>They provide a clean, easy to use website, and now they are preparing a first version of their API, with accompanying documentation, code samples and widgets. They have identified their operational costs and are developing an appropriate fee for the service that is based upon the number of minutes of audio you are processing.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Pop Up Archive will open their API for business with a handful of beta partners and begin iterating on the technology and business of their API platform. While there are a lot of unknowns, Anne and Bailey realize they just need to just get up and running, engage their users, and establish a feedback loop that will then help define the future of their API and its business model.</p>
<p>Your API is a an external, R&amp;D lab for your business. While you will be producing real products and services out of this lab, you need to approach operations with an agile state of mind, enabling you to be open to use cases and business models you may never have conceived when you set out  on this road. If you do this, your chances of success will significantly increase.</p>
<p>What sort of uses cases and business models do you envision for the Pop Up Archive?</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://portal.ehawaii.gov/page/subscriber-services/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/state-government/hawaii-gov-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The question of whether government should charge for APIs and other digital services came up again this week during a Google Hangout I did with Luke Fretwell(<a href="https://twitter.com/lukefretwell">@lukefretwell</a>) of <a href="https://twitter.com/govfresh">@GovFresh</a>. I began exploring this concpet last year in my post, <a title="Should the Government Subsidize and Profit from Data Market" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/02/01/should-the-government-subsidize-and-profit-from-data-markets/">Should the Government Subsidize and Profit from Data Market</a>, after talking with several city government open data folks.</p>
<p>Luke had pointed me to a page on the <a href="https://portal.ehawaii.gov/page/subscriber-services/">Hawaii.gov website that described their subscriber services</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>A subscriber account offers the benefit of monthly invoicing and payment and provides convenience to users who conduct large volumes of online transactions through our website. In some cases, a subscriber account is also required to access a specific online service.</em></blockquote>
<p>Many people I talk to in the open data space have reacted negatively when I propose the idea of government charging for access to services, but as reflected in Hawaiis approach, this is just for higher volume and heavy commercial use cases.</p>
<p>It costs money to gather and organize government data, design, deploy and manage APIs. I feel strong that many of the resources coming out of government should be free and open for access, but in the cases where it is incurring huge costs for government to provide, it might make sense to pass costs off to consumers.</p>
<p>Think of any other physical government assets like city, county, state, or national parks. These are open for anyone to access, and many are even free, but if you want to use them for commercial purposes, you have to pay. Virtual resources should be seen in a similar light.</p>
<p>However, this could easily evolve into a negative analogy, because park access fees sometimes can seem ridiculous, and I want to incentivize consumption of government open data and APIs through as wide of access as possible--not scare people away.</p>
<p>My goal here is to not take a for or against stance, but to stimulate conversation around the topic and see where it makes sense to apply. I don't think government charging for access is applicable in all areas of open data and APIs, but if it will ensure better quality of service and potentially fund new data and APIs, I think it can be a good idea. What do you think?</p>

        <p><a title="Swedish API License" href="http://apilicens.se/en/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swedish-api-license/swedish-api-license-2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The terms of service for APIs is the single most important building block of an API strategy, one that dictates how developers can access and put API resources to use and sets the tone for an entire API ecosystem. Your API can be publicly available, but the terms of service and licensing will determine whether it is truly open.</p>
<p>Even with the importance of this area of API operations, there aren't a lot of open resources to help guide you through crafting your API licensing and terms of service properly--until now.</p>
<p>A group of swedish entrepreneurs <a href="http://se.linkedin.com/in/danielrudmark">Daniel Rudmark</a> of <a href="https://www.viktoria.se/">Viktoria Swedish ICT</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elias-arnestrand/1/922/64b">Elias Arnestrand</a> of  <a href="http://www.samtrafiken.se/">Samtrafiken</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/anna-mirsch/83/936/14a">Anna Mirsch</a> lawyer at <a href="http://www.mannheimerswartling.se/">Mannheimer Swartling</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/andreaskrohn">Andreas Krohn</a> at <a href="http://dopter.se/">Dopter</a> have come together to create a new project to address this need, called <a title="Swedish API License" href="http://apilicens.se/en/">Swedish API License</a>.</p>
<p>The goals with the project was to create an API license that...</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Is open and free for anyone to use, encouraging maximal adoption</li>
<li>Is flexible enough to fit many different use cases</li>
<li>Respects both the publisher and the consumer of the API.</li>
<li>Easy to understand for people without a law degree</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apilicens.se/en/dokumentation/wizard/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swedish-api-license/swedish-api-license-wizard-2.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The Swedish API license covers the following areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>License</li>
<li>Intellectual Property Rights</li>
<li>Processing of Personal Data</li>
<li>Technical Requirements and Limitations</li>
<li>Other Requirements of Use</li>
<li>Liability</li>
<li>Changes</li>
<li>Terms and Conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>The Swedish API license even has an <a href="http://apilicens.se/en/dokumentation/wizard/">API license wizard</a> that walks you through 13 steps of constructing and customizing your license, keeping within the legal and commercial considerations your company has around your API.</p>
<p>While the Swedish API License is published in Sweden, the site and licenses are in english and all the work is licensed under CC-BY license. This opens up a whole lot of opportunity to use the model around the globe.</p>
<p>I will be spending more time getting familiar with the approach to developing terms of service by the Swedish API License, and consider it side by side with existing efforts like <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn't Read</a> and <a href="https://tosback.org/">TOS Back</a> from EFF. I'm thinking we are approaching a critical point in API growth, where we really need to start getting our house in order when it comes to open resources for API providers and API consumers.</p>

<p>Over the last 3 years I have looked at all the APIs available in <a href="https://bitly.com/10rGRbg+">ProgrammableWeb API directory</a>, with about 2500 of which I monitor regularly. Throughout this process I've evolved an eye for what building blocks go into a successful API program.</p>
<p>When I review an existing API area or program, public or private, I spend as little or as much time as I need to look at an API initiative through the following 20 lenses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- The general look, feel and initial impression of an API at the high level.</li>
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong>&nbsp;- Review of API endpoints, looking at the detail.</li>
<li><strong>On-boarding</strong>&nbsp;- How easy is it to get up and going? Where is the friction?</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>&nbsp;- General API documentation review and critique.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved with authentication and security.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong>&nbsp;- A look at all available code libraries, SDKs, apps and language or platform availability.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a mobile fit and how does an API address this world.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- What do direct and indirect support practices look like and what are activity levels.</li>
<li><strong>Communications</strong>&nbsp;- How are communications handled, and is it done in a transparent way.</li>
<li><strong>Change Practices</strong>&nbsp;- How are updates, changes, and communication around the roadmap handled.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model</strong>&nbsp;- What is the business model of an API, how does it make ends meet.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>&nbsp;- What resources are provided from how-to, case studies to videos and workshops.</li>
<li><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong>&nbsp;- Does an API reflect a research &amp; development group.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Department&nbsp;</strong>- Covering the legal areas of terms of use, privacy and branding.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong>&nbsp;- How portable and embeddable are aspects of the API? Can it be distributed easily?</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong>&nbsp;- A look at the underlying environment of the API, sandboxing, testing, monitoring, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Developers</strong>&nbsp;- What does this look like for a developer? What tools do we get to ensure success?</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>&nbsp;- How consistent are API endpoints and the support resources, and the overall operations.</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong>&nbsp;- If the API is public, to what degree of open are API efforts?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Evangelism</strong>&nbsp;- What does outreach around the API look like, regarding events, social, storytelling, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look across the&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html" target="_blank">building blocks I have listed for API management</a>&nbsp;to get a better idea of the detail I'm looking for across API operations. These building blocks have been assembled through over 3 years of reviewing APIs, and can provide a good checklist to use when applying the above lenses.</p>
<p>Each review involves visiting an API area, applying the above 20 lenses, register and often times hack on an API. When done I write up a review report, which in many cases will be privately shared with a company and key&nbsp;stakeholders&nbsp;for review and discussion.</p>
<p>In some cases, when approved, I will publicly write up a review, providing a more polished view of an API area based upon final review report, and publish on my API Evangelist network of blogs.</p>
<p>The goal with a review is to better understand the balance of technology, business and politics going on within an API ecosystem, providing feedback that will help a company better achieve balance and success with their API initiative.</p>

<p>I got back from Paris, France this Sunday, after Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) and I spoke at <a href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> last Thursday. This was the second annual API event, which kicked off last year around the same time. I've been a supporter of the event since Mehdi (<a href="https://twitter.com/medjawii">@medjawii</a>) of Webshell told me about the idea.</p>
<p>Last years event was small, and over half the audience seemed to be imported API specialists such as myself, where this year it was clear--this was a french conference. A passionate community of API enthusiasts has grown over the last year, producing an impressive line-up of speakers and attendees.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about the space ranging from containers and oAuth to revelations about how we can learn from history and make the right decisions as we move forward in a world of APIs.</p>
<p>I encountered some pretty smart folks who knew a lot about technology, APIs and open data, that I hadn't encountered before in the online API world. This shows me the value of this type of event, and the importance of bringing folks together from around the world and share API stories.</p>
<p>Thanks <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> and <a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/">FaberNovel</a> for making it happen, and bringing Audrey and I out to be part of such an important event.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/ed/fafsa-form.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was able to give my <a title="FAFSA API Project" href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">FAFSA API project</a> a little more attention in preparation for some data jams later this week. While there is still a lot of work to happen, I feel pretty good about what I have been able to get done. I'd love to reflect on the API design, get some feedback before I move it forward too much more.</p>
<p><strong>75% Github</strong><br /> As with all of my projects, the FAFSA API is mostly deployed via Github, except for the actual API. The project was born as a Github repository and expanded as a Github Page. Using Github I'm able to manage the project, while also making it open by default so anyone else can fork and put the work to use.</p>
<p><strong>Designing The API</strong><br /> Once the repository was created, I got to work on an API design. For this project I started with a <a title="Swagger" href="https://bitly.com/1j2KERU+">Swagger</a> specification, and developed a basic CRUD interface and data model that was derived from the list of 100+ fields from the <a title="FAFSA Form" href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/fotw1314/pdf/PdfFafsa13-14.pdf">FAFSA form</a>.  Now I had a basic API design I could work with as guide for developing my API, generating my documentation and code samples. It isn't perfect, but it is a good start.</p>
<p><strong>Deploying The API</strong><br /> Next with API design in hand, I got to work deploying an actual API that would allow developers to build applications that could create, update and manage FAFSA application. I selected the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim framework</a> and PHP to deploy the first iteration of the FAFSA API. This allowed me to rapidly produce server side code in a common programming language. I will be deploying Python, Ruby and Node.js versions in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Interactive Documentation</strong><br /> The first step in quantifying an API interface and make it something you can see and understand, is by developing documentation. In 2013 the common way to do this is with interactive documentation, which you can generate directly from the previously generated Swagger specification. Swagger has a slick JavaScript implementation that I can easily run from my Github project pages.</p>
<p><strong>Code Samples</strong><br /> I want to make sure my basic API design works I need to actually hack against it. Like the server side code, I'm developing the first code samples in PHP. I developer a set of samples that allow me to add, update, delete and pull all or an individual FAFSA entry. Next on the roadmap is to develop Python, Ruby, JavaScript and hopefully some mobile code samples for iPhone and Android (eventually).</p>
<p><strong>Secondary APIs</strong><br /> Once I started hacking on the FAFSA API I realized I would need more resources to actually make an application possible. First I needed a list of states and provinces--basic I know, but something I would need. Next there are other form fields, supporting processing logic, form rejection codes and lists of colleges and universities that would help developers be successful in building applications. I got to work downloading, and extract the data I would need and added these secondary APIs to my FAFSA API stack.</p>
<p><strong>A Portal To Round It Off</strong><br /> I have good amount of resources available for my FAFSA API project. I need a portal to hang all my resources within, establishing one stop access to everything generated as part of my work. Using Github Pages I generate a gh-pages branch of my Github repository, upload a graphical template, home page, about page, and a blog to provide a single portal gateway that developers can get at everything I've done. The portal blog will provide a real-time journal to chronical the evolution of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Data Behind</strong><br /> I've launched a suite of secondary APIs to support developers when building FAFSA applications, but this project is just a prototype API and even if it was a production deployment, some developers will just want access to the data behind. To support this, I published JSON data stores of FAFSA form fields, business process logic, rejection codes, and a list of states and schools that users can put to use. All data is stored as basic, machine readable JSON files in the master Github repository behind the FAFSA project portal.</p>
<p><strong>A Roadmap For The Future</strong><br /> While I made significance progress on the FAFSA API work, there is always more work to be done.  I need a roadmap to help me remember the various features I will be adding to the FAFSA API, but also a way to allow other contributors to submit suggestions to the roadmap. I developed a simple Javascript widget that was driven from the underlying Github Milestones system. This way milestones would list in the FAFSA API project roadmap, but would also allow anyone to submit potential features using the underlying Github platform.</p>
<p><strong>Providing Necessary Resources </strong><br /> I used a variety of PDF and website resources to understand the FAFSA program and derive the API interface and data model for this project. I wanted to make sure an provide an <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/resources.html">easy list of resources</a> for other developers to use. A significant part of this project was derived from existing resources, making these part of the living project is important to support it's evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Adding To The Commons</strong><br /> With a first draft of the API definition and underlying data model for the FAFSA form published, i wanted to make sure I put forth the definition for public comment and consumption. To do this I create an <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> manifest which registers the FAFSA API swagger definition with the commons. As I evolve the project and update the specification the manifest will keep it actively published in the API commons.</p>
<p><a href="http://apicommons.org"><img class="c1" style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Licensing</strong><br /> Beyond adding the FAFSA API definition to the API Commons, I make sure all code that is published as part of my FAFSA project is licensed using the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>, and any content is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY license</a>. I want the entire project to be freely and widely used, but make sure the central project is attributed to help build awareness and contributions to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /> That is where I stand. The goal of my FAFSA API project is to show what is possible with a simple API, and supporting resources. Developers can now build web applications that support students in applying for aid. Anyone can not just build applications, but deploy their own FAFSA API, becoming a node in a federated FAFSA ecosystem. Think of the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint">ecosystem that has emerged as part of the IRS e-file system</a>. Popular apps like Turbo Tax that help taxpayers file their federal and state taxes, providing a successful blueprint for public and private sector partnerships.</p>
<p>This is all just a beginning. I'm just getting going on this project. It should provide a base prototype for building FAFSA solutions. I'm using this base model for other projects I'm working on, but FAFSA has provided a great project to evolve my approach. I need help on this project. It is unpaid work and I can use financial support, code contributions or just <a href="https://github.com/ed-data/fafsa-api/issues?state=open">feedback on what should be on the roadmap</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-voice/oraclevgoogle/oraclevgoogle.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm just getting time to read through the news coming out of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the next phase of the Oracle v. Google case, which kicked off December 4th in California courts.</p>
<p>A panel of three judges presided over the Oracle v. Google Android/Java copyright appeal hearing, and after <a href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2013/12/detailed-analysis-of-federal-circuit.html">reading several accounts of the hearing</a>, all three judges seem to all agree that the Java API should protected under copyright, but whether Google's use of portions of the Java API is fair use, is still unclear--potentially overturning Judge William Alsup earlier ruling.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that APIs are the "fair use tip" of software that could potentially be covered by copyright and patents. As demonstrated by <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google/amici">my support</a> of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/2013.1021.1022.computer.scientists.amici_.brief_.pdf">Electronic Frontier Foundation amicus brief</a>, I think API definitions remaining fair use is critical to interoperability and and not just a healthy API economy, but the the larger economy.</p>
<p>The hearing last week is just the beginning, the legal battle is likely to go on for a while,  potentially making its way to the Supreme Court and / or possibly heading back to a lower court. Even if the earlier Oracle vs. Google ruling, that APIs aren't copyrightable is upheld, I anticipate we will see many, many legal battles on this front in coming years.</p>
<p>As we increase our vocabulary for describing and designing API interfaces, with approaches such as <a title="Swagger" href="https://bitly.com/1j2KERU+">Swagger</a>, <a title="RAML" href="https://bitly.com/16ZTZYt+">RAML</a> and <a href="https://bitly.com/1cl8tCc+">API Blueprint</a>, attempts to protect these definitions by copyright will increase. While I will continue to support efforts to defend APIs in their entirety as being protected under fair use and free from copyright, I will be focusing my efforts on encouraging healthy API design, sharing and collaboration through placement of API definitions into the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.</p>
<p>While Oracle vs. Google remains a critical case that will have a major impact on the world of APIs, whichever way the case goes, it won't change the importance of <a title="publishing APIs to the commons" href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">publishing API definitions to the commons</a>, setting the precedent for fair use, reinforcing the fact that this open use of API designs is critical to getting us from 10K APIs to millions of APIs, ensuring the interoperability we will need for our increasingly Internet enabled world.</p>

<p>I'm getting more PR folks reaching out to me trying to get me to review their client's API program. I'm happy to add these to my list and make time each week to review them alongside the other new APIs I find each week.</p>
<p>I'm not willing to jump on the phone and hear a pitch about the API. You should send me a short succinct email, or even better a Tweet with a URL and I'm happy to add to my list and make time when i can.</p>
<p>I'm not the usual blogger who just wants to regurgitate what you told me in a briefing or in a press release. Your API and its supporting area should do the talking. I should be able to click on a single link, understand what you do, and be able to find what I need within 5 minutes or less.  If I can't? Well I will let you know.</p>
<p>Think of me as a developer. I will be reviewing your product from that perspective.</p>
<p>So if you are doing PR for an API company, make sure and read my blog, engage me on Twitter and save the briefings and emails for other bloggers. I'm more concerned with the value your client is bringing to the table, and their approach to delivering a self-service API platform.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/11/29/government-services-schemas-with-jsonld/">Government Services Schemas With JSON-LD</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><span>This fall while working in Washington D.C. I was introduced to the concept of</span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/government-services/RepresentingGovernmentServiceswithJSON-LD.pdf">representing government services with JSON-LD</a><span>. Using the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/CivicServices">civic services schema.org</a><span>&nbsp;proposal you can represent common government services that target indvidiuals and businesses, providing a standard that developers can use when presenting government services in websites and mobile applications.</span></p>
<p>I was working on a project to help publish services from the Department of Veterans Affairs, and I wanted to enable people who work at the VA, as well as other agencies to be able to generate and manage JSON-LD representations of their services in the easiest way possible. So I thought to myself, what is the number one way for people in government to manage data? Spreadsheets of course!</p>
<p>I decided to start with Google Docs, and generate a simple JavaScript tool to take a Google Spreadsheet template that was setup with the required fields for a government services schema. Next I wrote an import script using Tabletop.js that would grab the contents of the Google Spreadsheet template and using JavaScript to generate the JSON-LD.</p>
<p>This thanksgiving holiday I decided to add one more tool to my work with government services and JSON-LD, and build a form that anyone could fill out and generate their own government services JSON-LD. The result is a Bootstrap, JQuery form that you can fill out, then hit publish JSON and using JavaScript it generates the JSON-LD representation for you.</p>
<p>I started a <a href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/index.html">project to organize my work around government services</a> and published the <a title="Google Spreadsheet to JSON-LD" href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/google-doc.html">Google Spreadsheet to JSON-LD</a> and the <a title="form to JSON-LD generators" href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/form.html">form to JSON-LD generators</a>. Next I will be adding the ability to save generated files to the Github master repository, making the whole thing a formable, government JSON-LD generator and storage repo.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying developing forms that generate JSON lately. I built an <a href="http://apicommons.org/manifest-generator.html">API Commons manifest generator</a> the other night, and using the same momentum I developed the government services JSON-LD generator. I couldn't think of a more worthy project to spend my time on over Thanksgiving. Hopefully government agencies of all shapes and sizes can more easily generate and publish machine readable lists of the valuable services they offer, so that Google, Yahoo, Bing and other web or mobile app developer can more easily and accurately represent these services in their apps.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-robot-json.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>My friend <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>, Director of Platform for the <a href="http://developer.klout.com/">Klout API</a>, wrote up a great piece before <a title="#APIStrat" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">#APIStrat</a>, called <a href="https://medium.com/p/4d36eab870c9">A Short Proposal for Robots.json</a>.</p>
<p>This is a topic that I've been meaning to make time to discuss, but only now finding time. I love exchanging ideas with <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>, because we tend to disagree on some important API related topics, however he is extremely knowledgeable on the space, and like me he possesses some strong opinions and is very open to lively discussion via blogs, twitter and on stage at events.</p>
<p>On the topics of web scraping, API rate limits, and API access that exist in the realm of what I call the politics of APIs, <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> and I couldn't disagree more on what is acceptable use in the API economy. What is interesting though, within this disagreement we find affinity in the topic of the robots.json.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>&nbsp;has a very succinct description of what a robots.json file would be:</p>
<blockquote><em>A Robots.json file, or something like it, would contain all desired rules for retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody, business models and other use cases allowed and encouraged for developers.</em></blockquote>
<p>I think a machine readable file that provides access to all aspects of an APIs terms of use is a great idea. Beyond the obvious benefits of publishing a robots.json file for API providers and consumers, I think the practice would help standardize industry best practices for API terms and conditions. In my experience most API providers just emulate what they see in the space and if top players lead on this subject, others will follow.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> and I both agree that there should be a robots.json, however we come at it from two opposing viewpoints. <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> is coming at from an API vendor  position, and I'm coming at from the stance of an API consumer. <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> wants to establish a definition of where the provider stands, setting the "rules of the road" as Twitter would say--where I want a single location to find the same definition, so that as an API consumer I can understand the "rules of engagement", and decide if I want to even waste my time, based upon their stance.</p>
<p>With a standardized robots.json, as a developer I could very easily set the bar for which API providers I integrate into my applications. If a company's views on "retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody and business models" are not in alignment with my businesses, I can easily determine this without spending any time learning about their API--something that can be very costly and time consuming.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> uses Craigslists as the lead in for what a possible robots.json file could be used for, and the tone that it could set. While the tone of Craiglist's robots.json file might be very stern, setting what I would consider to be a very uninformed, "get off my lawn" vibe, I don't think all robots.json would reflect this tone.</p>
<p>Forward thinking companies could use a robots.json to easily differentiate themselves from outdated viewpoints on what "retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody and business models" means, allowing developers to quickly identify leading players, and through "markets" set what is the prevailing definition is for the current times.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://asuc.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/universities/uc-berkeley/associated-student-university-california-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>On November 6th, 2013 the <a title="ASUC" href="http://asuc.org/">Associated Students, University of California(ASUC) Senate</a> submitted SB 48: <a href="http://asuc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Week-10-Agenda-Packet-11.6.131.pdf">A Bill in Support of Student Information Systems Application Developers</a>, stating that "open data and API compatibility is a necessary feature in the new Student Information System".</p>
<p>UC Berkeley has embarked on a "Student Information System Replacement Project" that is looking to "replace its constellation of aging, unique, disparate home-grown student systems with a modern, nimble and effective vendor-supported system".  Systems including financial aid, registration, enrollment, admissions and records are being targeted for replacement.</p>
<p>The existing Student Information Systems(SIS) has been in place for over two decades, and facing the same for future systems, the students led organization that represents over 35K students, is taking a stance to ensure that all future systems have APIs. That is some serious forethought and leadership on behalf on the ASUC Senate!</p>
<p>SB 48 puts forth that:</p>
<blockquote><em>an API, or Application Programming Interface, is a foundation put in place on top of a system to securely make specific information and data public to developers for those developers to create third-party extensions and applications pertaining to their specific uses for the data and program</em></blockquote>
<p>API and Integration Architect of UC Berkeley, George Atala(<a href="https://twitter.com/gmatala">@gmatala</a>) adds:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;An SIS API would be critical for supporting the many user applications and other campus systems that serve students. These systems change and evolve continuously, and a real time read/write API is necessary to enable this. The API must cover the full range of core functionality in the SIS, and should support appropriate levels of security for private and public data.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The bill authored by Sahil A Pandya and Quinn Z Shen nails some of the critical areas around APIs being a vital aspect of university operations, and that much of the SIS overhaul will not happen all at once, when in reality the evolution of all campus systems should happen in smaller, bite-size chunks. APIs would help evolve campus information systems from a 20-30 years technology procurement cycle, to a real-time, ongoing, agile systems lifecycle.</p>
<p>Current SIS are operating without APIs, limiting which applications can be integrated and deployed on top of university systems. Even with this current closed approach, there are a handful of student-made applications such as <a title="BerkelyTime" href="/admin/blog/berkeleytime.com">BerkeleyTime</a> and <a href="/admin/blog/ninjacourses.com">NinjaCourses</a>&nbsp;that have emerged showing the demand for better quality SIS applications and tools.</p>
<p>These existing, student-developed applications often obtain their information by scraping publicly available information on the Internet. APIs would provide direct access to information, eliminate scraping load on public websites, and provide analytics and insight into what applications exist, and how they use university and student information.  APIs provide higher level of control and security for UC IT operations, than even the currently closed systems offer. UC Berkeley uses <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a> to manage acess, analytics and other vital aspects of their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/25/get-a-list-of-all-classes-at-uc-berkeley-with-api-call/">recently launch API operations</a>, but unfortunately is not fullly taken advantage of across all university systems..</p>
<p>In addition to current student-developed applications, there are also other faculty-developed extensions to SIS that apply to specific departments, but are not covered by central information systems. All of these student, faculty and third party applications have proven to be so beneficial to students in serving purposes, that many of them have been officially adopted and endorsed by the University.</p>
<p>Imagine a university where each entering student experiences the financial aid, enrollment and registration process, then one of their first opportunities to learn involves actually contributed to building applications and tools that make that process better. In a world where university resources are increasingly strained, the institutions that remain relevant will allow for student, faculty and third party access to all campus resources via APIs.</p>
<p>I think SB 48 nails it again with?</p>
<blockquote><em>"the university with the top computer science department should also have the top student information system in place and harness the talent in its students by allowing them to create applications that enhance and extend features in the information system (i.e. the mantra 'Created by students, for students')"</em></blockquote>
<p>Wait! Information systems created by students for students? What if businesses students could help with data analysis and reporting? What if marketing students could help build interactive campaigns? Sounds like the recipe for some interesting education and work experience for students, and a huge opportunity for the university system to maximize the valuable intellectual exhaust generated by its faculty and students eacUh day.</p>
<p>I have to go out with the last section of SB 48, I think it speaks for itself:</p>
<blockquote><em>"THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Associated Students of the University of California stand in solidarity with student, faculty, and administrative developers under the unified opinion that open data and API compatibility is a necessary feature in the new Student Information System to ensure its longevity and holistic usefulness to students, not only in its core features, but in the potential add-ons from third-party applications and extensions"</em></blockquote>

<p>I'm working on an <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">API for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form</a>. I'm working my way through a document from Department of Education called the <a href="http://www.ifap.ed.gov/appprocspecsswd/1314AppProcSysSoftwareDevSpecsAugust2013Update.html">2013-2014 Application Processing System Specifications for Software Developers</a>.</p>
<p>I'm isolating various datasets, and data models, trying to get a feel for all the API resources I will need for the FAFSA API. The specifications provides several tables of data and data models for me to use, including the actual fields for the FAFSA form.</p>
<p>One dataset that is provided in the PDF is a list of states. It makes sense that a list of states is included for any developer who is building a federal student aid application. And I have a states API available elsewhere, that I've used in several other applications, so building this API will for the project will be easy.</p>
<p>Next I'm thinking..how do I replicate this utility API easily for an external API project like this? One of the architectural considerations for the FAFSA API is to make an API that anyone could fork and easily setup for their own use. That includes the state API resource.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about APIs in general. When it comes to APIs, they are ften attached to brands, like the Twilio API or Twitter API. We do not think of single API definitions as ubiquitous, as utilities or as commodities yet. However there are a lot of common API resources like states, IP addresses, counties, cities and many more, that are essential to many web and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Sure these datasets are widely available, but you need to actually design and deploy the actual API. How do we make utility APIs like this deployable anywhere? Anytime? I should be able to select from a library of common API definitions and easily fork, then deploy to my AWS EC2, AWS Cloud Formation or OpenShift platform. I shouldn't have to rely on 3rd party services for all of these resources.</p>
<p>Of course, not all APIs should be this portable, but there are a number of very common APIs that could. I should be able to launch a new API portal for a public audience or even a private development group, and easily publish the unique, as well as the utility APIs they will need to be successful, in a single, easy to navigate API area.</p>

<p>I was asked to help put some thought into an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid iniative. First, what is FAFSA:</p>
<blockquote>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requires to determine your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The government conducts a &ldquo;need analysis&rdquo; based on financial information, such as income, assets, and other family information, which you (and your parents if you are a dependent student) will be asked to provide.</blockquote>
<p>I'm just getting started with this project, and as I do with all my Public / Private Sector work, I created <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">this umbrella site for my Department of Education open data and API work</a>, and created an individual project site just for the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">Free Application for Federal Student Aid API</a>.</p>
<p>You can participate in the design and development process via the <a href="https://github.com/ed-data">Gitihub repositories</a>, and feel free to ping me @kinlane if you want to get involved. I will post stories here, and on the individual site to chronical its progress, and reference on API Evangelist when applicable.</p>
<p>Next up, understanding what the details of the FAFSA form are, and start considering what some possible architectural designs might work for FAFSA...</p>

<p>I've been pushing the boundaries of open data and API deployment using Github. I have a project I've been evolving since August called <a title="Simple API" href="http://simple-api.github.io/central/">Simple API</a> and its sister implementation <a title="api.ongithub.com" href="http://api.ongithub.com">api.ongithub.com</a>, which allows you to launch an API by forking common API definitions that are hosted on Github.</p>
<p>I was recently introduced to similar approach to geospatial API deployment using GeoJSON stored on Github called <a href="http://gitspatial.com/" target="_blank">GitSpatial</a>. Using the same approach, GitSpatial lets allows you to oAuth into the API deployment platform using your Github login, then spiders your repositories and let's you sync the repositories that contain GeoJSON.</p>
<p>Then using three URL parameters:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>user_name</strong> - Your GitHub user name</li>
<li><strong>repo_name</strong> - A GitHub repo name</li>
<li><strong>feature_set_name</strong> - A file in your repo that contains GeoJSON</li>
</ul>
<p>GitSpatial allows you to construct a geo spatial API resource URI: <strong><em>http://gitspatial.com/:user_name/:repo_name/:feature_set_name</em></strong></p>
<p>Pretty cool stuff! I might be a little biased here, but I think this type of API deployment via Github blueprints, plus JSON data stores is going to be big. I've been experimenting with <a title="API deployments from Github blueprints via Amazon Cloud Formations and Redhat OpenShift" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/20/server-side-api-templates-on-aws-cloud-formation-and-openshift/">API deployments from Github blueprints via Amazon Cloud Formations and Redhat OpenShift</a>, and it seems like the next evolution in cloud driven API deployment to me.</p>
<p>The best part to this approach is that your data, configurations and core elements are maintained within your world as simple, open formats like JSON--then you get to externally connect, using Github, to premium API services that augment and enhance your existing resources.</p>
<p>Lookout for an increase in the number of Github + API solutions in the coming months...</p>

<p>I created <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">11 very simple API designs</a> for the launch of <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>. We needed some API definitions to show the potential of the commons, so I wanted to design a handful of common API patterns to seed the launch.</p>
<p>For all 11 API designs I started with a <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki">Swagger definition</a>, then using PHP and the Slim framework I quickly generated server side code for each API. I generate this code programmatically from the Swagger spec, but I also prefer going through the generated code and giving it a human touch.</p>
<p>This approach isn't just for these 11 API design templates, I'm using it for all my projects right now. I'm designing the API definition, generating and modifying the server side code, publishing Swagger UI documentation, then any client side code libraries I will need.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openshift.com/"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openshift/openshift-logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm publishing the API definition and Swagger UI, plus a project overview completely on Github. Currently I'm generating PHP / Slim framework driven code on AWS EC2 instance. I'm will expand this to include server side frameworks in Ruby, Python, Node.JS.</p>
<p>Next I will take each API definition + server-side code in PHP, Ruby, Python and Node.js and running on Amazon EC2 and port to run in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS Cloud Formation</a> and <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a> from RedHat--providing an open API blueprint that others can deploy in the cloud.</p>
<p>This will be my basic process for any standard API design I'm evolving for <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, APIs I develop internally, as well any API that I design, develop and build for external projects.  As with my stories and open data, I want any API I design to be open and reusable by anyone who is in need of the same API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/appstream/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/appstream/amazon-appstream-main.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>With the growing number of hypermedia API deployments, hypermedia haters&copy; are going to lose a major argument, that hypermedia is just an academic exercise and will never work in the wild. ;-)</p>
<p>The latest hypermedia API I was told about&nbsp;in the wild(thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), is from Amazon Web Services with the recent <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream/latest/developerguide/rest-api.html#rest-api-hal">AppStream API</a>--"a flexible, low-latency service that lets you stream resource intensive applications and games from the cloud".</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream/latest/developerguide/rest-api.html#rest-api-hal">The AWS AppStream API</a> is an API that uses <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">Hypertext Application Language</a> (HAL),  a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between API resources, created by Mike Kelly(<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>) of <a href="http://stateless.co/">Stateless.co</a>. When HAL is used, with each API request, you get a  wealth of links that allow you to programmatically explore the functionality of an API.</p>
<p>For example, you can explore the JSON returned in each response from the application API endpoint, about a specific app you are streaming including using the services, you will find links to determine application status, show information on current session and many more.</p>
<p>Normally with APIs, developers have to explore each API endpoint, and read through documentation to understand the different actions that can be taken against an API. With HAL, API owners can craft links that provide meaningful actions that can be discovered and implemented by developers along the way, teaching them about what is possible with each API call.</p>
<p>Hypermedia goes a long way in extending business rules to developers, not just directing them to what next steps may be taken at each API request, but really save them a lot of homework on how your API business model works, and how to best build an application around an API.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">other hypermedia APIs</a> in the wild, including the very important <a href="http://publicmediaplatform.org/">Public Media Platform (PMP)</a>, but the numbers are still low. I will keep finding quality hypermedia solutions in the wild and sharing them with you as I find.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apache-solr/apache-solr-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was going through the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/#search-endpoint">Free Law Project Court Opinion API</a> today, playing with the API and data, while developing some server and client side tooling.  All the API endpoints are pretty consistence because they used their Django model and the <a href="http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Tastypie framework</a> to generate most of the API.</p>
<p>There is one endpoint that is radically different from the rest of the opinion API: the /search endpoint. The Free Law Project used <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> to generate the /search endpoint results and instead of directly hitting just the database for information it utilized Solr index to do the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Using Solr opens up a whole world of search by introducing common concepts like AND, OR, NOT, fielded queries, wildcards, fuzzy searches and much more when it comes to searching for court opinions.</p>
<p>While the on-boarding of Solr newbies to an endpoint like this takes some education, and the opinion API /search endpoint docs could use a little more polishing to  make it easier to start using, but the concept of a Solr driven endpoint is still very interesting.</p>
<p>Using Solr like this might not work for all API providers, but for some who are heavily using data stores that include document repositories as well, it might be a good idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While <a title="Have A Bunch Of Documents? Launch An API With Apache Solr" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/08/13/have-a-bunch-of-documents-launch-an-api-with-apache-solr/">I have advocated for using Solr to generate an API before</a>, this is the first time I've seen it bundled alongside another API offering so seamlessly, just to drive the search endoint.  I'll be keeping an eye out for others during my regular monitoring.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/">Court Listener Opinions API</a> is a well designed, dead simple REST API with 7 endpoints to search opinions, citations across jurisdictions, using Basic Auth to secure the API.</p>
<p>Along with the simple API and docs, the Court Listener provides a blog and forum to support developers, and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/">bulk downloads of all data</a> in addition to the REST API.</p>
<p>The court opinions API implementation is a model to follow for other public sector open data and API projects. The API and supporting developer area is simple and very well done, providing all the essential building blocks needed to grow an ecosystem around the API and data.</p>
<p>The entire API and data is released in the  public domain, and relies on donations to do the work and keep the lights on--something that should be the bar set for all public data projects.</p>
<p>This external, open approach to liberating, aggregating and improving on vital public sector data, is a model we need to replicate across all areas of city, county, state and federal government in all sectors.</p>

The piece that I'm tracking on specifically right now is around the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/policy-memo">OMB Memorandum M-13-13</a> Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset, in which one of the items require agencies to publish a data.json file that provides a machine readable inventory of each agencies public data assets.</p>
<p>Much like the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/11-more-federal-departments-and-agencies-have-published-their-api-digital-strategies/">tracking I did around the digital strategy</a>, I've <a href="http://data.json.monitor.publicprivatesector.org/">stood up a monitoring script</a> that I got from <a href="https://github.com/philipashlock/farm-server">Philip Ashlock's Github</a>, which I will be running daily to track on which agencies have published their data.json in anticipation of the November 30th deadline. A handful of agencies already have their data.json file up, others show a green check, but in reality their HTTP status codes are incorrect, as <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/11/06/knowing-your-http-status-codes-in-federal-government/">I've talked about before</a>.</p>
<p>I'll re-run this script nightly and keep an eye on which agencies publish their data.json and highlight what types of data sets they've made available. I think in reality, the challenges faced in taking inventory of open data, getting them published will prevent many agencies from making the deadline. Something that was just made worse by the government shutdown in October.</p>
<p>Even with these challenges, I'm hopeful that agencies will surprise us and publish some amazing stuff.</p>

<p>Dyn has 500 managed DNS users and partners using their APIs, growing from 7.3 million monthly API requests in January 2012 to 38.1 million API requests in September 2013, that is a 420% growth over 20 months.</p>

<p>I'm totally thankful for the experiences I've had over the last 90 days in Washington D.C. as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and even more thankful I'm able to keep doing much of the work I was doing during my fellowship. In reality, I'm actually doing more work now, than I was in DC.</p>
<p>While there were several challenges during my time as a PIF, the one that I regret the most, and is taking the longest to recover from, is losing my storytelling voice. This is my ability to capture everyday thoughts in real-time via my Evernote, sit down and form these thoughts into stories, and then share these stories publicly as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>During my time in DC, I was steadily losing my voice. It wasn't some sort of government conspiracy. It is something that seems to happen to me in many institutional or corporate settings, amidst the busy schedule, back to back meetings and through a more hectic project schedule--eventually my voice&nbsp;begins to fade.</p>
<p>In July I wrote 61 blog posts, August 41 and September 21. A very scary trend for me. My blog is more than just just stories for my audience and page views generated. My blog(s) are about me working through ideas and preparing them for public consumption.</p>
<p>Without storytelling via my blog(s) I don't fully process ideas, think them through, flush them out and think about the API space with a critical eye. Without this lifecycle I don't evolve in my career, and maintain my perspective on the space.</p>
<p>In October I've written 28 posts and so far in November I've already written 27 posts, so I'm on the mend. In the future, I'm using my voice as a canary in the coal mine. If a project I'm working on is beginning to diminish my voice, I need to stop and take a look at things, and make sure I'm not heading in a negative direction.</p>

<p>Sometimes no matter how hard you try, you can't get the buy in for APIs within a company or organization. There are many reasons why API efforts will fail within entrenched companies, organizations or government agencies, but in the end you may have to look for alternatives.</p>
<p>If you want to fullfill your API vision, many times you will need to go outside normal operations to get things done. I have multiple projects on my plate right now that have been started as internal projects, but after hitting roadblock after roadblock, key players have approached me to consider doing as an outside project.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to get people interested in APIs, is to get everyone around them talking about APIs or even getting key partners to adopt an API driven approach to a problem. If you can get traction for an API design externally, you may be able to change attitudes.</p>
<p>APIs are about opening up resources for access and use. If you can't get an API designed, developed and deployed internally, consider maybe doing it from the outside-in.</p>

<p>While API Commons is about providing a place to house these very technical design specifications, the largest benefit of API commons will be the process  , community and culture that will form around it. Bringing API design across government and industries out into the open, focusing on sharing, collaboration, reuse and operability will be the true end product--not just the tangible API definition.</p>
<p>As I work on a handful of new API designs for various projects, that I plan on putting in the commons when ready, the importance of API Commons becomes ever clearer. While the end goal appears to be populating the commons with API designs, the real work is about bringing everyone out of the shadows, working on their API designs in a collaborative, re-usable way.</p>

<p>I'm doing a lot more API deployments from dead simple data sources since I started working in the federal government. As part of these efforts I'm working to put together a simple toolkit that newbies to the API world can use to rapidly deploy APIs as well.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I worked through the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">simple, open API implementations</a>, and this week <span>I want to show how to secure access to the API by requiring an AppID and AppKey which will allow you to track on who has access to the API.</span></p>
<p>I'm using <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale API Management</a> infrastructure to secure the demos. 3Scale has a free base offering that allows anyone to get up and running requiring API keys, analytics and other essentials with very little investment.</p>
<p>Currently I have four separate deployment blueprints done:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/deploy-secure-api-mysql-to-api/">MySQL to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/deploy-secure-api-json-to-api/">Local JSON to API</a></li>

<p>I'm working on a variety of ways that anyone can easily deploy API on common cloud platforms. I'm working through a series of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">open</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/secure-api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">secure</a>, modular API demos written in PHP, using the Slim framework.</p>
<p>All of these demos are pretty basic, but currently I'm deploying them on Amazon EC2, because it is where most of my infrastructure runs and a top platform with wide user base. Ultimately my goal is to make them as simple to deploy as I possibly can, and while EC2 is definitely the leader, I know there are even simpler ways to launch simple APIs in the clouds.</p>
<p>I was doing a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/1zVJwxQfyBw">survey of which PaaS platforms government agencies allow their workers to deploy projects on</a>, via the US government API group and was reminded of <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a>, from Redhat. If you aren't familiar with OpenShift, it is a PaaS platform that allows you to define applications in a variety of languages, then deploy, automate, manage and scale in a very modular way.</p>
<p>With OpenShift I can define a very modular application, such as an API running PHP, using Slim framework and even apply what is known as a database cartridge, providing MySQL or Postgres storage for the API--all with a single command line.  I can instruct each application to derive its code from a Git location, allowing me to manage a central library of applications, then deploy specific instances as needed.</p>
<p>While I'm heavily using Github as the primary place to deploy <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">single page applications</a>, that are completely written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON, I still need server side locations to rapidly deploy API driven resources in PHP, Python, Ruby and Node.  OpenShift is a much more modular approach that AWS, and while I'll still be using Amazon for many of my deployments I'm going to play around more with what is possible on OpenShift.</p>
<p>What I really like about this approach, in addition to the modular design is that I can maintain blueprints for common APIs on Github and reference these designs when deploying APIs via OpenShift. This matches up well with what I'm doing with <a title="api.ongithub.com " href="http://api.ongithub.com">api.ongithub.com</a> and <a title="data.ongithub.com" href="http://data.ongithub.com">data.ongithub.com</a> where I working to define simple Git driven approaches to open data and APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/introducing-data-ongithub/">Introducing Data Ongithub</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://data.ongithub.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/github/github-matrix.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am a big fan of opening up data in city, county, state and federal government and across companies of all shapes and sizes. One thing I've learned in my 20+ years of working with data is that when it comes to data management, the spreadsheet is king. While there are always centralized database systems at companies and government organizations, the spreadsheet is actually how data is generally managed, shared and distributed by the average person.</p>
<p><a href="http://data.ongithub.com">Data Ongithub</a> is a project that is focused on tapping the wealth of data available in spreadsheet form and provide a simple platform for converting and managing open data, that anyone can use. While working on open data initiatives I consistently see two major hurdles for individuals who are opening up data:</p>
<blockquote><strong>How Do I Convert My Data To JSON?</strong> JSON is the reigning open data format. It is a light-weight, portable, machine readable format and is the preferred format of programmers over CSV or XML. Even with this popularity there is no common way for individuals to easily convert common data formats like Excel, CSV or XML to JSON without being a programmer.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Where Do I Put My Converted JSON Data Files?</strong> Once users are able to convert their data in JSON, they quickly struggle with where they should put these files to make publicly available.  Even though website hosting is widely available and inexpensive, users have not associated open data with online website storage. Especially within government organizations, individuals struggle with easy storage of their open data files.</blockquote>
<p>Data Ongithub looks to address both these concerns by delivering a lightweight application for conversion of Excel and CSV files to JSON formats, that is developed completely in client-side JavaScript, which means it can run anywhere in any browser. Since it is JavaScript, Data Ongithub lends itself to running completely on the social coding platform Github, which in this scenario acts as the backend storage for the application.</p>
<p>Data Ongithub can be forked and deployed to run under any Github account as a Github page. Every Github repository starts as a master branch, then once you add a Github Page, it adds a gh-pages branch to the repository. Data Ongithub uses the gh-pages branch as the user interface of the application and then employs the master branch as the backend JSON file storage.</p>
<p>Using <a title="oauth.io" href="http://oauth.io">oAuth.io</a>, Data OnGithub enables completely client-side authentication using Github oAuth, and if a user is a member of the repository, they are allowed to not just upload and convert common open data file formats, but also save them as JSON files to the master repository.  This approach creates a self-contained data conversion, management and storage platform that if you keep open source, is completely free to operate.  Think of it as a "pod" for your open data.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-google-drive-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm working on a series of simple scripts that help people deploy APIs from some of the most common data sources. I'm starting with a series of PHP scripts, and a couple weeks ago I did a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">public Google Spreadsheet to API demo</a>, and this week I want to show how to secure access to the API by requiring an AppID and AppKey which will allow you to track on who has access to the API.</p>
<p>For this PHP implementation, I'm using the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">SLIM framework</a>, which provides a dead simple REST framework you can use to deploy an API from a variety of data sources.   To begin deploying an API from your Google Spreadsheet datastore, download the REST library and upload to your server that runs PHP.</p>
<p>Slim is pretty straightforward to work with, to add each API endpoint you just add a single PHP file under methods. For this how-to guide we are going to add a simple endpoint from our spreadsheet products data store.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7104824.js"></script>
<p>Next you just add an include reference in the index page for your slim implementation. Everything up until now was the same as the open public Google Spreadsheet to API solution, but not on the index page we will wrap the entry point to the API, with a <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale API Management</a> layer. 3Scale is free to sign up and you pay as you scale, so all it takes to get going is register for a 3Scale account and choose the base account, and under your account settings you will find your key to link this code to your account.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7510004.js"></script>
<p>This API just uses ID, Name, Price and Description of the product, and queries by a simple query parameter. You can use this as a template for your own product database, adding and removing fields as you need, or completely retrofitting for any database table.  That is it, now you have a simple product API that pulls a list of products from a Google Spreadsheet data store.</p>
<p>There are any number of reasons you would want to secure an API driven from a Google Spreadsheet file, to offer advanced search, filtering or just to track on who is accessing resources. This solution just uses 3Scale to secure the API interface, requiring an AppID and Appkey to use the API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully that demonstrates a simple approach to securing an API that is driven from a Google Spreadsheet file.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439653.js"></script>
<p>Before all of this works you need to have an oAuth token, which I created a simple script to handle:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439681.js"></script>
<p>I leave it to you to figure out where you want to store your oAuth tokens, and other goods. I use a config.php file, but can easily be done from database or other:</p>

<p>I have a long list of little projects I'm working on across government, and since I'm not being paid for some of this work now (except for the support of my amazing partners), the publicity and page views for this work is all I got! :-) So I'm publishing the stories around everything I do.</p>
<p>This week I got a sneak peak of the Smithsonian EDAN API which provides access to meta data of collections housed at the Smithsonian Institute, along with the ability to tag items and build collections.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian is <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/luce-foundation-center-hackathon-tickets-7945919459">holding a hackathon this weekend</a> and I wanted to contribute what I could, so I pulled together a PHP code library as I explored and hacked not the Smithsonian EDAN API. The library isn't a beautiful product ready SDK, but should help the average PHP developer get up to speed on the API and save some time building their app.</p>

<p>I have a long list of little projects I'm working across government, and since I'm not being paid for some of this work now (except for the support of my amazing partners), the publicity and page views for this work is all I got! :-) So I'm publishing the stories around everything I do.</p>
<p>Up next: I was asked for some feedback on the FDA Recall API that is in pre-production currently, and I thought, what better way to offer feedback on API design than actually <a href="http://api.fda.publicprivatesector.org/swagger/kinlane/recalls/recalls">sculpting a Swagger definition of the changes</a> and making it <a href="http://fda-data.github.io/fda-recalls/">usable via Github</a>.</p>
<p>Overall the FDA Recall API design was perfectly suitable for launch, even though the interface isn't perfect and some of the data is pretty messy, but I'm a big fan of just getting things out there, letting developers hack on it and gather feedback for the next iteration.</p>
<p>The existing FDA Recall API allows you to pull weekly recalls for 5 separate product types including Food, Drugs, Veterinarian, Devices and Biologics. Using the API you can pull each week listing of recalls as well as pull detail on individual recalls.</p>
<p>To get a handle on where they should take the interface I needed to hack on it like I was a developer, so I setup a proxy that runs on AWS EC2 and started coding against each endpoint, then adjusting a Swagger definition until I had something that was acceptable for a v.01.</p>
<p>You can find the result of this work over at the <a href="http://fda-data.github.io/fda-recalls/">FDA Recall API working project I stood up on Github</a>, it should work until they make any adjustments to the pre-production API. You can follow any work I do on <a href="http://fda-data.github.io/developer/index.html">FDA open data and APIs at the main project site</a> I setup.</p>

<p>I was asked to help put some thought into an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid iniative. First, what is FAFSA:</p>
<blockquote>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requires to determine your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The government conducts a &ldquo;need analysis&rdquo; based on financial information, such as income, assets, and other family information, which you (and your parents if you are a dependent student) will be asked to provide.</blockquote>
<p>I'm just getting started with this project, and as I do with all my Public / Private Sector work, I created <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">an umbrella site for my Department of Education open data and API work</a>, and created an individual project site just for the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">Free Application for Federal Student Aid API</a>.</p>
<p>You can participate in the design and development process via the <a href="https://github.com/ed-data">Gitihub repositories</a>, and feel free to ping me @kinlane if you want to get involved. I will post stories here, and on the individual site to chronical its progress, and reference on API Evangelist when applicable.</p>
<p>Next up, understanding what the details of the FAFSA form are, and start considering what some possible architectural designs might work for FAFSA...</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/ifthisthenthat/IFTTT___Connect_YouTube_to_SoundCloud.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am a programmer with a full understanding of how to deploy, consume and put APIs to use. Even with this knowledge and ability I'm continually blown away by the opportunities APIs afford, even without possessing any programming skills whatsoever.</p>
<p>One API I depend on for my daily monitoring of the API space is the <a title="Pinboard API" href="https://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard API</a>. As I browse the web, using the Pinboard bookmarklet I can pin any web page for use later, then using the Pinboard API I pull these curated pages into my monitoring, reporting and story development platform. To take this feature one step further, when I star a Tweet on Twitter, Pinboard watches this and automatically bookmarks the Tweet, adding it to my curation as well.</p>
<p>This approach to using APIs has allowed me to define how I use bookmarking as well as what a favorited Tweet means in my personal world of online curation. Using APIs I'm able to wield this power, and drive my story curation and development lifecycle. Of course I wrote the code that interfaces with Pinboard API, but it still shows the ability to define and execute actions in my world using APIs.</p>
<p>As I was pondering this self-defined action that I use on a daily basis, I was trying to think of any new actions that I could define and add to my toolbox. I was looking through the <a title="Youtube Videos from APIStrat Conference" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat?feature=watch">Youtube videos from my recent #APIStrat conference</a>, and I thought how nice it would be to turn these into audio segments available as podcasts through SoundCloud. After a quick search I found an IFTTT recipe that does this automatically when I flag any Youtube video for watching later and automatically uploads as an audio file to SoundCloud. Sweet!</p>
<p>This type of action again shows the power of being able to define and execute your own actions that you can take in your everyday worlds, but in this case you don't have to be a programmer to make it work. Using APIs I was able to define further meaning beyond just watching a video for later, something that ultimately increases the chance I will be able to consume a topic via my SoundCloud iPhone player as I'm walking somewhere, waiting for a plane or who knows where. Also #APIStrat gets the added benefit of syndication to SoundCloud as part of the action.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to educate the masses that these potential recipes for taking action exist out there in the world, but it definitely makes me optimistic for the future of APIs and how they can benefit anyone, even if you aren't a developer.</p>

<p>I just found an interesting brainstorm going on via Github, about how to make government more efficient and interoperable using APIs, that was created by government consultant Leah Bannon (<a href="https://twitter.com/leahbannon">@leahbannon</a>), called <a title="If Gov Then That" href="https://github.com/leahbannon/if-gov-then-that/">If Gov Then That</a>.</p>
<p>The idea?  <strong>Promote gov APIs by making them dead simple and suggesting clever recipes (like IFTTT and Zapier)</strong></p>
<p>Leah has started a rough list of some possible recipes, but needs your help to brainstorm what you'd like to see for developing interoperability and automation recipes in our government.</p>
<p>You can contribute via the <a href="https://github.com/leahbannon/if-gov-then-that/">Github project</a>, on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/no4TjQFGfaw">conversation thread she started on the US Government APIs Google Group</a>, and she will be working on as part of <a href="http://codefordc.org/">Code for DC</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-google-docs.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm working on a series of simple scripts that help people deploy APIs from some of the most common data sources. I'm starting with a series of PHP scripts, and next up is a private Google Spreadsheet to API, using JSON stored in Github.</p>
<p>For this PHP implementation, I'm using the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">SLIM framework</a>, which provides a dead simple REST framework you can use to deploy an API from a variety of data sources.   To begin deploying an API from your Google Spreadsheet datastore, download the REST library and upload to your server that runs PHP.</p>
<p>Slim is pretty straightforward to work with, to add each API endpoint you just add a single PHP file under methods. For this how-to guide we are going to add a simple endpoint from our JSON products data store.</p>
<p>This project also depends on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/">Google Drive API</a> and I use the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-api-php-client/">Google API PHP Client</a> to connect to Google and provide necessary oAuth connectivity.&nbsp;</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439653.js"></script>
<p>Before all of this works you need to have an oAuth token, which I created a simple script to handle:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439681.js"></script>
<p>I leave it to you to figure out where you want to store your oAuth tokens, and other goods. I use a config.php file, but can easily be done from database or other:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439703.js"></script>
<p>Next you just add an include reference in the index page for your slim implementation:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439726.js"></script>
<p>This API just uses ID, Name, Price and Description of the product, and queries by a simple query parameter. You can use this as a template for your own product database, adding and removing fields as you need, or completely retrofitting for any database table.  That is it, now you have a simple product API that pulls a list of products from a private Google Spreadsheet data store.</p>
<p>This project is more excercise than anything else. I don't recommend deploying a public API driectly off a private Google Spreadsheet. Next up, will be to secure it using an <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API infrastructure provider like 3Scale</a>, and possibly build in some caching.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've been working through several demos of how to go from common data sources like MySQL and Google Spreadsheet to API over the last couple of weeks.  So far I have five basic working demos:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/21/deploy-api-mysql-to-api">MySQL to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/21/deploy-api-json-to-api">Local JSON to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-github-json-to-api">Github JSON to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api">Public Google Spreadsheet to API</a></li>
<li><a title="Private Google Spreadsheet to API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">Private Google Spreadsheet to API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These demos are meant to show how easy it is to deploy a simple API from common places you already have data stored. Right now I'm building them in PHP, but will also be building Python, Ruby and Node.JS versions.</p>
<p>These exercises are meant for my newbie readers but are also helping me see API deployment in different ways. I realize how difficult it is to write code that will work for all scenarios. There is a lot of custom work on the data store side, as well as possible the API side, making me feel like it is best to use an API definition in the middle.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the next phase of my API deployment tools will be about generating API definitions, which currently will be <a href="http://bit.ly/1j2KERU">Swagger</a>, but will also develop <a href="http://bit.ly/16ZTZYt">RAML</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a> versions of the same code eventually.</p>
<p>Once I have some data store to Swagger tooling I will evolve some of the code I have for generating APIs from Swagger definitions.</p>
<p>Then I will have the different custom parts decoupled from each other, all centered around an API definition and data model which I can publish in <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a> and evolve in an open, collaborative environment where everyone can benefit, and contribute to my API work.</p>

<p>I was working with Google APIs over the last couple days while building <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">Google Spreadsheet to API tools</a>. It gave me a chance to look around the <a href="https://developers.google.com">Google Developers Area</a> and rediscover some of the positive approaches the API pioneer brings to the table.</p>
<p>In this post I wanted to highlight the <a title="Google Drive Code Libraries" href="https://developers.google.com/drive/downloads">Google Drive Code Libraries</a>. While the Google approach isn't perfect, I think it sets a good bar for what can be achieved by API providers when delivering their own API code libraries.</p>
<p><a title="Google Drive Code Libraries" href="https://developers.google.com/drive/downloads"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-drive/google-drive-code-samples-2.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I think the languages represented are the baseline for any modern API, and all API providers should consider providing the following languages:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>.NET</li>
<li>Go</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p>Languages like Go and Node.js are definitely forward leaning, but represent very fast growing areas of the API integration space.</p>
<p>Java and Objective-C represent the mobile space, something API providers can't be ignoring in 2013.</p>
<p>If your target audience is the enterprise, you have to have .NET and Java as part of your API library.</p>
<p>PHP, Python and Ruby are the web staples, that are default for any API that is catering to general web developers.</p>
<p>It should get easier to generate code libraries automatically for API providers who have developed some sort of API definition for their APIs, but for others you will still have eto hand-roll your own code lbiraries.</p>

<p>Complete mobile applications is a great way to showcase what a complete API integration will look like, helping developers see the end goal clearly, while also teaching them best practices.</p>

<p>I've created a new playground for some of my work. Pretty much everything at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> runs on Github, and each new project I produce starts its life as a Github repository.  To support this work I established a new domain called ongithub.</p>
<p>My first series in the ongithub realm is based upon an approach I'm using to deploy very simple APIs, while also introducing and educating people about APIs. I have a handful of simple API designs from working in the government, so I married them with data models derived from <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>, and publish over 10 very simple API design patterns.</p>
<p>Every one of these demo APIs began as a simple <a title="swagger" href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger specification</a>, which I quickly spun into a web API using the <a title="SLIM REST Framework" href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim REST Framework</a>, then generated a simple API microsite complete with interactive documentation.</p>
<p>These Swagger specifications were the seed of the recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/05/3scale-launches-api-commons-to-allow-developers-to-share-apis-under-creative-commons-licenses/">API Commons that 3Scale and API Evangelist just launched</a>. I have plenty of other API designs laying around, but this seemed like a good way to seed the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> with some simple and common designs.</p>
<p>You can find the following 11 designs at <a title="api.ongithub.com" href="http://api.ongithub.com">api.ongithub.com</a>:</p>

<p>Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) from API infrastructure provider <a title="API infrastructure provider" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist launched a new partner project yesterday at <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag</a>, that we are calling <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.  The mission with API commons is to provide a simple and transparent mechanism for the copyright free sharing and collaborative design of API specifications, interfaces and data models.</p>
<p>For a space that is about open access and interoperability the API industry has been very closed about their API designs, and after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/02/helping-eff-urge-the-courts-to-block-copyright-claims-in-oracle-v-google-api-fight/">helping the EFF urge the courts to block copyright claims in the Oracle v. Google API fight</a>, Steve and I thought it would be a good idea to introduce an API commons that would help put the "open" into API designs and data models, and back into the API space in gernal.</p>
<p>API Commons is build entirely on Github and is meant to act as a common index of API definitions and data models that <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">anyone can add by generating what we are calling an API Commons Manifest</a> that points to your API definition(s). Using the existing layers of Github, anyone can fork, favorite or follow the best API design patterns and eventually help establish some clear best practices across any government or business sector.</p>
<p>Everything you need to get going is on the site at <a title="apicommons.org" href="http://apicommons.org">apicommons.org</a>. You can join the discussion on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/api-commons">Google Group</a> or by <a href="https://twitter.com/apicommons">following us on Twitter</a>. We are in early stages, but will be dedicating a great deal of time over the holidays to get more API definitions in the commons.</p>
<p>3Scale and I strongly believe that API Commons is what the API industry needs to help deal with some of the clutter in the number of API designs, incentivize the development of open and common tooling around the best API designs and bring reuse, collaboration and copyright concerns out into the open.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/open-government-partnership.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"> </a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">On the second anniversary of the </a><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">Open Government Partnership (OGP)</a>, where we are celebrating a "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/10/31/fact-sheet-marking-progress-second-anniversary-open-government-partnersh">global effort to encourage transparent, effective, and accountable governance</a>", and that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>OGP has grown to 60 countries that have made more than 1000 commitments to improve the governance of more than two billion people around the globe.  OGP is now a global community of government reformers, civil society leaders, and business innovators working together to develop and implement ambitious open government reforms and advance good governance.</em></p>
<p>That is some pretty significant platform growth! While reading this I'm reminded of how any amount of perceived growth and value delivered via an "open data or API platform" can be immediately muted by the omission of very fundamental building blocks like privacy.</p>
<p>Let's review the building blocks of the Open Government Alliance:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Expand Open Data -&nbsp;</strong>Open Data fuels innovation that grows the economy and advances government transparency and accountability.  Government data has been used by journalists to uncover variations in hospital billings, by citizens to learn more about the social services provided by charities in their communities, and by entrepreneurs building new software tools to help farmers plan and manage their crops.  Building upon the successful implementation of open data commitments in the first U.S. National Action Plan, the new Plan will include commitments to make government data more accessible and useful for the public, such as reforming how Federal agencies manage government data as a strategic asset, launching a new version of Data.gov, and expanding agriculture and nutrition data to help farmers and communities.</li>
<li><strong>Modernize the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) -&nbsp;</strong>The FOIA encourages accountability through transparency and represents a profound national commitment to open government principles.  Improving FOIA administration is one of the most effective ways to make the U.S. Government more open and accountable.  Today, the United States announced a series of commitments to further modernize FOIA processes, including launching a consolidated online FOIA service to improve customers&rsquo; experience and making training resources available to FOIA professionals and other Federal employees.</li>
<li><strong>Increase Fiscal Transparency -&nbsp;</strong>The Administration will further increase the transparency of where Federal tax dollars are spent by making federal spending data more easily available on USASpending.gov; facilitating the publication of currently unavailable procurement contract information; and enabling Americans to more easily identify who is receiving tax dollars, where those entities or individuals are located, and how much they receive.</li>
<li><strong>Increase Corporate Transparency -&nbsp;</strong>Preventing criminal organizations from concealing the true ownership and control of businesses they operate is a critical element in safeguarding U.S. and international financial markets, addressing tax avoidance, and combatting corruption in the United States and abroad.  Today we committed to take further steps to enhance transparency of legal entities formed in the United States.</li>
<li><strong>Advance Citizen Engagement and Empowerment -&nbsp;</strong>OGP was founded on the principle that an active and robust civil society is critical to open and accountable governance.  In the next year, the Administration will intensify its efforts to roll back and prevent new restrictions on civil society around the world in partnership with other governments, multilateral institutions, the philanthropy community, the private sector, and civil society.  This effort will focus on improving the legal and regulatory framework for civil society, promoting best practices for government-civil society collaboration, and conceiving of new and innovative ways to support civil society globally.</li>
<li><strong>More Effectively Manage Public Resources -&nbsp;</strong>Two years ago, the Administration committed to ensuring that American taxpayers receive every dollar due for the extraction of the nation&rsquo;s natural resources by committing to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).  We continue to work toward achieving full EITI compliance in 2016.  Additionally, the U.S. Government will disclose revenues on geothermal and renewable energy and discuss future disclosure of timber revenues.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can you argue with that? Its very sensible set of open government platform building blocks right? However, when you look at the bigger picture you realize there is a significant building block, that us in the tech sector have realized is essential to a healthy platform ecosystem missing:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Citizen Data Privacy -</strong> Ensuring that government respects the online privacy of each and every U.S. citizen, preventing unwanted harvesting of private data or meta data that exists in cloud environments, computer and mobile devices as well as transported across telecommunications infrastructure locally or abroad. When privacy is compromised in the name of law enforcement or national security, the laws, rules and procedures around these accepted situations are made publicly accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is great that our government is committed to expanding open data, increasing transparency and efficiently engaging citizens, and sensibly manage public resources. However if our government wants to act as an open platform, just like any private sector platform, they must respect user privacy.</p>
<p>Without ensuring privacy for users, it doesn't matter how forward thinking your open data, information and API strategy is. Privacy and security are essential building blocks any private or public sector entity looking to build an open platform.</p>
<p>Nice work around the Open Government Partnership, but without addressing the privacy of citizens it is rendered pretty useless.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Oct 2013</span>

<p>I'm working on a series of simple scripts that help people deploy APIs from some of the most common data sources. I'm starting with a series of PHP scripts, and next up is a public Google Spreadsheet to API, using JSON stored in Github.</p>
<p>For this PHP implementation, I'm using the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">SLIM framework</a>, which provides a dead simple REST framework you can use to deploy an API from a variety of data sources.   To begin deploying an API from your Google Spreadsheet datastore, download the REST library and upload to your server that runs PHP.</p>
<p>Slim is pretty straightforward to work with, to add each API endpoint you just add a single PHP file under methods. For this how-to guide we are going to add a simple endpoint from our JSON products data store.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7104824.js"></script>
<p>Next you just add an include reference in the index page for your slim implementation:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7104830.js"></script>
<p>This API just uses ID, Name, Price and Description of the product, and queries by a simple query parameter. You can use this as a template for your own product database, adding and removing fields as you need, or completely retrofitting for any database table.  That is it, now you have a simple product API that pulls a list of products from a Google Spreadsheet data store.</p>
