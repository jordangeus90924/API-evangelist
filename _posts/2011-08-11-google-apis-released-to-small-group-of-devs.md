{% include JB/setup %}<p>Google just put up a new Google+ Platform blog today, to support the growing demand around their new social platform.Developers have been waiting for the release of the Google+ API, so they can get to work building Google+ applications.While Google did put up aGoogle+ developers signup form, there has been no other word about access to the Google+ APIs.Apparently, todays launch of games on Google+ represents the first wave of developers using the Google+ APIs.Google chose to release the Google+ API to a small number of gaming partners so they could experiment, gather feedback and work the kinks out of the Google+ APIs before releasing it into the wild.</p>
