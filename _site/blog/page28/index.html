        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a title="code share" href="http://developer.force.com/codeshare/apex/resultspage?l=mru&amp;title=All%20Projects"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/salesforce/salesforce-code-share.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Salesforce has a pretty cool <a title="code share" href="http://developer.force.com/codeshare/apex/resultspage?l=mru&amp;title=All%20Projects">Code Share</a>&nbsp;area within the DeveloperForce ecosystem, which allows developers to share code snippets with the rest of the community.</p>
<p>Its a pretty cool way for anyone to share their techniques as code samples in a variety of languages, then letting the community vet the code, fork larger projects, and collaborate to improve the code for the greater good.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that they don't have the internal resources to fully support the process, <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/02/bringing-code-and-community-together.html">Salesforce has halted code samples submission, announcing plans to migrate the Code Sharing program to Github</a>.</p>
<p>Github is already the largest code sharing platform, providing social tools that developers are used to.  Salesforce's publiclackowledgement that they don't have the internal resources to operate, the fact they identify the importance of such a program, and the decision to migrate to Github are all very savvy moves by the <a title="API Pioneer" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">API pioneer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Github%20101">Github is one of the most important platforms you can use to support your API</a>.  Using Github to host all your API code samples and SDKs, whether they are generated internally or by your developers community is becoming more than a novelty, but an essential part of API operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/google/google-html-developer-udacity-class.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Google is using the <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/02/udacity-html5-game-development-course.html">online learning platform Udacity to teach developers about game development</a>.  The new <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255">HTML Game Development course</a> (CS255), is the online classroom for the programming class, coupled with a series of study groups hosted at Google's San Francisco office and a contest providing developers an incentive to complete the class.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/live/">Google is kicking off the course with a live session</a>, with Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun on Thursday, February 14th at 10:30 AM and the class<span>&nbsp;will be taught by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts">Colt McAnlis</a><span>&nbsp;(Developer Advocate, Chrome Developer Relations),&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts">Peter Lubbers</a><span>(Program Manager, Chrome Developer Relations), and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105495497383489174073/posts">Sean Bennett</a><span>&nbsp;(Architect, Udacity).</span></p>
<p>The HTML Game Development course from Google is an interesting approach to developer education by providing an online course bundled with in-person or streamed workshops and study groups, bundled with a contest to help motivate students.</p>
<p>I may create a blueprint for other API providers to follow, when launching their own courses in a similar way to Google.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/13/aws-api-reference-architecture/">AWS API Reference Architecture</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/aws/aws-ecommerce-reference-architecture.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was checking out the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/02/three-new-aws-reference-architectures-for-e-commerce.html">updates to the AWS Reference Architecture</a>, where they provide blueprints for how you can use AWS. In this version AWS provides an e-commerce architecture reference--providing a system overview, a detailed architectural diagram, and a list of the AWS services used in the architectural approach.</p>
<p>The AWS e-commerce architecture reference provides three separate areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web Frontend </strong>- This is a reference architecture for the web frontend of an e-commerce site. It makes use of Route 53, CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, ElastiCache, DynamoDB and CloudSearch</li>
<li><strong>Checkout Pipeline </strong>- This is a reference architecture for a secure and highly available checkout pipeline service for an e-commerce site. It uses the Virtual Private Cloud, the Simple Workflow Service, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, and the Simple Email Service</li>
<li><strong>Marketing &amp; Recommendations Service</strong> - This is a reference architecture for a marketing and recommendation service for an e-commerce site. It uses Elastic MapReduce, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, DynamoDB, and the Simple Email Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond providing the <a href="http://media.amazonwebservices.com/architecturecenter/AWS_ac_ra_ecommerce_webfrontend_14.pdf">detailed reference card</a>, AWS provides more information on a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/aws-training/architect/">three-day course in AWS Architecture Training</a> that will be held in numerous U.S. cities this spring.</p>
<p>I will add API architecture references as a <a href="/">building block for API owners</a> to consider when planning and managing an API.  If you can provide clear blueprints for developers to follow, you can increase the chances developers will be successful with integration of an API into their application or systems.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> is happening next week in NYC. I have had so much fun pulling together the schedule of keynotes, panels, sessions and the talks on the 429 - Too Many Requests stage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The number of requests we've received for sponsoring, speaking and attending has been overhelming. &nbsp;Resulting in a sold out conference, and an amazing lineup of speakers. &nbsp;I was spending some time tidying up the speakers page and sponsor page today, and was so impressed with the companies involved, I had to share.</p>
<p>There are 72 companies represented at API Strategy &amp; Practice:</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but I'm pretty blown away by the list of companies that will be attendance. &nbsp;I'm stoked we were able to pull together such an awesome lineup. &nbsp;I wish I could publish a list of companies who are attending, because that list would equally blow your mind. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's exciting to see the buzz around APIs in 2013, and I look forward to seeing you at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>.</p>

<p>Palo Alto has opened up city data, including <a href="http://paloalto.opendata.junar.com/dashboards/8031/library/" target="_blank">operational data about the Palo Alto City Library</a>.  Using the Palo Alto City open data portal you can access machine-readable data sets about various aspects of library operations including visitor count, checkouts by type of materia, information and circulation services, programs attendance, website visitors count and how library funds are spent.</p>
<p>The Palo Alto open data portal provides widgets with data grids and charts derived from data.  But you can also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/it/open_data/suggest_a_dataset.asp">request data sets</a> and access data via the <a href="http://paloalto.opendata.junar.com/developers/">City of Palo Alto's API</a>.</p>
<p>The city hopes that it will increase community engagement by making data open and machine readable by default. The city is looking to throw hackathons that will develop solutions, and increase public engagement in city government, and ultimately save money and enhance city services.</p>
<p>The City of Palo Alto open data portal is provided by cloud-based <a href="http://www.junar.com/">Junar Open Data Platform</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/openi/openi-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space is picking up momentum in 2013.  I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 BaaS providers, in hopes of better understanding what is being offered in this space.  Today I came across an interesting new, open source BaaS platform, being developed in the European Union called <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank">OPENi</a>.</p>
<p>The project describes itself as:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi is a European Union ICT Framework Programme (FP7) Information and communications technology (ICT) Collaborative project. Over the 30 month project duration we aim to deliver an open-source, cloud based platform for integrating mobile services.</em></blockquote>
<p>With a mission to:</p>
<blockquote><em>Our mission is to inspire innovation in the European mobile applications industry, by radically improving the interoperability of cloud-based services and trust in personal cloud storage through the development of a consumer-centric, open source mobile cloud applications platform.</em></blockquote>
<p>With the following objective:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi&rsquo;s objective is to directly address the lack of interoperability between cloud based services and enable applications to access and use a broad spectrum of existing cloud based functionality and content, consistently across different devices and platforms, in a way that enables a user-centric application experience. Targeting the needs of Application Developers, Services Providers and Consumers, OPENi will realize its vision for user-centric, cloud-connected, mobile applications.</em></blockquote>
<p>OPENi is a 30 month project, we will have to wait and see what comes out of the iniative. With the EU approach to open data and data privacy, I think there is a lot of potential to deploy and consume APIs, as well as delivering API automation, interoperability and backend platforms that have a healthy, consumer-centric approach--which I believe will be good for business, because its good for ender users.</p>
<p>In early 2013 the OPENi team will release software for the BaaS platform as an open-source project on github.com.  When released I will evaluate it side by side with the other BaaS providers I&rdquo;m tracking on.</p>

<p>Facebook is going to provide content for web and mobile developers, with attention in other specialty areas like gaming and information for publishers.</p>
<p>The first edition of the channel will be recorded live on February 19th, with Director of Product Doug Purdy, with the top 3 things every mobile developer needs to know.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Automation.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately thinking about <a title="emerging trends in API usage" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">emerging trends in API usage</a>. One area I&rsquo;m tracking on, is around companies that are offering simple services that provide interoperability and automation between cloud platforms, using APIs.   The best known examples are from companies like <a title="IFTTT" href="http://ifttt.com">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, who provide end users with simple icon based tools for defining  tasks that move data between SaaS platforms.</p>
<p>Its tough to define this space, which in enterprise speak is really just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">Extract Transform Load (ETL)</a>, which is historically a process to migrate information between systems in an enterprise, using data sources and web services.  But with the popularity of web APIs, we need to rethink ETL in the context of the cloud and update how we approach interoperability between the growing number of API driven platforms.</p>
<p>Mike Reich of Seabourne, and I were discussing this last time I was in Washington D.C., and he currently has a great blog post on <a title="rethinking ETL in the API age" href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/">rethinking ETL for the API age</a>.  If you don&rsquo;t know <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a>, they are behind high profile government projects like <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a> and <a title="GovInfo" href="http://govinfo.io/">GovInfo</a>.  They have been doing a lot of thinking about how to acquire, process and publish content with APIs.</p>
<p>To better help <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>&nbsp;better understand the space, I&rsquo;m watching 12 service providers that I&rsquo;m putting in a bucket of what I consider the next generation of ETL providers:</p>

<p>I feel that this new group of ETL providers are focused sufficiently on the new world of API driven platforms, beyond just "data sources" and "web services".  There are more providers like <a href="http://apatar.com/">Apatar</a> and <a href="http://www.jitterbit.com/Solutions/etl-data-integration">Jitterbit</a>, but I feel these providers are more ETL than, than reflecting new breed of API interoperability providers (which I don&rsquo;t have proper name for yet).  One characteristic I&rsquo;m looking for is ease of use.  I think this new breed should be more for end-users, SaaS users and ultimately empowering the masses--not IT, which I feel ETL is designed for.</p>
<p>This new generation of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/interoperability.php">interoperability providers</a> should be about solving the problems average users face when operating online and in the cloud, and not just extracting, transforming and loading--making ETL something anyone can understand and put to use. &nbsp;Further democratizing IT resources, which is a common theme with SaaS, APIs, etc.</p>
<p>I think the new players like Zapier and IFTTT have to be concerned with getting too complex for everyday users, become more ETL, than being about solving end-user problems.  I think we will need very specialized, niche implementations--much like we are seeing with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/baas.php">BaaS</a> and the emergence of specialized versions like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">BaaS for gaming</a>.  Very niche versions of ETL like <a title="SortMyBox" href="http://www.sortmybox.com/">SortMyBox</a> and <a href="http://wappwolf.com/dropboxautomator/">WapWolf Dropbox Automator</a>, which focus only on solving file management problem users are facing, will be successful, because they are easy for users to understand and put to work.</p>
<p>I think there is an opportunity to quickly build the next generation ETL solutions that solve a set of automation, integration and interoperability problems for a niche audience using the simple icon based format we are seeing from providers like IFTT and <a title="Elastic.io" href="http://elastic.io/">Elastic.io</a>.  If you are considering building one of these new solutions, make sure and evaluate existing open source ETL solutions like:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel, by rolling out your own ETL framework if at all possible.  This will allow you to focus on the specific acquire, transform and publish needs of your niche audience.  Even some of the new breed of providers are providing open source tools, like the <a href="https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki">Geekier project</a> from <a href="https://rules.io/">Rules.io</a>, so do your homework. Also consider putting existing API aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> to use, providing faster acquire and publish API connections with popular APIs, while also standardizing the objects across all platforms.</p>
<p>I can envision video, photo, quantified-self and other niche services emerge that will empower any user to put APIs to use and acquire, transform and publish the valuable data, information and other content that are central to our increasingly fragmented online lives.  These new solutions will be framed in easy to understand terms that speak to specific audiences,  putting valuable API resources within reach of the masses.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/baas-trends.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been processing a <a href="http://branch.com/b/apicalls-successtax">conversation over at Branch</a>, that was triggered by a story in TechCrunch by Sarah Perez(<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa">@sarahintampa</a>) called, &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/stackmob-ratchets-up-the-competition-makes-api-calls-free-launches-a-marketplace-for-third-party-mobile-services/">StackMob Ratchets Up The Competition: Makes API Calls Free, Launches A Marketplace For Third-Party Mobile Services</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are several layers to the convSteersation, the part I&rsquo;m focusing on is about how BaaS providers are structuring their pricing, in which Sarah Perez writes:</p>
<blockquote><em>StackMob is now making API calls free. This latter news will impact the competitive landscape, which includes startups like Parse, Kinvey and others, all of which have traditionally charged developers as API calls increase alongside an app&rsquo;s popularity.</em></blockquote>
<p>Making the argument that:</p>
<blockquote><em>Today, developers have to have an understanding of how many API calls they make, and if an app becomes really successful, developers are penalized for that with increased pricing.</em></blockquote>
<p>Sarah quotes StackMob CEO Ty Amell, saying that:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t really all that fair, explaining that it doesn&rsquo;t matter to StackMob how many API calls the app makes &ndash; the cost to them doesn&rsquo;t really go up. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to us whether someone&rsquo;s making a million API calls or 20 million API calls &ndash; the cost is fairly manageable on our parts. So we felt like this was a blocker to innovation on the developer&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;And we feel like API calls are starting to become a commodity, where it&rsquo;s really how can you provide value beyond that?&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The conversation immediately begins on Twitter, with:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Steve <span>Gershnik</span>(<a href="https://twitter.com/StackMobSteve">@StackMobSteve</a>) of Stackmob</strong> - @stackmob doesn't charge for 'active users' either. No success tax for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Joe Chernov (<a href="https://twitter.com/jchernov">@jchernov</a>) of Kinvey </strong>- but you charge for features. In the end, everyone charges for something. It's business!</blockquote>
<p>After this, the conversation moves to Branch.  I&rsquo;m not including full comments, because there is a lot of banter back and forth, discussing various claims BaaS providers make, that I feel are irrelevant to the more important, pricing story.</p>
<p>The conversation continues:</p>
<blockquote><strong><strong>Joe Chernov (<a href="https://twitter.com/jchernov">@jchernov</a>)&nbsp;of Kinvey</strong>:</strong><br /> If a developer prefers to pay by number of users, our model may work for them; if someone would rather buy features, then StackMob may make more sense. It's all good. Everyone has their own twist on pricing. Vendors should strive to highlight their own value without misrepresenting others'. Fair?  Steve Gershnik (StackMob):<br /> We don't charge per user. We don't charge per API call. We think those are outdated and archaic pricing models.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Miko Matsumura (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a>) of Kii:</strong><br /> I respect what @StackMob is doing but in looking at their pricing page, isn't it just segmenting everyone into a free tier and a "custom" Enterprise tier?</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>)&nbsp;of 3Scale:</strong><br /> Which model is best in our experience depends a lot on what type of market you're serving - individual developers tend to like by the drop because (start cheaply and scale). Large companies tend to like predictability so they can budget properly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Box.net is a storage company - yet, for all their enterprise accounts storage is unlimited. Variable scared their customers. Instead they charge by number of seats/users - something their enterprise customers CAN predict.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Thinking more abstractly: If a developer is successful, there will be some sort of increase in volume. Unless the PAAS service is truly magical that means extra cost for the PAAS provider.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can call this a success tax, but in my view what matters is not if there is more cost to the developer but if the unit cost goes down over time. I.e. As I succeed, I'm happy to pay you a bit more as long as you are not getting an increasing %age of the pie (and ideally if the %age is decreasing). If that %age increases I'll most likely ditch you for someone who offers me better terms at that point.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>QuickBlox(<a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBlox">@QuickBlox</a>): </strong><br /> Our pricing model is per API calls as well, we do it like that because it is clear for developers (and for our business model), also allows to create apps and prototypes that, in case they are not successful, the developers won't be charged. according to @jchernov</blockquote>
<p>Only Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii and Quickblox are represented in the <a href="http://branch.com/b/apicalls-successtax">conversation on Branch</a>.  So I wanted to see how each of the 20 BaaS providers I&rsquo;m tracking on, structure their pricing:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.apiomat.com/" target="_blank">APIOMAT</a> - Beta, can't find</li>
<li><a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/plans-pricing/" target="_blank">Appcelerator</a> - Events, Notifications, API Calls, Storage, Emails, Support</li>

<li><a href="http://www.flurry.com/flurry-appCloud.html" target="_blank">Flurry</a> - Beta, can't find</li>
<li><a href="https://geoloqi.com/pricing" target="_blank">Geoloqi</a> - API Calls</li>
<li><a href="http://iknode.io/pricing/" target="_blank">iKnode</a> - API Calls, Data Storage</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kii.com/en/technology/Price" target="_blank">Kii</a> - API Calls, Data Storage, Push Notifications</li>

<li><a href="https://parse.com/plans" target="_blank">Parse</a> - API Calls, Push Notifications, Data Storage</li>
<li><a href="http://www.proxomo.com/Pricing" target="_blank">Proxomo</a> - API Calls</li>
<li><a href="http://quickblox.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Quickblox</a> - API Calls</li>
<li><a href="http://scottyapp.com/pricing" target="_blank">ScottyApp</a> - Apps, Users, Database Size, Emails</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/io/" target="_blank">Sencha.io</a> - Can't Find, Beta</li>

<li><a href="https://go.urbanairship.com/accounts/register/" target="_blank">Urban Airship</a> - Push Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find pricing for five of the BaaS providers, because they are in beta, but pricing by API call is definitely the preferred way for the rest of them, with 11 of the 15 using this approach.  The rest of them charge based upon a mix of number of users, number of apps, data and file storage, push messages, and email messages.  With Stackmob going with pricing based upon feature, add-on or premium services, which can also be from 3rd party services via the <a href="https://marketplace.stackmob.com/">StackMob marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t think there is one approach to API or BaaS pricing.  Seems to me, that different models will work for different industries, companies and even at the application level.  But I wanted to document this conversation for my <a href="/trends/baas.php">larger research project around the BaaS space</a>--maybe I will have more opinions after I dive in deeper.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think about BaaS pricing.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/05/white-house-announces-round-two-of-the-presidential-innovation-fellows/">White House Announces Round Two of the Presidential Innovation Fellows </a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/presidential-innovation-fellows.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program, launched last year, bringing in talented individuals from the private sector, to Washington DC for 6-12 month &ldquo;tours of duty&rdquo; in the Federal Government, to develop innovative solutions to our governments most difficult problems.</p>
<p>Today the United States CTO Todd Park and CIO Steve VanRoekel&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/05/throw-your-hat-ring-round-2-presidential-innovation-fellows-program">announced round two of the Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program</a>.  The first round of PIF projects included MyUSA (formerly known as MyGov), RFP-EZ, Blue Button, Better Than Cash, and Open Data Initiatives started in August 2012 with 18 inaugural Fellows.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure to be <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/10/13/heading-to-washington-dc-to-talk-apis-with-innovation-fellows/">invited in October to spend half a day talking to a group of the fellows</a>, and help make sure they had an awareness of the API space, empowering the group to make the biggest impact possible.  Last week when I was in DC, I also got to speak with a couple of the fellows as they were finishing up their tour of duty, and beginning to think about what is next.</p>
<p>The second round of the Presidential Innovation Fellows will tackle the following initiatives:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Disaster Response &amp; Recovery</strong> - Collaboratively building and &ldquo;pre-positioning" needed tech tools ahead of future emergencies or natural disasters in order to mitigate economic damage and save lives</li>
<li><strong>MyUSA</strong> - Simplifying the process of finding and accessing information and government services that are right for you. Helping American businesses access the information and services that will help them grow, hire American workers, and export to foreign markets</li>
<li><strong>RFP-EZ and Innovative Contracting Tools </strong>- Making it easier for the government to do business with small, high-growth tech companies, and enabling the government to buy better, lower-cost tech solutions from the full range of American businesses</li>
<li><strong>Cyber-Physical Systems -</strong> Working with government and industry to create standards for a new generation of interoperable, dynamic, and efficient &ldquo;smart systems&rdquo; &ndash; an &ldquo;industrial Internet&rdquo; &ndash; that combines distributed sensing, control, and data analytics to help grow new high-value American jobs and the economy</li>
<li>MyData Initiatives - Empowering the American people with secure access to their own personal health, energy, and education data</li>
<li><strong>Innovation Toolkit </strong>- Developing an innovation toolkit that empowers our Federal workforce to respond to national priorities more quickly and more efficiently</li>
<li><strong>21st Century Financial Systems </strong>- Moving financial accounting systems of Federal agencies out of the era of unwieldy agency-specific implementations to one that favors more nimble, modular, scalable, and cost-effective approaches</li>
<li><strong>Development Innovation Ventures</strong> - Enabling the US government to identify, test, and scale breakthrough solutions to the world&rsquo;s toughest problems</li>
</ul>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows will also continue work on the <em><strong>Open Data Initiatives</strong></em>, which will accelerate and expand efforts to make government information resources more publicly accessible in &ldquo;computer-readable&rdquo; form and spurring the use of those data by entrepreneurs as fuel for the creation of new products, services, and jobs.  The Open Data Initiatives will continue work on existing projects including health, energy, education, finance and public safety and global development, while also tackling new data innovation efforts including Building Virtual Learning at National Scale, Digital Tools for the Smithsonian and  work on next iteration of Data.gov.</p>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows programs represents an agile new approach to government, mimicking the same partnership it took to build the Internet over the last 30 years, through a partnership between government and the private sector.  This approach is about tackling big problems, using open software and open data approaches to a government that is not just open, but machine readable by default.</p>
<p>Its great to see the White House not miss a beat, with kicking off the second round of PIF.  Iniatives within the program are addressing some of the most important areas of our society and economy like education and healthcare, while also paying attention to innovative areas like physical hardware systems, new approaches to financial systems and applying technology intelligently through disaster response and recovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to evaluate more of what was accomplished in round one, and closely track who is accepted into the program for round two.  I think the program has the potential to help fix some serious illnesses with open, transparency and lack of machine readable data from government agencies.  My only addition to the program would be another tier of volunteers called Presidential Innovation Corps, where talented individuals who did not make it as fellows could still be put to use for other smaller initiatives and crowdsourcing opportunities--this group represents a lot of excitement, passion and talent, and with the pool growing in round two it represents a large group of eager citizens not being put to use.</p>
<p>If you believe in APIs, and believe they can transform how our government operates, I encourage you to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/InnovationFellows">apply for the Presidential Innovation Fellows program</a>, and potentially participate in some serious change for our country.</p>

<p>There is an interesting <a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/02/01/instadm-brings-private-messaging-to-instagram/" target="_blank">post on the Parse blog</a> about <a href="http://insta.dm/" target="_blank">instaDM</a>, which is a service built using Parse, the <a href="/trends/baas.php" target="_blank">BaaS platform</a>, that provides private messaging in the Instagram ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting approach to externally developing features for another platform or service.  I think Parse says it well:</p>
<blockquote><em>Even the hottest new apps, however, aren&rsquo;t perfect and that&rsquo;s where clever innovators can fill in the gaps with a great idea. Parse-powered instaDM is one such innovation.</em></blockquote>
<p>On one hand, this approach is a gamble.  All Instagram has to do is copy what you've done, put it in the roadmap, and your done. &nbsp;Finished.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think this is a very realistic way of pushing a platform forward, by external developers, using APIs.  If an API provider is smart, when you have someone in your ecosystem roll out a valuable feature like this, you invest in their success.</p>
<p>Building features that augment web or mobile apps like this demonstrate that API ecosystems offer a lot potential for innovation, and I have to say it is even more interesting that this is being built on Parse--probably a whole other story in itself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think every idea that comes out of Silicon Valley should be VC size. APIs allow more lots of smaller, more sustainable features to emerge, that don't need large scale investment. instaDM is an example of this potential.</p>

<p>Salesforce talked a little bit about its <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/02/new-eclipse-plugin-available-february-15th.html">strategy around the development and release strategy around the Salesforce Eclipse plug-in</a>. &nbsp;Providing a little transparency into how they stagger its API releases as well as waiting to release their <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> plug-in, until API release is complete.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more interested in this story from an <a href="/buildingblocks/">API building block</a> perspective.  An eclipse plug-in seems like a building block for only the most mature APIs out there, and especially ones targeting the enterprise.  An eclipse plug-in is not for every API, but I think I will add it as a building block to consider.</p>
<p>It also seems like something a 3rd party provider could step up and find success with as well, by building a single or suite of Eclipse plug-ins that provide integrated API developer tools across popular or high value web APIs for Eclipse users.</p>
<p>I believe IDE plug-ins for APIs will be one way we can provide API discovery solutions for developers, by bringing valuable, qualified API resources into their development environments.</p>

<p><a href="http://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/01/new-simplified-adwords-api-pricing.html" target="_blank">Google is adjusting their pricing model for the Adwords API</a>, acknowledging that having a free usage tier is important. &nbsp;Making the API easier to access, while also ensuring a certain QOS.</p>
<p>Google has opted to go with two levels of API access:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Basic</strong> - Basic access is provided by default and allows up to 10,000 operations per day</li>
<li><strong>Standard</strong> - Standard access is available to qualified developers and has no daily limit on operations</li>
</ul>
<p>With both basic or standard access, there are no charges for <a href="https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/" target="_blank">AdWords API</a> usage.  Google is just looking to maintain quality over which developers can hammer on the API, while acknowledging a free tier allows for experimentation and innovation. &nbsp;All you have to do is apply to be part of the standard level, if you reach limits of basic tier.</p>
<p>This is a good model for even a totally open data of free resource APIs.  While you want your data and resources to be open, you also want to be able to offer a certain quality of service, and keep infrastructure costs to a minimum.</p>
<p>To do this, you will need to to secure the API interface to some degree.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/platform-stability.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>I did a <a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">presentation at the DC API Meetup</a>, when I was in Washington DC last week. My talk was some of my usual material around the history, business and politics of APIs, but included a section on trends, where I covered some of the newer aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, BaaS providers like <a href="http://parse.com">Parse</a> and automation tools like <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the meetup, we did a QA panel session, and Javaun Moradi (<a href="https://twitter.com/javaun">@javau</a>n), product manager at NPR digital, made a great point about the reliability and stability of this new generation of third party platforms building aggregate, backend, automation or other types of providers who are in turn, dependent on other API providers.</p>
<p>Javaun questioned the reliability of this new generation of startups, who are newly funded, most likely not yet profitable, dependent on other APIs, and are most likely going to be acquired later on down the road, or go out of business when funding runs out.  Javaun felt that established players like Salesforce and Google are here to stay, you know they aren&rsquo;t going anywhere--where a new startup has greater potential for service disruption and instability.</p>
<p>If you are building your app, and depending on an aggregate API service like Singly, or backend as a service (BaaS) platform like <a href="http://cloudmine.me">Cloudmine</a> or reliant on a automation platform like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, you want to know the company is going to be around in a year.  Right?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the number one way these new breed of startups can alleviate these concerns, is by solving developer problems, delivering value (which every company I&rsquo;ve mentioned is doing) and have a clear business model. Success is the best solution, right?</p>
<p>Another way these startups can instill confidence in the developers who are building apps around around their services is to also offer open source options.  By offering API aggregation, backend and automation as a cloud service, while also as open source download and fork, this new breed of providers can do a lot to build confidence and goodwill with potential users.</p>
<p>Some good examples of this are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a></strong> - Singly AppFabric empowers you to add social login, sharing and friend finding into your mobile and web applications, and <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">Singly Hallway</a> is the open source version to help developers build amazing applications combining data from many sources easily, through one API.</li>
<li><strong><a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">OpenKit</a></strong> - Open source, cross-platform backend services for game developers.  It will be available as client and server download on Github, and no mention if it will be a cloud service</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://rules.io/">Rules.io</a></strong> - Rules.io is a rules and segmentation engine with companion <a href="https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki">Geekier</a> which is part of the rules.io service as an open source framework</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just just a couple examples of how startups are emerging to provide a new approach to rapidly and efficiently building web and mobile apps across many APIs.  These platforms are all about delivering the resources developers need to efficiently build and manage web and mobile apps, without the overhead of rolling out the infrastructure on their own.  With an open option, if for any reason the startup should change or go away, app developers have the option to put the open codebase to use.</p>
<p>This approach will not be for all startups, but with the neck breaking pace in which startups are born, evolve and die, and open by default approached bundled with a healthy as a service option, looks like a positive approach for platform providers, developers, end users and the overall business sector.</p>
<p>As more providers emerge in this space, I hope they choose to adopt an open by default approach.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>For the longest time I would get asked, "Which API service provider should I use to deploy my APIs?".  This was a tough question, because historically the API management providers don't help you deploy your APIs, they only help you manage them.</p>
<p>Deploying your APIs was up to you.  Generally you already had some sort of internal system that you would use to generate RESTful interfaces or you'd go find your own open source API framework and deploy.  Then you'd proxy or connect your API to one of the API service providers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>These lines are now blurred by providers like <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/">Intel with their enterprise API gateway</a>, and through API deployment resources from <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>.  3Scale is investing in open source server technology for <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGINX</a>, and blueprints for API deployment using Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>3Scale recently published a quickstart tutorial on <a title="how to deploy an API on Amazon EC2 for Amazon Web Services" href="http://www.3scale.net/2013/02/quickstart-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-an-api-on-amazon-ec2-for-amazon-web-services-aws-rookies/">how to deploy an API on Amazon EC2 for Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS), and manage it using 3Scale API management.  My favorite part is that everything in this tutorial is completely FREE.  A critical element to experimenting with APIs.</p>
<p>The 3Scale, AWS walk-though provides details for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Creating and configuring EC2 Instance</li>
<li>Preparing Instance for Deployment</li>
<li>Deploying a demo API solution</li>
<li>Enabling API Management with 3Scale</li>
<li>Implementing an Nginx Proxy for Access Control</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several important things going on here, beyond being able to do this for free with an entry level AWS and 3Scale accounts.  But I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, the value of this being free and allowing you to explore, experiment and iterate with your API--without spending a fortune!  This is critical to not just your API initiative, but contributes to a more healthy API space in general.</p>
<p>After being free, you are using proven open source technology like Ubuntu for server OS and NGINX for your web server.  <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/15/3scale-launches-open-source-api-proxy-build-on-ngnix/">3Scale has invested in tools for NGINX</a>, rather than building their own proprietary solutions, because NGINX has been proven to deliver at scale and has large community to support it.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/nginx/nginx-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Third, with this solution, you retain control over your infrastructure.  You are deploying on the proven Amazon cloud (which I hope you are already using in other areas), and you are connecting to free API management services with the opportunity to buy premium services.  You are not proxying all your data and valuable API resources through a 3rd party proxy.  You are connecting to the API management services you need like rate limits, access controls and analytics without giving up control over your data and resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do the <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2013/02/quickstart-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-an-api-on-amazon-ec2-for-amazon-web-services-aws-rookies/">3Scale API deployment tutorial</a>&nbsp;myself, so that I know the process inside and out, have my own AMIs ready to deploy on AWS, and be able to walk others through, when possible.</p>

I Think It Was The Sound Of A Walrus</a>, on NPR this morning.  It is about the <a href="http://macaulaylibrary.org/" target="_blank">Macaulay Library</a>, which is:</p>
<blockquote><em>...the world's largest and oldest scientific archive of biodiversity audio and video recordings. Our mission is to collect and preserve recordings of each species' behavior and natural history, to facilitate the ability of others to collect and preserve such recordings, and to actively promote the use of these recordings for diverse purposes spanning scientific research, education, conservation, and the arts.</em></blockquote>
<p>The library's collection has a total of more than 7,000 hours of sounds, the result of an 80-year collaboration between the scientific community and the library's volunteer collaborators.  An amazing resource!</p>
<p>I couldn't help myself, and emailed them, to let them know a web API of the audio and video collection would be a great addition.  If developers could build web and mobile apps around the sounds, it would extend the reach of the catalog exponentially.</p>
<p>Of course you'd do it in a way that adds value to the collection and <a title="protect it as a brand" href="/2013/01/29/protecting-your-brand-with-api-branding-guidelines/">protects it as a brand</a> and priceless asset.</p>
<p>The digitizing of the <a href="http://macaulaylibrary.org/" target="_blank">Macaulay Library</a>, making it available online is a great example of the potential of open content, data and APIs.  Our world is full of rich resources like this, we just need to digitize and make accessible in sensible ways that make them available to the widest audience possible.</p>

<p>When I talk about API discovery, in-person at events, or on my blog(s), I notice people automatically default to thinking I mean a universal API discovery language that will work for all web APIs.  I think the technologists that operate in the API space are always striving for technical perfection--resulting in the discussions that you see around REST, HATEOAS, OAuth and similarly for this one about API discovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the passion and dedication of the technologists in this space, but when it comes to API discovery, I&rsquo;m <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> talking about a universal language or approach.  I personally just don&rsquo;t believe there can be one definition to rule them all.  When I reference API discovery, I&rsquo;m focusing on API discovery at the provider level, and providing information and resources that allow people who launch APIs to be successful.  I have no interest in defining or support a world-wide or industry level definition for API discovery.  I leave these conversations to all y'all tech pundits.</p>
<p>I am a fan of supporting API providers to do something, anything! Sure, it should be a standardized as you feel necessary.  I hope you use something that is already in existence like <a title="WADL" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">WADL</a>, <a title="Swagger" href="http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">I/O Docs</a> (don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel), and make sure and look at the <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">approach Google is taking with their API discovery service</a>--as they have some experience in the field.</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In reality though, your motivation to develop JSON or XML definitions for your API will probably be to provide interactive documentation or allow for easy generation of code libraries for your API--not discovery.  With the API discovery conversation automatically defaulting to a universal definition by the tech pundits, API providers will often avoid these discussions, leaving it a lower priority when planning and implementing an API.  Much like with HATEOAS, without concrete examples of value, API providers won&rsquo;t see value in providing JSON or XML definitions of their APIs.  Interactive docs and auto generation of code libraries are clear value propositions, and show potential for bringing discovery back to the forefront.</p>
<p>Once you have API definitions for all of your API endpoints, its pretty easy to publish a single manifest of all of your APIs in a single JSON (or XML) file in the root of your developer area.  Sure I would love all of these definitions to be the same, but I prefer a more pragmatic approach and will accept whatever a API service provider deems suitable for their APIs, and with the resources they have available.</p>
<p>If you think about how web page discovery came together in late 1990s with Yahoo, then solutions provided by Google, and even new approaches from providers like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>.  When it comes to API search and discovery, we are in circa 1997, if we compare it with web page discovery.  You have directories like ProgrammableWeb, but you also have newer vendors emerging like <a href="http://apihub.com">APIhub</a>, who potentially bring a new perspective to the table.</p>
<p>Since APIs are about &ldquo;programmatic discovery&rdquo;, I think how developers discover API will vary, occuring via these directories and hubs, but also occur via their chosen PaaS platform like Drupal, Heroku, Salesforce or with BaaS providers like Parse or Kinvey--as well as popular IDEs like Eclipse who allow for plugins.</p>
<p><a href="http://apihub.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mulesoft/API-Hub-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It will up to PaaS, BaaS or other 3rd party platform providers to assemble resource stacks that are meaningful to their community.  They will do the legwork to find best of breed API resources, which will be made easier if API providers provider JSON or XML definitions of their API resources, but not a requirement.</p>
<p>I believe that similar to website sitemaps, API discovery will have wider definitions that some follow, with successful vendor specific implementations as well, but ultimately it will remain largely imperfect and some API providers will do well, and others will implement poorly. &nbsp;The markets will decide! (<em>cringe</em>)</p>
<p>My object is to help the average API provider hear stories of other successful approaches, and identify the benefits, in hopes that they will implement something, anything! &nbsp;Allowing us to take baby steps forward in API discovery, not defining one definition to rule them all and nobody giving a shit, and we don't move forward at all.</p>

<p>Master API architect at <a title="Layer7 Technologies" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7 Technologies</a> Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund" target="_blank">@mamund</a>) has a great post this week on <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/blogs/index.php/four-tech-related-trends-that-will-shape-2013/" target="_blank">Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013</a>.</p>
<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that <em>"individual service deployments on the Web will get smaller and more numerous"</em>--he clarifies it with:</p>
<blockquote><em>Influenced by the existence of the many mobile apps running on a single device, Web-based services will become small, single-focused offerings that (in the words of Doug Mcllroy) &ldquo;do one thing and do it well.&rdquo; This will also explode the number of available services. The advantage of this trend will be an increase in the agility and evolvability of service offerings. The challenge will be an increased need for governance at the &ldquo;micro-service&rdquo; level.</em></blockquote>
<p>I have to agree.  I think the smaller we can break resources down, the better.  Agility is key in the API economy.  But as Mike points out it won't come without its new set of problems, like life cycle, governance and discovery.</p>
<p>Much like web pages, I think we'll still try to estimate the number APIs available, but there will be so many, we will lose track in the near future.  But we'll find an organic approach to designing, deploying, managing, discovering and consuming web APIs that strikes a balance.</p>

<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that "server mash-ups will increase but client mash-ups will decline"--he clarifies it with:</p>
<blockquote><em>The increasing popularity of languages like Node.js, Erlang and Closure will make implementing server-side mash-ups more efficient and easier to maintain than doing the same work within a client application; especially for the mobile platform. This will reduce the &ldquo;chattiness&rdquo; of client-side applications and increase the security and flexibility of server-side implementations. The result will be a perceived increase in responsiveness and a reduced use of battery power on mobile apps.</em></blockquote>
<p>As with my earlier post, <a title="individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous" href="/2013/02/02/the-scientific-archive-of-biodiversity-audio-and-video-recordings-needs-an-api/">individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous</a>, I agree 100%.  This is where I&rsquo;m going with my post this week on <a title="Virtual API Stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>.  With so many individual resources available on the web, in the coming years we&rsquo;ll see increased &ldquo;mashing up&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo; of new stacks, that are meaningful to a particular app or group of developers.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild is&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, with their API aggregation or mashup, which is available as a service, but is also <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">available as open source on Github as Hallway</a>.  Another recent example is potentially the <a title="OpenKit Gaming BaaS" href="/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">OpenKit Gaming BaaS</a>, which promised to be an open stack designed for game developers.</p>
<p>My predication is we&rsquo;ll see many more returns from server side API mashups, than we did during the client side mashup gold rush days! &nbsp;Especially if providers open source these stacks, while also offering as a service.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/traffic-and-weather-virtualized-api-stacks/">Traffic and Weather - Virtualized API Stacks</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://trafficandweather.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/traffic-and-weather/Traffic-and-Weather.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently added the <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather podcast</a> to the right hand menu for everyone to enjoy. What John Sheehan (<a href="http://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a><span>&nbsp;)</span> and Steve Marx (<a href="http://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>) are doing on the podcast is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SO</strong></span> needed in the API space, I highly recommend subscribing to the podcast in your itunes and listening regularly.</p>
<p>I was honored to be critiqued in the podcast this week, where they &ldquo;gently&rdquo; disagreed with my post from earlier this week on my <a title="virtualized API stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">speculation around virtual API stacks</a>.  So I wanted to &ldquo;gently&rdquo; respond and help clarify.</p>
<p>The first 60 seconds, pretty much sum up rebuttal, where they make my argument for me by saying <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTT</a> and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> are already doing this? Which is the whole basis for my story except I use <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a href="http://temboo.com">Temboo</a> as examples.  All of these providers are in the same space in my opinion, I think maybe they are just referencing what they are familiar with (as John used to work at IFTTT).</p>
<p>Second they read in that I&rsquo;m envisioning some grand discovery language?  Not sure where this comes from.  I&rsquo;m just referencing that API providers can provide JSON definitions of their APIs, which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> happening with specs like Swagger, but not being done for discovery but for interactive documentation and code stub generation--the fact it is there is a plus for discovery.  But I have zero visions of there every being a grand &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for discovery, but I feel you can't argue Swagger is picking up momentum.</p>
<p>John and Steve also reference that I&rsquo;m calling for a &ldquo;standardized building blocks API providers can jump on?&rdquo;  Not sure where this comes from.  My arguement is that API will play almost no role in this process at all.  They won&rsquo;t give a shit or prepare in any way.  It will be 3rd party providers stepping up and building these abstracted platforms around existing API providers.  Something we are already seeing with Temboo, Singly and yes IFTTT and Zapier as well as BaaS providers like Kinvey, Parse, etc.</p>
<p>Then at the part they start talking about "API providers do not want to be commoditized", they lose me and deviate from anything I&rsquo;m talking about.  I agree that API providers don&rsquo;t want to be reduced to commodities.  This is just one possible path, and would not be for every API provider or reduce their existing retail relationship with developers.  We see it already happening with <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/07/25/sendgrid-partners-heroku-engine-yard-cloudbees/">SendGrid partners with Heroku, Engine Yard, &amp; others on email management</a>, and <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2012/twilio-partners-windows-azure/">Twilio partners with Azure</a>.</p>
<p>So SendGrid won't be commoditized on Heroku? &nbsp;Twilio won't be commoditzed on Azure?</p>
<p>Google your favorite API by name and add partners with, you will see API providers do care about partnering and reselling themselves, which brings you very close to the commodities line when you resell at that level. &nbsp;What I'm suggesting could just be interpreted as reverse partnering, where a 3rd party platform integrates the API, rather than API seeking partnership--which we see with Singly, IFTT and Zapier, they don't ask for permission from every API provider.</p>
<p>While I listened further, the rest of the conversation had nothing to do with my post.  I blame my storytelling, as I&rsquo;m always trying to perfect how i articulate my visions and obviously I didn&rsquo;t clearly get my point across.  Since it was my first exploratory post on this subject, I will keep trying, and trying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have to call them out a bit, cause I heard standard over and over in the podcast, about building blocks, API interfaces and API definitions.  But if you look at my post I never even used the word standard or standardizing or anything.  So I think you guys read something that wasn&rsquo;t there, cause I am the last API guy who believes in standardizing in the web API space.</p>
<p>With that said, I fuck&rsquo;n love that you guys are doing this!  Makes me happy! &nbsp;Thanks John and Steve!</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/world-bank/The-World-Bank-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of being on stage with <span>Tim Herzog (</span><a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/tgherzog" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>tgherzog</a><span>)</span>, a Open Data Specialist from the <a title="World Bank" href="http://worldbank.com">World Bank</a> yesterday at the <a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">DC API meetup  at NPR</a>.  During the QA panel, at the end of the meetup, a question came from the audience, stating that open data from government is often boring, and thus is the reason much of what we see built on government isn't that exciting--alluding that there has to be more high value, exciting data that isn't being released.</p>
<p>While I agree that much of the data made available from open government initiatives is boring and stale, and there are probably much better datasets available, I also think this is more of a storytelling problem, than a data problem.  After the question was asked, I quickly answered by pointing to my left at Tim Herzog, and said the World Bank does an awesome job at this.</p>
<p>If you look through the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank data catalog</a>, and spend time looking through their blog, you see a symbiotic relationship between their open data, APIs and the stories they tell on the blog.  This approach is similar to what I'm calling <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>, the only difference is I am hosting all my stories on Github as individual repositories.</p>
<p>If you look at the home page of the World Bank data site today, there is a link to the blog post, "<a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-data-tell-us-about-debt-of-high-income-and-developing-countries">What does data tell us about debt of high income and developing countries?</a>"  This is a great example of not just providing a dataset, but actually telling the story around the data, while providing tools that let you interact with the data, making everything a very hands on experience--increasing the chances users will make an emotional connection with the data.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-data-tell-us-about-debt-of-high-income-and-developing-countries" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/world-bank/World-Bank-Exernal-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>According to the blog post, the World Bank maintains two quarterly databases of information on external and public sector debt of many countries. The blog post narrates what the statistical data from the <a href="http://worldbank.org/qeds">Quarterly External Debt Statistics</a> (QEDS) and the <a href="http://worldbank.org/qpsd">Public Sector Debt Statistics</a> (PSD) databases tell us about trends in debt levels of some high income and developing countries, while also providing us with links to the data sets and JavaScript charts (using <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com">Tableau Software</a>) we can play with, making the story an interactive, hands-on experience.</p>
<p>This is <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>.  It isn't just data.  It isn't just an API.  There is a story, giving the data context and meaning.  There are tools to help me play with the data, understand its value, with a link to the raw data for when I'm ready to get down to business.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that Hacker Storytelling is the solution to the boring data coming out of government, non-profit organizations and even in the private sector.  Hacker Storytelling is related to data journalism, but goes further, empowering anyone to publish a dataset and tell the story around it.  Not just journalists or programmers.</p>
<p>We need more open source tools that allow anyone to gather, curate and publish data, while also being able to wrap it in a story and bundle with interactive visualizations and tools that encourage exploration, remixing and sharing of these important stories that have the potential to solve real problems we face every day around the globe.</p>

<p><a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">A new player in the </a><a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space has emerged, from former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFeint">OpenFeint</a> co-founder Peter Relan--called <a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">OpenKit</a>. &nbsp;The new BaaS platform is targeting game developers, providing cross-platform tools for both iOS and Android. &nbsp;The core features of the gaming BaaS platform are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Cloud data sync</strong> - Save game progress in the cloud with data storage. Sync it across both iOS and Android devices for a consistent gaming experience</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards</strong> - Drop-in leaderboard SDK's for both iOS and Android. Give your users the opportunity to compete against millions of other players</li>
<li><strong>Facebook &amp; Twitter auth </strong>- Users login with familiar third party social networks like Facebook and Twitter. No need to create and manage accounts. OpenKit handles it all</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform support </strong>- OpenKit supports both iOS and Android. Our native SDKs are lightweight and will take just a few minutes to integrate into your game</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenKit represents a trend I&rsquo;m tracking on where people are pulling together specialized or <a title="virtualized stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtualized stacks</a> targeting specific groups of developers.  Early movers in the space like Kinvey, Parse and Cloudmine have generally catered to all types of developers by providing them a backend stack, that assists them in rapidly building mobile and web apps. So naturally the next step is to see more specialized stacks, for smaller groups of developers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to see that OpenKit is completely <a href="https://github.com/openkit">open source, readily available on Github</a>, as well as comes out of the box with a REST API.  <a title="open source baas" href="/2012/08/28/open-source-mobile-backend-as-a-service/">Open source BaaS is something I was identifying was missing from the space</a>.</p>
<p>I will add OpenKit to my <a title="baas trends" href="/trends/baas.php">trends section for Backend as a Service</a>, where I&rsquo;m tracking on the BaaS space, and will dive in deeper and compare it with some of the other offerings we are seeing emerge.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">A Conversation About APIs in Washington DC</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/dcapi-january/dcapi-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I came to Washington DC this week for meetings with a couple federal agencies and a handful of private companies who contract with our government--including a conversation last night at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/events/97891662/">DC API Meetup Group</a>, which met at NPR offices downtown.</p>
<p>The API Meetup started with pizza, a healthy selection of beer and networking with around 50 API professionals and API curious from around the DC area.  I was able to meet about 15 folks I know online, but have never had the opportunity to connect with in real life.</p>
<p>Ben Balter (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/BenBalter" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>BenBalter</a>), one of the Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) kicked off the conversation with a presentation of some of the cool API discovery, CSV to API, DB to API and various tool he's developed during his time as a innovation fellow.  I totally dig Ben's style, in making very small, but powerful open source tools that can make a real difference in how government opens up data via APIs.</p>
<p>I was up next, giving a talk titled, "<a href="/talks/apidays/business-models/">From Web, to Programmable Web, to Programmable World</a>".  I wanted to give everyone a healthy dose on the history of APIs, some views on where we are currently, and where API are going with an introduction to concepts like aggregation and automation.  The talk is meant to be a 200K foot walkthrough of the API space, which also reflects all of the sections available on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">APIEvangelist.com</a>.</p>
<p>Next up was Gray Brooks from the General Services Administration (GSA) who walked through some of the open data and API initiatives coming out of the federal government.  He is overseeing some very important aspects of the <a title="White House Digital Strategy" href="/federal_government.php">White House Digital Strategy</a>, and is the point person for the execution of the digital strategy across all federal agencies.</p>
<p>After Gray talked, Tim Herzog (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/tgherzog" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>tgherzog</a>) the Open Data Specialist at the World Bank walked us through what the <a title="World Bank" href="http://www.worldbank.com">World Bank</a> is doing with their open data initiatives, which APIs are at the core.  He discussed how they couldn't have delivered their open data platform in the time and budget, without making it driven by APIs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/dcapi-january/dcapi-7.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>Last up was Javaun Moradi (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/javaun" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>javaun</a>)&nbsp;of NPR, who walked us through some of the lessons learned from deploying and managing the NPR APIs.  His talk was full of nuggets of wisdom, including "Don't build an API unless it solves a user problem" and "We drink our own champagne, because we don't make dog food!".  I'm hoping to spend more time this spring, doing a deeper dive into the NPR approach and share those insights in blog posts and ultimately a white paper.</p>
<p>We wrapped up with the presentations, grabbed another beer, ate some more pizza and networked a bit--then came back for a QA panel with everyone who presented, moderated by Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>) of O'Reilly Media.  Alex did an awesome job at making the panel a conversation with everyone in attendance, encouraging open questions from the audience on APIs.  Alex is extremely knowledgable on not just open data and APIs, but how Washington DC operates, there is no better person to moderate a panel in DC.</p>
<p>The DC API Meetup Group is something I will be coming back regularly to attend and hopefully have the opportunity to present again.  They are looking for speakers and sponsors for future events, so if you have anything you'd like to share or make sure your company supports these valuable API conversations, you can contact Patrick Svenburg (<a href="https://twitter.com/svenburg">@svenburg</a>), Head of Business Development &amp; Partnering at <a title="APIphany" href="http://apiphany.com">Apiphany</a> and organizer of the DC API Meetup Group.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/01/29/protecting-your-brand-with-api-branding-guidelines/">Protecting Your Brand With API Branding Guidelines</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.active.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Active-Network/power-by--drk.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the top five concerns I hear from companies considering APIs is regarding losing control of their brand.  With APIs being about access to raw data and resources, companies immediately think that developers will extract the value, without any attribution or reference to the companies brand.</p>
<p>Even with this being a major concern, I see many APIs implement very poor branding guidelines, giving developers zero direction regarding how to properly provide attribution. &nbsp;This is a missed opportunity to not just protect the API providers brand, but actually extend it and increase its value.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I'm always on the lookout for good examples of API branding guidelines. &nbsp;One recent example I came across while monitoring my <a title="API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>, is from the <a title="Active Network" href="http://developer.active.com/">Active Network</a> which provides activity and outdoor content via their APIs.</p>
<p>Active Network starts with a great explanation of why they provide <a title="branding guidelines" href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines">branding guidelines</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>At ACTIVE Network, we want you to be able to create fantastic applications with the ACTIVE Network APIs. At the same time, we don't want users to get confused about who is responsible for the data they are accessing, so we have some brand guidelines.</em></p>
<p>Next Active Network explains to developers why branding guidelines are important to their own users:</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Active-Network/Active-Branding-Guidelines.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The ACTIVE brand holds credibility in the mind of the customer.  It serves as a seal of approval giving customers the confidence to transact through a trusted source</li>
<li>As a consumer utility, ACTIVE.com&reg; captures and records registration activity providing people with a record of their personal registration history if they need it at a future date</li>
<li>Transacting for an ACTIVE powered activity, tells your customer who they need to call if they need help.  ACTIVE&rsquo;s standard of excellence provides customers with 24/7 support 365 days a year</li>
</ul>
<p>Active Network also provides details on how to properly use their companies name (which I followed in my story), what attribution is required, and a complete branding kit for download as a zip file--containing the following key assets:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Branding Guidelines in PDF Format</li>
<li>Icon Image</li>
<li>Powered by Logos</li>
<li>Register Now Buttons</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a title="Active Network Branding Guidelines" href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines">Active Network Branding Guidelines</a> is one of the better implementations I've come across.  It provides a nice overview, with all of the details and assets needed to execute properly.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't concerned about your brand when it comes to your API, requiring some attribution from your developers will at least help you market and advertise your API, and potentially bring in new API consumers.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/01/28/announcing-the-app-net-file-api/" target="_blank">App.net has just released a File API</a> to add to their messaging and communication stack, allowing any App.net account to natively store files via the social platform.</p>
<p>Each App.net account will be given a 10GB file storage area, allowing applications to read and write files, that can be linked and embedded within App.net communications.</p>
<p>This approach reminds me of what I&rsquo;m seeing within the <a title="backend as a service" href="/trends/baas.php">backend as a service (BaaS)</a> space with other common developer resources like user management, object storage and key-value stores.</p>
<p>App.net is just making sure developers have the resources they will need to be successful building web and mobile apps with the App.net API--a similar motivation for BaaS providers as wel as other API providers.</p>
<p>While many developers are fine with using multiple API providers to get what they need, I can see an opportunity to provide the essential resources developers will need within the primary API that they are building their app around.</p>
<p>As essential API resources are further commoditized, it seems like an opportunity for private label BaaS resources to emerge.  File storage could become something that any API provider could offer alongside their own resources, without having to reinvent the wheel each time.</p>
<p>Maybe such services already exist under other names, and I'm unaware of it, but it seems like a great opportunity for cloud providers to step up and offer private label, backend resources for API providers to integrate into their platforms.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">Virtualized API Stacks</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Virtualized-API-Stacks.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Up until now we tend to think of APIs individually--we approach integration in terms of the Twilio API, Twitter API or the Facebook API.  But as the number of <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">public APIs has grown beyond 8K</a>, and an <a title="unknown amount of internal and partner APIs" href="/2013/01/24/estimating-the-number-of-non-public-apis/">unknown amount of internal and partner APIs</a> become available, we are seeing new patterns of <a title="aggregation" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregation</a> and <a title="interoperability" href="/trends/interoperability.php">interoperability</a> emerge from companies like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, but also seeing <a title="automation" href="/trends/automation.php">automation</a> be added into the mix by companies like <a title="Temboo" href="http://temboo.com">Temboo</a>, and entire backend stacks from providers like Parse.</p>
<p>These new aggregated or backend stacks of API driven resources can be as general as object and key-value stores, user management and other developer commodities we see <a title="backend as a service" href="/trends/baas.php">backend as a service providers</a> (BaaS) bring to the table, or they can be very personal like the photos Singly is aggregating across Flickr, Facebook and Instagram and with friends and followers across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>As I see these new aggregate and BaaS providers emerge, at an ever increasing pace, I can&rsquo;t help but think--this still isn&rsquo;t fast enough (its my nature, you should try being me).  If I want common mobile developer resources I can adopt one of these new BaaS platforms like <a href="http://kinvey.com">Kinvey</a> or <a title="Parse" href="http://parse.com">Parse</a>, or if I need personal and social resources, which have <a title="fabric of mobile and web apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/11/13/the-api-fabric-for-next-generation-of-apps/">become part of the fabric of web and mobile apps</a>, I can go to Singly.  But what if I want a more specialized network, say just for <a title="education" href="http://hackeducation.com">education</a>?  I might need user management, object storage, key-value storage, access to commons social tools like friends and photos across multiple social networks, but I also need access to open courseware, teacher and student directories all via a very secure, auditable, efficient stack tailored just for K-12?  I will have to wait, for the next wave of startups to emerge.</p>
<p>While in NYC on Friday I had a great discussion with Temboo about virtualization.  Not just the virtualization we&rsquo;ve come to depend on with cloud computing--which is the virtualization of compute, storage, and database resources, but the <a title="virtualization of network resources" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_virtualization">virtualization of network resources</a> and <a title="software defined networking" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking">software defined networking</a>.  Companies like <a href="http://nicira.com/">Nicira</a>, <a href="http://www.pluribusnetworks.com/">Pluribus Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.anutanetworks.com/">Anuta Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.aristanetworks.com/en/solutions/network-virtualization">Arista</a>, <a href="http://www.vyatta.com/solutions/virtual">and Vyatta</a> are emerging with new products that are allowing the virtualization of networking resource into new and meaningful network stacks for any possible implementation that you can imagine.</p>
<p>After these conversation with the Temboo team, over the weekend I continued to think about the potential of virtualized API stacks.  Why can&rsquo;t I assemble my own API stack?  Why do I have to go to each API individually, or wait for new Singlys' to emerge in other verticals?  Why can&rsquo;t I assemble Parse, Singly, Twilio, Schoology, SendGrid into a virtualized API stack that provides not just ease of use, but the security I need to deploy a backend tailored just for K-12 education?</p>
<p>In this vision of the future, API providers could focus on what they do best, and not worry about every use case out there.  Providers like Singly, Temboo, Parse can build abstracted layers on top of this. With this abstraction I wouldn&rsquo;t be limited to just the friends and followers features on Twitter or Facebook, I could take advantage of the next generation of friend discovery tools like what Singly is delivering--in addition to the value of individual API providers.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/interoperability-trends.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>With a virtualized approach, I could build the stack that is most meaningful for my internal, partner or public developers and if one piece of my stack is proving unreliable, I can replace it with another.  APIs resources would be further commoditized, required to provide JSON definitions of their interfaces (or die a quick death), which virtual API stack platforms could use to discover and offer API resources.  <a title="API Ranking" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API ranking</a> algorithms would emerge allowing anyone to make sure they were discovering, selecting and using the best of breed API resources in the areas that matter for any vertical.</p>
<p>With a virtualized API stack I could launch any specialized set of resources that I desired from the best of breed providers out there.  I could blend private and public resources together and in return offer them for use in private or public environments, further blurring the lines of what is an API and how they are consumed.</p>
<p>As we see APIs continue to become a driving force in government, healthcare and education and bridge the online and physical worlds via our <a title="automobiles" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/automobiles.php">automobiles</a>, homes, <a title="buildings" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/buildings.php">buildings</a> and further grow within healthcare via the <a title="quanitfied self" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/quantified-self.php">quantified self</a>, potentially <a title="disrupt manufacturing with 3D printing" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/3d-printing.php">disrupt manufacturing with 3D printing</a> and drive everything around us with the <a title="internet of things" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/internet-of-things.php">internet of things</a>--the manual assembling of individual or even aggregated API stacks won&rsquo;t be enough.  We will need the ability to virtualize APIs stacks for any purpose within hours, not months or years.</p>

<p>API ecosystems are all about research &amp; development, and an opportunity for incubating ideas and apps in a way that invites 3rd party developers and companies to develop innovative ways of using your company assets and resources.  I&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">incubation within an API ecosystem before,</a>&nbsp;and how companies are not just identifying developer talent and the best apps, but actually investing in companies via their API.</p>
<p>A new example of this in action is Nike's&nbsp;launch of their&nbsp;<a href="http://nikeaccelerator.com/index.html" target="_blank">Nike+ Accelerator</a>--a partnership with <a title="Techstars" href="http://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a> that will host 10 companies for a three-month, immersive, mentor-driven startup accelerator designed to spur development on the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.nike.com/">NikeFuel, the Nike+ FuelBand, and Nike+ Running API platform</a>.</p>
<p>The 10 partner companies will be given the following:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>$20,000</li>
<li>Access to the Nike+ APIs, Nike+ mobile SDKs, and Nike+ FuelBand Dev Kit (Beta) - you will be among the first in the world to receive this access</li>
<li>A Nike+ FuelBand for each team member</li>
<li>Tech support from experienced developers who've built companies, or built with Nike+ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</li>
<li>Code and solution reviews during the program</li>
<li>Mentor sessions with Nike executives and leaders in the start-up community</li>
<li>Two Investor Demo Days: one at the Nike World Headquarters and one in Silicon Valley</li>
<li>Real Access to Decision Makers</li>

<p>Then, at the end of the Nike+ Accelerator, each team will present to Nike executives, mentors, angel investors, venture capitalists, and tech industry leaders.</p>
<p>As an API publisher have you considered a built-in accelerator or incubation program within your API ecosystem?  And while I&rsquo;m at it, has your incubator or accelerator consider a partnership program tailored for API publishers?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/01/24/the-next-generation-of-api-discovery/">The Next Generation of API Discovery</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/Tag-Cloud-API-Discovery.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>For the last seven years, when you wanted to find an API you went to <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.  It has been the definitive way to discover new APIs, and responsible for all the buzz in the space that has gotten the industry to where it is.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb is at 8400 APIs in its directory</a>, and adding 50-100 each week, it will continue to get even more difficult to discover APIs.  Even for someone like me who has looked at thousands of APIs, it can be very difficult and time consuming to find the API or APIs you are looking for.</p>
<p>In 2013 there are even more ways to find APIs, new approaches that are looking to define the next generation of API discovery and consumption.  Currently I&rsquo;m tracking on 4 API directories in addition to ProgrammableWeb:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="APihub" href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a></strong> - APIhub is the best way to publish, discover and consume APIs. Search our database or browse through our most popular APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="APIs.io" href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a></strong> - APIS.io is an open source and free API registry service that allows developers to publish and discover REST APIs and interact with them online</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.exiconglobal.com/api-dir/">Exicon API Directory</a></strong> - Exicon helps marketers and enterprises find qualified developers through our online platform and advisory services</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mashape" href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a></strong> - Mashape provides a world-class marketplace to manage, distribute and consume both private and public APIs by developers from all over the world</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs.io and Exicon have the least amount of APIs available, but both Mashape and APIhub are currently leading, with Mashape possessing over 1500 and APIhub has over 13,000 APIs available.</p>
<p>In addition to providing the ability to search APIs and browse by category, these new generation of API directories are providing sophisticated tools like interactive documentation, code samples and ways to follow, share, like--providing social interactions for API developers with API publishers.</p>
<p>Beyond these new bells and whistles, what&rsquo;s next for API discovery?  To make developers lives easier they need programmatic ways to discover and understand APIs, as well as some sort of ranking to tell which are good and which are bad APIs.</p>
<p>To provide interactive documentation, these directories posses JSON definitions of each API interface, using formats such as <a title="Swagger" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">Swagger</a> from Wordnik, which opens up the door for more sophisticated discovery in a programmatic way, and potentially directly from within your IDE.</p>
<p>With the  data from the sharing, liking, following, page views and other signals generated via these API directories, there is a potential to develop some sort of ranking.  But we need more data signals from the space to truly develop a meaningful ranking.  I&rsquo;ve developed <a title="API Ranking" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">my own API ranking</a> to help me discover which APIs are trending based upon internal and external signals, allowing me to establish my <a href="http://apistack.com">API Stack</a>.  But its not enough either.  We need a lot more to be able to establish a meaningful way to rank APIs, that truly benefits developer efforts.</p>
<p>As we are switching from showcasing the quantity of APIs, to better understanding the value and quality of APIs, we are going to need a new breed of directories.  I&rsquo;m excited by what I&rsquo;m seeing from these new API directories, and hopeful for what is coming 2013.</p>

<p>Google is migrating samples and tools for App Engine, BigQuery, Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage to a new Github account, they are calling the <a title="Google Cloud Platform" href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/01/find-sample-code-and-more-for-google.html">Google Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/googlecloudplatform">Google is going all in with its use of Github</a>, something I'm encouraging API owners to do.  They are working to manage all of their essential API tools there like their start projects, which show developers how to get started with Google APIs as well as other helper tools like the OAuth 2.0 Helper, that helps developers be successful.</p>
<p>Github provides a lot of benefit beyond the obvious aspect of open sourcing your code.  Google is actively engaging with developers using Github alongside all of these open source projects.  If you think about it, this offers a more compelling way to engage with API developers beyond forums.  On forums you end up with a lot of general, sometimes senseless questions--Github anchors questions or issues and pull requests around actual code libraries, SDKs, starter kits and other integration areas.</p>
<p>Github provides potentially more meaningful actions to occur between you and your developer community, beyond making code more accessible and openly licensed.  It is good to see Google going this route.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/sdk-bridge/SDKBridge-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><em>This post comes from the&nbsp;<a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a>&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.</em></p>
<p>ProgrammableWeb is known for publishing the number of public APIs in its directory, and they regularly present an impressive&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r-l-utikkyk-hdhyyhjli-j/" target="_blank">graph</a>&nbsp;that shows how this number has increased exponentially over time. However, not all APIs are public, and ProgrammableWeb is not able to obtain information on how many non-public APIs exist.</p>
<p>SDK Bridge writes API documentation as a service, and many of our customers have us document their non-public APIs. That puts us in a unique position to be able to estimate what percentage of APIs is public compared to non-public.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>What exactly is a non-public API? For the purposes of this article, let's define a few terms.</p>
<p><strong>Public API.</strong>&nbsp;A public API is an API where the documentation is freely available on the Web. Using the API may require registering and paying a fee.</p>
<p><strong>Partner API.</strong>&nbsp;A partner API is an API where the documentation is not made available to the public, but is made available to select companies who have some kind of partnership agreement with the API provider. Typically the documentation is accessible through a password-protected website.</p>
<p><strong>Internal API.</strong>&nbsp;An internal API is an API that is only used by developers who work for the company that provides the API. Typically the documentation is available only on an internal website.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Since its inception in 2008, SDK Bridge has written documentation for 23 web APIs. (Web APIs are only a portion of the writing that we do for software professionals. We also write SDK documentation, IT documentation, and training curricula, as well as create video tutorials for developers.) Of these APIs, 12 were public, 9 were partner, and 2 were internal. The following pie chart shows the breakdown:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 200px;" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="bottom"><img src="https://i6.createsend1.com/ei/r/97/AC3/A0A/061035/nonpublicapipie.png" alt="" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Web API documentation by type.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For the non-public APIs (partner and internal), it's interesting to note that 82% were RESTful and 18% were SOAP APIs. Also, 91% supported XML formats and 18% supported JSON formats. This suggests that non-public APIs have mostly made the transition from SOAP to REST, but have largely not made a transition from XML to JSON.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Our data analysis indicates that roughly half of web APIs are not public. Two factors to consider:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The sample size is still fairly small. As time goes on and we get a larger sample size, we will improve the accuracy.</li>
<li>Companies may be less inclined to hire outside writers for non-public APIs than for public APIs. This means that our data could easily result in an underestimation of non-public APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for now, if you are looking for a rough estimation of the total number of APIs, you can take the number published by ProgrammableWeb and double it.</p>

<p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/transparency-report-what-it-takes-for.html">Google released an update to the Transparency Report today</a>, showing information regarding government requests for users' data on the Google Network.</p>
<p>Google's transparency report proves details on Government requests including who they come from, where the requests originate, types of requests and other critical information about how our government monitor us citizens and ultimately the entire world online.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/23/google-releases-new-government-surveillance-data-facebook-stays-mum/">stories on other blogs that state Facebook and other platforms should follow Google's lead with transparency reports</a> of their own.  I agree.  We will never see our government mandate industry leaders to do this, so us people have to lobby corporations to follow Google's lead.</p>
<p>I see this type of transparency being critical to any company claiming they have an "open platform" or "open APIs".  I will be adding transparency report to my list of <a title="legal building blocks for API owners" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">legal building blocks for all API owners</a>.</p>
<p>As more and more of our world, economy and daily lives moves online and are transmitted via APIs, investigations by our legal system and government are only going to grow.  We need to establish a way to report on these inquiries in real-time and in an open way like Google has been doing for two years now.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hacker-storytelling/Tag-Cloud-Hacker-Storytelling.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I love to write.  My girlfriend has really help me kindle this passion.  Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/">@audreywatters</a>.</p>
<p>After 2.5 years of telling stories on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a>, I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at organizing my ideas, and putting out stories that showcase the best (and worst) from the Business of APIs.  I&rsquo;ve gotten so efficient at it in 2012, I even launched <a href="http://apievoice.com/">API Voice</a> which is dedicated to the politics of APIs, <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a> which is dedicated to top APIs and <a href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hack Weekends</a> which is all about hackathons.</p>
<p>When I meet people in the real world, I often hear, &ldquo;You sure blog a lot, I see like 5 posts a day coming from you!&rdquo;  I do write a lot, but it comes in waves.  I tend to write a lot of stories all at once, pumping out 15-20 pieces and then I trickle them out across the appropriate domain over the next couple days.</p>
<p>In 2013, I&rsquo;m going to get even more efficient with my storytelling, with an evolved approach I&rsquo;m calling <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/">Hacker Storytelling</a>.</p>
<p>The process is based upon dwhat I already do, but uses a new blend of:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Pages</strong> - HTML, CSS and text that frames a site, project or research</li>
<li><strong>Blogs</strong> - Chronological blog posts that walk through a project or research</li>
<li><strong>Presentations</strong> - Deck.js presentations that walk through a project or research</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - JSON, XML or database stores that drive the essence of a story</li>
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Simple, data and representations derived from APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I use these formats to tell stories across my blog, but in 2012 I learned some new techniques with existing and new technology that &nbsp;I have discovered, and will be employing a series of technologies that help me better deliver stories:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Github Pages</strong></a> - A quick, easy and lightweight way to host websites on Github allowing anyone to build site with HTML, CSS and Javascript.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme" target="_blank"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> - Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website.</li>
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mustache Templates</strong></a> - A simple way to render structured data from JSON files, using basic HTML templates for displaying--instead of pulling directly from database.</li>
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Deck.js</strong></a> - A JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations. deck.js is flexible enough to let advanced CSS and JavaScript authors craft highly customized decks, but also provides templates and themes for the HTML novice to build a standard slideshow.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default all of my projects start as a Github repository with a base Github Pages + Jekyll implementation I&rsquo;ve setup for my API Evangelist brand.   This will force me to be open and transparent by default.  I know this reality isn&rsquo;t meant for everyone, but for me, I hate seeing many of my projects never leave the firewall and end up being deleted from an Amazon EC2 instance in the dungeon of my IT network.</p>
<p>All my projects will become <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> projects.  Some will have a single page, while others will have blogs, presentations and simple or complex data driven tools that help support the story.</p>
<p>Currently I have four projects who live in this new format and are hosted entirely on Github:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a></li>
<li><a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com">Hack Weekends</a></li>
<li><a title="Hack Weekends Guide" href="http://guide.hackweekends.com">Hack Weekends Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://digitalstrategy.apievangelist.com">Digital Strategy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to be open by default, when it comes to content and data and make sure I share all of my ideas, in the widest and most shareable and remixable way possible.  My objective during my time on earth is to tell stories and write code that will make change, no matter how small.</p>
<p>I believe that <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> will help me do this!  I hope it will help you too!</p>

Giving them access to upcoming Google Drive SDK features and the opportunity to provide feedback.</p>
<p>Google isn't accepting everyone--they will be screening applicants based upon the type and quality of the application, number of users, and ability to implement and provide feedback on new features as they're made available.</p>
<p>An early access program seems like a good idea for API owners.  It gives you the chance to test out your alpha and beta APIs, client libraries, SDK's with a controlled audience, before you release them out into the wild.</p>
<p>With the number of developers Google has, I don't think it will be a problem getting developers to sign up.  But it seems like something you could even pay developers for, if you have a shortage of good developers in your API ecosystem.</p>
<p>An early access program fits right into earlier stories I've done on <a title="possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/10/24/incentivize-your-api-developers-to-contribute-with-lower-pricing/index.php">possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems</a>.</p>

<p>WSO2's <a title="open source API management platform" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager">open source API management platform</a> for creating, managing, consuming and monitoring APIs, now has the ability to track API usage through Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Since APIs are deployed using HTTP, the same transport we are using for websites, it makes sense that we should be able to see statistics for both our websites and APIs, side-by-side using Google Analytics.</p>
<p>After creating a new profile for your API in Google Analytics you can put the tracking code into your WSO2 API Management interface and begin seeing real-time or standard (24 hour) reporting on API traffic in the Google Analytics interface.</p>
<p>Since Google Analytics has an API and widgets, you will be able to use this data easily in other reports or system integrations that may need access to your API usage data.</p>
<p>It is great to see innovation around API analytics and reporting, beyond the standard dashboards we've seen from most providers.

<p>It has been a while since I provided an update on the White House Digital Strategy. &nbsp;I <a href="/federal_government.php">monitor the progress of federal agencies participation programmatically</a>, using JSON reports published by each agency at the agencies domain, /digitalstrategy.</p>
<p>After running the script today, I notice 20 federal agencies with active footprints. &nbsp;There are about five more, but there are issues with the JSON version of their digital stratgies--I really want to focus on the programmatic value. So, across these 20 agencies I find 76 data API initiatives&nbsp;and 75 mobile API projects.</p>
<p>To bring you up to speed, there are two specific milestones in the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government Strategy</a> that specifically address API deployment:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>2.2 (Data) -</strong> Make high-value data and content in at least existing two major customer-facing systems available through web APIs, apply metadata tagging and publish a plan to transition additional high-value systems</li>
<li><strong>7.2 (Mobile) -</strong> Optimize at least two existing priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for improving additional existing services&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To help shed light on where these progressive agencies are going with both their data and mobile intiatives I wanted to break them out into separate groups, for each agency.</p>

<p>API play a critical role in BaaS platforms by providing interfaces for the common services emerging in the BaaS space, like object storage, user management and location, to name a few, but also bring in other 3rd party services like Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>I will be moderating this new BaaS panel at APIStrat. Let me know if there are any questions about the space, you&rsquo;d like me to ask.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-stack/API-Stack-Colored.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Finding APIs that compliment your API, and talking about the mutual benefits is nothing new.  When I worked with the <a href="http://mimeo.com">print API Mimeo</a>, I would write code that used Mimeo API in conjunction with <a title="Box API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=91">Box API</a> or <a href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=223">Dropbox API</a>.  Mashing up or bundling your APIs with other complimentary service can really help, when you are trying to explain the value your API delivers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to see patterns of even deeper integration and partnerships between APIs emerge--where one API provider will resell the API of another provider. &nbsp;APIs partnering with other APIs isn&rsquo;t that new, but reselling of each others API services to their developers is a fairly new concept, providing a potential new wholesale channel for API providers.</p>
<p>One recent example of this is in a recent <a title="partnership between Singly and Cloudmine" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/11/12/teaming-up-with-cloudmine-for-backend-superpowers/">partnership between Singly and Cloudmine</a>.  Cloudmine is a <a title="BaaS Provider" href="/trends/baas.php">BaaS provider</a>, and Singly is provider of personal and social data via <a title="aggregate APIs" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregate APIs</a>. With the reseller approach, Cloudmine developers get a vastly improved stack to develop against, with <a href="https://cloudmine.me/">Cloudmine</a> providing all the essential BaaS tools developers are growing accustomed to, while also having access to 30+ social, personal and other aggregate API services provide by <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this new approach is to provide developers with the most meaningful stack possible, in a single developer area.   A <a href="http://www.mogreet.com/">MMS API provider like Mogreet</a> could in theory, to better serve their developers, bundle image APIs like Flickr, Instagram and Facebook from Singly into their API area--providing a more robust stack to their developers who are building media enabled mobile apps.</p>
<p>Now developers don&rsquo;t have to traverse to each API area on their own.  APIs can mashup, bundle and develop a stack, which includes their own APIs, but might also have APIs from potentially several other API providers. &nbsp; Obviously there are lots of details to work out around authentication, pricing, etc., but the potential is obvious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also talking with a linguistics API provider in Europe, and learning more about their partner program, which would allow for 3rd party API providers to submit APIs and sell alongside their own linguistics API. &nbsp;Opening up their API stack for new opportunities and innovation from 3rd party linguistics API providers--in languages, formats they wouldn't have resources to do themselves.</p>
<p>As the number of APIs are growing, and we are seeing APIs aggregate via providers like Singly and through BaaS providers like Cloudmine, I think we&rsquo;ll see individual APIs become more portable, allowing them to be assembled into meaningful API stacks for developers. &nbsp;</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/markdown-icon.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just posted a story on <a title="how I like the Guardian&rsquo;s approach to data journalism" href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/17/the-guardian-is-brilliant-in-supporting-relevant-events-with-open-data/">how I like the Guardian&rsquo;s approach to data journalism</a>, and spending time evolving on last nights <a title="Markup APIs" href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">thoughts about the possibilities of Markup APIs</a>.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/02/all-side-projects-are-now-hosted-on-github/">migrating much of the front-end of my websites to run on a home brew of Github Pages, Jekyll and JSON fueled Mustache Templates</a>, I am seeing more of the potential of not just Markup APIs, but Markdown APIs that will run in a purely client side environment.</p>
<p>Imagine if I could go to a provider like the Guardian, US Census or other high value data provider, grab a link to a Markdown API JavaScript file that is relevant to a story or report you are working on. &nbsp;With this Markdown API I would be given a whole dictionary of markdown you could use.</p>
<p>An example would be, that when I wanted the 2010 population for New York City, I could just write [population|New York|NY|US|2010], or something like that and would print out the actual population for that year in NYC, with a link to the source.  Each time I used a markdown API it would add some sort of attribution to the source at the bottom of document.</p>
<p>Seems like we&rsquo;d establish trusted, centralized sources of information, allowing anyone (even non-developers) to put open data and APIs to use via easy to implement markup or markdown APIs.</p>
<p>Think of the potential if facts around the web actually had the backing of trusted sources, and were able to be embedded anywhere on the web, via apps or digital documents.</p>
<p>It would be fun to create a markup and markdown API for API Evangelist, with a dictionary of terms, facts and other data that were relevant to the API industry.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/emergent-one-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a>, one of the newest <a href="/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/" target="_blank">API management players</a> on the block, just announced a new free development tier.</p>
<p>The Emergent One platform provides simple, cloud-based tools for connecting to your MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and quickly generating an API from your database.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t sign up for their service when they first launched, because they didn&rsquo;t have a free tier, and I&rsquo;m unwilling to put in credit cards and commit to brand new services. This is something I have problem with from running development and IT teams who use a wide variety of cloud services.  I would spend a great deal of time each month chasing down charges and other issues from cloud services that were being experimented with.</p>
<p>The Emergent One approach to deploying APIs from common data sources, is one I think will resonate with users who aren&rsquo;t developers, but understand the importance of APIs, and are often restrained by unresponsive, limited or no IT resources.</p>
<p><a href="https://emergentapi.com/cp/register?type=internal" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/emergent-one/Emergent-One-Get-Started.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Emergent One one is responding to user requests for a cheaper tier that support entry level API users, which will allow them to tweak their API strategies before spending money.  This is something I think is mandatory for all API service providers, something <a href="http://3scale.net/">3Scale</a> were the first movers on, and we have seen <a href="http://apigee.com/about/pricing">Apigee</a> implement recently, as well as&nbsp;<a href="/serviceproviders/layer_7_technologies.php" target="_blank">Layer7</a> with their <a href="http://www.apify.co/" target="_blank">Apify</a>.</p>
<p>I notice that in the email announcement of the 100% free tier, it encourages me to build new APIs at no cost, <strong><em>&ldquo;until launch&rdquo;</em></strong>.  I hope Emergent One will agree that a entry level pricing tier is not critical for users to get to know Emergent One, but essential for educating the masses about the value of APIs--allowing them to experiment. So le'ts please make sure it isn&rsquo;t only until launch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m setting up some APIs, directly from one of my Amazon RDS instances. &nbsp; I'll let you know when ready.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of APIs that do one thing and do it well, like <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>.  I had lunch with the team from a similar API yesterday, called <a title="Mogreet" href="https://developer.mogreet.com/">Mogreet</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Mogree API" href="https://developer.mogreet.com/">The Mogreet API</a> lets you send and receive text or multimedia messages and use the platform to transcode, host and send video, audio and images for your web or mobile application.</p>
<p>When you think of the popularity of Instagram, the rebirth of Flickr and the ubiquitous value of photos and images online, it just makes sense that MMS is going to play a critical role in mobile app development in 2013.</p>
<p>I have a daughter, who sometimes responds to my SMS, email, chats and facebook messages.  Her attention span doesn&rsquo;t include always responding to her dad in "his" preferred formats. While she was visiting lately I sat on couch and watched her interact with friends and use her iPhone.   I noticed she communicated mostly in photos.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mogreet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mogreet/mogreet-api-mms.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>She communicates by taking photos and sending them, tweaking or distorting them and writing messages before sending, and spent a lot of time surfing and sharing silly photos from around the web--all in a social way via her smart phone.</p>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words.  I'm not good at math, but that seems 6x more valuable than a Tweet.</p>
<p>When you start thinking about which killer features will emerge in our mobile apps this year, I&rsquo;m sure the majority will depend on photos or videos, making MMS a pretty critical API resources to have in your developers toolbox.</p>
<p>After taking a look at Mogreet, I predict we will see them fueling the next crop of meaningful mobile apps, much like Twilio has done for the last two years.</p>

<p>Over the holidays I added a <a title="new section to API Evangelist called trends" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">new section to API Evangelist called "trends</a>".  One of the areas I&rsquo;m tracking on is what I&rsquo;m calling &ldquo;<a href="/trends/scripting-platforms.php">scripting platforms</a>&rdquo;.  While you can program against any API using the language of your choice, these platforms are aggregating APIs and make available through a custom language stack.</p>
<p>This approach is different than what I&rsquo;m seeing from <a title="aggregate APIs" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregate APIs</a> like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.  Scripting platforms may offer aggregate APIs, but are also providing a way to easily script against them, in new and abstracted ways.  I&rsquo;m <a href="/2012/12/19/taking-apis-to-next-level-with-api-scripting-platforms/">still trying to understand each company</a>, as well as the nuances between each approach--so stay tuned.</p>
<p>In the last couple weeks, I&rsquo;m seeing a possible new approach to programming against APIs come into focus, one that is using HTML instead of scripting--using Markup APIs.</p>
<p>After reading <a title="Building Bridges Between GUIs and Code With Markup APIs" href="http://www.toolness.com/wp/2013/01/building-bridges-between-guis-and-code-with-markup-apis/">Building Bridges Between GUIs and Code With Markup APIs</a> by Atul Varma (<a href="https://twitter.com/toolness">@toolness</a>) from Mozilla, you can really start seeing not just the potential around rich media and content like Mozilla is with its <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/">Webmaker platform</a>, but deliver any API resource in abstracted, simplified markup anyone can put to use--without knowing programming.</p>
<p>Lyre Calliope takes this further discussing how, &ldquo;Webmaker could be an opportunity to define an embeddable API strategy for the entire web&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;a Singly Markup API would lower the learning threshold for anyone interested in remixing all of their personal information together in new ways&rdquo;, in&nbsp;<a href="http://captaincalliope.net/2013/01/15/markup-apis-and-the-readwrite-web/">Markup APIs and the Read/Write Web</a>.</p>
<p>I envision Markup APIs, at their simplest working like <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> where you can easily render data from JSON templates, or be as robust as what Mozilla is doing with their Webmaker platform. &nbsp;Making the web embeddable and remixable like Lyre says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While scripting platforms are providing an important evolution in APIs for developers, by aggregating top APIs into new resources, the Markup API approach is an interesting evolution in APIs for everyone. &nbsp;And with <a href="https://singly.com/docs/data/authorization#Browser-based-Client-Apps">browser based authentication solutions like Singly's</a>, we can make this a very personalized experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working to understand all the possibilities, but I think both API scripting platforms and Markup APIs will bring us closer to a truly programmable web that is acceptable by everyone.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google/Google-Voter-Information-Widget.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I stumbled across the <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Google Civic Information API</a> today, which allows developers to build applications around civic information including polling place, early vote location, candidate data, and election official information.  As soon as I landed on the home page, I scanned the left hand navigation, and noticed the option for "<a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/embed">embeddable tool</a>".</p>
<p>As you know <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Embeddable">embeddable tools are are something I advocate all API owners</a> should consider when assembling the building blocks of your API.  I like Google's approach to the Google Voter Information Tool, which lets users look up their polling place, early vote sites, ballot, and election official information for the US 2012 General Election.</p>
<p>To support the embeddable tool, Google provides a quick overview, with instructions for "quick embed" and more granular options allowing anyone to configure region, address, local and other advanced settings.</p>
<p>Even though the 2012 election is over, I think Google's approach to providing embeddable tools with their APIs is potentially something that other API owners can follow, which will make your API accessible beyond just the developer community.</p>

<p>The mission of API Evangelist is centered around telling stories from the API space, shedding light on the innovative things developers and API providers are doing across all business sectors.</p>
<p>Over the holidays I rolled my <a title="History of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs series into its own section</a>.  It can be very difficult to understand who the players were in the API game, last year, let alone 10 years ago.  If there aren&rsquo;t stories about what happened in 2001, it can be very difficult to piece together the history.</p>
<p>In 2012 I also scaled up my API monitoring system to track the blogs and tweets of over 1000 APIs, providing a way for me to track activity across the space and establish my own <a title="API Ranking System" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API ranking system</a> resulting in what I cal&nbsp;<a title="The API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>.  This too is very dependent on API owners telling or sharing stories around their operations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking on over 1500 APIs and only 1000 have blogs and Twitter accounts.  With very few other signals to follow, such as stories in the blogosophere, social bookmarks on Hacker News and Reddit or QA on Quora or Stack Overflow--there isn&rsquo;t much to discover about these potentially valuable APIs.</p>
<p>At first, I felt there was a flaw in the way I track on APIs.  If an API offers value, but there are no stories for me to track on, it won&rsquo;t show up on my radar--leaving me feeling my approach could be flawed.</p>
<p>On the flip side, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/27/new-api-stories-in-2013/">going into 2013 I am eager to find &ldquo;new&rdquo; stories of APIs,</a> feeling like I&rsquo;m constantly telling stories of Amazon and Netflix--contrasting this with the lack of stories around 500 of my APIs, I felt there is an important link.  There is a reason I tell so many stories about Netflix isn't chance, it is because Netflix shares so much about its operations, providing fuel for my analysis and storytelling.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/daniel-jacobson-netflix.JPG" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>To shed light on this, I sat down with Daniel Jacobson (<a href="https://fr.twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), Director of Engineering for APIs at Netflix and asked him, <strong><em>&ldquo;Why does Netflix share so many stories about their operations?&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>It is very similar to why I tell stories on API Evangelist. &nbsp;Daniel asys it can be very positive to think about things, anticipating that you will share publicly, forcing you to see things in a different light.  That process can be very healthy, even without considering the after-effects of publicly sharing.</p>
<p>Ultimately Netflix shares its stories publicly to set itself as a thought leader, providing a marketing vehicle for the company when stories get picked up by TechCrunch or Mashable, but also sending signals to the world that Netflix is innovating and is a great place to work--additionally providing a valuable talent acquisition engine in a time when competition for talent is high.  <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/15/why-rest-keeps-me-up-at-night/">Look at posts from Daniel, on sites like ProgrammableWeb</a>.  What do you see in the last sentence...&rdquo;<a href="http://jobs.netflix.com/jobsListing.html?function=Engineering">we are hiring</a>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next I asked Daniel how, or if they measure and reported on the return on investment (ROI) from their public storytelling--number of hires, pageviews, syndication, etc.  He providing me with another link to talent acquisition--that ultimately they don&rsquo;t track on this, its based upon the response they get publicly and the feeling in their gut after each story is released into the wild.</p>
<p>Daniel related this approach to strorytelling with their internal <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664">culture of freedom and responsibility</a>.  When you work at Netflix, there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> a lot of management and control, the culture is centered around good judgement, communication, impact, curiosity, innovation, courage, passion, honesty and selflessness.  In my opinion all qualities that can lead to good storytelling.</p>
<p>The Netflix storytelling process isn&rsquo;t a PR stunt.  Its truly about a genuine desire to share the story of their operations, the successes and failures--demonstrating their expertise and thought leadership not just in the movie and TV industry, but across the technology sector.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-reed-hastings.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>API Evangelist is my learning and storytelling platform.  It is rooted in my learning in real-time, and my desire to share these thoughts, in hopes others can learn along with me.  I&rsquo;m not seeking pageviews, I just want to share my view of the space, showcase the good and bad across all sectors, helping lead, in hopes that I can contribute to making the space as healthy as possible.</p>
<p>As an API provider, your blog, social networks, QA and forum activity is not just a PR mouthpiece.  It is how you will tell the stories around your platform, how you will share the value you deliver--educating users, developers and the public at large that you exist, and that what you are doing matters.</p>
<p>Without stories, your platform won&rsquo;t matter now or in the future--no matter how amazing your technology is.</p>

<p>When I was in France speaking at <a href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a>, the art director at <a href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a>&nbsp;drew some <a href="/2012/12/10/api-evangelist-drawings/">very cool sketches of me</a>. &nbsp;He recently followed up with some more high resolution images I can use for t-shirts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Very cool! Thank you so much Benoit Talabot and <a href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a>! &nbsp;I'm working on ordering some t-shirts using the work, right now on Inkd.</p>

<p>I'm rebooting the marketing and PR for the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a> after the holidayz. After finding a new date for the event on February 21st and 22nd, we've gone through the session and speaker lineup and almost the entire line-up is coming back, with a couple of new entries including a new keynote from&nbsp;Jeff Lawson of Twilio.</p>
<p>We had a whole bunch of new requests for speaker additions over the holidays, and while we tried to squeeze in where we could, with such a killer lineup and the fact that everyone was committed to the new dates, we had to decline some pretty good talks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-home-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Over the next week we are going through and confirming with all registered attendees to verify they will be attending, but since the event was sold out before hurricane Sandy, I expect we will be announcing the event as sold out pretty soon.</p>
<p>The event is designed to be an intimate 2 days between 300 industry professionals in the API space. &nbsp;So I recommend if you are excited about APIs in 2013, make sure and head over to <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice site</a> and register before its 100% sold out.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><em>After looking back at 2012, I wanted a January 1, 2013 blog post for my blogs.  My first blog post of 2012 was my tour schedule for January, 2012.  While it was a pretty busy time for evangelizing and hackathons, I wanted something a little deeper.  I&rsquo;m not sure what, but I will play with the format year to year, until I find what I&rsquo;m looking for.</em></p>
<p><em>Every year I rewrite my bio, based upon where I am.  I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 2009.   This year I will write inaugural blog posts along with my bio rework, and post to each of my active blogs.  We&rsquo;ll see if it resonates again in 12 months and I do it again in 2014.</em></p>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-voice/Tag-Cloud-API-Voice.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I started API Voice because I believe the politics of APIs is one of the most important areas that will make or break the API space.  APIs are not just technical.  There are a wide range of political issues facing companies when it comes to APIs.</p>
<p>The politics of APIs can range from terms of service issues to potential government regulation.  We are seeing the politics of APIs play out in the Twitter ecosystem and in the U.S. legal system with Oracle vs. Google.</p>
<p>My understanding of the politics of APIs still evolving.  I started API Voice in May 2012 to help me understand it more.  I&rsquo;m still trying to quantify all the areas, but so far the politics of APIs can include terms of use, data portability, branding, privacy, business models, service level agreements (SLA), acquisitions, copyright, regulation, patent and the ubiquitous, magical term &ldquo;open&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When I started <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I wanted to provide a platform for research into the business of APIs.  Over two years I&rsquo;ve begun to solidify some perspective on the space, and form clear opinions around potential best practices.  With API Voice, I want to do the same for the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>At this point, all I can do is write about things as they unfold--as APIs are acquired and as they make the terms of service changes that impact developers.  API Voice is in its infancy, and I will be working to cover as many of what unfolds in 2013 as I can.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel that 2013 is going to be a big year when it comes to the politics of APIs.</p>

        <p><em>After looking back at 2012, I wanted a January 1, 2013 blog post for my blogs.  My first blog post of 2012 was my tour schedule for January, 2012.

<p>API Evangelist is my obsession.  I started the blog in summer of 2012, in an effort to reinvent myself and find a career path that didn&rsquo;t just make sense for me, but also was something that would be around in a couple, while also returning something to society.</p>
<p>I believe API Evangelist is on course to do just this.  While focusing on the business of APIs, I am able to satisfy my sometimes ADD personality with a diverse range of subject areas ranging from social to the internet of things.  And by telling stories of the best practices in APIs, I&rsquo;m able to help provide much needed information to people planning, deploying and managing APIs in critical sectors like government, education and healthcare.</p>
<p>In 2010 when I began, it was clear to me that the technology of APIs was here to say, but there was a lot to learn when it came to the business of APIs, and evangelizing the value of APIs beyond developer community and Silicon Valley.  Two and half years later I feel that the business of APIs is progressing and much of the success I&rsquo;ve highlighted in the space is catching on with mainstream companies, with many business sectors are waking up to the potential.</p>
<p>In 2012 I felt an awakening.  An awakening that APIs exist, and the potential they possess in industries from telecommunications to government.  This wasn&rsquo;t just in the U.S.  I talked with people from France to Brazil about the importance of APIs.  Sitting here on January 1st, 2013, I feel we are on the verge of a pivotal year in APIs.</p>
<p>While APIs time has definitely come, there are many paths we can take from here when it comes to terms of use, business models or decisions around hypermedia that could benefit or severely damage the potential APIs can deliver.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-2013.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>To quote a friend of mine, APIs are very tactical. &nbsp;And because of this, I don&rsquo;t think we can make predictions. &nbsp;As API owners you can just focus on what you do best, solve your problems in real-time--while also making sure to look up from time to time and get your bearings in respect to the rest of the space and your industry.</p>
<p>I also hope as an API Evangelist I can maintain an awareness of the overall space, and provide news and analysis here at API Evangelist that will help you in your efforts. &nbsp;If you feel your story might help someone else in the space, make sure and reach out to me so I can help you get it out.</p>
<p>Happy New Year! &nbsp;Hang on, it is going to be an exciting year for APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/30/history-of-apis-programmableweb/">History of APIs:  ProgrammableWeb</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">30 Dec 2012</span>
        <p>While writing about the&nbsp;<a title="history of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs</a>, it is easy to be so focused on just APIs, that you overlook the single most important player in the entire history of the web API--<a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.</p>
<p>In July 2005, John Musser started ProgrammableWeb. According to his original about page:</p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/programmableweb/ProgrammableWeb-10-2005.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>ProgrammableWeb is a web-as-platform reference site and blog delivering news, information and resources for developing applications using the Web 2.0 APIs.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I started this site because I couldn't find what I was looking for: a technology focused&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2005/08/20/so-many-apis-so-little-time/">starting point for web platform development</a>. (For a bit more see my initial post.) Although no guarantees, the last time I started a reference site it somehow became Google's highest rated link on the topic. Given that this site will be a collaborative effort with community input as well, this can be what we make it.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I hope you find the site useful.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>John Musser - Seattle, August 2005</em></blockquote>
<p>I think John&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2005/08/20/so-many-apis-so-little-time/">original blog post</a>&nbsp;on why he started ProgrammableWeb, says it all:<strong><em>&nbsp;Why? Because going From Web Page to Web Platform is a big deal</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Web APIs are a big deal! Whether its social networking, government, healthcare or education--having a programmable platform to make data and resources available will be a critical part of how commerce and society operates from here on forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>John made a early decision to showcase open and RESTful approaches to deploying APIs vs. parallel attempts of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a>(SOA) and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">Web Services</a>, and focused on telling stories about open APIs--way before it was the thing to do in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>When I started API Evangelist in July 2010 (5 years after PW), and started talking about the business of APIs, the technology of web APIs was already widely accepted in Silicon Valley, because of the stories John Musser and Adam Duvander have told on ProgrammableWeb.</p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/programmableweb/programmableweb-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As we close 2012, a year in which I think we can confidently say APIs are moving mainstream, and I feel we owe much of the success to ProgrammableWeb. The stories John, Adam and other writers have been telling on ProgrammableWeb have been crucial to quantifying and defining the API industry--allowing us all to build, iterate and move things forward. Without stories around the technical, business and politics of APIs, these virtual interfaces would not have been able to find a place in our real life worlds.</p>
<p>Thanks John, Adam and ProgrammableWeb, for telling the stories that got us here.</p>

<p>You can learn a lot from the <a href="/history/">history of APIs</a>, and following what the pioneers are doing. &nbsp;Salesforce isn't the coolest API within the Hacker News community, but when it comes to building an API ecosystem--Salesforce knows what they are doing.</p>
<p>I was reading through the <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/12/yearinreview.html">Salesforce top developers highlights of 2012</a>. &nbsp;Their highlights doesn't just showcase the success of the community, but what Salesforce feels is critical to keeping their ecosystem healthy.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>800,000 developers and climbing:</strong>&nbsp;the Salesforce Platform Developer Community is growing at an unprecedented rate.</li>
<li><strong>Cool new Salesforce technologies:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Identity">Identity</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Salesforce_touch_platform">Salesforce Touch Platform</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_Canvas">Force.com Canvas</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/9/19/announcing_heroku_enterprise_for_java/">Java on Heroku&nbsp;</a>for the Enterprise were released.</li>

</ul>
<p>What I hear when I read this list is that to get to 800K developers (holy shit), you need to constantly release new technologies, product resources and content to support your platform, give your community a voice with an emphasis on showcasing the leaders--while also engaging with developers both online and offline.</p>

<p>Salesforce has been building their API ecosystem for 12 years! &nbsp;Twice as long as Twitter. &nbsp;What they highlight as part of their developer community in 2012 is something you should be doing in your own developer community.</p>

<p>Storytelling in the API industry is critical to the healthy growth of the space.  John Musser and <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> have been telling great stories in the tech industry, since way before APIs were all lthe rage they are now.</p>
<p>While I was at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a> this year,  I was speaking with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) of <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a>, and we started talking about how Amazon, Netflix (and I&rsquo;d add Twilio) tend to dominate the API discussion.  I considered my talks from API Days, and sure enough--Netflix and Amazon were in there multiple times!</p>
<p>There are other stories we tell around Twitter, Facebook Google and other smaller APIs, but Amazon, Netflix and Twilio were cornerstones of API folklore in 2012.  While I will keep telling these pillar stories (because they matter), as well as evolving other pioneers from my <a title="history of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs</a> section, I want to develop a fresh lineup of amazing API stories for 2013.</p>
<p>Stories like <a title="ohnson Control's, Panoptix API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/17/make-an-impact-on-our-environment-using-apis/">Johnson Control's, Panoptix API</a>, and how a 125 year old company can change their culture and embrace a new way of doing business via APIs.</p>
<p>I will make sure there is easy access to the classic Amazon, Netflix and Twilio API stories.  I will also be adding new versions of some other classic stories from Salesforce, eBay, Flickr and other API pioneers.  But in 2013 I will be working to find a new set of API stories from brands and companies we know.</p>
<p>If you have an API success story you&rsquo;d like to share, please let me know.</p>

<blockquote><em>The issues surrounding personal data &ndash; political, technological and commercial alike &ndash; are numerous and complex. The choices stakeholders make today will influence the personal data ecosystem for years to come.</em></blockquote>
<p>The World Economic Forum then outlines five key area that require action:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Innovate around user-centricity and trust. The personal data ecosystem will be built on the trust and control individuals have in sharing their data. From a technological, policy and sociological sense all stakeholders need to embrace this construct. One particular area of focus is the continued testing and promoting of &ldquo;trust frameworks&rdquo; that explore innovative approaches for identity assurance at Internet scale</li>
<li>Define global principles for using and sharing personal data. Given the lack of globally accepted policies governing the use and exchange of personal data, an international community of stakeholders should articulate and advance core principles of a user-centric personal data ecosystem. These pilots should invite real-world input from a diverse group of individuals who can not only articulate the values, needs and desires of end users, but also the complex and contextual nuances involved in revealing one&rsquo;s digital identity</li>
<li>Strengthen the dialog between regulators and the private sector. Building on a collective sense of fundamental principles for creating a balanced ecosystem, public and private stakeholders should actively collaborate as the ecosystem begins to take shape. Those responsible for building and deploying the tools (the technologists) should more closely align with those making the rules (regulators)</li>
<li>Focus on interoperability and open standards. With the appropriate user controls and legal infrastructure in place, innovations in how personal data moves throughout the value chain will be a key driver for societal and economic value creation. Enabling a secure, trusted, reliable and open infrastructure (both legal and technical) will be vital. Participants should identify best practices and engage with standards bodies, advocacy groups, think tanks and various consortia on the user-centric approaches required to scale the value of personal data</li>
<li>Continually share knowledge. It&rsquo;s a huge challenge for entities to keep up with new research, policies and commercial developments. To stay current, stakeholders should share insights and learnings on their relevant activities, from both successes as well as failures. After all, the ecosystem&rsquo;s promise is about the tremendous value created when individuals share information about who they are and what they know. Clearly, this principle should also apply to practitioners within the development community</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether its social networks or education and healthcare, personal data will be a major driver of API adoption in 2013.  Personal data is at the heart of the recent social and mobile movements, and there are very serious illnesses in how we buy and sell personal data in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>I agree with Alex Howard, that personal data ownership will be big issue in 2013, and intrigued by the World Economic Forums insight on personal data, it asks a lot of great questions--questions that we need bring mainstream in 2013.</p>

<p>While traveling the globe, dedicating my life to API evangelism, I only drink one beer--IPAs.</p>
<p>Coincidence?  I think not!</p>
<p>This blog is dedicated to discussing the amazing world of India Pale Ales, also known as IPAs.</p>

<p>The end of the year is a great time to reflect--looking back at the year with a desire to quantify and understand ourselves.</p>
<p>With our increasingly digital (social, cloud, mobile, APIs) lives, there are more opportunities than ever to ask our digital self very specific questions, and with the power the API get an answer back.</p>
<p>Over the holidayz, I spent some time asking some questions I wanted to know about my world in 2012--things that were important to me, and help me feel healthy, happy, accomplished and ultimately successful. (aka.&nbsp;<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/10/18/optimize-for-happiness.html" target="_blank">Optimize for Happiness</a>)</p>

<p>This is all a work in progress. &nbsp;I wanted a list that could evolve, but I could use as a framework for actually answering some of these questions--either annually or real-time if possible, using APIs.</p>
<p>To facilitate this process, I've <a title="Personal Data Questions" href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">published as project on Github</a>. &nbsp;I will be publishing all the questions I ask, and their solutions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, I've been able to use <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and answer a number of critical questions about 2012 using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Google--via the <a href="http://singly.com">Singly API</a>.</p>
<p>If you have questions you'd like asked, you can visit my <a href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/">personal data questions project</a> and comment via Disqus or if you want, you can <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/personal-data-questions">fork and contribute</a> your own questions and API driven solutions.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/22/amazing-visuals-but-lack-of-api-imagination/">Amazing Visuals, But Lack of API Imagination</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/earth-as-art/desolation-canyon.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was scrolling through my feeds today and I came across, "<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/earth_art_detail.html">Earth As Art</a>" from NASA.  I clicked on the homepage and didn&rsquo;t think much, and moved on.  Then I came across <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2012/12/21/earth-as-art-from-nasa/">Earth as Art book from NASA on Flowing Data</a>, where they showed an actual image from the &ldquo;Earth As Art&rdquo; collection.</p>
<p>Sure, I suffer from ADD.  But so does much of the world.  I work through huge amounts of data on a daily basis, looking for gems.  Sometimes I can find them myself, and sometimes I need help.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Earth as Art&rdquo; is an amazing collection of satellite photos from NASA.   I feel the entire collection could be made into an exhibit, allowing us to experience, take in and discuss the meaning of art, created from space of the planet we live on.</p>
<p>I also feel NASA&rsquo;s Earth as Art I think is a poster boy example of how APIs can open up and provide access to content, but also work as conduit for syndication, sharing, remixing and expression around content the owner may not have been able to see.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/earth_art_detail.html">deployment of the Earth as Art collection at NASA</a> has a title, description and meaningless photo thumbnail--accompanied by a <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/703154main_earth_art-ebook.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nasa-earth-as-art/id577527077?mt=8">iPad app</a>.  Obviously NASA saw the value in delivering an iPad app, and making the content accessible to the masses via a PDF.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw the images I want to create something that would share, syndicate and bring awareness to their beauty.  My hands are immediately tied, with only a PDF and iPad app--I am not equipped with the tools of a developer.</p>
<p>If there were simply a JSON file of all images, titles, locations and details. Before I got to work, I looked around, but couldn&rsquo;t find any raw data for the project.  So I created <a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/earth-as-art/gh-pages/data/photos.json">my own JSON representation</a> of the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/703154main_earth_art-ebook.pdf">Earth as Art PDF</a>.</p>
<p>JSON output is so much more valuable than PDF output.  It took me about 2 hours to reverse engineer the Earth as Art PDF and render as images and text.  Now, equipped with the parts and pieces of the Earth as Art content, with JSON file as a framework--I can get to work creating several, more interactive representations of the satellite imagery.</p>
<p>Before I create any visualizations, I need a place to put my project.  No better place than <a href="/admin/blog/http:/github.com">Github</a>.  I can use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to host my project and with a JSON file as my data source, I can easily use <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> to display the images and allow for basic browsing.</p>
<p>Instead of a single, static PDF--I now have all my images and the title, details, location and paths in a JSON file I can render the content in any way I want:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>HTML Templates</strong> - Using JSON + Mustache I can view images on a listing with detail pages</li>
<li><strong>Deck.js Presentation </strong>- Create a presentation in markdown using the satellite imagery and content, laid out using the deck.js framework</li>
<li><strong>Widgets</strong> - Develop several, embeddable, syndicatable JavaScript widgets that are driven from the JSON file</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/earth-as-art/great-salt-desert.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Having the Earth as a Art assets stored as individual images with name, details, location and image paths as JSON allows me build my own HTML display, presentations and widgets around the content.</p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank">Hosting the Earth as Art project at Github</a> allows me to provide simple, inexpensive, open hosting for the data, content and display elements--allowing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">anyone</span> to fork, download and remix and even choose to contribute back.</p>
<p>As another project, I can explore the licensing, branding and other aspects that will ensure the creators of the content (NASA), get the attribution they deserve for creating such amazing content.</p>
<p>When I first saw the Earth as Art pictures this morning, I couldn&rsquo;t get over the fact that they weren&rsquo;t in a format that allowed for remix, sharing and syndication.  The images are amazing and really lend themselves for infinite presentations and interpretations.</p>
<p>Hopefully the project will only grow from here.</p>

<p>These areas reflect the patterns I'm seeing, and while some API owners or API service providers may fall into one or many of these areas, I've broken them down into, what I feel are meaningful groups that will help me explain the future of APIs to the masses. &nbsp;With a goal of demonstrating the value, power and importance of APIs.</p>
<p>If you feel there are other trends I'm missing, patterns I'm not seeing or companies that are doing cool stuff in these areas, please let me know. &nbsp;As with all of API Evangelist, these new sections are a work in progress--help it grow.</p>

        <p><a title="History of APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/history/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-History.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The history of APIs is something I discuss a lot. &nbsp;The history of modern web APIs is something I include in all my talks, and I'm always surprised by how little people understand some of the more popular APIs that got us to where we are at.</p>
<p>To further support this area, I've launched a <a title="History of APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/history/">History of APIs</a> section where I've hung the stories I've already done in this area, and will be looking to dig up the history on other APIs that are shaking things up.</p>
<p>When I'm talking to people about APIs, the term APIs can mean many different things. Sometimes it means hardware APIs, or the Java API or various other technical incarnations. Right now when you hear the term API, it probably means web API or an API built using REST, running on the same infrastructure the World Wide Web runs on.</p>
<p>When it comes to APIs, I strongly feel that to understand where we are, we need to understand the short, modern history of the web APIs. There are several patterns to why the modern web API movement has worked, that I think you can take home and use in your own API strategy.</p>
<h2>Commerce</h2>
<p>While modern web APIs were officially born with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm" target="_blank">Roy Fieldings dissertation Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures in 2000</a>--Web APIs first appeared in the wild with the&nbsp;<a title="Saleforce" href="/history/salesforce.php">introduction of Salesforce</a>&nbsp;on February 7th, when the company officially launched its API at the IDG Demo 2000 conference. Salesforce was an enterprise-class, web-based, sales force automation as a "Internet as a service", with XML APIs were part of Salesforce.com from day one.</p>

<p>Later in the year, on November 20, 2000,&nbsp;<a title="eBay" href="/history/ebay.php">eBay launched the eBay Application Program Interface (API)</a>, along with the eBay Developers Program--which was originally rolled out to only a select number of licensed eBay partners and developers.</p>

<p>Then on July 16, 2002,&nbsp;<a title="Amazon E-Commerce" href="/history/amazon.php">Amazon launched Amazon.com Web Services</a>&nbsp;allowing developers to incorporate Amazon.com content and features into their own web sites.

<p>The modern Web API movement was kicked off. But for some reason it didn't gain the momentum we see today, whether it was due to the "dotcom" bubble bursting or other things werent quite ready--web APIs wouldn't get traction until things got social.</p>
<h2>Social</h2>
<p>In February 2004 the popular photo sharing site Flickr launched. Six months later&nbsp;<a title="Flickr" href="/history/flickr.php">they launched their now infamous API</a>, and six months after that, they were acquired by Yahoo. The launch of the RESTful API helped Flickr quickly become the image platform of choice for the early blogging and social media movement by allowing users to easily embed their Flickr photos into their blogs and social network streams. While allowing Flickr to focus on a&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/" target="_blank">new approach to business development using web APIs</a>.</p>

<p>Then on August 15th 2006,&nbsp;<a title="Facebook" href="/history/facebook.php">Facebook launched its long-awaited development platform and API</a>.

<p>One month later on September 20, 2006&nbsp;<a title="Twitter" href="/history/twitter.php">Twitter introduced the Twitter API to the world</a>. Much like the release of the eBay API, Twitter's API release was in response to the growing usage of Twitter by those scraping the site or creating rogue APIs.</p>

<p>At the same time Facebook and Twitter were playing with the social powers of web APIs, Google was exploring the power of web APIs supporting embeddable tools and apps. The&nbsp;<a title="Google Maps" href="/history/google-maps.php">Google Maps API launched was just shy of 6 months after the release of Google Maps as an application</a>, and was in direct response to the number of rogue applications developed that were hacking the application. Google Maps was immediately so popular that developers hacked the JavaScript interface and developed application such as housingmaps.com and chicagocime.org.</p>

<p>At this point web APIs were showing the power of the Internet when it came to sharing, making things embeddable and social. Web APIs still were perceived as "hobby" by mainstream business. You couldn't take care of business...yet.</p>
<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>As APIs were generating social buzz across the Internet, Amazon saw the potential of an&nbsp;<a title="RESTful approach to business" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/restful-business-architecture/" target="_blank">RESTful approach to business</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/" target="_blank">internalized and saw APIs in a way that nobody had seen them before</a>--giving re-birth to an Amazon Web Services that was much, much more than just e-commerce.</p>
<p>In March, 2006 Amazon launched a new web service, something completely different from the Amazon bookseller and e-commerce site we've come to know. This was a new endeavor for Amazon: a storage web service called&nbsp;<a title="Amazon S3" href="/history/amazon-s3.php">Amazon S3</a>. Amazon S3 which provided a simple interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives developers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites.</p>
<p><a title="Amazon S3" href="/history/amazon-s3.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>Six month later, shortly after launching Amazon S3, Amazon followed with a new cloud computing service dubbed&nbsp;<a title="Amazon EC2" href="/history/amazon-ec2.php">Amazon EC2</a>&nbsp;or Elastic Compute Cloud. Amazon EC2 provided resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing developers to launch different sizes of virtual servers within Amazon data centers. Just like its predecessor Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 was just a RESTful API. Amazon wouldn't launch a web interface for another three years.</p>
<p>With cloud computing, web APIs got real. You could now deploy global infrastructure using APIs. It wasn't just about social fun anymore, you could actually run your business using APIs.</p>
<p>Even with this new found power of API driven cloud computing, it would take one more essential ingredient before web APIs were ready for the prime time.</p>
<h2>Mobile</h2>
<p>With everyone focused on social and the cloud, a new device emerged, and much like social and cloud, would prove to be a game changer. In June of 2009 Apple launched the iPhone 3G, the App Store began allowing iPod Touch and iPhone owners to download applications through the iTunes desktop software or the App Store on their iPhones--opening up entirely new world of mobile applications, one that APIs would be the driving force.</p>
<p>Soon after the launch of the iPhone, in March 2009&nbsp;<a title="Foursquare" href="/history/foursquare.php">Foursquare launched</a>&nbsp;at the SXSW interactive festival in Austin, TX. Foursquare was a location-based mobile platform that makes cities more interesting to explore, by checking in via a smartphone app or SMS, users share their location with friends while collecting points and virtual badges. This new type of mobile app, utilized APIs to allow developers to deliver a new generation of location aware, API driven applications, feeding the growing app economy.</p>

<p>The mobile evolution of the Internet was under way, and the following year on October 6, 2010,<a title="Instagram" href="/history/instagram.php">Instagram launched its photo-sharing iPhone application</a>. Less than three months later, it had one million users. Kevin Systrom the founder of Instagram focused on delivering a powerful, but simple iPhone app that solved common problems with the quality of mobile photos and users' frustrations with sharing.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Immediately many users complained about the lack of central Instagram web site or an API, with Instragram remaining firm on focusing its energy on the core iPhone application. In December a developer name Mislav Marohni? took it upon himself to reverse engineer how the iPhone app worked, and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/" target="_blank">built his own unofficial Instagram API</a>&nbsp;on top of private Instagram APIs. By&nbsp;<a href="/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/" target="_blank">January Instagram shut down the rogue API, announcing that it was building one of its own</a>.</p>
<p>The appetite for API resources to drive mobile has only grown with the introduction of the iPad tablet and the growth of the Android and Windows mobile platforms.</p>
<p>Mobile was the finalize piece of the digital strategy puzzle, which included commerce, social and cloud--all required before the original vision of web APIs could be realized.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Web APIs got their start in early e-commerce on the Internet, but without social, a scalable cloud backend and a ubiquitous mobile devices--APIs weren't ready for prime time. In 2012, we reached that point.</p>
<p>Every company needs a healthy digital strategy for success in 2013, which includes sensible uses of social, cloud, mobile--all depending upon APIs. While there are plenty of other APIs to learn from, we can learn a lot from the history of modern web APIs, and these early web API pioneers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/scripting-platforms.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working hard to understand the emerging patterns of of how APIs used, work through the details, and grasp the differences in competing approaches--in hopes of identifying <a title="what is next when it comes to web APIs" href="/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">what is next when it comes to web APIs</a>.</p>
<p>One trend I&rsquo;m tracking on is the emergence of API scripting platforms.  This is a difficult are to track on, because we script against APIs all the time, right? This is different.  Scripting platforms are providing platforms and libraries to support easily scripting against multiple APIs.</p>
<p>To help me understand this new approach to using APIs I&rsquo;m studying three separate approaches:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a></strong> - Authentication, integration and scripting platform.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a></strong> - Beyond&nbsp;code snippets, into ready-to-use processes, that simply API integration, taking care of authentication, credential management, updates and more</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/">Google Apps Scripts</a></strong> -&nbsp;<span>A JavaScript cloud scripting language that lets you extend Google Apps, integrate 3rd party services and build mobile and web applications.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these platforms are bringing together valuable API resources, from multiple sources into not just a common interface, but providing a language library you can use to build apps efficiently across multiple API resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working to understand the nuances of each approach. For example, Google provides its JavaScript like, stripped down language, where Webshell focuses on JavaScript and CoffeeScript.  Temboo provides ready to go processes or what they call choreos, with language SDKs in Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby and Python.</p>
<p>Google Apps Script provides access to Google APIs and services, but recently opened up scripts to acts as connectors, that can be developed by 3rd party providers.  Temboo has over 100 APIs in its library, while Webshell is just getting going with less than 25.</p>
<p>I see what Webshell, Temboo and Google are doing as similar to the aggregation, integration and some times automation we are seeing in other trending API areas, but these approaches are actually building languages that allow you to be more expressive with not just single APIs, but fluently with many APIs at once.</p>
<p>This area is new and emerging, and I&rsquo;m still working to understand the different approaches.  let me know if you if you have anything I should be looking at or other thoughts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>More to come...</p>

<p>I'm working on a new trends section of API Evangelist. &nbsp;One area i'm tracking on is the opportunities around 3D printing and APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I did some fun research, and <a href="/2011/05/18/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">laid down some interest thoughts on APIs and 3D printing in 2011</a>. &nbsp;This was part of some research I was doing while working at Mimeo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts. With this trends research into 3D printing, I am working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I've identified 10 major components of 3D printing:</span></p>

<p>The <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/22/6000-apis-its-business-its-social-and-its-happening-quickly/">number of available APIs is growing at a neck breaking speed</a>.  I have trouble keeping up with individual APIs, and I feel I am losing touch with the nuances and trends within specific areas like music or travel.</p>
<p>I am getting more and more questions like this via email and twitter:</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>I am doing some research on music APIs. I am considering using one to integrate music streaming and relevant data into an app.  Can you recommend anyone who has technical or business expertise (or both) with these in particular?  I would love to speak with an expert to help lead me and my developers in the right direction.  Some points I am considering:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Technical capabilities (streaming speed, limitations of service, etc.)</li>
<li>Access to support from API parent company</li>
<li>Business opportunities or restrictions that arise when relying on the API</li>
</ul>
</em></blockquote>
<p>These are concerns that might be shared with other industries, but knowing the music industry--there are plenty of unique issues developers encounter when building applications and businesses around music APIs.</p>
<p>Back in February, I did write on how <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/15/emi-helps-developers-navigate-building-apps-for-music-industry/">EMI is helping developers navigate building apps for the music industry</a>, but beyond just shedding light on what others are doing, I don&rsquo;t have the time to specialize in the details of how APIs are transforming the music industry.</p>
<p>There is a huge need for more professionals to step up within specific industries and develop the domain expertise necessary to make sure APIs are being deployed with the proper technical, business and political building blocks, and help developers understand how to navigate the nuances of a particular industry being transformed by web APIs.</p>
<p>Could you be this person, feel free to connect with me. &nbsp;I see a desperate need for experts in the music industry, education, health care, government and other fast moving business sectors.</p>

<p>I had a chance to talk with the <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/content/us/en.html">Johnson Controls</a>, <a title="Panoptix API" href="https://developer.panoptix.com/">Panoptix API</a> team this last week.  The <a href="http://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">Panoptix&reg; community</a>&nbsp;offers:</p>
<blockquote><em>a combination of software and services that easily and cost-effectively helps customers see more so they can do more to achieve optimized building performance and energy efficiency</em></blockquote>
<p>To understand what Panoptix enables...imagine if all of our buildings:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Thought for themselves</li>
<li>Teach us to reduce energy consumption</li>
<li>Diagnose problems in real-time</li>
<li>Self correct when necessary</li>
<li>Call a service provider when they need repair or tuning</li>
</ul>
<p>Panoptix starts with a cloud-hosted platform that enables buildings to collect and manage data, along with tools for automating operations at the building and space levels providing metering for electricity, water, gas oil steam, carbon and weather--with very granular level reporting up to overall trends of energy use.</p>
<p>To grow Panoptix, Johnson Controls introduced a <a title="marketplace" href="http://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix/apps">marketplace of apps</a> combined with supporting news, information, resources and entire community dedicated to building performance and efficiency management.</p>
<p>This marketplace and community is driven by an&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.panoptix.com/">API developer area</a>, allowing anyone to <a href="https://developer.panoptix.com/signup/">sign up</a> and get to work developing apps and start selling them in the Panoptix marketplace.  The Panoptix API is free to use for anyone looking to developer one app, allowing you to collect 70% of revenue from app sales in the marketplace (an essential ingredient for developer success).</p>
<p>I like Johnson Controls approach to building a community around building management applications, data and resources--complete with a API driven developer area.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s great to see a 125 year old company open up their hardware and software with such an innovative approach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be digging further into how <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/content/us/en.html">Johnsons Controls</a> deployed the Panoptix API, with further entries to this blog series, and a full case study on their approach to delivering their API driven building management platform.</p>

<p>Some great <a title="API questions for Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier" href="http://startupjuicer.com/2012/12/wade-foster-co-founder-ceo-of-zapier/">API questions for Wade Foster, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Zapier</a> over at <a title="Startup Juicer" href="http://startupjuicer.com/">Startup Juicer</a> today.</p>
<p><strong>Zapier is a company that couldn&rsquo;t have existed even a few years ago as API&rsquo;s were not commonplace. What other advanced do you envision changing the way businesses operate?</strong></p>
<blockquote><em>APIs are just the first piece, but it&rsquo;s still the wild west in the API world with APIs constantly changing. One thing that will happen is APIs will move away from polling driven to push driven. That way API consumers don&rsquo;t have to constantly asking providers for new data like a kid on a long trip asking &ldquo;are we there yet&rdquo; but can instead rely on the API provider to send us the data when we get to the proverbial travel destination.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>What your thoughts are about the changing landscape of API access with some of the free big networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin are becoming increasingly restrictive in the way they allow developers to access their feeds?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://startupjuicer.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/startup-juicer/startup-juicer.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>The only services I&rsquo;m seeing become more restrictive in how they allow developers to use their APIs are free tools. Many those services are in the high growth stage and are starting to think about monetization and are experimenting with lots of different ways to make money. Unfortunately this means instability for developers. Zapier leans heavily B2B though. And B2B services are doubling down on their APIs. For them, more usage of the API leads to more usage of the core product and since their core product is a paid service that means more paying users and the paying users are upgrading to higher plans. That means a service like Zapier is highly valuable to both API providers and to consumers alike.</em></blockquote>

        <span class="post-date">12 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hackweekends/oc-hackerz/oc-hackerz-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I started tracking on Hackathons full time in 2011, as part of my API Evangelism toolbox.  In 2012 I&rsquo;ve watched <a title="Hackathons explode and become a popular way for API owners to engage and build a relationship with developers" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/10/08/458-hackathons-in-the-united-states-so-far-in-2012/">Hackathons explode and become a popular way for API owners to engage and build a relationship with developers</a>.  (if done right)</p>
<p>As I do with other trending areas, I launched as its own site, <a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com">hackweekends.com</a>.   I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of demand from hackathon organizers and sponsors to add events and other news and information.  To support this I recently <a title="Open Sourced Hack Weekends on Github" href="/2012/12/08/open-sourcing-hack-weekends-using-github/">launched Hack Weekends on Github</a>, so anyone can edit pages, write blog posts and add events to the calendar.  A sort of crowd sourced hackathon hub.</p>
<p>To further support the hackathon community I also wanted to provide an <a title="open source hackathon guide" href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">open source hackathon guide</a>, helping anyone understand how they can throw their own hackathon.  There were already two great hackathon guides out there which are <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBuisDTIiBAz9u2tr7sgv6GdDLOV_aHbafjqHXSkNB0/edit">Open Data Hackathon How to Guide</a> and <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">The Hack Day Manifesto</a>---both licensed openly.  So I took this excellent material and merged with my own material to create a <a title="Hack Weekends Guide" href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">Hack Weekends Guide</a>.</p>
<p>The Hack Weekends guide provides a very detail guide to throwing a hackathon, and I also included a <a href="http://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">website template that runs on Github Pages</a> using Jekyll.  My goal is to make it a plug-n-play guide with all the tools and resources you need to be successful in your communities hackathon</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hackweekends/hackathon-home-2.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Next I need to actually prove my &ldquo;open source&rdquo; approach to planning, designing and marketing hackathons.  I&rsquo;m planning several hackathons to make sure the process works.  The first hackathon I am planning is for <a title="OC Hackerz" href="http://www.meetup.com/OCHackerz/">OC Hackerz</a> in Orange County, California.  OC Hackerz is a big supporter of developers, and is in sync with my vision of what the hackathon space should look like, so they are a great partner to plan two initial hackathons:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="OC Hackerz Hackathon Los Angeles" href="http://kinlane.github.com/oc-hackerz-hackathon/">OC Hackerz Hackathon - Los Angeles - March 2013</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The planning of the OC Hackerz Hackathon is meant to be an exploratory deployment of the Hack Weekends Guide, intended to make hackathon planning an open and collaborative process between organizers, sponsors and the local stakeholders.</p>
<p>Hack Weekends is all a work in progress.  So I&rsquo;m lookiking for feedback.  If you&rsquo;d like to get involved in hackathons or use the Hack Weekends process yourself, feel free to reach out.   The platform already has other supports such Singly, AT&amp;T and Hacker League.  My vision is to have everyone in the community contributing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/singly/Singly-Mobile-Fabric-Your-App.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> is continuing its quest to easily explain what it does for developers. &nbsp;The San Francisco startup has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/10/singly-launches-app-fabric-platform-for-developers-to-speed-up-integrations-with-dozens-of-services/">re-launched defining itself as, fabric for connected apps, or AppFabric</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Singly puts it best:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Singly AppFabric empowers you to add social login, sharing and friend finding into your mobile and web applications.&nbsp;</em><br /><em>Singly DataFabric handles syncing, data formatting, de-duplication, and normalization letting you query by location, keyword, and more.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When building mobile apps you are going to need to bridge social networks for your users, allowing them to authenticate with their preferred platform as well as pull friends, images and provide sharing in a meaningful way. &nbsp;You either do this platform by platform, or you use Singly's AppFabric to do this for you.</em></p>
<p>The best example of this in the wild, is with Singly developed mobile app <a title="Timehop" href="http://timehop.com/">Timehop</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://timehop.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/singly/timehop/timehop-1.png" alt="" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Timehop lets you see your photos and updates from this exact day in history.</p>
<p><a href="http://timehop.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/singly/timehop/timehop-2.png" alt="" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>To use Timehop, I need to sign up using <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> (this is Singly).</p>
<p><a href="http://timehop.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/singly/timehop/timehop-3.png" alt="" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Now I'm registered for Timehop and I have my <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> history connected.</p>
<p><a href="http://timehop.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/singly/timehop/timehop-4.png" alt="" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Using Singy AppFabric, Timehop allows me to easily connect my <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/foursquare">Foursquare</a>, <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a> and Flickr services.</p>

<p>Now <a href="http://timehop.com/">Timehop</a> can intelligently connect me to my friends across these networks and share my Timehop stories, where it is most important to me.</p>
<p>Singly is weaving together the most critical of social and personal APIs into an AppFabric, that developers can use to build the next generation of API driven mobile apps.</p>
<p>As a developer, you won't think of development with single APIs anymore like <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a>. &nbsp;You can use AppFabric to build meaningful apps, knowing the social authentication, friends, sharing, photos and other objects across the multiple networks is at your disposal in a single, standardized interface.</p>
<p><a title="Singly is AppFabric for our personal and social data" href="https://singly.com/">Singly is AppFabric for our personal and social data</a>, that developers can use to build the apps that we depend upon ever day.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/11/mulesoft-launches-api-discovery-hub/">Mulesoft Launches API Discovery Hub</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.mulesoft.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mulesoft/mulesoft-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API Discovery is becoming an increasingly troubling problem.  As an analyst, I see a dizzying amount of APIs each month.   When I get asked to find a particular type of API, or group of APIs in a particular industry--it gets difficult to discover a meaningful results to any query.</p>
<p>My options for API discovery historically has been <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.  The OG API Directory.</p>
<p>Today there is a new player on the block, <a href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a>.  APIhub is a fresh attempt at solving the API discovery, with over 13K APIs organized by category, type, protocol, format and security.</p>
<p>API Hub is looking to provide a solution for two distinct groups:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Developers</strong> - Developers need an ecosystem to discover, learn, test and use APIs</li>
<li><strong>Publishers</strong> - Publishers require a platform to publish, manage, engage customers, and monetize APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>With first release APIhub&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have much out of the gate that is different than <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, except for a much cleaner layout, search tools that is not cluttered by news, mashups and advertising.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apihub.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mulesoft/API-Hub-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Once you explore APIhub further, you start seeing early signs of deeper features.  When you add or claim your API, your given the option to upload a API spec in a Swagger or WADL format, with more formats coming soon.  If implemented for all 13K APIs, this could be a powerful discovery engine.</p>
<p>Beyond programmatic discovery I see hints of ranking on the platform.  Right now its just 5 star ranking, but have hopes for more sophistication on how developers, publishers and analysts can rank APIs in the future.  Allowing consumers to find new and existing APIs in meaningful ways--other than just 5 star ranking or my number of followers and mashups built on an API would be extremeley valuable.</p>
<p>APIhub, marketplace or directory is nothing new.  You see folks like <a href="http://apis.io/apis">APIs.io</a> trying to step up with a directory and startups like <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> providing a hub of their own, in a similar attempt to create an API marketplace.</p>
<p>I think there are several things that will decide whether <a href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a> is successful and it will center around their ranking and discovering algorithm, but also their ability to attract API owners to come, claim and enhance their listings.  But more importantly can APIhub and Mulesoft get developers to care and participate in curating, ranking and consuming APIs via the new APIhub? &nbsp;Just like the web API movement, developers will make or break APIhub. &nbsp;If it add values to developers worlds, they'll embrace it--if not, APIhub will have hard time staying relevant.</p>

<p>Hackathons have been a big part of current web API movement.  They are one of the most meaningful ways API owners can connect with developers in person. &nbsp;Twilio, Amazon and Facebook have all used hackathons to build their ecosystems.</p>
<p>I started a section on API Evangelist in 2011, dedicated to hackathons. And in early 2012 I rolled this section out as its own site, hackweekends.com. &nbsp;Over 2012 the number of hackathons has grown significantly--making it difficult to ignore hackathons as channel for reaching developers.</p>
<p>This weekend I <a href="/2012/12/08/open-sourcing-hack-weekends-using-github/">migrated the Hack Weekends directory to run on Github</a>.  It uses <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> for the blog.  I deployed <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">mustache templates</a> and JSON files for the events calendar and curated news section.  I&rsquo;m working on ways to easily crowdsource the management of Hack Weekends, while establishing it as an open source hub for the hackathon community.</p>
<p>In addition to establishing Hack Weekends as a hub for the community, I wanted to create a <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">guide to throwing hackathons</a>.  So anyone can organize their own event. To help feed this, I&rsquo;ve been gathering my own research on hackathons from attending, mentoring, hacking and organizing hackathons over last 2 years.</p>
<p>I also knew that there was other really good information available from other hackathon experts.  So I pulled together the best, open information on throwing hackathons and combined it with my own research.  Pulling content from:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hack Weekends</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBuisDTIiBAz9u2tr7sgv6GdDLOV_aHbafjqHXSkNB0/edit">Open Data Hackathon How to Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">The Hack Day Manifesto</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With this content and my experience I wanted to organize into something more.  Remixing and setting into motion,  a guide that anyone can use to organize a hackathon.</p>
<p>While maintaining the calendar for Hack Weekends, I see a lot of hackathon sites.  To accompany the Hack Weekends Guide I wanted <a href="http://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">hackathon organizers to be able to easily deploy a website in support of the event</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://hackweekends.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hackweekends/hackweekends-logo.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide">Hack Weekends Guide</a> comes with a <a href="http://kinlane.github.com/hack-weekends-guide/">hackathon website template </a>as part of the Github repository.  So all you have to do is fork the Hack Weekends Guide, and you get a detailed guide in addition to a website. It is up to you, which parts of the guide you will use--as little or as much as you feel necessary.</p>
<p>The Hack Weekends directory, guide and website is meant to be community owned.  You can deploy any hackathon with the guide and site, and participate in marketing your hackathons using Hack Weekends and other partner sites.</p>
<p>I will be using the model to deploy 5 hackathons in the coming months, to contribute my own content and data, I hope you will get involved too!  I look forward to your feedback and hackathon expertise.</p>

        <p>While I was in Paris speaking at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io" target="_blank">API Days </a>last week, a drawing of me was circulated on Twitter. &nbsp;I was a little speachless when I saw them on Twitter. &nbsp;I am always looking for new graphics to use in API Evangelist. &nbsp;I worked for hours to come up with the logo I have, so I was stoked to see someone create something so cool, in the moment.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/enterprise-business.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>At the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas, NV last week I discussed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>"grass-roots web API movement"</em></span> with quite a few enterprise folks.  Walking through the exhibit floor, where I did my <a href="/2012/11/30/my-api-building-blocks-workshop-with-intel-at-the-gartner-aadi-conference/">building blocks of an API workshop</a>, I noticed the signage and discussions were all focused on APIs.</p>
<p>During my discussions with multiple enterprise developers, analysts, architects and executives, one question seemed to come up a lot:  <strong><em>Didn&rsquo;t we do all of this 10 years ago?  What is different this time around?</em></strong></p>
<p>With a strong focus on the technology of web services, many in the enterprise fail to see the difference between SOA and API.  In an effort to better tell stories in this area, I wanted to revisit the SOAP vs. REST argument, and refresh my thoughts. &nbsp;So I got to work pulling up old stories, and while conducting my research I noticed the same patterns I see in the REST debates--a heavy focus on the technical, with only a few discussions of the business and politics of web services.</p>
<p>If you are new to the SOAP vs. REST debate, let me get you up to speed.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">Wikipedia defines SOAP</a> as:</p>
<blockquote><em>SOAP, originally defined as Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of Web Services in computer networks. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em> SOAP was designed as an object-access protocol in 1998 by Dave Winer, Don Box, Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein for Microsoft, with a specification of SOAP currently maintained by the XML Protocol Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>After SOAP was first introduced, it became the underlying layer of a more complex set of Web Services, based on Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI). </em></blockquote>
<p>SOAP, XML and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Service">Web Services</a> are all part of earlier approach to APIs which is widely considered to be called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a> (SOA).  While SOA is still used in enterprise environments, it is considered in open developer circles to have been a failure in comparison to API efforts in the more grassroots, popular web API approach employed by companies like Flickr, Twitter and Amazon.</p>
<p>I will spare you much of technical detail of the SOAP vs. REST debate, but the the main advantages of a web API approach are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Simple and Lightweight</li>
<li>Human Readable Results</li>
<li>Easy to Build and Consume</li>
</ul>
<p>The SOAP advantages are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Rigid, Well Defined and Adhering to a Contract</li>
<li>Wide Variety of Development tools</li>
<li>Agreed Upon Standard</li>
</ul>
<p>SOAP is a very well defined, strict technical, industry defined set of rules for approaching APIs.  To the enterprise, SOAP and a SOA approaches appears to be the proper solution for the exchange of structured information.</p>
<p>But around 2003, outside the enterprise, we started seeing a shift in how developers viewed web services.  According to <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3005">Tim O&rsquo;Reilly of O&rsquo;Reilly Media</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>Amazon has both SOAP and REST interfaces to their web services, and 85% of their usage is of the REST interface. Despite all of the corporate hype over the SOAP stack, this is pretty compelling evidence that developers like the simpler REST approach. </em></blockquote>
<p>Over the course of the next nine years we see this trend continue with <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/1-in-5-apis-say-bye-xml/">REST + JSON</a> growing in dominance, wrestling control over web services and the term API from a more SOAP + XML approach.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/enterprise-business-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>After re-reading much of the SOAP vs. REST debate this weekend, I see the same as with the REST debate, where much of the discussion is technical.  But there are some great statements on what contributee to the success of API over SOA.  From <a href="http://supunk.blogspot.com/2012/08/rest-vs-soap-adoption-perspective.html">Supun Kamburugamuva on Life of a Software Engineer blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>REST as a framework gives the developers exactly that. The freedom to innovate. Developers love that. As a framework REST introduces very few rules. Most of them are not even rules. Rather they are soft guidelines. So building a proper powerful REST API is an Art and a challenging task. In my opinion this makes it cool. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>This is completely opposite to SOAP. SOAP gives the developer all the rules. First thing about SOAP is you get a SOAP envelope where you have to put your data according to some rules. So from start to end the system is pretty well defined. There are standards for doing even the simplest things. Top of all this SOAP is very complex to understand. So in my opinion SOAP doesn't give user the nuts and bolts to innovate. Instead it gives a half baked solution that user has to obey. I guess not all developers like to bog down by rules and they don't like to learn that kind of rules as well.</em></blockquote>
<p>Martijn Linssen at&nbsp;CloudAve also had a great statement:</p>
<blockquote><em>SOAP was originally introduced to and by Microsoft, and was one in a range of futuristic machine-to-machine self-describing protocols. Needless to say, the world wasn&rsquo;t ready then, nor is it now. Current implementations of SOAP are arbitrary, proprietary, bi-lateral human agreements at best. In their worst form, SOAP implementations are dictated by governments and other bodies of power and bring nothing else to the other party but a cumbersome and hard-coupled interface</em></blockquote>
<p>In my opinion SOAP vs. REST is about Structure vs. Simplicity, Defined vs. Organic, Control vs. Open.  The differences aren&rsquo;t just technical.  As technologists we like to see things through a certain lense, add in capitalists and we can really have our blinders on.</p>
<p>There are a lot of lessons in the modern web API movement that the enterprise can learn from.  SOA and API have a lot of parallels in trying to facilitate the exchange of structured information between applications, but where they begin to differ is that SOA was born within industry and within an enterprise.  API was born on the open Internet, where it was able to get the oxygen it needed to grow.</p>
<p>My advice to the enterprise is when you look at adopting a web API approach over SOA approach, you look beyond just the technology and vendor solutions--you need to look at a lot of the more human elements that exist in the business and politics of APIs.  Consider essential elements like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Keep things small, modular and intuitive</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong> - You should be widening access to your resources, not ever limiting</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong> -  While not everything should be 100% open, be as open as possible</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - Provide insight into operations and your roadmap allowing consumers to operate in alignment</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - Two way communication between you and your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Protect the privacy of your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong> - Be open to alternative licensing and ownership of content and data that is favorable to consumers</li>
<li><strong>Legal</strong> - Be as open as you can be with copyright, patents and trademark in API initiatives</li>
<li><strong>Terms</strong> - Establish terms of use that favor your business, but also the interests of consumers</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - Acknowledge the monetization needs of your consumers</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the key ingredients in the grassroots recipe that so many companies are following when deploying web APIs.  A balance of technical, business and politics has been found and is currently being explored in the web API movement. You can see examples of both success and failure in these areas, with APIs like Amazon and Twitter. Both API providers have found success technologically, but took different approaches to business and politics, delivering very different results within their respective developer ecosystems.</p>
<p>There is a reason web APIs have found success on the open Internet.  Web APIs require a certain amount of &ldquo;open&rdquo; to be present in not just the technical, but also the business and political layers.  When embracing APIs,  make sure you understand the full scope of why API is different than SOA--then internalize this difference and make it part of how you conduct business internally, with partners and the public on the open Internet.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://hackweekends.com/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hackweekends/Tag-Cloud-Hack-Weekends-Github.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been maintaining a calendar of hackathons for all of 2012.  Originally it was just a section off of <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, but eventually the site needed to be its own project.  Up until now its just been a blog and calendar of events I curate from Eventbrite, Twitter, Google, Eventful and event organizers.</p>
<p>I spend about 8-12 hours a week curating the events and stories for blog posts, and with the increase in the number hackathons over 2012, so does the time I need to maintain.  I was adding an API so other users can add to calendar or event guest post, then I decided I would like to also have databases of hackathon organizers, sponsors, vendors, venues and other key building blocks of hackathons.</p>
<p>My goal is to create an information hub for the hackathon community.  But an &ldquo;open API&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t seem like enough.  I wanted everything about it to be open and accessible, as well as community owned.  I decided to publish&nbsp;<a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com/index.html">Hack Weekends on Github</a> and run it like an open source project.</p>
<p>I launched the site using <a title="Github Pages" href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> with <a title="Jekyll" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.  These run the pages and blog for Hack Weekends. &nbsp;But, I needed something to run the calendar, and other systems.   I wanted them to be simple--I went with <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> + JSON stores.</p>
<p>The implementation isn't perfect.   I had problems getting search and sort tools to work, so I scaled back to a minimal viable implementation.  I got the following areas up:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Hackathon Calendar </strong>- Listing of hackathons global, sorted by city (for now)</li>
<li><strong>Cities Hackathon Directory</strong> - Breakdown of hackathons by cities</li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends Blog</strong> - Blog running on Jekyll, which I edit using prose.io</li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends News </strong>- Curated, relevant hackathon links from my pinboard</li>
</ul>
<p>I will get all the bells and whistles in there soon. Before that, I&rsquo;m working on a basic Github template for planning and executing a basic hackathon.  I would like to see hackathon organizers using a common, open approach to planning and delivering hackathons around the globe.  I&rsquo;m hoping it will work in conjunction with an open approach to Hack Weekends and other hackathon community sites.</p>
<p>Hack Weekends is a work in progress.  I went ahead and made it live, as its about 85% of what I had on the previous version.  Having it running as a completely client-side and static site on Github will force me to learn to approaches to manage my content and data in a way that is open and machine readable by default. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to fork <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends">Hack Weekends</a> and make contributions. &nbsp;You can add blog posts, news or calendar events. &nbsp;I will be building other client side tools for interacting with the site as time goes on. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of speaking at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> in Paris, France this week.  The organizers originally asked me to do one talk, but after some speaker shuffle, I ended up with three separate talks on APIs.</p>
<p>The second talk I did at API Days was <a title="The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal" href="/talks/apidays/internal-apis/" target="_blank">The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal</a>. &nbsp;This material was evolved from past stories I've done on <a title="Amazon" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon's</a> and <a title="Netflix" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/20/apis-power-netflix%E2%80%99s-move-to-cloud-enabling-world-domination/">Netflix's</a> success with internal APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I really want to tell more stories about other companies who have had success with internal APIs. But these are the hardest stories to come by, and I feel they are some of the most important API stories we can tell. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a great internal API story you'd like to tell, I love to hear more. &nbsp;Feel free to email or DM on Twitter, and we can figure out the best format to tell your story.</p>

<p>The organizers of <a href="http://apidays.io/">APIs Days</a> asked me at the last moment if I'd like to do a third talk at the European API event, due to last minute cancellations. &nbsp;Of course, I jumped on the opportunity to generate to material and work through it in front of a live audience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The talk was on <a href="/admin/blog/Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up" target="_blank">business models for your API as a start-up</a>. &nbsp;On the plane ride over I reviewed <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmusser/j-musser-apishotnotgluecon2012" target="_blank">John Musser's great material on API business models</a>, and prepared a walk through, from a startup's perspective. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then after watching Guillaume Ballas (<a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebalas">@guillaumebalas</a>) from 3Scale give his talk&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323" target="_blank">APIs for Biz Dev 2.0, Which Business Model?</a> &nbsp;And watching other speakers I decide to scrap what I had put together, and went an entirely different direction.</p>
<p>I decide to walk through the evolution of an imaginary startup, keeping in mind 3Scale's philosphy that:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 35px;">
<p>Let's not ask what business model for my API.You should be deploying an API for your business model. @<a href="https://twitter.com/3scale">3scale</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebalas">guillaumebalas</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23apidays">#apidays</a></p>
&mdash; Kin Lane (@kinlane) <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/status/275622596689661954">December 3, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Then I walked through what I would consider a robust, healthy startup business model with five tiers:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15473323" width="342" height="291" align="right"> </iframe></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Free users</li>
<li>Paid users</li>
<li>Free developers</li>
<li>Paid developers</li>
<li>Partners</li>
<li>Incubation</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this approach isn't for every startup. &nbsp;I highly recommend checking out 3Scale's presentation if you want to better understand <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323">which API business model is right for your startup</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell the story of how you could apply some or all of the monetization strategies outlined by John Musser in his work, while also listening to Guillaume from <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>.</p>
<p>The talk is rooted in my research on the <a title="Business of Twitter's API" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Business of Twitter's API</a> and experience I've had in the field consulting and building strategies with existing API owners.</p>
<p>You can view the presentation of my <a title="Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up" href="/talks/apidays/business-models/" target="_blank">Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up</a>, and I believe the session was video taped so I'm sure there will be video coming soon.</p>

As I always do, I omitted some slides and evolved my presentation a little further. &nbsp;This is one benefit of using <a title="reveal.js" href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a>, driven from the API Evangelist database--I can evolve my content and make better with each talk.</p>

<p>It was interesting to talk through my <a title="API Building Blocks" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building block</a> approach with API owners in France, after giving my talk. &nbsp;I learned a lot by talking with folks there. &nbsp;And I really think Europe has huge opportunity in front of it, when it comes to the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-days-paris-france/api-days-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I got back last night from France, where I spent the week at the #APIDays conference, billed as the first international event on APIs in Europe.  The two day event was organized <span>by&nbsp;</span><a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a><span>, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and by</span><a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">WebShell</a><span>, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs</span></p>
<p>After some scheduling shuffling due to speaker cancellations API Days asked me if I&rsquo;d do three talks on APIs, instead of just my one--resulting in these three presentations:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Building Blocks (Bricks) For Your Developer Portal" href="/2012/12/07/building-blocks-bricks-for-your-developer-portal-apidays/" target="_blank">Building Blocks (Bricks) For Your Developer Portal</a></li>

<p>While the building blocks presentation is my usual material (but needs to be told over and over to new audiences), the other two talks represents entirely new work based upon other stories and research I&rsquo;ve done in the past.</p>
<p>I learned a lot while at API Days.  It was about 200 people, discussing APIs over the course of two days.  I was really impressed with the passion everyone had for APIs and the genuine interest in understand the essence of the web API movement--discussing ideas, philosophies and approach rather than just the technology of APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://webshell.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-days-paris-france/webshell-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I feel an awakening occurring in Europe right now in regards to APIs.  My Twitter has lit up in the past three months with new European based followers focusing on APIs, and flood of new requests for discussions and information about APIs.</p>
<p>With a very healthy stance on transparency, privacy and data ownership I think the EU has an excellent opportunity to become a major player in the <a title="API Economy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>, and I predict good things to come out of not just France, but other EU countries in 2013.</p>
<p>I look forward to getting back soon, and talking APIs!</p>

<p>I read a great post recently about how a company called <a href="http://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/4979/Start-Up-Offers-Blueprints-For-3D-Printed-Parts.aspx">Teenage Engineering has started providing 3D CAD files that allow their customers to 3D print replacement parts</a> for the products they make.</p>
<p>It is awesome to see things I talk about become reality. &nbsp;I wrote about the concept of a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/08/01/my-3d-printed-junk-drawer/">3D printed junk drawer</a> last year, while doing research on 3D printing and APIs.</p>
<p>Teenage Engineering is taking a big step, and potentially leading the industry in new ways. &nbsp;Can you imagine if companies by default, provide 3D drawings of common replacement parts and pieces for their products?</p>
<p>There is still a lot of gaps in how all of this can work, 3D printing is widely available yet, but with retailers like <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/staples-3d-print-mcor-iris,19447.html">Staples playing around with offering 3D printing on demand</a>, the future for 3D printing is looking pretty bright.</p>

<p>There was a great post last week on <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> from Curtis C. Chen (<a href="https://twitter.com/sparCKL">@sparCKL</a>), on how a company called <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/11/22/spectragram-is-a-gateway-to-instagram-api/">Spectagram has launched a new JavaScript library built on top of </a><a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://lab.adrianquevedo.com/jquery-spectragram/">Spectagram</a> uses JQuery to provide a basic set of embeddable tools for Instagram allowing users to embed widgets showing latest photos, popular photos, and photos by tag.</p>
<p>Instagram has been notoriously focused on their core product, which leaves a lot of areas open to its developer community.  Even the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/">first version of the Instagram</a> API was created by a passionate developer.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see such a sophisticated Javascript library developed by a developer, essentially rolling out something <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a> should be doing themselves, but obviously haven&rsquo;t prioritized.  Something I&rsquo;m sure many API owners would love to have happen in their communities.</p>

<p>I conducted two workshops this week in partnership with Intel at the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas.  Working from my <a href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">Building Blocks of a Successful API</a> material, I put together a 30 minute workshop that I conducted at 12 and 6PM on Tuesday.</p>
<p>My workshop started with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=History">history of APIs</a>, then walked through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a> in 3 areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API Design&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Development&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Evangelist</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I stepped back and emphasized that APIs are all about research &amp; development and business development for your company.</p>
<p>After stepping back, I looked into whats next with APIs with API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, API automation platforms like <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTT</a> and new API programming libraries like <a href="http://webshell.io">Webshell</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of my talk was to plant a few seeds in attendee&rsquo;s mind:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs Are More Than Tech&nbsp;</li>
<li>APIs Require a Business Approach&nbsp;</li>
<li>Politics Can Be Biggest Killer of APIs&nbsp;</li>
<li>Focus Delivering Value</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view the slide deck below for the workshop.  If you&rsquo;d like a custom demo feel free to contact me and we can do a Google Hangout.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://learnsprout.com/#home"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/learnsprout/learnsprout-logo.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I got an email from Anthony Wu over at <a href="http://learnsprout.com/#home">LearnSprout</a> yesterday.  If you are not following what LearnSprout is up to, they are bridging legacy student information systems (SIS) and providing easy to use web APIs that application developers can use to build educational apps.</p>
<p>The email from Anthony was in regards to a SIS LearnSprout was integrating with, which he said:</p>
<blockquote><em>IlluminateEd is the best SIS API we've seen so far!   Clean &amp; simple. OAuth, JSON, no bullshit. If every SIS did this, we could just move on to greener pastures. This kind of thing should be encouraged!</em></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Anthony. The&nbsp;<a href="https://demo.illuminateed.com/dna/?ApiDocumentation">IlluminateEd API</a>&nbsp;is clean and simple.  They intelligently use common technical API building blocks like oAuth and JSON, while keeping the API interfaces intuitive and meaningful and provide simple, up to date documentation.</p>
<p>My only criticism is simple, and would be about the description for the API:  &ldquo;This API allows third party applications to interact and communicate with the Illuminate system&rdquo;.   This is a classic mistake from API owners.  Unlike Anthony I had no idea what the Illuminate system is.  I can assume its a SIS, but they should really make it a little more description for newcomers.</p>
<p>Even though the API isn&rsquo;t perfect LearnSprout says it is better than:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Humans as APIs (i.e. office secretary mashup with Excel)</li>
<li>CSV as APIs (the status quo)</li>
<li>Screen Scraping as APIs (for some, the ends justify the means&hellip;)</li>
<li>Legacy DOS terminal emulation</li>
</ul>
<p>Learsprout sees a lot of different approaches to accessing and sharing data between SIS systems.  They have a lot of value to bring to the industry, and I enjoying telling the story about what they are experiencing.  And I agree with Anthony and this type of effort should be encouraged within the education space.  Nice work <a href="https://www.illuminateed.com/">IlluminateEd</a>.</p>

<p>Right before the Thanksgiving holiday, in an effort to make the Facebook platform more responsive and dependable for developers, <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/11/15/delivering-important-alerts-about-your-app/">Facebook announced Developer Alerts</a>.  Developer alerts are a way for Facebook platform developers to receive critical information about their apps via email or Facebook notification.</p>
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts provide the following for Facebook app administrators:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Breaking Changes </strong>- If your app is using functionality that FB is changing or removing, you will be sent an alert at least 90 days before the change goes into effect</li>
<li><strong>App Status Changes</strong> - If you have submitted Open Graph actions or created an app detail page for App Center, FB will use Developer Alerts to notify you when the status of your submission changes</li>
<li><strong>Policy Violations and Enforcement -</strong> If your app doesn&rsquo;t adhere to FB Platform Policies you will be notified through these alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts are more than notifications, it is an issue management system which will allow multiple developers on a project to known when action is required or things have been resolved.</p>
<p>It seems like a great approach to improving communications between API platforms and its API application developers.  I think I will add platform alerts as an official API building block, and recommend it as something API should consider when developing their platform.</p>

<p>Poster boy for how to properly run your API ecosystem properly, <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, recently updated their <a href="http://www.twilio.com/doers">DOer Gallery</a> to highlight developers in the Twilio ecosystem that build cool stuff on the popular voice and SMS API.</p>
<p>Twilio has the best record I&rsquo;ve seen of any API, when it comes to showcasing and being loved by their developer community, and I'm sure the DOer Gallery plays an important role in that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twilio.com/doers"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/twilio/twilio-doers-gallery.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The Twilio DOer Gallery has the following features:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Personal Details</li>
<li>Short Bio</li>
<li>Skills</li>
<li>Other Profiles</li>
<li>Projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Devloper Galleries like Twilios might not be for every API platform.  But if you have a passionate base of developers you might want to consider giving them their own profile and a gallery where they can not just discover and interact with each other, it can let other companies find potential developers to execute projects via your API.</p>
<p>A Developer Gallery can be a great way to give your API developers some love and attention.  Twilio even features developers from their DOer Gallery on their blog in a "DOer of the Month".</p>
<p>Would showcasing your &ldquo;API DOers&rdquo; benefit your API community?</p>

<p>In 2012 the number of APIs has grown significantly.  We are transitioning from &ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t enough APIs&rdquo; to &ldquo;how do we more intelligently use many APIs&rdquo;.  As I track on this and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of web APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m noticing growth in the number of API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I was introduced <a title="Adigami" href="http://www.adigami.com/">Adigami</a>, a "Singly for Analytics".  While Singly focuses on personal data API aggregation, Adigami is focused on <a title="aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today" href="http://www.adigami.com/">aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today</a>--covering seven key channels:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adigami.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/adigami/adigami-data-visual.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web</strong> - Google Analytics</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - Google AdWords, Microsoft Bing</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - DoubleClick, Yahoo! APT, Facebook Ads, MediaMind</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Facebook Insights, Twitter</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Yahoo! Mobile, Verve Wireless</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> - MailChimp, SendGrid, ConstantContact, ExactTarget</li>
<li><strong>Custom</strong> - Adigami can import proprietary data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating your business on the Internet or "in the cloud" is a reality, and as we operate more and more in this cloud, each platform will have its own set of analytics--making the need to centralize and standardize analytics across channels and platforms more and more critical.</p>
<p>Adigami is just the tip of the iceberg.  I predict we&rsquo;ll see API aggregators emerge from top industries like government, healthcare and education.  In 2013 we will learn to more fluently communicate with web APIs with the help of API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a title="Adigami" href="http://www.adigami.com/">Adigami</a>.</p>

<p>The legal building blocks of an API can be just as critical as the technical and business building blocks.  It makes sense to version and communicate your API terms of use (TOS) , privacy policy and branding guidelines alongside your code.</p>
<p>Since Github will allow document types other than code, such as markdown and PDF, it can make sense to use Github for managing the legal side of your API.</p>
<p>Using Github for the legal aspects of API operation will provide a level of transparency developers will appreciate, allowing them to download and store for their own records while being able to see the difference between each version, in a format that makes sense to them.</p>
<p>Just as with all other areas of an API, Github will allow you to completely manage the evolution of your API terms, privacy and branding in a way that is in sync with all the other technical and business building blocks of your API.</p>
<p>Consider using Github for API legal building block management.</p>

<p>I am heading to Paris, France next week for <a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>.  API Days is December 3rd and 4th in Paris and is dubbed as the <em>"First National Event on APIs in Europe"</em>.   The two day event is organized by <a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a>, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and by <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">WebShell</a>, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>&nbsp;sees the API economy the same way I do:</p>
<blockquote><em>The Web 1.0 was readable, the Web 2.0 was social, now the web is programmable through application programming interfaces, aka APIs. Web APIs are a unique opportunity for companies, governments and developers to either better organize the governance of their IT into a scalable and flexible model, either leverage a complete ecosystem around the organization, exchanging data through the web for trillion of applications on billion devices. Because each civilization has been described by the way it communicates and make exchanges, API are the beginning of a programmable civilization.</em></blockquote>

<p>The API event is hosting over 50 sessions from over 30 speakers--including two of my own talks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The Secret to a Successful API is Internal</li>
<li>Business models for your API as a start-up</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see APIs getting interest in Europe.  And after working with the Webshell team for several months and learning more about FaberNovel, I'm excited to be working with both of them to drive API adoption in Europe.</p>
<p>If you are planning on going to <a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>, let me know and I&rsquo;ll make time to talk.  If you aren&rsquo;t, I will publish more info about the event and my talks here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, when it is all wrapped up.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chartboost/Chartboost-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The team over at <a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank">Chartboost</a> have a pretty forward thinking <a href="http://blog.chartboost.com/post/36221629171/web-3-0-help-site?hn">blog post about what they see as the next generation of web application development</a>.</p>
<p>They feel that the future is about creating web applications, not sites.  The server side should be an API and the client should be a self-contained app which uses the API as its back-end.  With mobile applications following the same pattern.</p>
<p>To practice what they preach, Charboost is overhauling their help site to be an API driven web app using the following approach:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Push State</strong> - Provide site navigation without page refreshes by faking navigation and inserting JavaScript callbacks</li>
<li><strong>JSON-API </strong>- A REST API providing JSON to drive the site</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Design </strong>- Providing an application design that responds to mobile as well as it does laptops or desktop computers</li>
<li><strong>Vector (Icon Fonts &amp; CSS)</strong> - Using a combination of icon fonts and CSS3 to deliver the UI. SCSS - A new technology that uses CSS-preprocessing to make the CSS code cleaner and res-usable</li>
<li><strong>Markdown</strong> - Using the simple markup language to allow anyone on their team to write and edit help articles</li>
<li><strong>GitHub</strong> - Using Github to manage the help center as an open project</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chartboost/Chartboost-Help-Center-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I agree that their metholody has the potential to be one possible future of web and mobile application development.  JavaScript and API development have both matured in the last 10 years, getting us to this point where you can build some damn sexy, but simple apps that run smoothly on the web or mobile devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Or as Chartboost puts it:</p>
<blockquote><em>We believe that the web is finally reaching a tipping point. The culmination of a decade of incremental improvements to web technologies is upon us, and lets us do things in a way that is radically new and better.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m also playing around with my own approach to delivering apps in this way using Github + Jeckyll + Mustache Templates with JSON data stores, all running as open repositories using Github Pages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have more to publish on this in the near future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-access.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>Social analytics provider&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://www.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr</a>&nbsp;has won a temporary injunction against Twitter today, with a complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court. It reads:</p>
<p><em>PeopleBrowsr seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent Twitter from destroying its business, interfering with PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s contractual and prospective business relations, and restraining competition in markets using Twitter data.</em></p>
<p>The complaint was filed in response to a trheat from Twitter to cut off PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s access to its Firehose by November 30, 201 &nbsp;PeopleBrowsr has had access to the full Twitter full firehose for over four years. According to the complaint:</p>
<p><em>PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s products require the full Firehose feed. A mere sample of Twitter data is insufficient for PeopleBrowsr to provide the products its users expect. Though there are some data analytics companies that can provide certain limited types of Twitter data analysis based on sampling, PeopleBrowsr competes in a separate &ldquo;Twitter Big Data Analytics&rdquo; market, in which a few, highly sophisticated players analyze massive amounts of Twitter data to provide deeper insights.</em></p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s decision to terminate PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s firehose follows a&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">pattern of it consistently cutting off partner and developer access to the platforms and its data</a>. In doing so Twitter&nbsp;has sought more control in their effort to monetize the social networking platform and provide&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/07/22/investment-in-twitter/">investors with a return on their investment of almost 1.4B dollars</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/PeopleBrowsr-logo.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>PeopleBrowsr states that it has &ldquo;invested millions of dollars and years of work in building a business based on the Firehose&rdquo;. It says it did so in rlying on Twitter&rsquo;s representations that it would maintain an &ldquo;open ecosystem&rdquo; and allow other companies to use of its data. Through agreements with Twitter PeopleBrowsr felt it could compete without fear that Twitter would cut off access to its data in order to influence which businesses succeed or to usurp business opportunities for itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Twitter has consistently described</a>&nbsp;the Firehose as a part of this open ecosystem that it would make available to &ldquo;everyone in the system&rdquo;, and this open approach was a key component of Twitter&rsquo;s business strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The injunction PeopleBrowsr received today will keep their firehose access open until January, when further hearings on the case will be held. Until now, all the outcy regarding Twitter&rsquo;s restriction of access to the platform have been vocal, but without any legal action. The filing by PeopleBrowsr shows the situation has truly become serious and will move discussion about Twitter access from the tech blogosphere and hacker news into the U.S legal system.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Those of you who follow my blog, know my favorite API management service provider is <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a>.  It&rsquo;s no secret I&rsquo;m a fan of what they are doing.  We share a vision of the API space and what a healthy API industry <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> look like.</p>
<p>In support of that vision, 3Scale just launched a new open source API proxy build on the <a title="NGINX" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGNIX</a> web server technology--a move, I feel is important for 3Scale, as well as the entire API industry.</p>
<p>What makes 3Scale&rsquo;s approach signficant, is that by deploying the NGNIX proxy, API providers don't need to rely on proprietary API proxy solutions, while also gaining additional benefits, such as acess to a library of 3rd party <a title="addons" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/3rdPartyModules">addons</a> and <a title="modules" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Modules">modules</a> available in the NGNIX ecosystem. All while employing an established technology that has been proven to deliver in highl volume production environments.</p>
<p>In addition to the benefits provided by NGNIX, the proxy provides seamless integration with 3Scale&rsquo;s API management platform that delivers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API business modeling using service contracts, API rate limits and pricing rules</li>
<li>API access control &amp; security with API key generation with user id, app id, oAuth</li>
<li>API analytics &amp; reporting including alerts, statistics, business intelligence</li>
<li>API billing &amp; payments supporting pre-paid, post-paid, PCI compliant, six separate payment gateways</li>
<li>Developer portal for self-service registration and onboarding</li>
<li>Interactive API Documentation for better adoption using Swagger</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-API-Proxy-Admin-Panel.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This list represents everything you will need to get your API up and running.  3Scale enables you to do this both on premise or in the cloud, using a proxy that you cotrol--then alllowing you to choose which 3Scale API management services you need to use.  But what is most important for me, is 3Scale allows you start off without spending any money.  3Scale has a free, entry level tier that will allow you to design, experiment and iterate until you find the meaningful API definition that works for your developers--at which time you can scale, paying for only what you need, as you grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach is critical to success of individual APIs as well as the overall health of the API industry.  We need to allow companies to innovate without spending a fortune, give up control of their data, and being locked into unnecessary commitments--allowing the industry to go from thousands of APIs to millions of APIs as quickly as possible.</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;As of today this makes 3scale the API Management solution provider with the richest and most flexible set of technical options to manage API traffic,&rdquo; said Guillaume Balas, 3scale CMO. &ldquo;At 3scale we want companies with great and valuable APIs to be able to distribute them easily, rapidly, without hampering the economics of their API project and without disrupting their existing infrastructure: this what 3scale&rsquo;s API Management solution provides.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The 3Scale approach is in aligment with my industry philosophy, that we shouldn&rsquo;t stand in the way of API providers with costly, proprietary proxies.  We should leverage existing, proven, open technologies like NGINX to allow API providers to deploy wherever their infrastructure exists, either in the datacenter or the cloud--while enabling them to &ldquo;connect&rdquo; to the best of breed API management services, which allow them to scale, grow and evolve their API ecosystem in the healthiest way possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/State-Healthcare-Insurance-Exchanges.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was listening to a story about <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/165057222/nevada-quietly-starts-implementing-obamacare">Nevada quietly starting their implementation of health insurance exchanges</a>, as part of what everyone loves to call Obamacare.  I&rsquo;m not even going to get involved in the politics and merit of making sure everyone is insured--I want to focus on the execution of it.</p>
<p>Immediately I think:  <em><strong>Where is the state health insurance exchange platform API?</strong></em></p>
<p>According to healthcare.gov an exchange is:</p>
<blockquote><em> A mechanism for organizing the health insurance marketplace to help consumers and small businesses shop for coverage in a way that permits easy comparison of available plan options based on price, benefits and services, and quality.  By pooling people together, reducing transaction costs, and increasing transparency, Exchanges create more efficient and competitive markets for individuals and small employers.</em></blockquote>
<p>And the principles and priorities of state health insurance exchanges are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Establishing a State-based Exchange</strong> - Establishment of an Exchange is a critical step that States must take to be on track for achieving certification of an Exchange by January 1, 2013 under Section 1321. </li>
<li><strong>Promoting Efficiency </strong>- Exchanges must be mindful of costs for consumers, employers, and the federal government. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Adverse Selection</strong> - Successful Exchanges will avoid adverse selection by ensuring that those who buy through the Exchange are a broad mix of the healthy and the less healthy.</li>
<li>Streamlined Access and Continuity of Care.  Section 1311(d)(4)(F) requires Exchanges to evaluate and determine eligibility for applicants in Medicaid, the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and other health programs - Exchanges must also comply with all applicable federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination.  The federal government will provide critical building blocks and financial support for achieving an efficient enrollment process including verification of&nbsp;eligibility for tax credits.</li>
<li>Public Outreach and Stakeholder Involvement - Section 1311(d)(6) requires Exchanges to consult with a broad range of stakeholders in carrying out their activities.</li>
<li>Public Accountability and Transparency - Accountability requires transparency.  Section 1311(d)(7) requires public reports on Exchange activities, and Section 1311(e)(3) requires additional reporting, which should include standardized data reporting on price, quality, benefits, consumer choice and other factors that will help measure and evaluate performance. </li>
<li>Financial Accountability - Section 1313 provides for the efficient and non-discriminatory administration of Exchanges, and seeks to prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are going to successfully implement 50 state health insurance exchanges that meet the definition, principles and priorities of the federal government objectives, you will need an open source platform, complete with a robust API strategy.  Maybe it exists, and I&rsquo;m unaware of it.</p>
<p>If you know more about current initiatives in this area, please let me know.</p>

<p>Hackathons are a fertile environment for generating code based upon the ideas of its attendees.  However, much of the innovative programming that occurs at these events is forgotten the day after the event ends.  This process tends to leave developers working on the same ideas over and over, without much continuity.</p>
<p>To help remedy this, hackathon organizers can use Github to store code that is generated by all attendees. Organizers can encourage all developers to commit their code through-out the hackathon, and wrap up the event with a README file of their project as part of the presentation process.</p>
<p>Github can be a great way to showcase what was built over the weekend, make the intellectual property open and accessible for other people to use, and make it easier for other hackathon participants to build off what has already been created in the past.</p>
<p>Using Github for a hackathon can generate extra marketing for the event as well as the hackathon organizers.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the success of the web API movement lies in the ability to extend, potentially complex resources in a very simplistic and universal way.  So, as an evangelism I have to abstract away the complexities and make sure I connect with my audience.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m tracking on the API space and working to quantify the potential future of APIs, I&rsquo;m struggling to find meaningful analogies to articulate where API driven platforms like Singly are moving the industry.  But just as with the technology, leave it to the Singly team to do this for me.</p>
<p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> made a slight shift in their branding recently, using the words <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API Fabric</span></strong></em> in the description of what they do.  This seems like a slight change, but it truly is an exceptional way to describe the Singly approach to app development using social authentication and data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance, to a non technical person, fabric may be defined as:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>fab&middot;ric/Ëfabrik/</strong> Noun: Cloth, typically produced by weaving or knitting textile fibers</em></blockquote>
<p>With synonyms being cloth, material, structure, textile, texture and web. Using this definition of fabric as the source for my analogy can work by itself.  It can help a non-technical person understand what is possible when you can quickly begin weave together apps using different APIs--visualizing some sort of woven textile, with unique meaning.  Immediately helping anyone, visually relate to the potential when developing on top of social and personal APIs.</p>

<p>If you are more technical, the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; might help you understand Singly at another level. In information technology, fabric is a synonym for the words framework or platform.  In general, the term fabric can describe the way different parts of something work together to form a single entity.  Fabric can be used as a metaphor to illustrate the idea that if someone were to document computer components and their relationships on paper, the lines would weave back and forth so densely that the diagram would resemble a woven piece of cloth.</p>
<p>Bringing us back full circle to the visualization potentially related to non-developers.  The word fabric has deep meaning through our personal worlds, it might be your favorite jeans, blanket the uniform you wear to work every day.  APIs are fast being woven into every aspect of our lives, and the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; is an excellent way to relate what API providers like Singly are doing with specific groups of APIs, like personal and social data APIs.</p>
<p>Our sometimes very personal data and sometimes very public social data is fast becoming fabric of our daily personal and work worlds on the Internet and our mobile devices.  We are going to need to provide ways of assuring developers can build the most powerful, meaningful apps possible--by weaving together the best of breed data and resources into a strong API fabric!</p>
