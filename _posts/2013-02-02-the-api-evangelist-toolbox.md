{% include JB/setup %}<p>Ive spent a lot of time lately looking for new tools that will help you plan, develop, deploy and manage APIs. My goal is to keep refining the API Evangelist Tool section to provide complete API tool directory you can filter by language or other tag.  Ive added a number of open source tools to my database lately. But I know there are many more out  there. So I put out on the Twitterz that I was looking for anything that is missing.</p>
