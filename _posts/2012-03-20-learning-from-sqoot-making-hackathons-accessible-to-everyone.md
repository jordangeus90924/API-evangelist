{% include JB/setup %}<p>Boston API Jam organizer Sqoot just got themselves into a lot of hot water with some very sexist comments on their hackathon home page (now removed): From what I can tell, Sqoot was called out by @BoazSender: Then the pressure quickly was put on in the Twittershpere: Resulting in Apigee pulling their sponsorship: And Heroku pulling theirs as well: Sqoot quickly released an apology which included: While we thought this was a fun, harmless comment poking fun at the fact that hack-a-thons are typically male-dominated, others were offended.Their apology definitely summarizes the misogynistic tone of the spreading Silicon Valley startup and hackathon culture.This is a major problem.One of my biggest complaints about many hackathons is that they are male dominated, and this is nothing to joke about, make fun of or take lightly.You donâ€™t realize it when all you do is attend the all boy hackathons and do your bro-gramming.</p>
