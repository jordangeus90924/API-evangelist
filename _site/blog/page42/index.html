        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/08/28/explaining-my-work-around-apis-in-higher-education-to-institutions/">Explaining My Work Around APIs In Higher Education To Institutions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/priorities/university-of-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m needing to quantify the work i do around APIs in higher education for a university in the U.K., so I figured I&rsquo;d craft into a story that I can share with my readers, and potentially other schools who would ask what it is that I do.</p>
<p>I am interested in APIs in higher education because I feel strongly that our institutions are a fertile environment for ensuring that the next generation of our society possess the digital literacy they will need to navigate and find success in our increasingly digital world.</p>
<p>When I mention that higher education institutions should be incorporating APIs into daily operations, most folks immediately think of a very technical, IT directed effort, which is one layer to the discussion that should be considered, but ultimately it is about developing an awareness, and engagement by administration, faculty, and the students with the increasingly public APIs that surround us, as well as internal institutional APIs.</p>
<p>Our personal, and business lives are moving into the cloud. We are increasingly dependent on web-based and mobile applications in many aspects of our lives, and a growing number of these software services have APIs, and API-enabled actions that can be taken by anyone, even non-developers.</p>
<p>My mission as the API Evangelist is to help everyone be aware that APIs exist, and that they are there to assist you in your personal and business life. Which brings me back to higher education institutions being an important place to expose students, and faculty to the benefits of APIs&mdash;in preparation for the increasingly API driven world unfolding around us.</p>
<p>While I pay attention to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">over a 100 categories of APIs</a>, let&rsquo;s take one area, <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=images-stack">photos and images</a>, and use as a backdrop for what I do. I pay attention to over <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=images-stack">25 photo and image APIs</a> that provide image related services for developers, as well as direct access to the popular photo and image platforms we often depend on like Flickr and Instagram.</p>
<p>As the API Evangelist I seek to pay attention to three key layers of the API space.</p>
<p><strong>Technology of APIs - </strong>The geeky detail of how APIs work.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How do I authenticate?</li>
<li>Where do I read data from?</li>
<li>How do I write data?</li>
<li>Where are their code samples in my language?</li>
<li>Where is the WordPress plugin?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business of APIs - </strong>The business profile behind any online service.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How much does the service cost?</li>
<li>What are the limitations of what I can read or write?</li>
<li>What kind of support is available to me?</li>
<li>What are the long term plans of company?</li>
<li>Is the platform and tools well documented?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Politics of APIs -</strong> The often complex politics behind the curtain.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Do I own my data? Do I own my photos?</li>
<li>Can I specify the license for my photos?</li>
<li>What are the security practices?</li>
<li>Do I have control over who access my data (aka oAuth)?</li>
<li>Are code libraries, tools, and other code open sourced?</li>
<li>Are the terms of service easy to understand? Fair?</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are much more than just technology and when you compare platforms like Flickr and Instagram which both act as photo sharing platforms, but have widely different approaches to the technology, business, and politics of each of their APIs. Sometimes it is just small details that can make the difference in whether or not a platform is the right choice or not for any individual or business.</p>
<p>Beyond the technology, business, and politics I also pay attention to a handful of important trends that are growing out of the API space, to support API consumers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com">Realtime</a> -</strong> What options are there to interact in realtime.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How do I send / receive push notifications?</li>
<li>How do I use webhooks to receive updates?</li>
<li>Does this API have a streaming API?</li>
<li>What frameworks are available for real-time delivery?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">Aggregation</a> -</strong> Details on API data and information aggregation.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Can I get all of my images from Flickr, Instagram in a single feed?</li>
<li>Can I publish to one place, and have it syndicate out?</li>
<li>What options do I have for POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">Reciprocity</a> </strong>- Approaches to moving data from one system to another.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Can I migrate all of my flickr images to dropbox?</li>
<li>Can I keep all of my flick, instagram, and other photo sites in sync?</li>
<li>Where is the best place to store my photos?</li>
<li>Can I transform images when moving from location to location?</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just about watching, and monitoring what is going on in the API space, my mission demands that I take what I learn and produce content that everyone else can benefit from. To fulfill this, I take all of my curation, analysis and awareness, and I work to create rich content that is designed for the widest distribution possible:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Short Form -</strong> Blog posts on my primary blogs (apievangelist.com, apivoice.com, api.report, theapistack.com, ipaevangelist.com, and kin lane.com)</li>
<li><strong>Long Form -</strong> White papers and ebooks that get published either public, or in some cases privately for internal organizational distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Presentations -</strong> Walkthroughs, talk presentations, and other interactive content that introduce people to the world of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Videos - </strong>Generating video content, around my research and presentations for publishing to YouTube and other video distribution sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly feel that it isn&rsquo;t enough that I'm doing all of this work online, I&rsquo;m also invested in stimulating in-person conversations in the following formats:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Conversations -</strong> In person, small group conversations with team members about APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Classrooms -</strong> Teaching large, or small classrooms at institutions around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Meetups -</strong> Supporting the creation of, and guest speaking of API focused meetup groups around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Conferences -</strong> I support up to 10 API conferences, while also putting on my global conference on APIs called @APIStrat</li>
</ul>
<p>API evangelism for me is not just about educating developers that APIs exist, it is about bringing awareness to the masses that APIs exist, and they are just the next evolutionary layer of the web that has penetrated almost all aspects of our lives. I focus on bringing an awareness of APIs to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Individuals -</strong> Every citizen. API literacy is like financial literacy, you don&rsquo;t need to understand the entire banking system, but you will need some basic financial literacy to manage your bank account, and credit cards&mdash;the same applies in the API space, you don&rsquo;t need to understand everything about oAuth, but you should know who has access to your bank account, Facebook, and YouTube accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Business -</strong> More business activity is occurring online, and APIs are rapidly making business data and information available to the average business user for use in spreadsheets, mobile and web applications. Basic API literacy is fast becoming a requirement for many business sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Institutions -</strong> Over the last 15 years, many institutions have moved online, establishing a web presence, and connecting with partners, and constituents via the web. Large organizations need to understand how to use APIs to become more resilient, agile, and nimble in an age where much is changing when it comes to how the institutions of yesterday are perceived and stay relevant in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Government - </strong>Our government is required to do more with less, and APIs are the way we are slowly shifting government of all sizes, operate and engage constituents. Federal, state, and local governments are opening up data, making resources available via APis, and shifting the burden of governance to private sector partners, and even the public using APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Helping everyone understand the API undercurrents that are occurring right now all around us, is my mission as the API Evangelist. Everyone needs to understand that APIs exist, and have a basic understanding of how they can put them to use in their personal and business world. This isn&rsquo;t some grand, techno vision being sold from Silicon Valley that I'm looking to sell to universities, this is about what is already happening around us on the web, via our personal mobile devices, our homes, businesses, cars, and much much more. API Evangelist is about helping regular folks see what is happening, understand as much of it sa they can, allowing them to take meaningful action with the context of their lives.</p>
<p>Continuing to bring this higher education API venn diagram tighter, is additional work I&rsquo;m doing with in two very quiet, but extremely important initiatives.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://umw.domains/">Domain of One&rsquo;s Own</a> -</strong> A program occurring at a handful of higher education institutions, where students get their own domain upon entering school, which can be used for their projects throughout their academic career, and even beyond if they choose&mdash;giving each student the gift of web literacy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a> - </strong>A secondary project spun out of Domain of One&rsquo;s Own which is about providing education materials, tools, and other resources for students, and any other individual to map out their online domain, and put together a strategy for reclaiming parts of their digital identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do my work I use my own custom developed internal system, where I aggregate information about over 2500 APIs, 1500 RSS feeds, 2500 Twitter accounts, and 750 Github accounts. From there, all of my short form and long form content, as well as presentations, and other supporting research gets published to <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">75 individual open source research projects managed using Github</a>. My intent is to make sure all of my research, and resulting data is publicly available in open formats, allowing anyone to fork, extend, and expand on what I do.</p>
<p>How can my research help your institution better understand, internalize, and apply APIs?</p>

<p>When it comes to APIs, the quickest way to get an API for your company, organization or government agency is to choose to only use online services that have APIs. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Dropbox, Github, Instagram, Flickr, and many other popular services you already use, all have APIs.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m expanding on my tracking of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment tools</a>, to include deploying APIs via Google Spreadsheets, and to scraping data from websites, I can&rsquo;t help but step back and consider truly what is the easiest way to deploy an API, which really is about choosing to use online services that already have an API--no connecting to your backend systems necessary!</p>
<p>We talk about APIs in the context of developers, using APIs to build applications for end-users, and provide system integrations. What if we talked about it in context of the users, and helping individual users aggregate their APIs into a single, personal API stack?</p>
<p>As Joe or Jane user, I could have my own personal API hub, with code samples, and other resources to understand how to access my APIs. I&rsquo;m not sure how oAuth would be triggered in this scenario (needs more thought), if a developer wanted access to my Facebook or other private data, but if I ran WordPress, and included my Flickr photos in my API stack, API access could be pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Thinking of this in the context of enabling personal API hubs is a pretty far out there concept, but understanding that you can have an isntant API just by using common services that have APIs, is pretty powerful. In reality, the average person will rarely ever need a personal developer hub with a stack of APIs, but if we teach people that they need an API with all the service they use, so they can use services like Zapier, and the other API-enabled tools, we might just be able to keep SaaS providers honest, ensuring they always public APIs, transparency and data portability for end-users.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-excel-icon.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on the usage of spreadsheets in conjunction with APIs for several years now. Spreadsheets are everywhere, they are the number one data management tool in the world, and whether API developers like or not, spreadsheets will continue to collide with the API space, as both API providers, and consumers try to get things done using APIs.</p>
<p>APIs are all about getting access to the resources you need, and spreadsheets are being used by both API providers and consumers to accomplish these goals. It makes complete sense to me that business users would be looking for solutions via spreadsheets, as they are one potential doorway to hacking for the average person&mdash;writing macros, calculations, and other dynamic features people execute within the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I know IT would like to think their central SQL, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and other database are where the valuable data and content assets are stored at a company, but in reality the most valuable data resources are often stored in spreadsheets across an organization. When it comes time to deploying APIs, this is the first place you should look for your datasources, resulting in Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet to API solutions like we&rsquo;ve seen from <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing spreadsheets used by companies to deploy APIs in some of the following ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Microsoft Excel - </strong>Turning Microsoft Excel spreadsheets directly into APIs. by taking a spreadsheet, and generating an API is the fastest way to go from closed data resource to an API for anyone to access, even without programming experience.</li>
<li><strong>Google Spreadsheet -</strong> Mounting public and private Google Spreadsheets is an increasingly popular way to publish smaller datasets as APIs. Since Google Spreadsheets is web-based, it becomes very easy to use the Google Spreadsheet API to access any Spreadsheet in a Google account, then generate a web API interface that can allow for reading or writing to a spreadsheet data source via a public, or privately secured API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond deploying APIs I&rsquo;m seeing API providers provide some innovative ways for users to connect spreadsheets to their APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Client -</strong> Electronic parts search API Octopart has been providing a bill of materials (BOM) solution via <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">Microsoft Excel</a>, and now <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/25/ocotoparts-open-source-google-spreadsheet/">Google Spreadsheets</a>&nbsp;for their customers--providing a distributed parts catalog in a spreadsheet, that is kept up to date via public API.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Cache -</strong> I&rsquo;ve talked with U.S. Census and other data providers about how they provide Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet caches of API driven data, allowing users to browse, search and establish some sort of subset of data, then save as a spreadsheet cache for offline use. </li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Catch-All -</strong> Spreadsheets aren&rsquo;t always being used just about data, you can see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/route-sms-messages-to-google-spreadsheets-via-twilio-api-with-twiliosheet/">Twilio storing SMS</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/13/using-excel-for-crowdsourced-data-gathering-and-reporting/">NPR using as crowdsourced engine</a>, making spreadsheets into a nice bucket for catching just about anything an API can input or output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving out of the realm of what API providers can do for their API consumers with spreadsheets, and into the world of what API consumers can do for themselves, you start to see endless opportunities for API integration with spreadsheets using reciprocity providers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a> - </strong>There are five pages of recipes on the popular API reciprocity provider Zapier that allow you to work with Google Docs, and 57 pages that are dealing directly with Google Drive, providing a wealth of tools that non-developers (or developers) can use when connecting common APIs up to Google Spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen enough movement in the area of Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheets being used with APIs to warrant closer monitoring. To support this I've started publishing most of my research to an <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist spreadsheet research site</a>, which will allow me to better track, curate, tag, and tell stories around spreadsheets and APIs.</p>
<p>As I do with my <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ API research projects</a>, I will update this site when I have time, publishing anything I've read, written, and companies I think are doing interesting things spreadsheets and APIs. I'm pretty convinced that spreadsheets will be another one of those bridge tools we use to connect where we are going with APIs, with the reality of where the everyday person is, just trying to get their job done.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.jivesoftware.com/">Enterprise social API Jive Software</a> wins for the best developer landing page. Normally I tell folks, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/the-speed-of-federal-government-when-it-runs-on-github/">like I did with Trade.gov last week</a>, that your landing page should have a short, precise description of what you API does&mdash;this is some seriously valuable real estate, and you have one chance to make an impression.</p>
<p>I would put Jive Software into the category of more making a first impression, than providing a short description of what the API does:</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.jivesoftware.com/"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/jive-software/brew-up-something-awesome.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this approach for every API provider, but if you can do it right, and make a solid first impression&mdash;run with it! As an <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, and <a href="http://ipaevangelist.com">IPA Evangelist</a>, I can seriously get behind a message like &ldquo;brew up something awesome&rdquo;. +1</p>
<p>I like how they have apps, docs, APIs, and IPAs as taps, and the taps even work when you mouseover!  Seriously, all of this API shit is hard to make entertaining (trust me I know), and when you can provide this human touches while inciting innovation, they can go a long way in breaking the ice with consumers.</p>
<p>Right above the taps Jive Software provides the essential getting started, and register links for their APIs, which signals that beyond the fun facade, they mean business, and want to help you onboard with using their APIs. I haven&rsquo;t dug deep into the Jive Software API to see what else is going on, but after this first impression it is likely I will be looking around more, now that they made a good first impression.</p>

        <p><a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-shipping-container.png" alt="" width="290" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/">Containers</a> are a fast growing trend when it comes to delivering compute resources online. Reflecting the world of API design, I feel containers are about deploying exactly the cloud resources you will need to complete a specific compute objective, then putting everything into a single virtualized container definition, that can be forked, clone, scaled, and evolved indpendently of any other resources. Each individual container posesses everything it will need from the operating system, file system, database, necessary libraries, and APIs to accomplish its given objective.</p>
<p>Virtual containers will make API driven resources even more agile, nimble and scalable--not just for providers, but also for consumers. Everything we have right now I would consider to be a retail API market&mdash;where even though APIs are often sold B2B, they are generally a one-size fits all API solution. Think about when API resources become modular, customizable, scalable, wholesale resources that can be bought and sold, and deployed anywhere, making all digital assets into commodities that are ready for use anywhere in the API economy.</p>
<p>My goal is to understand how APIs and containers work together, and as I do with all of my research <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/">I setup a Github repo</a> for tracking every piece of container news I read that I feel is relevant, each company doing interesting things containers, tools for working with containers, and ultimately my analysis. Cloud computing will continue to be the lead driver of innovation in the API space, and I feel the introduction of cloud computing in 2006&ndash;2008 gave legitimacy to web APIs&mdash;you could now deploy global infrastructure using web APIs, game on. I think containerization will take API design, deployment, management and integration to the next phase, and closer the early visions of a programmable web we all started envisioning around 2005.</p>
<p>I will be taking each of my API designs, and <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">developing an Amazon Machine Image, Heroku App version, as well as a docker container definition</a>. I want every one of my open source API designs to have the option to be deployed in any cloud environment, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/23/push-button-api-deployment-with-the-heroku-button/">preferable with the click of a button, as with Heroku</a>. In the future it won&rsquo;t about knowing about all the APIs, it will be about having the right stack of APIs, that you can deploy anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p>I will be talking on this subject at <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">@APIStrat in Chicago this September</a>, and also at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag in Colorado this November</a>, let me know if you want to connect around the subject.</p>

<p>I have been doing a lot of research into the world of financial APIs, specifically looking at some of the larger companies providing APIs that deliver market news, data, corporate profiles, and other data that make markets go round.</p>
<p>As I consider some of the common building blocks that are common across many financial API--real-time data frameworks, and visualization tools are two of the top items that I think will be part of every financial API stack in the future. Almost every API I looked at had some sort of real-time stream, promising data faster, as well as a way to extract meaning from these streams using template, or custom visualizations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking on <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time API services</a> and tools, and i&rsquo;ve been seeing some of these frameworks, like Firebase <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">getting baked in by default to some API platforms</a>. I am also tracking on visualization tools, I just don&rsquo;t have the research published as a Github repository yet, like I do with my real-time research.</p>
<p>I will keep tracking on API providers who are doing interesting things with real-time or visualizations, and hopefully be able to publish more examples. I can&rsquo;t help but think there are some pretty interesting opportunities for open frameworks, and white label solutions for API providers when it comes to real-time, and visualization layers on top of their existing APIs.</p>

<p>I was keeping an eye out for interesting API stories on <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a> the other day and came across an cool notification startup that lives in the Stripe API ecosystem, called <a href="https://hooked.io/">Hooked</a>.</p>
<p>Hooked allows users to set up notifications for any events related to a Stripe account. Hooked uses the Stripe API to disocver events, and then employs webhooks to send notifications.</p>
<p>As I'm writing this story, I realize this is very similar to my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/26/realtime-and-visualizations-will-be-key-in-financial-api-deployments/">previous story today about real-time and visualization layers for APIs</a>, and that notifications could easily be provided as a white label solution for API providers, giving them a ready to go notification layer to their APIs.</p>
<p>Right now I lump notifications in my research under <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, but I think I will be pulling it out into its own research area. Notifications are real-time, but they are more messaging than just a real-time feature, but they are kind of more real-time than just a message too. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>We'll see. That is the fun of my API Evangelist research network, is that all of it is pretty liquid&mdash;allowing me to keep moving things around until they make sense in my head.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://ziplocate.us/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/ZipLocate.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>My friend Mark Silverberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/skram">@skram</a>), pointed out a very cool API the other day, that geolocates zip codes, and appropriately named&nbsp;<a href="http://ziplocate.us/">ZipLocate</a>. What I really like about ZipLocate is that they do one thing, and they do it well. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love me some AWS and Twilio, who have industrial grade APIs, but I also have a love for simple, lightweight APIs that focus on one thing.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing about ZipLocate is that it is always free, and never rate limited. He says that it is relatively cheap to host the API, because bandwidth usage is light, with all API calls are heavily cached. I like this type of micro service design--I want thousands more just like it.</p>
<p>What I also dig about ZipLocate is that if you <em>&ldquo;...don't trust the API to be around tomorrow? Host it yourself. Source code and data import scripts available on Github&rdquo;</em>. This is possible because the ZipLocate API is open source, and the data comes from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html">Census Bureau</a>. This approach to developing dead simple APIs on top of government data is really important, and I personally feel that <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/25/6482-datasets-available-across-22-federal-agencies-in-datajson-files/">all 6,482 data sets across 22 federal agencies who have published their data.json file</a>, should have APIs just like ZipLocate.</p>
<p>It looks like ZipLocate is a project developed by Nathan Cahill (<a href="https://twitter.com/nathancahill">@nathancahill</a>). I like his style, and think his approach is simple, elegant, yet extremely powerful, and provides a blueprint that others can follow when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/23/models-for-api-driven-startups-built-around-public-data-/">designing, developing and deploying APIs built on top of public data</a>.</p>

<p>I have been slowly producing my own stack of APIs, which I'm putting under <a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a> brand. My goal with each of these APIs is to do one thing, and do it well, then package up the server side code, API definition, and publish as its own standalone Github repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an Evernote full of ideas for APIs, and I'm seeing plenty of great API designs that I could easily emulate from the rest of The API Stack. As I have time, I will deploy each of my API designs as an API Stack API, eventually looking to build a robust stack of utility APIs.</p>
<p>To support this I've separate out my APIs here into two separate pages, my <a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html">core APIs</a>, which will provide access to content across the API Evangelist network, and my <a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/stack-apis.html">stack APIs</a> which will all be the modular, API Stack designs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I'm done deploying any new design, and I feel it is ready for primetime, I will list here for every to check out and play with.</p>

<p>I was looking around the Google Developer area as part of some regular work, and I noticed an interesting page Google has under their mapping session, that <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/api-picker">help users decide which API they need</a>&nbsp;based upon their goals.</p>
<p>As the page says: "<em>The API picker lists the most common things you may want to do on a map or with location-based data, and suggests the API that most suits your needs. For details about each API, follow the links to the related documentation.</em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/api-picker"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google/which-api-do-i-need.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think that the table layout Google uses is a particularly good one, resulting in a pretty busy looking matrix. I don't think it is a perfect solution, but I like the idea of providing developers with some sort of assistance in understand which API to use, based upon their goals.</p>
<p>This is something that a larger API provider would probably do, but a simple little needs calculator that could help users translate what they are looking for into what the API does, is an interesting concept to play with for some API providers.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m riding the build up for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">APIStrat in Chicago</a>, and preparing for <a href="http://iloveapis2014.com/">I Love APIs in San Francisco</a>, and the <a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/api360/">API 360 Summit in DC</a>, I can&rsquo;t help but think about how busy the API event scene is getting&mdash;in 2014 there are 14 separate conferences focused on the world of APIs.</p>
<p>In the beginning there was just <a title="Gluecon" href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon</a>, <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag</a>, and the <a href="http://www.apiconference.com/">Business of APIs</a>, then 3Scale and API Evangelist got together and started planning for @APIStrat, then immediately <a href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> happened, <a href="http://nordicapis.com/">Nordic APIs</a> came on the scene, <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API-Craft</a>a&nbsp; grew beyond just Meetup, and before you know we have 14 separate events.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be biased here, because @APIStrat is my baby, and I&rsquo;ve been involved in supporting API Days since day, so these two events will always have a special place in my heart. Even with this I believe in interoperability in the community and I am working to support all of the events equally, so if you are organizing make sure and reach out.</p>
<p>You can find me at I Love APIs in a couple weeks in San Francisco, as well as at API 360 in Washington DC the same week, and of course @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of September, and Nordic APIs in October. Unfortunately we messed up in planning @APIStrat, and made it at the same time as REST Fest, which seriously pissed me off&mdash;so I won&rsquo;t be attending REST Fest yet again this year. :-( This is part of the reason I'm putting together this research, so I don't make this mistake again.</p>
<p>As with the rest of my work, <a href="http://events.apievangelist.com/">I setup a Github repo, and website to give me a single place to aggregate information on API events</a>. I will do my best keep up to date, for my own education, but I am also looking to help you understand each of the events, the organizers, sponsors, speakers, and also who is attending. As I have time I will aso add a section for API Meetups, so we can keep tabs on the smaller API gatherings that are going on in various cities around the globe.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to participate in one of the conferences listed as a speaker or sponsor let me know, I&rsquo;ll hook you up with the organizer. If you&rsquo;d like to organize a meet up in your town, or you would like to bring in guest speakers from the outside API community, let me know as well&mdash;no guarantees, but I will see what I can do.</p>
<p>As with the rest of the space, I will do my best to keep my <a href="http://events.apievangelist.com/">API events research</a> up to date, and as with the rest of my research, feel free <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-events">fork and contribute</a> where you can&mdash;I need all the help I can get!</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/heroku/heroku-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The new <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button">Heroku Button</a> gets us one step closer to a new age of API deployment, where anyone can deploy the APIs they need without any developer or IT resources. As I&rsquo;m working on packaging up API designs for my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, and <a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation API</a>, this type of approach is what I&rsquo;m envisioning for all of my APIs in the future&mdash;push button API deployment.</p>
<p>You shouldn't have to wait to deploy the API you need. Just as we are beginning to deploy pre-packaged application stacks like Wordpress, and Drupal, we should be able to deploy common API deployments for images, blogs, videos, and much, much more, with a single click of a button. Once any new API is launched it can be configured, and connected to other systems using the API, allowing it to operate as part of larger stack, or stay as completely independent node &nbsp;that just checks in with the mother ship from time to time.</p>
<p>While there will remain a handful of API leaders like Twilio and SendGrid who will have a big presence, many of the APIs in this next wave of API deployment will be smaller, and more transient in nature, taking advantage of current cloud trends around PaaS, and containerization.  This new type of APis will possess a self contained blueprint for the OS, database, server-side code, API definition, and even configuration, integration, and automation tooling for the API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on Docker definitions for <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">creen capture</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation AP</a>, as well as other APIs I develop in the future, but first I think any API I deisn shouldl run as a Heroku app, that anyone can deploy in their own account with a single click of a button. It won't take much work to make this happen for any API I deploy, and since <a title="3Scale API Infrastructure" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a>, which I use to secure my APIs, already <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/deploying-apis-using-heroku-and-3scale-addon/">runs on Heroku</a>--making securing, and managing my Heroku deployed APis seamless.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/newzealand-government-banner.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The other night I was <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/18/all-government-should-have-a-social-media-directory-api/">writing about the need for a social media directory API</a>, like the one <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/">the GSA has launched for the federal government</a>, but specifically for the City of Chicago. I was trying to get a list of each of the City of Chicago Twitter accounts, and while I&rsquo;m glad there is a <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/narr/misc/social_media.html">central social media account list</a>, I always want an API so I can eliminate the need for data entry.</p>
<p>After I posted my story, Oliver Seiler (<a href="https://twitter.com/0seiler">@0seiler</a>) emailed me the <a href="https://www.govt.nz/api/v1">API endpoint for the New Zealand Government Directory API</a>, which doesn't include the social media information that our <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml">federal government social media directory API</a> delivers, but offers another look at what one possible pattern for government directory APIs is.</p>
<p>This is one of the by-products of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">my profiling of federal government APIs</a>, that I will begin to see API patterns that ALL government possess, things like a directory API. There should be a WordPress of the government directory API, a open source PHP Web API, possessing a common API definition, allowing any government agency, of any level, to be able to quickly download and deploy a directory API for their branch of government.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping when I&rsquo;m done with my profiling of 120 federal government APIs, I'll have better suggestions of which APIs patterns government agencies should be offering by default. I will also have API definitions for all of these government API patterns, which I can probably pretty quickly crank out server side API code to support&mdash;who knows maybe <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">Wordpress 4.1 will be available by then and I can use Wordpress as an API deployment framework</a>.</p>
<p>Until then I will just start tracking on all the common patterns for government API deployment, and publish as stories her on API Evangelist, and on my <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">federal government research site</a>. I'm thinking other things I'm tracking on, like API deployment using containers, and deployment via PaaS platforms like Heroku, will contribute to this type of API deployment across government as well, making it a very interesting time to be in tech.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">I stumbled across a cool resource out of Heroku today, their </a><a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">HTTP API design guide</a>, which intends to direct practices for API design on the Heroku API platform.</p>
<p>Heroku&rsquo;s goals around APIs design are, "consistency and focusing on business logic while avoiding design bikeshedding&rdquo;.  They put out the guide to drive consistent aPI design practices at Heroku, but are also interested in sharing with the wider API community.</p>
<p>I think API design best practices are something every API provider should have, and publish publicly (on Github). I think it is ok to even fork, and modify existing guides like Heroku&rsquo;s or maybe <a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">from 18F out of federal government</a>. This most important thing is that you have a guide that can guide your team, or other teams within your organization.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m seeing more of these, I will start flagging, and aggregating them so we can browse and continue learn the API design practices from the leading API providers out there.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-bread.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my monitoring of the API space, when I started seeing a large number of blog posts, tweets, companies, and other elements I track on get tagged with the same tag over and over, I take notice. My blogging, CRM, and news curation system all have their own <a href="http://theapistack.com/">tag cloud interface</a> for the week, showing which tags have been applied--so if a tag gets heavy usage, I know it.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, I've spun up new research into other areas within the world of APIs, beyond my core <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a title="API Evangelism" href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, <a title="API Discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, and <a title="API Integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a> research. I created separate buckets beyond just provide and consume to track on these new areas, called <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">trends</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/opportunities/">opportunities</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/priorities/">priorities</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014 it is beginning to seem like each of my trend research areas are getting baked directly into API platforms, ranging from real-time features with Firebase, to reciprocity by default using Zapier. API providers are learning that having a real-time layer, or a reciprocity layer baked into their platform is a good thing, and why reinvent the wheel when you have kick ass solutions like <a title="Firebase" href="http://bit.ly/1w9oJSq">Firebase</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/SzPnEh">Zapier</a>.</p>
<p>It makes sense that API providers would be looking externally to deliver&nbsp;<a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">aggregation</a>, <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, and even <a title="Voice APIs" href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a> layers for their API platforms--this stuff is hard, and why spread yourself too thin. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">Intuit just bought reciprocity provider itDuzzit</a>, and I think we will more providers <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">integrating Zapier into their platforms by default like Nimble did</a>. We'll also see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/nest-provides-a-realtime-layer-by-default-for-api-consumers/">more API platforms bring in Firebase as a real-time layer like Nest did for their Internet of Things (Iot) thermostat API platform</a>.</p>
<p>Overall it seems like a white label solution that any API provider could put to use when considering solutions for aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice or even data solutions including spreadsheet connectors, analysis, and visualization, would do well in the space. At the very least, any company looking to step up and provide solutions in these areas, should definitely have a strong partner program like Zapier and Firebase have brought to the table.</p>
<p>I will have to start considering how to migrate aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice out of the trends bucket and into either the provide or consume buckets, or maybe both. It would seem that both API providers and consumers need to be educated in these areas, and made aware of what solutions are available.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that worried about the overall structure of API Evangelist at the moment. That is one of the beautiful aspects of how I architected the site(s), is that each research area lives as its own node on the network, so I can move around, shift as I need to find the right formula&mdash;something that helps me in a very fast moving space, where my understanding is constantly shifting and evolving with the swift currents of the APi space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I first wrote about <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">openFDA</a> back in June, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">showcasing the launch of their new developer area</a>, and I'm happy to see they aren't missing a beat when it comes to launching new APIs. I recently saw that openFDA just launch a new endpoint, called the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/label/">Drug Label API</a>, which allows you to query over 60K prescriptions and over-the-counter drug labels.</p>
<p>It is satisfying to see such a large government agency find their API mojo. The original spark at the FDA was lit by Presidential Innovate Fellow Sean Herron (<a href="https://twitter.com/seanherron">@seanherron)</a>, but most recently Sean has handed off the iniative to an internal team who will keep they platform moving forward using the same formula.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/Drug_facts_label_gl01.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Beyond just the API, openFDA is also seriously putting the "open" in openFDA with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fda/openfda">Public Repo on GitHub&nbsp;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opendata.stackexchange.com/search?q=openFDA">Extensive Community Q&amp;A on StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://open.fda.gov/terms/">Progress Terms of Service for Government</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Everything the openFDA is doing provides a great blueprint for other agencies to follow, from their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">creative evolution of the interactive API documentation</a>, to encouraging other federal agencies to fork, and use the openFDA TOS in their own platforms.</p>
<p>The work coming out of the FDA makes me happy, because it sets a strong example that other agencies can follow, provides the rest of us with something positive that we can highlight when working to change public opinion, but also because it is such extremely vital data, and should be available in full download, and API format so that it can stimulate web and mobile app development, and system integration across the private sector.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m adding <a href="https://platform.pokitdok.com">PokitDok</a>, a simple API for healthcare to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>, and my overall <a href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com/">APIs in healthcare research</a>. Well I didn't exactly add them, PokitDok added themselves to my healthcare research by forking the Github repository, and adding themselves to the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/healthcare/blob/gh-pages/data/companies.json">JSON data source</a>&mdash;once I received the pull request, I accepted, and they were published on the site.</p>
<p>Usually once a week I spend time to manually adding new companies I've come across in my monitoring of the API space, but being a one man show I can&rsquo;t find everything across this massively expanding space. This is why I depend on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> to help me curate the best from across the space. Not everyone knows that the entire API Evangelist network of <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ research projects</a> all runs on Github, which allows anyone to help write posts, curate industry news, and maintain the lists of API providers.</p>
<p>As soon as I accepted the pull request for PokitDok, I also tagged them as &ldquo;API Stack&rdquo;, which immediately adds PokitDok to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>, listed under healthcare. No matter which doorway a company enters, I will make sure they get published to all appropriate research areas across the API Evangelist network, using my tagging system.</p>
<p>Thanks PokitDok for adding yourself, and I look forward to paying attention to the good things coming our of your API platform via your <a href="https://pokitdok.com/blog/">Blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PokitDok">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pokitdok">Github</a> profiles.</p>

<p>I depend on a <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/14/details-about-the-52-online-services-i-depend-on/">number of cloud services to make my personal and business world go round</a>. Even as a programmer, who can hand code just about any script to integrate, automate, and orchestrate my world, I find myself using more reciprocity services like <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity providers</a> are one of the most important evolutions of the API space, because they make the whole world of APis accessible to the normals, and not just to the geek crowd. My time is valuable, and personally I'd rather being using existing tools and services, rather than re-inventing the wheel, and when it comes to orchestrating my online life, I need all the help I can, which is why I am looking IFTTT and Zapier for help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using both platforms in 2014, but as I do with any other software I&rsquo;ve been dating for any sustained period, I start looking at getting a little more serious. This is where I have to part ways with IFTTT, and other other platforms that don&rsquo;t have <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/">clear relief valves for their free tier</a>, allowing me to start paying monthly or annually for my use of their service, and sensibly scale up as my needs grow.</p>
<p>Zapier has a pretty straightforward <a href="https://zapier.com/app/pricing">pricing framework</a>, giving you just enough room to get hooked, then you can pay for more usage as needed. Having a free tier for any cloud service is essential, but having a tiered business model, and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">clear monetization strategy</a>, so I know that you will be around in the future, is a requirement.</p>
<p>I will keep my IFTT account to play with, but when it comes operating my business, continuing to integrate Zapier into my workflow makes sense as they have a clear business model that fits my needs. Plus <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/">Zapier has an API</a>. Ummmm&hellip;hello? An API for your automation and integration layer across all the services you depend on, via their APIs--how cool is that!</p>
<p>When launching your own APIs, make sure it has a clear, visible, intuitive and ascendable service framework--it is something that will go a long way in helping companies decide if they will use your APIs, or not.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.uber.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/uber-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The sharing economy is booming, and with the release of the <a href="https://developer.uber.com/">Uber API</a>, the attention on this space will only increase. Personally I&rsquo;m only  interested in the surface area of the API that Uber has released, and what it tells about the opportunity for API designers in the sharing economy.</p>
<p>I think the surface area of the Uber API is pretty minimal, but very significant when you look at it as a glimpse of what is to come, as the sharing economy gets a direct pipeline to the API economy, and the resulting app economy. Oh yeah, I went there&mdash;I used all the economy buzzwords in once sentence. Seriously, I think the five endpoints that Uber launched with, are very telling:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/products</li>
<li>/estimates/price</li>
<li>/estimates/time</li>
<li>/history</li>
<li>/me</li>
</ul>
<p>These API endpoints represent the beginning of the shared economy API surface area, and while there will be many additions, augmentations, and different takes on what APIs look like in the sharing economy, I predict many other providers will often emulate Uber in their own design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really equipped to make a judgement on the value or importance of the Uber API. What I can do is keep an eye on Uber, and other sharing economy startup and their APIs, and look for patterns across each of the implementations. Hopefully the space can remain true to their roots, and make sure the API definitions are shareable, and reusable across the flourishing sharing app sapce.</p>
<p>Uber is focused specifically in the transportation portion of the sharing economy, and this makes me consider the bigger picture, and who will step up to serve the larger sharing economy, with an Uber API platform for the sharing economy. I think much like the wider API space, as the sharing API space matures out there will lots of opportunities for aggregation, real-time, automation, messaging, payments, and other API essentials that are in service of the sharing economy.</p>

<p>I tag a lot of interesting companies that show up during my weekly API monitoring. When I see a tag go from 1 or 2, to over 5 companies--I take a closer look to see what is going on. An increase in the number of companies focusing in a specific area could be a trend, or it could be nothing.</p>
<p>The tag "API Agency" ticked over to 6 today, when I added&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aquevix.com/">Aquevix</a>, an indian company that is focusing on API development. As of August 2014 I now have six separate agency style companies that I've found who have a focus on API design and development:</p>

<p>We'll see how many more dev shops I find in the next couple months. Sometimes when I start focusing in a new area I will find more companies working in the same area, purely because I'm looking harder, and sometimes it takes time for things to actually heat up.</p>
<p>As I'm looking at local Chicago web and mobile development shops during the lead up to <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practce in Chicago</a> next month, and I'm learning that many small shops like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">SYDCON</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/18/how-are-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-bryson-pouw-at-blaze-portfolio/">Blaze Portfolio</a> are using APIs, they just havn't shifted their marketing and web site content to reflect the evolution.</p>
<p>It won't take much for many of these web and mobile development shops to standardize their API design and development services, much like the evolution we saw occur from web to mobile development, shifting the focus of the small dev shop to better serve a growing demand for API design, and development. I think by 2015 I'll see over 50 development shops, who are heavily focused on API design and developmennt in my API tracking system.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking with a very nice recruiter over at Google over the last couple weeks, and she has been so kind in keeping me updated about opportunities for evangelism at Google. This is the 3rd round of talks I've had with Google while being the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, talks that historically go nowhere because of their programming test, which is a super silly aspect of their HR process.</p>
<p>I was straight up with the Google recruiter a couple of weeks ago when she first emailed me, and again when we talked on the phone last week&mdash;I do not take programming tests to open up doors for employment conversations, sorry. ;-( It is a waste of my time, and yours, and doesn&rsquo;t measure shit. I understand that you have to qualify large number of folks, at your very algorithmic-centric company, but when it comes to measuring what I do, a programming test isn&rsquo;t a thing.</p>
<p>If programming a tic-tac-toe game on a live screen share is what you need to open up a conversation with professionals around evangelizing your platform, you need to look elsewhere. Nowhere in my role as the API Evangelist do I have to code under time pressure with someone else watching, sorry. I would even say, having hacker skills, trumps programming skills in a public facing evangelism role, and speed, quality of code go out the window. This is about making connections through hacker storytelling, something that doesn't always pencil out to producing best code, and is more about helping people understand what is possible using a platform, in the most meaningful way&mdash;requiring more focus on the person and their problems, not the code or algorthm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve managed to have man very meaningful conversations with other tech giants like Intel, IBM, large institutions like UC Berkeley, BYU, and establish fruitful relationships with partners like 3Scale and API Spark, and across federal agencies like Department of Education, Energy, NASA, and the White House around APIs--all without taking programming tests. I talk to startups, SMBs, SMEs, organizations, institutions, and government agencies a lll the time, and never have to code under pressure, in front of an audience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not under the influence that I will change your hiring practices Google&mdash;you are a very smart, and successful company. All I&rsquo;m saying is you are probably filtering out some pretty talented folks, who are extremely passionate and knowledgeable in what they do, and connected in their space, and when you won&rsquo;t engage in meaningful conversations without a programming test, your missing out.</p>
<p>I actually prefer working with organizations from the outside in, I think it better reflects the essence of API Evangelism. The companies who have trouble working with outside entities, without tradition HR processes, are probably not going to lead when it comes developing an API driven ecosystem.</p>
<p>If your company doesn't have the time to research me, and understand what I bring to the API space, and what my skills are, we probably aren't a fit. Everything about me is available online at <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kinlane">Github</a>--you just have to look. If you are only looking at <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane-resume/Resume-Kin-Lane-API-Evangelist-Summary.pdf">resumes</a>, and making people take tests, you will probably get what you are looking for!</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://twiliosheet.azurewebsites.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/twilio/TwilioSheet.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you follow <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog">Twilio blog</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/twilio">Twitter account</a> you can always find a good API story from the API leader. It also makes me happy to see trends I&rsquo;m seeing from other provider re-enforced by the API heavyweight. This time is providing spreadsheet integration with common API resources, like Twilio SMS.</p>
<p>Twilio has a pretty slick tool they call <a href="http://twiliosheet.azurewebsites.net/">TwilioSheet</a> that allows you to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet, and created a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/08/connecting-twilio-sms-to-google-spreadsheet.html">pretty nice walkthrough of the entire setup</a>. Providing this type of functionality helps, as Twilio says, "make it easy for developers and non-developers alike to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet&rdquo;&mdash;<strong>emphasis on the non-developers.</strong></p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, the spreadsheet is the #1 database solution in the world, and provide a huge opportunity when it comes to bridging the world of APIs with the wider business landscape. This is something that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API reciprocity providers like Zapier</a> have bridging for a while now, and something that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">API providers like Intuit are looking to bank into their API platforms</a>.</p>
<p>When you see Twilio doing something like providing providing spreadsheet integration for their API platform, you have to stop and consider whether or not it is something that might work for your own API platform. Spreadsheet integration by default with API your driven resources is a great way to expand the reach of any API, bringing these valuable resources within reach of the actual, everyday problem owners.</p>

<p>It can be hard to keep up with what the latest geek trends are--where all of the latest digital watering holes are&nbsp;(especially when your old), that allow you to find the latest info, conversations, and links to everything cool and hip. I depend on my network of API peeps for tips, and last week I was introduced to a new place that I wanted to pass on to you, called <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>.</p>
<p>Product Hunt does a good job of describing what they do:</p>
<blockquote><em>Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the site open for the last five days, scanning for cool tech creations that grab my attention, and when I opened the tab today, I noticed that APIs dominated the top of the list.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.producthunt.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/product-hunt/product-hunt-api.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>You see the Uber API (of course), and Zapier both jockeying for top slots, as well as Product Hunts API too. Product Hunt allows you to post product name, tagline, and url for any web, mobile or single page app&mdash;a format that is perfect for publishing and sharing your individual API resource creations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be adding Product Hunt as an <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelism building block</a>, publishing my own API creations, as well as encouraging my API readers to do the same. The platform seems like a great way to show off your API, and generate buzz (or not) around each API resource we bring to the table.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.intuit.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/intuit/intuitbig.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the interoperability, automation, and reciprocity providers I track on <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/blog/2014/08/13/intuit-acquires-itduzzit-syncing-data-between-cloud-apps-gets-easier">itDuzzit has been acquired by the accounting platform Intuit</a>.  Usually acquisitions are just news, and not worthy of analysis here on API Evangelist, but I feel the itDuzzit acquisition is a significant sign when it comes to API providers, consumers, and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">reciprocity providers</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been seeing more <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">API providers offer IFTTT or Zapier integration as a default option, in their own developer hubs</a>. I think the Intuit acquisition of itDuzzit reflects this evolution in how APIs are deployed, and consumed, something that has been pushed forward by this new generation of API reciprocity providers.</p>
<p>The Intuit announcement recognizes that this new breed of reciprocity providers have the potential to reach beyond a core developer audience by:</p>
<blockquote><em>The itDuzzit technology allows multiple audiences to create sophisticated integrations with very little coding required.  With their technology combined with the range of QuickBooks platform services we already offer, the breadth and depth of integrations our partners can build will grow tremendously. itDuzzit&rsquo;s sophisticated rules-based engine really set them apart from the competition, and their technology benefits the entire QuickBooks Online ecosystem: third-party developers, accountants and small businesses.</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cloud.itduzzit.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/intuit/itduzzit.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The world of accounting seems like a great place to start when providing interoperability, automation, and reciprocity tools that are not just developers, but also empower end-users to use API. If you are as advanced as Zapier, <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/">even your reciprocity layer will have an API that developers</a>&nbsp;can&nbsp;put to use when taking advantage of the cross platform API integration and automation possibilities.</p>
<p>I will keep an eye on the <a href="https://developer.intuit.com">Intuit partner Platform</a>, and see what they end up doing with itDuzzit.  According to the press release, "<em>The Intuit and itDuzzit teams are already collaborating to fold the technology into the Intuit Partner Platform&rdquo;</em>, and hopefully we&rsquo;ll see some interesting API reciprocity patterns that I can highlight here on API Evangelist, and other API providers can follow when considering their own reciprocity layer for their own platform</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/vstudio" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/microsoft/visual-studio.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The Bing Developer Center team <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bingdevcenter/archive/2014/08/18/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-focuses-on-improving-productivity-within-the-experience.aspx">has released a pretty interesting pluginthat assist developers who use Visual Studio</a> when building web or mobile applications using APIs.</p>
<p>In an effort to make developers lives easier, the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a1166718-a2d9-4a48-a5fd-504ff4ad1b65">Bing Developer Assistant</a> now comes with integrated API code search that, <em>&ldquo;while coding, a relevant code snippet related to your current API will be automatically displayed in the IntelliSense window which is powered by Bing Code Search"</em>.</p>
<p><em>"Code snippets are short piece of code that you can easily learn and copy"</em>, and you can <em>"copy the code, or click the source URL to view where the code snippet comes from, or click "Search More" to find more code samples related to the API"</em>.  Which seems like it could easily be extended to other aspects of the API, using <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/">APIs.json url type</a>, allowing for the discovery of videos, how-to, and other supporting API resources.</p>
<p>The approach by the Bing Developer Center team&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-within-the-developers-ide/">reflects what I&rsquo;m seeing from Salesforce, Google, and other API IDE integrations</a>. I&rsquo;m interested in continuing to explore what role API definitions like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML</a> will play when it comes to API discovery via popular IDEs like Visual Studio.</p>
<p><a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ide-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I also envision <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> also taking a lead role when it comes to discovering new APIs, or pulling from a curated list of existing APIs, while programming within any IDE. There will also be an opportunity for IT, and development support staff to discovery API resources using <a href="http://apis.io">API search engines like APIs.io</a>, and then create their own internal APIs.json collection of sanctioned API resources from across public, partner and internal sources.</p>
<p>IDE API integration isn't something that will just be for the big players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google. As more API providers publish machine readable API definitions, complete with APIs.json indexes of these resources--we&rsquo;ll begin to see more niche IDE developers who are curating meaningful stacks of API resources from a variety of sources into a single, rich API development experience.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is one of the benefits of where we are currently headed with <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>.&nbsp;API providers can focus on making machine readable API definitions, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> collections. Then others can innovate in the deployment of tooling like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and IDE plugins like the Bing Developer Assistant for Microsoft Visual Studio, that make sure API resources are disocvered and put to use in everyday development environments.</p>

<p>I had someone ask me the other day if I had any numbers on how many APIs are used in a modern web or mobile applications--great question! I often refer to the growth in the number of APIs we use, but this is really just anecdotal, and not based on any real facts.</p>
<p>In August, as part of the&nbsp;lead up to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/APIStrat">@APIStrat</a>&nbsp;I am spending more time reaching out to dev shops in Chicago, with the most recent talks with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/18/how-are-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-bryson-pouw-at-blaze-portfolio/">Bryson Pouw at Blaze Portfolio</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">Dave Devitt at SYDCON</a>. In future conversation I will make sure and ask the dev shops how many APIs they use in the average app they deliver.</p>
<p>If you have any data on the average number of APIs used in web or mobile apps at your agency, or know of research or stories that talk about this, please let me know.  Until now, many of the numbers being reported in the API space are coming from providers, I think we need to start gathering, tracking on, and reporting on API usage from the API consumption side of the coin.</p>

<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> was designed to be a versatile API discovery format, not just a format for public API discovery via search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. An APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable index of APIs within a single developer hub, providing information on the API endpoints as well as any other supporting resources--there is no reason that all of this can&rsquo;t also be applied in a private setting.</p>
<p>APIs.json can easily be placed within a domain, subdomain, or at any network address, and be used to describe an internal collection of API resources, as well as bring in outside APIs. APIs.jsonbui excels at aggregating multiple, potentially disparate APIs, into a single coherent collection for use in development.</p>
<p>Using internal APIs.json files, a company, organization or governent agency can deploy an instance of an open source API search engine like APIs.io, or develop a custom API search tool that can aggregate the different APIs.json from each location, into a company wide API search and discovery destination.</p>
<p>An APIs.json provides a framework for referencing each APIs machine readable definition in Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML format, as well as other resources that internal developers will need to be successful, such as authentication info, SDKs, terms of service, and the multitude of other <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks</a>.</p>
<p>If you have public APIs, it will be a no brainer for you to generate machine readable API definitions for your APIs, and add them to a single, or potentially multiple <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> files for indexing. Even if you don&rsquo;t have public APis, you can put APIs.json to work improving your internal API discovery, while also opening up your API resources to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">other benefits of having machine readable API definitions</a>.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stacks.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I used to publish out a list of curated stories each week, and a listing of the top 25 APIs I was paying attention to during my regular monitoring of the API space to a site I called <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>. When i went to Washington DC last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, I suspended that weekly ritual, and never picked up after my world got back to normal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still monitoring about 1000 companies, with over 2000 total APIs, and curating the stories--I just don&rsquo;t take the time each week to publish them to The API Stack. In an effort to try and reboot the project, provide value to the API Evangelist network, as well as to you my loayal reader, I've republished a new reflection of my work at the Github project. Right now it just lists 819 of the companies who are doing interesting things with APis in 114 categories.</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks I will be reviewing each of these 819 companies APIs, and as I validate them, I will publish more detail. You can search for General Services Administration (GSA), under the <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=federal-stack">Federal Stack</a> to see an example of this work in action. I link to each of the GSA APIs, across multiple domains, and include a machine readable API definition as well as interactive documentation generated from the definition.</p>
<p>The API Stack will continue to be a window into my API targeting and monitoring, and I will update regularly as I have time. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that going forward, the API space needs to focus on the quality of APIs, and not just the number of APIs available, and <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a> reflects this way of thinking, playing out in my own work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blaze-portfolio/atom-align-blaze-portfolio.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently talked with Bryson Pouw (<a href="https://twitter.com/bpouw">@bpouw</a>), Founder / CEO at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com">Blaze Portfolio Systems</a> in Chicago about how his portfolio management and trading technology company sees the world of APIs. Last week <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">I had talked with Dave Devitt (@sydcon), President at SYDCON, a web development shop</a>, and this week I was very interested to hear Bryson&rsquo;s view on APIs, because his company is a little more niche, focusing specifically on the needs of the investment professional.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com/features/model-rebalancing">Atom Align</a>, the Blaze Portfolio Systems flagship product is looking to help investment professionals better manage their portfolios, and a big enabler of this is the <a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com/atom-align-api">Atom Align API</a>,&nbsp;which provides programmatic access to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Information Queries</strong> &ndash; Obtain the list of portfolios, orders, brokers, and securities</li>
<li><strong>Trade Orders</strong> &ndash; Place, execute, cancel, and allocate trade orders</li>
<li><strong>Manage Trade Extracts </strong>&ndash; Create and download trade extract file</li>
</ul>
<p>The Atom Align API is only made available to trusted Blaze Portfolio partners and clients upon request, while also being used internally to drive system integrations. This approach to API design, as the core for specialty, or even widely available web and mobile applications, <a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-market-graph.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>is the signature of a software development shop that has evolved and realized that a core API stack is essential for internal, as well as external integrations&mdash;APIs aren&rsquo;t just for public consumption when it comes to todays dev shop operations.</p>
<p>Beyond their own internal Atom Align API, Blaze Portfolio also uses several other financial related APIs as part of their core operations. APIs are core to the Atom Align secret sauce, aggregating, refining, and making sense of markets by pulling data and content from multiple API sources, most notably <a href="ttp://www.xignite.com/">financial data from Xignite</a>.  You can&rsquo;t be an investment professional in 2014 without having the right technology in your toolbox, and Blaze Portfolio has done well aggregating financial data from public API sources, into tje tool the pros are needing.</p>
<p>Blaze Portfolio Systems designing, deploying, and managing their own internal APIs, as well as consuming multiple publicly available APIs, provides an interesting blueprint that other software development shops can follow. There is money to be made in managing your own API infrastructure, using the best of breed, publicly available data and API sources--then craft it all into your own API driven software solution that can deliver web, mobile, or even device based solutions for niche or mainstream customers.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time looking for good quality logos to represent the companies I track on and write stories about. I have a certain vision in my head about how I want company listings and detail pages to look across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>&mdash;something that takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>To support this vision, I spend a lot of time looking for logos. Sometimes you can find them in the header of a website, but often times they are poor quality, not configured to be standalone, or difficult to get at for any number of other reasons--making my work a lot tougher.</p>
<p>I published a new list of 819 companies who are doing interesting things with APIs that I call&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>. After publishing the project, <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>, one of the <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=travel-stack">travel API providers</a>&nbsp;listed, tweeted at me asking if I could replace their logo with a better quality one from their <a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/logos">official logo page</a>--I did so very quickly!</p>
<p>I sure love me a good logo and branding page for an API. It makes my life easier, by giving me a single place to go get high quality logos, without having to open up my image editor. I wish that more API platforms would have a well designed logo page like <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote about&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/what-is-an-api-first-strategy-adding-some-dimensions-to-this-new-question/">What Is An API First Strategy? Adding Some Dimensions To This New Question</a> the other day after talking with <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. One of the commonets on the post was&nbsp;from my friend Logan Powell (<a href="https://twitter.com/logantpowell">@logantpowell</a>), and I think it was so good, that it deserves its own post. I will let Logan do the talking:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To supplement the pool of meaning here, I would like to add that an API-first strategy is one where the API serves as both a pattern of an enterprises IT architecture as well as catalyst for engagement.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In a nutshell, an API-first strategy is a systems paradigm shift</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>-- from a centralized, engineered mechanical system made up of subordinate parts serving as means to deliberately designed ends</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>-- to a decentralized, organic and evolving ecosystem where the individual actors can be spontaneously enfranchised or co-opted by any other actor / set of actors to serve new purposes.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>This allows the system to be more flexible, respond more quickly and behave more dynamically to suit unforeseen purposes. I believe the API-first paradigm is thereby more scalable by nature.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Prudent separation of information from presentation through APIs should be the first and next step for most organizations with large IT infrastructures. To be more specific, this provides a number of efficiency benefits. To just name a few: by modulating infrastructure with solid APIs, stakeholders can create / hack together production-ready applications faster, more securely and more reliably.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This approach warrants a new form of IT team protocol wherein the curation of APIs is front-and-center to their role. When designing a new product / service, the design of it's API should be commensurate. As the product or service makes it's way to production, making sure the API is well documented, easy to use / as conventional as possible, hooked up with analytics, secure and prepared to scale should be a given (these are frequently included in any self-respecting API management solution). In so doing, not only might the enterprise benefit from the speedier and more rewarding 'dog-fooding' of these services / resources, if they ever decide to commercialize or publicize / open them up to users outside their organization (the decision to flip the switch itself being informed by the aforementioned analytics), it's just an invite / key request away.</em></p>
<p>Logan works in the federal government, on some pretty high value open data and API projects, and he is on the frontline for how APIs can be a catalyst for change within enterprise IT, but also connect externally in some meaningful ways--in short he knows his stuff, and is helping internalize APIs across the federal government.</p>
<p>What Logan describes IS why I believe so paassionately in APIs. In my mind It is the culural change, with an eye towards exernal interactions and conversations that make APIs work, and while the tech of APIs is critical, it is the cultural, organizational, and ultimately the human aspects of APIs that make the biggest impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/swagger-apisjson-and-review-for-the-new-developertradegov/">coordinating with the development team for Developer.Trade.Gov today</a>, providing them with a review of their new developer area, and some suggestions on how to make their APIs, and developer more usable.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> is published as a <a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal">Github repository</a>, using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to actually deliver the website. The feedback I&rsquo;ve been giving to the team, has been done through the <a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal/issues">Github issue management for the repository</a>.</p>
<p>One piece of feedback I left was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I love that when I land on your home page, I get a brief description of what developer.trade.gov delivers, the probem is that the description is below the fold on some monitors, leaving just the 3 links available to see.</em></p>
<p><em>I'd switch the description and links, putting description at the top....and the first thing your eyes are drawn to. You'd be surprised how valuable this can be. Simple, but important.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I submitted&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal/issues/20#issue-40274346">the suggestion 5 hours ago</a>, and I just received an update that the issue was closed, and my suggestions were incorporated. When you go to the <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> website now, you will see the text, with links to the right&mdash;creating a much more clean, informative, and usable way to deliver the most valuable real estate you have in your developer hub. It was a small, but quick and meaningful change to a government website.</p>
<p>Imagine if we could help other agencies see the benefit of publishing small, simple websites, developer hubs, single page apps, and other projects to Github, and manage their feedback loops via Github issues. What types of improvements in delivering government services would we see? What cost savings could be realized across government?</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/trade-gov/developer-trade-gov.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I got a gentle ping today, as I often do when there is a new developer hub or API launched in the federal government. This time it was located within the Department of Commerce, for the International Trade Administration, and was a new developer area, with five APIs at <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a>.</p>
<p>I quickly went through the new developer area, which I consider passing the test for a minimum viable developer area, possessing all the essential building blocks an API developer hub needs. The only places I feel it fell short is in the feedback loop, and providing machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs.</p>
<p>I submitted my feedback as Github issues, on the repository for the developer hub, but when it comes to machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs, I know how easy this is, so rather than just submit issues, I figured I'd get to work generating the machine readable API definitions for Developer.Trade.Gov, and demonstrate what was possible. As I do with all of my work, I setup a <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/">subdomain, and Github repository</a>, to store all of my work, and got to work on each of the five APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/market-research-library.html">Market Research Library</a> (<a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/definitions/market-research-library.json">Swagger</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/ita-office-locations.html">ITA Offices &amp; Centers</a> (<a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/definitions/ita-offices-and-centers.json">Swagger</a>)</li>
<li>Trade Events</li>
<li>Trade Leads</li>
<li>Trade News &amp; Articles</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I chose to use <a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger</a> for creating my machine readable API definitions, and while I was waiting for the Github commit to take for the Market Research Library API Swagger definition + Swagger UI, I got to work on the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API. As I was finishing up, I reloaded the <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/market-research-library-api.html">interactive docs for the Market Research Library API</a>, and got the dreaded CORS warning:</p>
<blockquote><em>Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://api.trade.gov/market_research_library/search?keyword=travel. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.</em></blockquote>
<p>That is where the fun ends for me. I can keep creating Swagger specs for the other three APIs, but I won&rsquo;t be able to play with them until I create a proxy to make calls through, and open up CORS on my end. I will make time to do this over the weekend, but until then the fun stops. I am hoping they will also open up CORS, but I'm sure it will take a while.</p>

<p>To wrap up my work, I also generated an <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json file for the Developer.Trade.Gov domain</a>, listing the details for both the Market Research Library API, and the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API--opening up the APIs to discovery by API search engines like APIs.io. When Developer.Trade.Gov publishes the APIs.json + Swagger specs under their domain, it will become more authoratative and given prominence in search engine results.</p>
<p>In about 2 hours, I was able to review a new developer area, and five APIs, generate two swagger specs, 1 APIs.json, publish to a Github repository where I launched interactive documentation for each of the two APIs, and wrap up with this story of my work. As with all of my work, you can find all of this <a href="https://github.com/commerce-data/developer.trade.gov">work at the Github repository,</a> and the best part is, when I pick the work back up, it is all in one location, <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/blog/">with complete notes about what I did</a>&mdash;helping me understand where I left off, in addition to allowing anyone else to step in and learn from the process.</p>

<p>I spoke with Phil Windley (<a href="https://twitter.com/windley">@windley</a>) over at <a href="http://byu.edu">Brigham Young University (BYU)</a> about their API strategy this morning. BYU is bringing together API providers and consumers, to establish a coordinated strategy for delivering designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs across campus--an effort being led by <a href="http://cio.byu.edu/">CIO Kelly Flannagan</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/kelflanagan">@kelflanagan</a>).</p>
<p>As part of their latest API effort, BYU is focusing in on the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to campus resources:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Students</li>
<li>Instructors</li>
<li>Classrooms</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The API team is still struggling with a handful of technical details like how to deal with unique identifiers, and relationship between resources, but overall they are on a healthy path when it comes to getting their API designed, and deployed for use at the institution. I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how fast they progress with a top down approach to APIs, vs the bottom up efforts I&rsquo;m seeing at institutions like <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>.</p>
<p>I will be talking their team regularly, about their design, deployment, management, and integration strategy. I want to make sure and document the process all along the way, and share real-time updates that other universities can follow along, or possibly collaborate with us when it comes to establishing some common API patterns we can share and re-use across higher educational institutions.</p>
<p>Look for any stories out of BYU, here on API Evangelist, or over at my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university API research site</a>, and if you are doing any API work at your school, I'd love to know more about it.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I just wrote a piece on r<a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/13/replacing-legacy-systems-with-apis-at-the-department-of-veteran-affairs/">eplacing legacy systems at the VA using APIs</a>, where one of the systemic constraints in place that restricts the modernizzation VA systems using API is purely about money, and more specifically the color of money. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the detail of the topic, but in short the color of money is: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_procurement_in_the_United_States">Money appropriated for one purpose cannot be used for a different purpose, according to the Purpose Act (31 U.S.C. &sect; 1301)</a>.</p>
<p>In short, if $50M was given to sustain an existing legacy system, and that money cannot be re-appropriated, and applied to the newer system, what incentive is there to ever get rid of legacy VA systems, or modernize any government system for that matter? Whether it is usng APIs, or anything else. Newer approaches to using technology are difficult to accept when you are working hard to accomplished your job each day, but if you already have $50M in budget to a specific job, and that job won&rsquo;t go away, unless you choose to make it go away, guess what happens? Nothing changes&hellip;hmmm?</p>
<p>As I said before, I don&rsquo;t give a shit if you deploy APIs from the ground up, or excite via a presidential mandates from the top down, if you have incentives in place for employees to do the opposite, based upon how money is allocated, you won&rsquo;t be changing any behavior or culture&mdash;you are wasting your energy. I don&rsquo;t care how excited I get any one individual, team or department about the potential of APIs bundled with new systems, if it means their job is going away&mdash;too bad, nobody will give a shit.</p>
<p>Think about this scenario, then consider that <a href="https://www.voa.va.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DocumentID=1942">$1,810M of the 3,323M overall VA budget (54%) is sustainment</a>. Granted this isn't all IT system sustainment, but still over half of the budget is allocated to keep shit the same as it is. Imagine what environment this creates for the acceptance of modernization efforts at VA.</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/digital-strategy/logos/va.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>One of the jobs I was tasked with at the VA as a PIF, was taking inventory of the web services within the agency. When asking folks where these web services were, I was directed to various IT Leads on different groups, each giving one or two more locations I could look for word, excel, or other PDFs talking about web services used in projects and known systems. Most of the time these were redundant lists, pointing me to the same 5 web services, and omitting 20-30 that were actually in use for a project.</p>
<p>At one point I was given the contact information for a lady who had been working for two years on a centralized web registry project, that would be the holy grail of web service discovery at the VA. This was it! It was what I was looking for, until I sat in on the weekly call where this project got a 10 minute update, demonstrating that the registry was still about defining the how and what of the registry, and never has actually moved to cataloging actual web services in the wild at the VA. ;-(</p>
<p>Then one day I was introduced to a gentlemen, that was in a back office, in an unmarked cubicle, who seemed to know where most of the web services were, the one difference with this person was that they were a contractor, and not an employee. One thing you hear about, but do not experience fully until you work in government is the line between government employee and contractor&mdash;in meetings, and conversations you know who is who (it is pretty clar), but when it comes to finding APIs, I&rsquo;m sorry the contractors know where everything is at. This contractor had some pretty interesting lists of what web services were in operation, where they were, and which groups at VA owned them, including up to date contact info. These contractors also had their finger on the pulse of any project that was potentially moving the web services converations forward, including the global registry.</p>
<p>Overall I was surprised at how IT groups knew of their own web services, could care less about the web services of other groups, but contractors new where all the web service were across the groups. I was closing in on 500 web services on my list before <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/11/15/why-i-exited-my-presidential-innovation-fellowship/">I left during the shutdown</a>, and I wonder how many else I would have found if I kept up the good fight. This mission had nothing do with API, except that web services are often compared to APis, I was purely taking inventory of what was already in place, a process that went far beyond just technical inventory, and shed light on some serious business and political flaws within operations at the VA.</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-onion.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the byproducts of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/10/where-will-your-api-stand-in-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-debate/">Oracle vs Google API copyright case</a>, was a realization that many API providers and consumer do not understand the layers of the API stack, let alone the potential licensing considerations for each layer of the API onion. I wouldn't just blame API providers, and consumers, I&rsquo;m still getting a grasp on all of this, which is why I'm blogging about the subject.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick crack at defining the layers to the potential API licensing onion:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Data</strong> - What is the licensing for the actual data returned and collected by an API? I&rsquo;m still learning about the ways to license your data, and the <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/faq/licenses/">Open Data Commons provides some guidance in this area</a>, while others feel that your data can just as be easily licensed using <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licensing.</li>
<li><strong>Data Model </strong>- The separation between data and its data model can be hard to see, where in reality end-users may own their data, but the order and structure of it can be owned by the originating application. If this layer is a concern, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, or other copyright options should be considered. </li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - Server side API code is the core of any API operations, and should be licensed accordingly using <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses">common open source software licens</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">es</span>&nbsp;when appropriate. However I would add that this is the one layer in the API stack where a proprietary licensing could make sense, but the rest of the stack should always be licensed as open as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Interface</strong> - The separation between the API and its surface area is important, and is something that is just becoming relevant with the Oracle v Google copyright case. Understanding the importance of an openly licensed surface area, is essential to the health of any API stack, and should be kep as open as possible, even when associated with a proprietary API backend. This is why we started <a href="http://apicommons.org">API commons</a>, to help API providers take a stance on the license of the surface area of the API stack.</li>
<li><strong>Clients</strong> - As with server side code, you should apply<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses"> common open source software licensing</a>&nbsp;to client code when appropriate, but your client code samples, libraries and SDKs should never be licensed in a proprietary way, encouraging implementation for any commercial integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario we are talking about a purely data API, if you are serving up some sort of programmatic resource, things might be different. My goal is to just try and understand the separation between the API layers, and apply some thoughts on how licenses can be applied to open, or possibly close access and constraint an APIs operation.</p>
<p>Much like other political building blocks of the API ecosystem, licensing in the aPI stack can be good, bad, or neutral. In the end, regardless of your stance I think it is important to have an open conversation about how our API stack is licensed, so that your consumers can better understand what they are in for.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/digital-strategy/logos/va.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, slowly bringing them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>On deck are my thoughts on <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">replacing legacy systems with APIs</span></em>, at the Department of Veteran Affairs. In the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, one of the motivations for deploying APIs, is to assist in the evolution, and replacement of legacy systems. The theory is, you have older system that needs to be replaced, and you can wrap in a modern web API, and slowly switch any desktop, web, mobile or other client system to use the new API&mdash;then you build out newer backend system, and make the switch in the API layer from the legacy to the newer backend system, leaving everything operating as expected. API magic!</p>
<p>I'm used to hostile environments to this way of thinking, but most times in the private sector there are other business objectives that can be leveraged to get legacy system owners to get on board with a shift towards API deployment&mdash;I saw no incentive for this practice in the VA environment, where in reality there are incentives for IT, and business owners, as well as 3rd party contractors to keep legacy systems in place, not replace them. There are a variety of motivation for existing VA workers to keep existing systems in place, ranging from not understanding how the system works, to budgetary restrictions on how money flows in support of this pro-sustainment culture.</p>
<p>Here is an example. There is old database for storing of a specific type of document, a database that X amount of existing desktop, server, web, or even mobile systems depend on. If I move in and create an API, that allows for reading and writing of data into this database, then work with all X of the legacy systems to use the API instead of a direct database connection&mdash;in theory I can now work to dismantle the legacy database, and replace with a newer, modern backend database. In most IT operations, this approach will then allow me to replace, modernize and evolve upon an existing legacy system. This is a common view of technologists who are purely looking through a technical lens, and ignoring the existing business and political constraints that exist in some companies, organizations, insitutions and government agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the real world, you have staff, budgets, workflows, and decision making processes that are already in place. Let&rsquo;s say this legacy database had $50M a year allocated in budget for its operation, and I replace with a newer database, plus API, which operates for $10M a year&mdash;you&rsquo;d think I get to reallocate the staff, budget, and other resources to developing newer mobile apps, and other system with my newly liberated $40M. Right? Nope&hellip;that money goes away, and those people have no interest in moving from supporting a COBOL system, to supporting a new MongoDB + Node.js API that is driving a Swift iPhone app. ;-(</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large companies, organizations, institutions and government agencies operate, that are in conflict with what an API philosphy can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin to weave my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.</p>

<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I was given three projects when I started work at the VA: 1) Inventory data assets 2) Inventory web services 3) Move forward D2D, a forms web service that would allow VA hospitals and Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to submit forms through the claims process on behalf of  veteran.</p>
<p>The most prevalent illness I witnessed across these three efforts was a unwillingness to trust outside groups (even VSOs and hospitals), and a lack of desire to share data and resources to anyone outside of the VA (ironically except contractors), to the point where groups seem to take defensive positions around what they did on behalf of our veterans. This culture makes for some pretty toxic environments, I personally feel contributing to much of the problems we&rsquo;ve seen bubble up into the public media space of late.</p>
<p>While work at the VA you constantly hear about the VA claims backlog, and how we need to optimize, but when you bring up sharing data, or resources to other federal agencies, trusted external partners like hospitals, and VSO&rsquo;s you get pushback with concerns of security, personally identifiable information (PII), etc. All which are valid claims, but there are proven ways to mitigate these risks through Identify and Access Management (IAM), which is another whole post in itself. You start feeling crazy when you get pushback for arguing that a doctor should be able to submit disability questionnaires via an iPad application, that uses an existing VA API, in a way that securely authenticates the doctor.</p>
<p>As a result of other system, cultural issues, and mistakes made in the past, VA employees and contractors are extremely adverse to opening up to the outside world, even if it can help. I kept <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/vatheft/">hearing references to the 2006 data breach</a> as a reason to keep systems locked down, where an employee brought a laptop home, affecting 26M individuals. This horror story, plus a variety of other cultural issues are keeping VA staff from accepting any new way of thinking, even if it could help reduce their workload, improve the claims process, and better serve the veterans and their families.</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period.

<p>I get regular requests to add APIs to my website via email, Twitter, and carrier pigeon. I have an Evernote that I put these requests into, and as I have time, I review, then possibly add to the appropriate API Evangelist network project.</p>
<p>To support this process, I've crafted a new response email to requests I get, that I thought I would share with everyone:</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>Sure thing. It could take me a day or two, or maybe up to a week.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to fork any of the 60+ API Evangelist network projects, and add to the JSON list that is driving the listing, they are all under the /data folder. Otherwise I'll add as I have time in the next week.</p>
<p>Once you submit your pull request, if your company listing is relevant to the research I&rsquo;m doing, I will accept your addition. No guarantees, so make sure it will provide value to not just my research, but to the API community.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing information about your API!</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>It is a little known fact that all <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ plus of my research projects</a> run as Github repositories, using Github and Jekyll to drive the overall website and blog. With this approach, everyone can fork any of my projects, add a company to a listing, post to the blog, or correct a spelling or grammar error.</p>

<blockquote><em>Google Cloud Endpoints consists of tools, libraries and capabilities that allow you to generate APIs and client libraries from an App Engine application, referred to as an API backend, to simplify client access to data from other applications. Endpoints makes it easier to create a web backend for web clients and mobile clients such as Android or Apple's iOS.</em></blockquote>
<p>While much of the Google Cloud Platform offering looks a lot like the cloud offering over at Amazon Web Services, AWS definitely does not have API deployment as a service, baked into their cloud stack, like Google does with Google Cloud Endpoints.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-endpoints-architecture.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Google puts an emphasis on API endpoint deployment for mobile purposes, but leaves it open to be used in JavaScript as well&mdash;which seems a little limiting, since you could call same endpoints in any language. Oh well, I&rsquo;m not writing their marketing.</p>
<blockquote><em>..the API backend is an App Engine app that performs business logic and other functions for Android and iOS clients, as well as JavaScript web clients. The functionality of the backend is made available to clients through Endpoints, which exposes an API that clients can call.</em></blockquote>
<p>Google provides SDKs for Android, iOS, and JavaScript, as well as a very Java heavy development process using <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/getstarted/backend/create_project">Maven</a>, combined with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/cloud_endpoints">Google Plugin for Eclipse</a>, which&nbsp;is used to design, develop, and deploy your APIs to <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.</p>
<p>All Google has to do now, is open up the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Console</a>&nbsp;as a Google Cloud Endpoints management console, giving developers on the Google Cloud Platform the ability to design, deploy, and manage their APIs. Then if Google baked in <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">Google Discovery</a> services for all Google Cloud Endpoints, developers would have a pretty slick discovery layer on top of their cloud API stacks. Hell, all you need then is to allow generation of <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> for each collection, and boom you have a pretty complete API design, deployment, management, and discovery platform in the clouds.</p>
<p>Now that Google is added to my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment research</a>, I will be keeping a closer eye on what they are doing in respects to being a cloud API platform.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-first.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I hear this phrase used more and more lately, &ldquo;An API First Strategy&rdquo;. It is something you hear from startups like <a href="https://www.lob.com/blog/api-first-development-makes-lob-more-productive">printing API LOB</a>, to <a href="https://developer.pearson.com/blog/creating-a-single-platform-for-all-pearson-apis/">established players like Pearson</a>, all the way up to <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F at the GSA in Washington DC</a>, but what is API first? Much like APIs in general, an API first strategy is something that will mean something different to each company, organization, government agency, or individual.</p>
<p>From my view, the most common interpretation of API first will be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Develop an API First</strong> - Before you build your website, web, mobile or single page application you develop an API first, then you get to work on defining the channels you will be making the API resources available on.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had an interesting conversation today with the 18F team in Washington DC, and they illuminated some other possible dimensions to the API first conversation for me, that I wanted to explore a little:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Design Your API First</strong> - Using tools like <a href="http://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, and API definition formats like <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a>, you kick off discussion with customers, generate user stories, and mockup your API, and even your web or mobile app interfaces, using your mock API.</li>
<li><strong>API First In Open Source Software -</strong> Encouraging the development and use of open source software solutions similar to Wordpress, that have API by default, so when agencies deploy them, they always have an API as part of their first steps for making access and integration decision&mdash;something that can drastically shift what is possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to help small business, non-profit organizations, and government of all shapes and sizes understand the benefits of an API first strategy, so having conversation with API leaders like 18F, and getting their view on what API first means is essential to my storytelling process. How do you view API first at your company? How has your development lifecycle evolved since embracing APIs? Let me know, I&rsquo;m curious to hear other views on the phrase.</p>
<p>All three of the dimensions laid out above are very appealing to me. I am big advocate for "API first being" about API design, open source software architectural patterns, or just a way of life before you consider connecting any web, mobile, or single page app to a back-end system. To me, API is more about conversation, collaboration, and access to ideas and resources, before we even get to any technical definition of what an API can be&mdash;making API first strategies more about philosophy and methodology, rather than what technical component you develop first.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/08/next-stable-version-of-apisjson--apisio-is-ready--are-your-apis-discoverable/">published the story last night on finalizing the most recent version of the API discovery format APIs.json</a>, and the support for it in the open source API search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Steve and I are done messing with the format for a while, and want to encourage API providers to begin describing their APIs using the open format.</p>
<p>After publishing the story last night, I also had an interesting comment on Google+ from <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JonasHellstr%C3%B6m/posts">Jonas Hellstr&ouml;m</a>:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apis-json-timeline.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>The question got me thinking about how APIs.json rolled out. As with <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, APIs.json started as a conversation between Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I. Around the beginning of April we combined our notes on what each of us envisioned when it came to API discovery, establishing the first APIs.json definition with the timeline going roughly like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>April 2014&nbsp;</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Steve and I established version .11 of APIs.json</li>
<li>We emailed a handful of smart folks that we trusted for feedback</li>
<li>Crafted version .12 of APIs.json</li>
<li>Developed <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>May 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>We <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/05/20/announcing-apisjson-at-gluecon-2014/">launched API.json at Gluecon</a> in Broomfield, CO</li>
<li>Encouraged discussion via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apisjson">APIs.json Google Group</a></li>
<li>Encouraged feedback via the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">Github issue management</a> on APIs.json repo</li>
<li>Cotinued email Conversations</li>
<li>Established a Twitter presence for <a href="https://twitter.com/apisjson">@apisjson</a></li>
<li>Presented as part of session at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">API Days in Barcelona, Spain</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>June 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Establish version 0.13 of APIs.json</li>
<li>Continued discussion on Google Group</li>
<li>Continued feedback on Github issue management</li>
<li>Continued email conversations&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>July 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Conducted a session on API discovery, including APIs.json at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">APICraft</a> in Detroit</li>
<li>Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) for the work on the JSON schema (thank you Tony!)</li>
<li>Established version <a href="http://apisjson.org/format/apisjson_0.14.txt">0.14 of APIs.json</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>August 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Updated APIs.json for API Evangelist network to version 0.14</li>
<li>Updated APIs.io to support version 0.14 of APIs.json</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been an interesting five months. I like to record things like this while they are fresh in my mind, because as time moves on, the details fade into the past. I feel like if I do not capture the moment, it will be forgotten and it will be like it never happened.</p>
<p>I think we got the feedback from the community we needed to get to the first stable version, and I want to thank&nbsp;@fehguy, @mamund, @darrel_miller, @OriPekelman, @xmlgrrl, @johnmusser, and the attendees at Gluecon, APIDays, and APICraft for listening, and providing feedback. Also thanks to&nbsp;Jonas Hellstr&ouml;m for your great question!</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> looks like in 2015--it is a very exciting time!</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.sydcon.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chicago/sydcon/sydcon-web-development.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just talked with Dave Devitt (<a href="https://twitter.com/sydcon">@sydcon</a>), President at <a title="SYDCON web development inc. in Chicago" href="http://www.sydcon.com/">SYDCON Web Development, Inc. in Chicago</a> about how his web and mobile development shop sees the world APIs. I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for stories about how the everyday person on the ground at startups, all the way up to the federal government, actually see the world of APIs, and I was pleased that Dave could make some time to share his view of APIs with me.</p>
<p>First, Dave said something I found very interesting when we first started our conversation. He said they were a &ldquo;web development shop&rdquo;, not in the the sense that they build websites, but that they develop applications that use the web for their operations.  I think this is an important distinction when we start putting developers  into buckets, and it isn&rsquo;t always as straightforward as building websites, web applications, mobile, single page or Internet of Things apps&mdash;we are now building software that uses the Internet for communication, something that will inevitably use all of these channels (and more).</p>
<p>When it comes to API usage at SYDCON, they primarily use what we all call public APIs for driving commerce. Whether it is B2B or B2C, Dave&rsquo;s team is using APIs to sell products, integrate with payment systems like Authorize.net and PayPal, activating and validating of gift cards. Whether it is the nature of development or just a reflection on the type of customers SYDCON has, commerce is a pretty clear motivator for public API integration. The modern web API movement was started by commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Paypal, and 14 years in it makes sense that commerce is a major driver of development at smaller develop shops.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sydcon"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chicago/sydcon/dave-nevitt-sydcon.jpeg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Beyond commerce, the main usage of APIs at SYDCON is about opening up access to internal resources that exist within their client systems, and making them available to buid apps on top of. Dave provided an example of a oil &amp; gas worker who uses one of the mobile applications they&rsquo;ve developed to scan the barcode of a 4 inch PVC pipe, and using an API the mobile application is then able to access the company&rsquo;s internal product database and return information to the worker looking to get their job done, with the assistance of the mobile app they've developed. APIs are how they deliver the resources they need for the mobile applications they develop for their customers. Period. It can be products in a database, or media across servers, APIs are how these reousrces are delivered to the web enabled applications SYDCON delivers.</p>
<p>It was good to hear the stories from Dave at <a title="SYDCON web development inc. in Chicago" href="http://www.sydcon.com/">SYDCON</a>, and understand what API usage looks like on the ground at a Chicago area application dev shop. I think we can easily get blind to what the mainstream developers are needing when it comes to APIs, being so close to the Silicon Valley echo chamber, as well as playing a part in some of the bleeding edge aspects of the API sector. Talking with people like Dave who actually are making a living developing APIs, and web enabled applications, whether it is a web or mobile, is extremely valuable to me when I am working to better understand the realities of the API space.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time today Dave. I have calls scheduled with other web and mobile development shops, as well as some IT and analytics firms, as I lead up to the API conversations we will be having at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago</a>. The event is titled &ldquo;APIs Go Mainstream&rdquo;, so I think that conversations with small and medium sized development shops about how APIs are impacting their day to day worlds are super relevant, and something the larger API industry should tune into.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-platform-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was browsing through <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google&rsquo;s Cloud Platform</a>, in the 15 minute lead up to a preliminary discussion with Google about being an evangelist for the platform (another story), and I saw a useful pattern from the "customers" section for publishing API customer case studies--something I wanted to share with you.</p>
<p>This pattern was evident in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/redbus/">Travel Agency Masters Big Data with Google BigQuery case study</a>. I think the format for the case study provides a simple format that other API providers might consider following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A catchy summary title&nbsp;</li>
<li>Challenge the company faced&nbsp;</li>
<li>Solution to the problem&nbsp;</li>
<li>A quote from company&nbsp;</li>
<li>Results from the solution</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/redbus/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-cloud-platform/logo-redbus.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, Google provides an "At a Glance" summary in the left hand bar, for those busy folks who don't have the time to read case studies, providing a quick summary of the case study:</p>
<ul>
<li>What they wanted to do&nbsp;</li>
<li>What they did&nbsp;</li>
<li>What they accomplished&nbsp;</li>
<li>About API service used</li>
</ul>
<p>The outline for the case study, as well as the summary version is a nice, simple format that any API provider could use to when crafting their own API case study experience. The format allows for easy scanning by visitors, which allows for us busy folks to read, or quickly scan multiple case studies--giving more context to the potential value an API will deliver.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Steve (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>), Nicolas (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a>), and I have been working hard to gather all the feedback from some very smart folks on the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">API.json format</a>. Now we are stoked to finally announce that we have the <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">0.14 version</a> ready for prime time. Our goal with the first version of APIs.json, was to just get the idea out there to get feedback from the community, and after four iterations, we feel like the format is now something the community can really build on.</p>
<p>First, lets recap, what is APIs.json? APIs.json is a machine readable JSON file that lives in the root of your domain, and describes your APIs and its supporting API program.</p>
<p>Think of APIs.json as a <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/">robots.txt</a>, or <a href="http://www.google.com/sitemap.xml">sitemap.xml</a> from Google, but instead of describing all the pages of your website, an APIs.json describes your developer portal, all available APIs, and the supporting building blocks of your API program--allowing you to describe your API efforts whether it is a public, or private affair. The goal is simply to provide a machine readable description, that any search engine can crawl, and make sense of your overall API program, and each individual API resource.</p>
<p>The real power of APIs.json lies in the properties that you can apply to your APIs. We wanted to start with providing basic links meant for humans, like a link to the API signup page, or documentation, but then quickly provide machine readable elements like a <a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger specification</a>, or <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a> manifest. However we don&rsquo;t want to define and control all of the properties you use to describe your APIs, and while we have a <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues/44">short list of additional properties</a> that we are adding in on the next version, you can use any property you like just by adding x- to your own type label.</p>
<p><a href="http://apis.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-io/apis-io.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Along with the <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">APIs.json 0.14</a> release, the API search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> also supports the latest APIs.json format. You can now validate your APIs.json 0.14, and submit your API.json for indexing using the APIs.io interface or API (mind blown). Your APIs.json will be your gateway to API discovery in the future, and since <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> is an open source API search engine, it will just be the first of a wave of new API search engines to emerge, built on the APIs.json format.</p>
<p>While we will be making slight changes in coming versions of APIs.json, we feel like the format is now ready for prime time, and we encourage the entire API community to begin participating in the next generation of <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a>, where your API, and the details of your API program are machine readable, and discoverable, in a single, known location at your company, organization, or agencies &nbsp;public or private domain.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-connector.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing an increase in the number of API deployment services this year, such as startups like <a href="http://bit.ly/1jLr1Pf">StrongLoop</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>. These companies are looking to help all of us deploy APIs from common systems, often without the need for IT or programming resources.</p>
<p>The providers I&rsquo;m seeing emerge are catering to some of the lowest hanging fruit for deploying APIs. The commonly used, and easiest to access systems, that contain the valuable content, data, and media we need to make accessible via APIs.</p>
<p>The common source for many of these API deploy solutions are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Excel Spreadsheet&nbsp;with</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://sheetlabs.com">SheetLabs</a></li>
<li><strong>Google Spreadsheet&nbsp;from</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a></li>
<li><strong>Database&nbsp;At The</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/">Dream Factory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These common information sources, represent the places where the average person in any size company, organization or government agency will be storing their valuable resources.  It makes sense that this new wave of API deployment startups would target these services.</p>
<p>If you consider every system integration option that classic API gateways have delivered, it provides a good reference for finding opportunities for building independent API deployment solutions, that if done right, could be a startup all by itself.</p>
<p>Not all companies can afford a full API gateway solution, and their needs are too small for a gateway. There is an emerging opportunity to help people quickly deploy APIs from common sources like spreadsheet, database, file stores, as well as more unique sources like specialty CMS and CRM systems.</p>
<p>Sometimes I like to look at the expanding API universe as a result of the SOA big bang, where all the tools that were in your SOA toolbox, being liberated, and available as independent services that you can get from an increasing number of new API deployment startups.</p>

To prepare for #APIStrat I found 32 local Chicago breweries:</p>
