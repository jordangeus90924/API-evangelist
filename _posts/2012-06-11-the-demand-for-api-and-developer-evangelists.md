<p>I just got off the phone with a recruiter of a major API management company, looking to recruit me as a developer evangelist, and last week I talked with two companies looking for developer evangelists.
<p>My profile comes up in a lot of searches on Google, LinkedIn , and with the growing number of APIs, the number of companies looking to fill the role, grows as well. It makes sense that I come up in searches and get a regular stream of calls.
<p>Most recruiters I decline, as I&rsquo;m looking to pay attention to the bigger picture, beyond just a single API--and tell them I will put out a signal to my network, about the role.  I do this knowing, there really is nobody to fill the role.
<p>The recruiter today asked an interesting question.  If you're not available, what type of person should I be looking for?  In my mind, an evangelist should be equal parts:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Engineer</li>
<li>Product Development</li>
<li>Business Development</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you can find anyone coming from one of those disciplines, but has the technical chops and isn&rsquo;t afraid of programming-I recommend starting with whichever of those skillsets is most important to you.
<p>Ideally you want to find someone who has been programming for years, but recently has been a lead developer or architect, and has upper management experience as well as understands the business and customer end of operations.
<p>If you fit the profile of an API or developer evangelist, or are just curious about the role, drop me a line I&rsquo;d like to talk more, there is potentially a huge demand out there for your skills.
