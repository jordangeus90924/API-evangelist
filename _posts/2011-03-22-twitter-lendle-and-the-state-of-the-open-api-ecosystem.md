{% include JB/setup %}<p>As such, there has been much discussion recently about Open APIs and whether or not third party developers are wise or foolish to build their businesses on someone elses platform.The concern stems from a number of reasons, least of which being Twitters pronouncements about the rules of the road for its ecosystem, and now Lendles announcement that Amazon has revoked its access to the Amazon API.The reactions to both Twitter and Amazon have been pretty strong.And while I do think Twitter is making some serious mistakes with its approach to its API and developer ecosystem, we might be making some mistakes of our own if we lump the Lendle/Amazon issue in to concerns about Twitter.Is Amazon shutting down apps that are poaching on its ecosystem?</p>
