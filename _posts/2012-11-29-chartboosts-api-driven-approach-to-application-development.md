The team over at [Chartboost][1] have a pretty forward thinking [blog post about what they see as the next generation of web application development][2].

They feel that the future is about creating web applications, not sites. The server side should be an API and the client should be a self-contained app which uses the API as its back-end. With mobile applications following the same pattern.

To practice what they preach, Charboost is overhauling their help site to be an API driven web app using the following approach:

  * **Push State** \- Provide site navigation without page refreshes by faking navigation and inserting JavaScript callbacks
  * **JSON-API** \- A REST API providing JSON to drive the site
  * **Responsive Design** \- Providing an application design that responds to mobile as well as it does laptops or desktop computers
  * **Vector (Icon Fonts **
