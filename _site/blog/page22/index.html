	<p>This blog is dedicated to understanding the world of APIs, exploring a wide range of topics from design to deprecation, and spanning the technology, business, and politics of APIs. <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist" target="_blank">All of this runs on Github, so if you see a mistake, you can either fix by submitting a pull request, or let us know by submitting a Github issue for the repository</a>.</p>

<p>I had someone ask me the other day if I had any numbers on how many APIs are used in a modern web or mobile applications--great question! I often refer to the growth in the number of APIs we use, but this is really just anecdotal, and not based on any real facts.</p>
<p>In August, as part of the&nbsp;lead up to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/APIStrat">@APIStrat</a>&nbsp;I am spending more time reaching out to dev shops in Chicago, with the most recent talks with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/18/how-are-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-bryson-pouw-at-blaze-portfolio/">Bryson Pouw at Blaze Portfolio</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">Dave Devitt at SYDCON</a>. In future conversation I will make sure and ask the dev shops how many APIs they use in the average app they deliver.</p>
<p>If you have any data on the average number of APIs used in web or mobile apps at your agency, or know of research or stories that talk about this, please let me know.  Until now, many of the numbers being reported in the API space are coming from providers, I think we need to start gathering, tracking on, and reporting on API usage from the API consumption side of the coin.</p>

<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> was designed to be a versatile API discovery format, not just a format for public API discovery via search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. An APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable index of APIs within a single developer hub, providing information on the API endpoints as well as any other supporting resources--there is no reason that all of this can&rsquo;t also be applied in a private setting.</p>
<p>APIs.json can easily be placed within a domain, subdomain, or at any network address, and be used to describe an internal collection of API resources, as well as bring in outside APIs. APIs.jsonbui excels at aggregating multiple, potentially disparate APIs, into a single coherent collection for use in development.</p>
<p>Using internal APIs.json files, a company, organization or governent agency can deploy an instance of an open source API search engine like APIs.io, or develop a custom API search tool that can aggregate the different APIs.json from each location, into a company wide API search and discovery destination.</p>
<p>An APIs.json provides a framework for referencing each APIs machine readable definition in Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML format, as well as other resources that internal developers will need to be successful, such as authentication info, SDKs, terms of service, and the multitude of other <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks</a>.</p>
<p>If you have public APIs, it will be a no brainer for you to generate machine readable API definitions for your APIs, and add them to a single, or potentially multiple <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> files for indexing. Even if you don&rsquo;t have public APis, you can put APIs.json to work improving your internal API discovery, while also opening up your API resources to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">other benefits of having machine readable API definitions</a>.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stacks.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I used to publish out a list of curated stories each week, and a listing of the top 25 APIs I was paying attention to during my regular monitoring of the API space to a site I called <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>. When i went to Washington DC last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, I suspended that weekly ritual, and never picked up after my world got back to normal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still monitoring about 1000 companies, with over 2000 total APIs, and curating the stories--I just don&rsquo;t take the time each week to publish them to The API Stack. In an effort to try and reboot the project, provide value to the API Evangelist network, as well as to you my loayal reader, I've republished a new reflection of my work at the Github project. Right now it just lists 819 of the companies who are doing interesting things with APis in 114 categories.</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks I will be reviewing each of these 819 companies APIs, and as I validate them, I will publish more detail. You can search for General Services Administration (GSA), under the <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=federal-stack">Federal Stack</a> to see an example of this work in action. I link to each of the GSA APIs, across multiple domains, and include a machine readable API definition as well as interactive documentation generated from the definition.</p>
<p>The API Stack will continue to be a window into my API targeting and monitoring, and I will update regularly as I have time. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that going forward, the API space needs to focus on the quality of APIs, and not just the number of APIs available, and <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a> reflects this way of thinking, playing out in my own work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blaze-portfolio/atom-align-blaze-portfolio.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently talked with Bryson Pouw (<a href="https://twitter.com/bpouw">@bpouw</a>), Founder / CEO at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com">Blaze Portfolio Systems</a> in Chicago about how his portfolio management and trading technology company sees the world of APIs. Last week <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">I had talked with Dave Devitt (@sydcon), President at SYDCON, a web development shop</a>, and this week I was very interested to hear Bryson&rsquo;s view on APIs, because his company is a little more niche, focusing specifically on the needs of the investment professional.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com/features/model-rebalancing">Atom Align</a>, the Blaze Portfolio Systems flagship product is looking to help investment professionals better manage their portfolios, and a big enabler of this is the <a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com/atom-align-api">Atom Align API</a>,&nbsp;which provides programmatic access to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Information Queries</strong> &ndash; Obtain the list of portfolios, orders, brokers, and securities</li>
<li><strong>Trade Orders</strong> &ndash; Place, execute, cancel, and allocate trade orders</li>
<li><strong>Manage Trade Extracts </strong>&ndash; Create and download trade extract file</li>
</ul>
<p>The Atom Align API is only made available to trusted Blaze Portfolio partners and clients upon request, while also being used internally to drive system integrations. This approach to API design, as the core for specialty, or even widely available web and mobile applications, <a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-market-graph.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>is the signature of a software development shop that has evolved and realized that a core API stack is essential for internal, as well as external integrations&mdash;APIs aren&rsquo;t just for public consumption when it comes to todays dev shop operations.</p>
<p>Beyond their own internal Atom Align API, Blaze Portfolio also uses several other financial related APIs as part of their core operations. APIs are core to the Atom Align secret sauce, aggregating, refining, and making sense of markets by pulling data and content from multiple API sources, most notably <a href="ttp://www.xignite.com/">financial data from Xignite</a>.  You can&rsquo;t be an investment professional in 2014 without having the right technology in your toolbox, and Blaze Portfolio has done well aggregating financial data from public API sources, into tje tool the pros are needing.</p>
<p>Blaze Portfolio Systems designing, deploying, and managing their own internal APIs, as well as consuming multiple publicly available APIs, provides an interesting blueprint that other software development shops can follow. There is money to be made in managing your own API infrastructure, using the best of breed, publicly available data and API sources--then craft it all into your own API driven software solution that can deliver web, mobile, or even device based solutions for niche or mainstream customers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2014</span>

<p>I spend a lot of time looking for good quality logos to represent the companies I track on and write stories about. I have a certain vision in my head about how I want company listings and detail pages to look across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>&mdash;something that takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>To support this vision, I spend a lot of time looking for logos. Sometimes you can find them in the header of a website, but often times they are poor quality, not configured to be standalone, or difficult to get at for any number of other reasons--making my work a lot tougher.</p>
<p>I published a new list of 819 companies who are doing interesting things with APIs that I call&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>. After publishing the project, <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>, one of the <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=travel-stack">travel API providers</a>&nbsp;listed, tweeted at me asking if I could replace their logo with a better quality one from their <a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/logos">official logo page</a>--I did so very quickly!</p>
<p>I sure love me a good logo and branding page for an API. It makes my life easier, by giving me a single place to go get high quality logos, without having to open up my image editor. I wish that more API platforms would have a well designed logo page like <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2014</span>

<p>I wrote about&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/what-is-an-api-first-strategy-adding-some-dimensions-to-this-new-question/">What Is An API First Strategy? Adding Some Dimensions To This New Question</a> the other day after talking with <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. One of the commonets on the post was&nbsp;from my friend Logan Powell (<a href="https://twitter.com/logantpowell">@logantpowell</a>), and I think it was so good, that it deserves its own post. I will let Logan do the talking:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To supplement the pool of meaning here, I would like to add that an API-first strategy is one where the API serves as both a pattern of an enterprises IT architecture as well as catalyst for engagement.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In a nutshell, an API-first strategy is a systems paradigm shift</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>-- from a centralized, engineered mechanical system made up of subordinate parts serving as means to deliberately designed ends</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>-- to a decentralized, organic and evolving ecosystem where the individual actors can be spontaneously enfranchised or co-opted by any other actor / set of actors to serve new purposes.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>This allows the system to be more flexible, respond more quickly and behave more dynamically to suit unforeseen purposes. I believe the API-first paradigm is thereby more scalable by nature.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Prudent separation of information from presentation through APIs should be the first and next step for most organizations with large IT infrastructures. To be more specific, this provides a number of efficiency benefits. To just name a few: by modulating infrastructure with solid APIs, stakeholders can create / hack together production-ready applications faster, more securely and more reliably.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This approach warrants a new form of IT team protocol wherein the curation of APIs is front-and-center to their role. When designing a new product / service, the design of it's API should be commensurate. As the product or service makes it's way to production, making sure the API is well documented, easy to use / as conventional as possible, hooked up with analytics, secure and prepared to scale should be a given (these are frequently included in any self-respecting API management solution). In so doing, not only might the enterprise benefit from the speedier and more rewarding 'dog-fooding' of these services / resources, if they ever decide to commercialize or publicize / open them up to users outside their organization (the decision to flip the switch itself being informed by the aforementioned analytics), it's just an invite / key request away.</em></p>
<p>Logan works in the federal government, on some pretty high value open data and API projects, and he is on the frontline for how APIs can be a catalyst for change within enterprise IT, but also connect externally in some meaningful ways--in short he knows his stuff, and is helping internalize APIs across the federal government.</p>
<p>What Logan describes IS why I believe so paassionately in APIs. In my mind It is the culural change, with an eye towards exernal interactions and conversations that make APIs work, and while the tech of APIs is critical, it is the cultural, organizational, and ultimately the human aspects of APIs that make the biggest impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> is published as a <a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal">Github repository</a>, using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to actually deliver the website. The feedback I&rsquo;ve been giving to the team, has been done through the <a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal/issues">Github issue management for the repository</a>.</p>
<p>One piece of feedback I left was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I love that when I land on your home page, I get a brief description of what developer.trade.gov delivers, the probem is that the description is below the fold on some monitors, leaving just the 3 links available to see.</em></p>

<p>I submitted&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal/issues/20#issue-40274346">the suggestion 5 hours ago</a>, and I just received an update that the issue was closed, and my suggestions were incorporated. When you go to the <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> website now, you will see the text, with links to the right&mdash;creating a much more clean, informative, and usable way to deliver the most valuable real estate you have in your developer hub. It was a small, but quick and meaningful change to a government website.</p>
<p>Imagine if we could help other agencies see the benefit of publishing small, simple websites, developer hubs, single page apps, and other projects to Github, and manage their feedback loops via Github issues. What types of improvements in delivering government services would we see? What cost savings could be realized across government?</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/trade-gov/developer-trade-gov.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I got a gentle ping today, as I often do when there is a new developer hub or API launched in the federal government. This time it was located within the Department of Commerce, for the International Trade Administration, and was a new developer area, with five APIs at <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a>.</p>
<p>I quickly went through the new developer area, which I consider passing the test for a minimum viable developer area, possessing all the essential building blocks an API developer hub needs. The only places I feel it fell short is in the feedback loop, and providing machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs.</p>
<p>I submitted my feedback as Github issues, on the repository for the developer hub, but when it comes to machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs, I know how easy this is, so rather than just submit issues, I figured I'd get to work generating the machine readable API definitions for Developer.Trade.Gov, and demonstrate what was possible. As I do with all of my work, I setup a <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/">subdomain, and Github repository</a>, to store all of my work, and got to work on each of the five APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/market-research-library.html">Market Research Library</a> (<a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/definitions/market-research-library.json">Swagger</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/ita-office-locations.html">ITA Offices &amp; Centers</a> (<a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/definitions/ita-offices-and-centers.json">Swagger</a>)</li>
<li>Trade Events</li>
<li>Trade Leads</li>
<li>Trade News &amp; Articles</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I chose to use <a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger</a> for creating my machine readable API definitions, and while I was waiting for the Github commit to take for the Market Research Library API Swagger definition + Swagger UI, I got to work on the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API. As I was finishing up, I reloaded the <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/market-research-library-api.html">interactive docs for the Market Research Library API</a>, and got the dreaded CORS warning:</p>
<blockquote><em>Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://api.trade.gov/market_research_library/search?keyword=travel. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.</em></blockquote>
<p>That is where the fun ends for me. I can keep creating Swagger specs for the other three APIs, but I won&rsquo;t be able to play with them until I create a proxy to make calls through, and open up CORS on my end. I will make time to do this over the weekend, but until then the fun stops. I am hoping they will also open up CORS, but I'm sure it will take a while.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>To wrap up my work, I also generated an <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json file for the Developer.Trade.Gov domain</a>, listing the details for both the Market Research Library API, and the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API--opening up the APIs to discovery by API search engines like APIs.io. When Developer.Trade.Gov publishes the APIs.json + Swagger specs under their domain, it will become more authoratative and given prominence in search engine results.</p>
<p>In about 2 hours, I was able to review a new developer area, and five APIs, generate two swagger specs, 1 APIs.json, publish to a Github repository where I launched interactive documentation for each of the two APIs, and wrap up with this story of my work. As with all of my work, you can find all of this <a href="https://github.com/commerce-data/developer.trade.gov">work at the Github repository,</a> and the best part is, when I pick the work back up, it is all in one location, <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/blog/">with complete notes about what I did</a>&mdash;helping me understand where I left off, in addition to allowing anyone else to step in and learn from the process.</p>

<p>I spoke with Phil Windley (<a href="https://twitter.com/windley">@windley</a>) over at <a href="http://byu.edu">Brigham Young University (BYU)</a> about their API strategy this morning. BYU is bringing together API providers and consumers, to establish a coordinated strategy for delivering designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs across campus--an effort being led by <a href="http://cio.byu.edu/">CIO Kelly Flannagan</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/kelflanagan">@kelflanagan</a>).</p>
<p>As part of their latest API effort, BYU is focusing in on the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to campus resources:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Students</li>
<li>Instructors</li>
<li>Classrooms</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The API team is still struggling with a handful of technical details like how to deal with unique identifiers, and relationship between resources, but overall they are on a healthy path when it comes to getting their API designed, and deployed for use at the institution. I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how fast they progress with a top down approach to APIs, vs the bottom up efforts I&rsquo;m seeing at institutions like <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>.</p>
<p>I will be talking their team regularly, about their design, deployment, management, and integration strategy. I want to make sure and document the process all along the way, and share real-time updates that other universities can follow along, or possibly collaborate with us when it comes to establishing some common API patterns we can share and re-use across higher educational institutions.</p>
<p>Look for any stories out of BYU, here on API Evangelist, or over at my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university API research site</a>, and if you are doing any API work at your school, I'd love to know more about it.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I just wrote a piece on r<a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/13/replacing-legacy-systems-with-apis-at-the-department-of-veteran-affairs/">eplacing legacy systems at the VA using APIs</a>, where one of the systemic constraints in place that restricts the modernizzation VA systems using API is purely about money, and more specifically the color of money. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the detail of the topic, but in short the color of money is: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_procurement_in_the_United_States">Money appropriated for one purpose cannot be used for a different purpose, according to the Purpose Act (31 U.S.C. &sect; 1301)</a>.</p>
<p>In short, if $50M was given to sustain an existing legacy system, and that money cannot be re-appropriated, and applied to the newer system, what incentive is there to ever get rid of legacy VA systems, or modernize any government system for that matter? Whether it is usng APIs, or anything else. Newer approaches to using technology are difficult to accept when you are working hard to accomplished your job each day, but if you already have $50M in budget to a specific job, and that job won&rsquo;t go away, unless you choose to make it go away, guess what happens? Nothing changes&hellip;hmmm?</p>
<p>As I said before, I don&rsquo;t give a shit if you deploy APIs from the ground up, or excite via a presidential mandates from the top down, if you have incentives in place for employees to do the opposite, based upon how money is allocated, you won&rsquo;t be changing any behavior or culture&mdash;you are wasting your energy. I don&rsquo;t care how excited I get any one individual, team or department about the potential of APIs bundled with new systems, if it means their job is going away&mdash;too bad, nobody will give a shit.</p>
<p>Think about this scenario, then consider that <a href="https://www.voa.va.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DocumentID=1942">$1,810M of the 3,323M overall VA budget (54%) is sustainment</a>. Granted this isn't all IT system sustainment, but still over half of the budget is allocated to keep shit the same as it is. Imagine what environment this creates for the acceptance of modernization efforts at VA.</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/digital-strategy/logos/va.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>One of the jobs I was tasked with at the VA as a PIF, was taking inventory of the web services within the agency. When asking folks where these web services were, I was directed to various IT Leads on different groups, each giving one or two more locations I could look for word, excel, or other PDFs talking about web services used in projects and known systems. Most of the time these were redundant lists, pointing me to the same 5 web services, and omitting 20-30 that were actually in use for a project.</p>
<p>At one point I was given the contact information for a lady who had been working for two years on a centralized web registry project, that would be the holy grail of web service discovery at the VA. This was it! It was what I was looking for, until I sat in on the weekly call where this project got a 10 minute update, demonstrating that the registry was still about defining the how and what of the registry, and never has actually moved to cataloging actual web services in the wild at the VA. ;-(</p>
<p>Then one day I was introduced to a gentlemen, that was in a back office, in an unmarked cubicle, who seemed to know where most of the web services were, the one difference with this person was that they were a contractor, and not an employee. One thing you hear about, but do not experience fully until you work in government is the line between government employee and contractor&mdash;in meetings, and conversations you know who is who (it is pretty clar), but when it comes to finding APIs, I&rsquo;m sorry the contractors know where everything is at. This contractor had some pretty interesting lists of what web services were in operation, where they were, and which groups at VA owned them, including up to date contact info. These contractors also had their finger on the pulse of any project that was potentially moving the web services converations forward, including the global registry.</p>
<p>Overall I was surprised at how IT groups knew of their own web services, could care less about the web services of other groups, but contractors new where all the web service were across the groups. I was closing in on 500 web services on my list before <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/11/15/why-i-exited-my-presidential-innovation-fellowship/">I left during the shutdown</a>, and I wonder how many else I would have found if I kept up the good fight. This mission had nothing do with API, except that web services are often compared to APis, I was purely taking inventory of what was already in place, a process that went far beyond just technical inventory, and shed light on some serious business and political flaws within operations at the VA.</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-onion.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the byproducts of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/10/where-will-your-api-stand-in-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-debate/">Oracle vs Google API copyright case</a>, was a realization that many API providers and consumer do not understand the layers of the API stack, let alone the potential licensing considerations for each layer of the API onion. I wouldn't just blame API providers, and consumers, I&rsquo;m still getting a grasp on all of this, which is why I'm blogging about the subject.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick crack at defining the layers to the potential API licensing onion:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Data</strong> - What is the licensing for the actual data returned and collected by an API? I&rsquo;m still learning about the ways to license your data, and the <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/faq/licenses/">Open Data Commons provides some guidance in this area</a>, while others feel that your data can just as be easily licensed using <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licensing.</li>
<li><strong>Data Model </strong>- The separation between data and its data model can be hard to see, where in reality end-users may own their data, but the order and structure of it can be owned by the originating application. If this layer is a concern, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, or other copyright options should be considered. </li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - Server side API code is the core of any API operations, and should be licensed accordingly using <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses">common open source software licens</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">es</span>&nbsp;when appropriate. However I would add that this is the one layer in the API stack where a proprietary licensing could make sense, but the rest of the stack should always be licensed as open as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Interface</strong> - The separation between the API and its surface area is important, and is something that is just becoming relevant with the Oracle v Google copyright case. Understanding the importance of an openly licensed surface area, is essential to the health of any API stack, and should be kep as open as possible, even when associated with a proprietary API backend. This is why we started <a href="http://apicommons.org">API commons</a>, to help API providers take a stance on the license of the surface area of the API stack.</li>
<li><strong>Clients</strong> - As with server side code, you should apply<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses"> common open source software licensing</a>&nbsp;to client code when appropriate, but your client code samples, libraries and SDKs should never be licensed in a proprietary way, encouraging implementation for any commercial integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario we are talking about a purely data API, if you are serving up some sort of programmatic resource, things might be different. My goal is to just try and understand the separation between the API layers, and apply some thoughts on how licenses can be applied to open, or possibly close access and constraint an APIs operation.</p>
<p>Much like other political building blocks of the API ecosystem, licensing in the aPI stack can be good, bad, or neutral. In the end, regardless of your stance I think it is important to have an open conversation about how our API stack is licensed, so that your consumers can better understand what they are in for.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/digital-strategy/logos/va.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, slowly bringing them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>On deck are my thoughts on <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">replacing legacy systems with APIs</span></em>, at the Department of Veteran Affairs. In the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, one of the motivations for deploying APIs, is to assist in the evolution, and replacement of legacy systems. The theory is, you have older system that needs to be replaced, and you can wrap in a modern web API, and slowly switch any desktop, web, mobile or other client system to use the new API&mdash;then you build out newer backend system, and make the switch in the API layer from the legacy to the newer backend system, leaving everything operating as expected. API magic!</p>
<p>I'm used to hostile environments to this way of thinking, but most times in the private sector there are other business objectives that can be leveraged to get legacy system owners to get on board with a shift towards API deployment&mdash;I saw no incentive for this practice in the VA environment, where in reality there are incentives for IT, and business owners, as well as 3rd party contractors to keep legacy systems in place, not replace them. There are a variety of motivation for existing VA workers to keep existing systems in place, ranging from not understanding how the system works, to budgetary restrictions on how money flows in support of this pro-sustainment culture.</p>
<p>Here is an example. There is old database for storing of a specific type of document, a database that X amount of existing desktop, server, web, or even mobile systems depend on. If I move in and create an API, that allows for reading and writing of data into this database, then work with all X of the legacy systems to use the API instead of a direct database connection&mdash;in theory I can now work to dismantle the legacy database, and replace with a newer, modern backend database. In most IT operations, this approach will then allow me to replace, modernize and evolve upon an existing legacy system. This is a common view of technologists who are purely looking through a technical lens, and ignoring the existing business and political constraints that exist in some companies, organizations, insitutions and government agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the real world, you have staff, budgets, workflows, and decision making processes that are already in place. Let&rsquo;s say this legacy database had $50M a year allocated in budget for its operation, and I replace with a newer database, plus API, which operates for $10M a year&mdash;you&rsquo;d think I get to reallocate the staff, budget, and other resources to developing newer mobile apps, and other system with my newly liberated $40M. Right? Nope&hellip;that money goes away, and those people have no interest in moving from supporting a COBOL system, to supporting a new MongoDB + Node.js API that is driving a Swift iPhone app. ;-(</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large companies, organizations, institutions and government agencies operate, that are in conflict with what an API philosphy can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin to weave my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.</p>

<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I was given three projects when I started work at the VA: 1) Inventory data assets 2) Inventory web services 3) Move forward D2D, a forms web service that would allow VA hospitals and Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to submit forms through the claims process on behalf of  veteran.</p>
<p>The most prevalent illness I witnessed across these three efforts was a unwillingness to trust outside groups (even VSOs and hospitals), and a lack of desire to share data and resources to anyone outside of the VA (ironically except contractors), to the point where groups seem to take defensive positions around what they did on behalf of our veterans. This culture makes for some pretty toxic environments, I personally feel contributing to much of the problems we&rsquo;ve seen bubble up into the public media space of late.</p>
<p>While work at the VA you constantly hear about the VA claims backlog, and how we need to optimize, but when you bring up sharing data, or resources to other federal agencies, trusted external partners like hospitals, and VSO&rsquo;s you get pushback with concerns of security, personally identifiable information (PII), etc. All which are valid claims, but there are proven ways to mitigate these risks through Identify and Access Management (IAM), which is another whole post in itself. You start feeling crazy when you get pushback for arguing that a doctor should be able to submit disability questionnaires via an iPad application, that uses an existing VA API, in a way that securely authenticates the doctor.</p>
<p>As a result of other system, cultural issues, and mistakes made in the past, VA employees and contractors are extremely adverse to opening up to the outside world, even if it can help. I kept <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/vatheft/">hearing references to the 2006 data breach</a> as a reason to keep systems locked down, where an employee brought a laptop home, affecting 26M individuals. This horror story, plus a variety of other cultural issues are keeping VA staff from accepting any new way of thinking, even if it could help reduce their workload, improve the claims process, and better serve the veterans and their families.</p>
<p>This is a pretty fundamental flaw in how large government agencies operate, that are in conflict with the solutions API can bring to the table. I don&rsquo;t give a shit how well designed your API is, in this environment you will fail. Period. I do not think I will ever fully understand what I saw at the VA, while a PIF in Washington DC, but I feel like I&rsquo;m finally reaching a point where I can at least talk about things publicly, put my thoughts out there, and begin my experiences as a PIF at the VA into my overall API Evangelist message.</p>

<p>I get regular requests to add APIs to my website via email, Twitter, and carrier pigeon. I have an Evernote that I put these requests into, and as I have time, I review, then possibly add to the appropriate API Evangelist network project.</p>
<p>To support this process, I've crafted a new response email to requests I get, that I thought I would share with everyone:</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>Sure thing. It could take me a day or two, or maybe up to a week.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to fork any of the 60+ API Evangelist network projects, and add to the JSON list that is driving the listing, they are all under the /data folder. Otherwise I'll add as I have time in the next week.</p>
<p>Once you submit your pull request, if your company listing is relevant to the research I&rsquo;m doing, I will accept your addition. No guarantees, so make sure it will provide value to not just my research, but to the API community.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing information about your API!</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>It is a little known fact that all <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ plus of my research projects</a> run as Github repositories, using Github and Jekyll to drive the overall website and blog. With this approach, everyone can fork any of my projects, add a company to a listing, post to the blog, or correct a spelling or grammar error.</p>
<p>Just remember, when you are looking to get the word out about your API, or new feature, you can help curate and publish on the API Evangelist network.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-platform-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was taking another look at the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a> yesterday, and stumbled across <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/?_ga=1.186468064.812314948.1407779892">Google Cloud Endpoints</a>. It was something I saw come across my feeds, but really didn&rsquo;t give it the time it needed to see what it was all about.  With the new Google Cloud Endpoints, Google is making a strong push to be not just an API deployment provider, but their approach also reflects what I&rsquo;d consider to be an evolution of backend as a service (BaaS) deployment.</p>
<p>I think Google describes their service better than I can do it justice:</p>
<blockquote><em>Google Cloud Endpoints consists of tools, libraries and capabilities that allow you to generate APIs and client libraries from an App Engine application, referred to as an API backend, to simplify client access to data from other applications. Endpoints makes it easier to create a web backend for web clients and mobile clients such as Android or Apple's iOS.</em></blockquote>
<p>While much of the Google Cloud Platform offering looks a lot like the cloud offering over at Amazon Web Services, AWS definitely does not have API deployment as a service, baked into their cloud stack, like Google does with Google Cloud Endpoints.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-endpoints-architecture.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Google puts an emphasis on API endpoint deployment for mobile purposes, but leaves it open to be used in JavaScript as well&mdash;which seems a little limiting, since you could call same endpoints in any language. Oh well, I&rsquo;m not writing their marketing.</p>
<blockquote><em>..the API backend is an App Engine app that performs business logic and other functions for Android and iOS clients, as well as JavaScript web clients. The functionality of the backend is made available to clients through Endpoints, which exposes an API that clients can call.</em></blockquote>
<p>Google provides SDKs for Android, iOS, and JavaScript, as well as a very Java heavy development process using <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/getstarted/backend/create_project">Maven</a>, combined with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/cloud_endpoints">Google Plugin for Eclipse</a>, which&nbsp;is used to design, develop, and deploy your APIs to <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.</p>
<p>All Google has to do now, is open up the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Console</a>&nbsp;as a Google Cloud Endpoints management console, giving developers on the Google Cloud Platform the ability to design, deploy, and manage their APIs. Then if Google baked in <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">Google Discovery</a> services for all Google Cloud Endpoints, developers would have a pretty slick discovery layer on top of their cloud API stacks. Hell, all you need then is to allow generation of <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> for each collection, and boom you have a pretty complete API design, deployment, management, and discovery platform in the clouds.</p>
<p>Now that Google is added to my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment research</a>, I will be keeping a closer eye on what they are doing in respects to being a cloud API platform.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-first.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I hear this phrase used more and more lately, &ldquo;An API First Strategy&rdquo;. It is something you hear from startups like <a href="https://www.lob.com/blog/api-first-development-makes-lob-more-productive">printing API LOB</a>, to <a href="https://developer.pearson.com/blog/creating-a-single-platform-for-all-pearson-apis/">established players like Pearson</a>, all the way up to <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F at the GSA in Washington DC</a>, but what is API first? Much like APIs in general, an API first strategy is something that will mean something different to each company, organization, government agency, or individual.</p>
<p>From my view, the most common interpretation of API first will be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Develop an API First</strong> - Before you build your website, web, mobile or single page application you develop an API first, then you get to work on defining the channels you will be making the API resources available on.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had an interesting conversation today with the 18F team in Washington DC, and they illuminated some other possible dimensions to the API first conversation for me, that I wanted to explore a little:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Design Your API First</strong> - Using tools like <a href="http://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, and API definition formats like <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a>, you kick off discussion with customers, generate user stories, and mockup your API, and even your web or mobile app interfaces, using your mock API.</li>
<li><strong>API First In Open Source Software -</strong> Encouraging the development and use of open source software solutions similar to Wordpress, that have API by default, so when agencies deploy them, they always have an API as part of their first steps for making access and integration decision&mdash;something that can drastically shift what is possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to help small business, non-profit organizations, and government of all shapes and sizes understand the benefits of an API first strategy, so having conversation with API leaders like 18F, and getting their view on what API first means is essential to my storytelling process. How do you view API first at your company? How has your development lifecycle evolved since embracing APIs? Let me know, I&rsquo;m curious to hear other views on the phrase.</p>
<p>All three of the dimensions laid out above are very appealing to me. I am big advocate for "API first being" about API design, open source software architectural patterns, or just a way of life before you consider connecting any web, mobile, or single page app to a back-end system. To me, API is more about conversation, collaboration, and access to ideas and resources, before we even get to any technical definition of what an API can be&mdash;making API first strategies more about philosophy and methodology, rather than what technical component you develop first.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/08/next-stable-version-of-apisjson--apisio-is-ready--are-your-apis-discoverable/">published the story last night on finalizing the most recent version of the API discovery format APIs.json</a>, and the support for it in the open source API search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Steve and I are done messing with the format for a while, and want to encourage API providers to begin describing their APIs using the open format.</p>
<p>After publishing the story last night, I also had an interesting comment on Google+ from <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JonasHellstr%C3%B6m/posts">Jonas Hellstr&ouml;m</a>:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apis-json-timeline.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>The question got me thinking about how APIs.json rolled out. As with <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, APIs.json started as a conversation between Steve Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) and I. Around the beginning of April we combined our notes on what each of us envisioned when it came to API discovery, establishing the first APIs.json definition with the timeline going roughly like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>April 2014&nbsp;</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Steve and I established version .11 of APIs.json</li>
<li>We emailed a handful of smart folks that we trusted for feedback</li>
<li>Crafted version .12 of APIs.json</li>
<li>Developed <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>May 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>We <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/05/20/announcing-apisjson-at-gluecon-2014/">launched API.json at Gluecon</a> in Broomfield, CO</li>
<li>Encouraged discussion via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apisjson">APIs.json Google Group</a></li>
<li>Encouraged feedback via the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">Github issue management</a> on APIs.json repo</li>
<li>Cotinued email Conversations</li>
<li>Established a Twitter presence for <a href="https://twitter.com/apisjson">@apisjson</a></li>
<li>Presented as part of session at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">API Days in Barcelona, Spain</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>June 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Establish version 0.13 of APIs.json</li>
<li>Continued discussion on Google Group</li>
<li>Continued feedback on Github issue management</li>
<li>Continued email conversations&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>July 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Conducted a session on API discovery, including APIs.json at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">APICraft</a> in Detroit</li>
<li>Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) for the work on the JSON schema (thank you Tony!)</li>
<li>Established version <a href="http://apisjson.org/format/apisjson_0.14.txt">0.14 of APIs.json</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>August 2014</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Updated APIs.json for API Evangelist network to version 0.14</li>
<li>Updated APIs.io to support version 0.14 of APIs.json</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been an interesting five months. I like to record things like this while they are fresh in my mind, because as time moves on, the details fade into the past. I feel like if I do not capture the moment, it will be forgotten and it will be like it never happened.</p>
<p>I think we got the feedback from the community we needed to get to the first stable version, and I want to thank&nbsp;@fehguy, @mamund, @darrel_miller, @OriPekelman, @xmlgrrl, @johnmusser, and the attendees at Gluecon, APIDays, and APICraft for listening, and providing feedback. Also thanks to&nbsp;Jonas Hellstr&ouml;m for your great question!</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> looks like in 2015--it is a very exciting time!</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.sydcon.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chicago/sydcon/sydcon-web-development.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just talked with Dave Devitt (<a href="https://twitter.com/sydcon">@sydcon</a>), President at <a title="SYDCON web development inc. in Chicago" href="http://www.sydcon.com/">SYDCON Web Development, Inc. in Chicago</a> about how his web and mobile development shop sees the world APIs. I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for stories about how the everyday person on the ground at startups, all the way up to the federal government, actually see the world of APIs, and I was pleased that Dave could make some time to share his view of APIs with me.</p>
<p>First, Dave said something I found very interesting when we first started our conversation. He said they were a &ldquo;web development shop&rdquo;, not in the the sense that they build websites, but that they develop applications that use the web for their operations.  I think this is an important distinction when we start putting developers  into buckets, and it isn&rsquo;t always as straightforward as building websites, web applications, mobile, single page or Internet of Things apps&mdash;we are now building software that uses the Internet for communication, something that will inevitably use all of these channels (and more).</p>
<p>When it comes to API usage at SYDCON, they primarily use what we all call public APIs for driving commerce. Whether it is B2B or B2C, Dave&rsquo;s team is using APIs to sell products, integrate with payment systems like Authorize.net and PayPal, activating and validating of gift cards. Whether it is the nature of development or just a reflection on the type of customers SYDCON has, commerce is a pretty clear motivator for public API integration. The modern web API movement was started by commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Paypal, and 14 years in it makes sense that commerce is a major driver of development at smaller develop shops.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sydcon"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/chicago/sydcon/dave-nevitt-sydcon.jpeg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Beyond commerce, the main usage of APIs at SYDCON is about opening up access to internal resources that exist within their client systems, and making them available to buid apps on top of. Dave provided an example of a oil &amp; gas worker who uses one of the mobile applications they&rsquo;ve developed to scan the barcode of a 4 inch PVC pipe, and using an API the mobile application is then able to access the company&rsquo;s internal product database and return information to the worker looking to get their job done, with the assistance of the mobile app they've developed. APIs are how they deliver the resources they need for the mobile applications they develop for their customers. Period. It can be products in a database, or media across servers, APIs are how these reousrces are delivered to the web enabled applications SYDCON delivers.</p>
<p>It was good to hear the stories from Dave at <a title="SYDCON web development inc. in Chicago" href="http://www.sydcon.com/">SYDCON</a>, and understand what API usage looks like on the ground at a Chicago area application dev shop. I think we can easily get blind to what the mainstream developers are needing when it comes to APIs, being so close to the Silicon Valley echo chamber, as well as playing a part in some of the bleeding edge aspects of the API sector. Talking with people like Dave who actually are making a living developing APIs, and web enabled applications, whether it is a web or mobile, is extremely valuable to me when I am working to better understand the realities of the API space.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time today Dave. I have calls scheduled with other web and mobile development shops, as well as some IT and analytics firms, as I lead up to the API conversations we will be having at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago</a>. The event is titled &ldquo;APIs Go Mainstream&rdquo;, so I think that conversations with small and medium sized development shops about how APIs are impacting their day to day worlds are super relevant, and something the larger API industry should tune into.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-platform-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was browsing through <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google&rsquo;s Cloud Platform</a>, in the 15 minute lead up to a preliminary discussion with Google about being an evangelist for the platform (another story), and I saw a useful pattern from the "customers" section for publishing API customer case studies--something I wanted to share with you.</p>
<p>This pattern was evident in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/redbus/">Travel Agency Masters Big Data with Google BigQuery case study</a>. I think the format for the case study provides a simple format that other API providers might consider following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A catchy summary title&nbsp;</li>
<li>Challenge the company faced&nbsp;</li>
<li>Solution to the problem&nbsp;</li>
<li>A quote from company&nbsp;</li>
<li>Results from the solution</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/redbus/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-cloud-platform/logo-redbus.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, Google provides an "At a Glance" summary in the left hand bar, for those busy folks who don't have the time to read case studies, providing a quick summary of the case study:</p>
<ul>
<li>What they wanted to do&nbsp;</li>
<li>What they did&nbsp;</li>
<li>What they accomplished&nbsp;</li>
<li>About API service used</li>
</ul>
<p>The outline for the case study, as well as the summary version is a nice, simple format that any API provider could use to when crafting their own API case study experience. The format allows for easy scanning by visitors, which allows for us busy folks to read, or quickly scan multiple case studies--giving more context to the potential value an API will deliver.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Steve (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>), Nicolas (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a>), and I have been working hard to gather all the feedback from some very smart folks on the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">API.json format</a>. Now we are stoked to finally announce that we have the <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">0.14 version</a> ready for prime time. Our goal with the first version of APIs.json, was to just get the idea out there to get feedback from the community, and after four iterations, we feel like the format is now something the community can really build on.</p>
<p>First, lets recap, what is APIs.json? APIs.json is a machine readable JSON file that lives in the root of your domain, and describes your APIs and its supporting API program.</p>
<p>Think of APIs.json as a <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/">robots.txt</a>, or <a href="http://www.google.com/sitemap.xml">sitemap.xml</a> from Google, but instead of describing all the pages of your website, an APIs.json describes your developer portal, all available APIs, and the supporting building blocks of your API program--allowing you to describe your API efforts whether it is a public, or private affair. The goal is simply to provide a machine readable description, that any search engine can crawl, and make sense of your overall API program, and each individual API resource.</p>
<p>The real power of APIs.json lies in the properties that you can apply to your APIs. We wanted to start with providing basic links meant for humans, like a link to the API signup page, or documentation, but then quickly provide machine readable elements like a <a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger specification</a>, or <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a> manifest. However we don&rsquo;t want to define and control all of the properties you use to describe your APIs, and while we have a <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues/44">short list of additional properties</a> that we are adding in on the next version, you can use any property you like just by adding x- to your own type label.</p>
<p><a href="http://apis.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-io/apis-io.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Along with the <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">APIs.json 0.14</a> release, the API search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> also supports the latest APIs.json format. You can now validate your APIs.json 0.14, and submit your API.json for indexing using the APIs.io interface or API (mind blown). Your APIs.json will be your gateway to API discovery in the future, and since <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> is an open source API search engine, it will just be the first of a wave of new API search engines to emerge, built on the APIs.json format.</p>
<p>While we will be making slight changes in coming versions of APIs.json, we feel like the format is now ready for prime time, and we encourage the entire API community to begin participating in the next generation of <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a>, where your API, and the details of your API program are machine readable, and discoverable, in a single, known location at your company, organization, or agencies &nbsp;public or private domain.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-connector.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing an increase in the number of API deployment services this year, such as startups like <a href="http://bit.ly/1jLr1Pf">StrongLoop</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>. These companies are looking to help all of us deploy APIs from common systems, often without the need for IT or programming resources.</p>
<p>The providers I&rsquo;m seeing emerge are catering to some of the lowest hanging fruit for deploying APIs. The commonly used, and easiest to access systems, that contain the valuable content, data, and media we need to make accessible via APIs.</p>
<p>The common source for many of these API deploy solutions are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Excel Spreadsheet&nbsp;with</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://sheetlabs.com">SheetLabs</a></li>
<li><strong>Google Spreadsheet&nbsp;from</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a></li>
<li><strong>Database&nbsp;At The</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/">Dream Factory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These common information sources, represent the places where the average person in any size company, organization or government agency will be storing their valuable resources.  It makes sense that this new wave of API deployment startups would target these services.</p>
<p>If you consider every system integration option that classic API gateways have delivered, it provides a good reference for finding opportunities for building independent API deployment solutions, that if done right, could be a startup all by itself.</p>
<p>Not all companies can afford a full API gateway solution, and their needs are too small for a gateway. There is an emerging opportunity to help people quickly deploy APIs from common sources like spreadsheet, database, file stores, as well as more unique sources like specialty CMS and CRM systems.</p>
<p>Sometimes I like to look at the expanding API universe as a result of the SOA big bang, where all the tools that were in your SOA toolbox, being liberated, and available as independent services that you can get from an increasing number of new API deployment startups.</p>

<p>In preparation for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago, September 24-26th</a>, I did a little research on where the good beers, and specifically the kick-ass IPAs can be found. You may not know, but in addition to being the API Evangelist, I am also the <a href="http://ipaevangelist.com">IPA Evangelist</a> (plan b career path), and I'm always interested in knowing where the killer IPAs are, in addition to knowing where to find the best APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While in Chicago we want to be able to have the tasiest beer possible at the conference, while also having the best options for finding good beer and food after the event to network and socialize with the 600+ folks that will be at #APIStrat. To prepare for #APIStrat I found 32 local Chicago breweries:</p>

<p>A blog is such a simple thing, but when it comes to the world of APIs, it can be one of the most important signals for whether or not an API is worthy of integration, or you should just move on and continue looking for another API to use. I know many folks will dismiss that a blog is so relevant, especially if they are coming from IT or developer disciplines--I respectfully decline.</p>
<p>In reality, a blog not only provides a great way to keep API consumers up to date, it also provides the essential human face to any API operation. An API&rsquo;s blog provides a regular flow of information that show there is someone behind the curtain, who is not just working on the API, but actively is contributing ideas to the API community, and is there to support.</p>
<p>A blog is the number one signal for me when evaluating the quality of an API. I track on whether an API has a blog, how of the blog is updated, and how long since the last post. Using these signals, it is pretty easy to tell when a public API is getting the resources it needs, and when the support for a public API is losing steam within a company.</p>
<p>Here is an example of this in action&mdash;back in April I commented on the ESPN API:</p>
<div class="twitterBlock">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>It is sad that the last ESPN "API-focused musings and ramblings" was 1 year ago ;-( <a href="http://t.co/sMWDoFtacJ">http://t.co/sMWDoFtacJ</a> &gt;&gt; I prefer them more often</p>

<p>Sure enough, four short months later, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/08/public-apis-are-tough-when-you-are-in-a-tightly-controlled-industry/">ESPN announces they are shutting down their public APIs</a>. The existence of a blog for your API shows that you care about with your API community, regular blog posts show that you are thinking about your API community regularly and want to share stories with them, and when your blog goes silent, it speaks volumes about what is going on behind the curtain--run for the hills!</p>
<p>What does your blog say about your API? Storytelling via a blog can be one of the most powerful tools in your <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> toolbox, but be careful an inactive API blog can quickly become the canary in the coal mine when it comes to imminent demise of a public API.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/08/08/share-your-api-news-with-me-on-the-api-report/">Share Your API News With Me On The API Report</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2014</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve launched a new API news site, designed to provide short news updates from across the world of APIs. The API Report is the newest part of the API Evangelist network of sites, with apievangelist.com as the analysis on the business of APIs, apivoice.com as the analysis on the politics of APIs, and the the API Report as the industry news heartbeat.</p>
<p>The API Report is built on Github, as a public repository, using Github Pages, and Jekyll. This approach to blogging opens up the news site to a new form of collaborative publishing, allowing anyone to fork, author their own API news story, and make a pull request for publishing to the site. Every commit will be reviewed for quality, and either rejected, or published to the live API Report website. Each post should follow a simple format, allowing for easy scanning of the days API news by consumers. The API Report has an RSS feed, as well as a Twitter account, for reader and social syndication.</p>
<p>Soon, the API Report will also have its own advertising network, which will allow anyone to purchase any of the advertising slots available in the header, right hand sidebar, and in the body of all blog posts. Advertising will be priced very low at first, but as pageviews grow, and demand increases, and weekly market rate will be set--allowing for weekly turnover of advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>If you are an API provider of any shape or size, or an API enthusiast, I recommend you help craft stories for the API Report, fork the site, and make a pull request, anytime you have a new piece you want share. Once the API Report advertising is up and running, and being monetized, I will be setting aside 50% of revenue and sharing with all contributors based upon pageviews.</p>
<p>The API Report is brand new, and looking to be the place where the community can publish their own stories about providing, consuming, or delivering services to the API space, and provide a regular news heartbeat for the API community, by the API community.</p>
<p>Get involved as early as you can, I'd love your feedback.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.espn.com/branding"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/espn/espn-api-black_200.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>ESPN just <a href="http://developer.espn.com/blog/read/publicretirement">announced that they will no longer be accepting registrations for public API keys</a>, and discontinuing all of their public APIs. I saw a few enraged comments on the Twitterz when I originally tweeted out the story, and also saw a couple of people compare it to the recent <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">Netflix API deprecation</a>.</p>
<p>In reality I don't think the shuttering of the public ESPN API, or the Netflix API is a reflection on the viability of APIs, steering clear of the usual API FUD <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever-wait-nothey-can-go-away-at-any-time/">that APIs are forever, wait no&hellip;they can go away at any time</a>! I think the decision to shutter the ESPN API is due to lack of vision, outreach, and the establishment of the vital developer feedback loops that are necessary to make APIs successful, but most importantly they failed to understand the challenges faced when deploying APIs in a tightly controlled industry.</p>
<p>Doing public APIs in tightly controlled spaces like the movie and sports industry has to be tough. Both to these spaces have built their empires on tightly controlling the content, messaging, distribution, branding, and other elements&mdash;which are all things that work against the ethos of a successful public API strategy.  In my mind it shows that APIs aren&rsquo;t really the thing we all claim they are, it is everything that comes bundled the API, and a company's willingness to evolve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we'll see waves of other companies, who come from legacy industries like movies, sports, publishing, television, and other similar sectors, try APIs, thinking they will be a technological silver bullet, in coming years who also neglect to pay attention to the business and politics of APIs that will provide essential building blocks that support the technology.</p>
<p>There are plenty of lessons to be learned from both ESPN and Netflix, but two that stand out for me, is the importance of understanding the entire lifecycle of the resources you are making available, and the value of having a robust API service composition and API access tiers, that sensibly serve internal, partner, and in some(not all) cases public API consumers.</p>

<p>I went through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">77 federal government API developer portals</a> a couple of weeks ago, as part of some <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> work I&rsquo;m doing with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. I ended up <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">targeting 120 APIs</a> that I will be generating of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a> definitions, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">API.json</a> for their umbrella domain, or subdomain over the next couple months.</p>
<p>As I made my way through each of these developer areas, I began to realize that I would have to sign up for API keys at each of these developer areas. I&rsquo;m sure some of the APIs will not require a key, but it is still potentially 77 separate API keys (I will let you know the final count when I know), that I will have to register for&mdash;the federal government needs a common, yet distributed API management strategy.</p>
<p>To augment this common, yet distribution API management strategy, I would like to be able to just use Github oAuth to ping an API provider, request my application keys, and using the Github API to then store them in a repository of my choosing. I store all of my API keys for my applications, in a central location that my apps can securely put to use, and in many cases these apps are already using a private Github repository as a centralized configuration location.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have to go through 77 separate API registration flows to get the API keys I need. I should be able to get API access in a programmatic way, using my existing Github account, and put Github oAuth to use in an authentication flow, getting the API keys I need in real time, in the location that I need them.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-key.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>This API access workflow would allow me to quickly gain access to resources I need for my apps, and store all my API keys in a single, or across multiple Github repositories&mdash;potentially giving me a simple, but powerful way to manage all of my API keys, via Github.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could someone please build this, so that government, and even the private sector APIs can install on their server, and provide me machine readable access to generate an API account, the API keys I need, and store them in one of my chosen Github repositories. I think it would make both API providers, and API consumers lives much easier. We could even develop some sort of trust layer in there based upon Github profiles, allowing API providers to assess new registrations, and provide didn&rsquo;t levels of access, based upon their trust of a Github profile.</p>
<p>We are moving beyond the world where we use one or two APIs, we are now using 10 or 20 different APIs, or more, from multiple providers, and there needs to be a better solution for us to manage API key access. I really appreciate you building this, I just don't have the time ;-)</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

<p>I was learning more about the <a href="http://timrogers.uk/2014/07/12/discovering-private-apis-with-charles-app/">discovery of private APIs with the Charles App</a>, and was fascinated by its potential to visualize, and map the darkest regions of the API realm. There is a lot of speculation about the number of APIs out there, with the 10K+ public APIs that are currently available being the &ldquo;tip of the iceberg&rdquo;, and the number of private APIs rpresenting the rest of the surface area below the dark surface--making the approach that Tim Rogers (and others) employ a tantalizing option for mapping these dark waters of the rapidly expanding API space.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">HTTP proxing and monitoring solutions like Charles</a> are nothing new, and there are a wealth of next generation&nbsp;<a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/">API integration</a> tools like <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> and <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a> available, but what is interesting about this, is the routing all of your app traffic for your laptop, tablet or smartphone through a proxy, and record not just the traffic between you and the private APIs your apps depend on, but the mapping out the API interface, request, response, and underlying data models.</p>
<p>Before I continue with this story, I have to admit this is a little on the dark side of APIs, and is something I don't recommend doing, because you are going to piss off a whole bunch of API providers&mdash;regardless, I think it is an interesting idea, that is worth sharing and discussing.</p>
<p>What if someone packaged up an HTTP proxy, monitoring, and provided a recording layer for the interface, requests, responses, and data models, scrubbed out PII, and allowed individuals to opt in and publish the resulting definitions to a shared, public registry?</p>
<p>Of course you would not publish your own transmissions, and underlying data, you would only publish the interface, requests, responses, and data models for the private APIs that are driving your public mobile and tablet applications. This centralized location would then aggregate, and shed light on this dark region, providing a single directory to discover what goes into all of the private APIs we depend on in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Something like this would pretty quickly map the world of private APIs, but at first glance I think the negative backlash would far outweigh the benefits. Mobile app providers would recoil, and probably look for ways to secure the inner workings of their mobile apps...or would they? It might also have the opposite effect, and push providers to realize they need to be more transparent with their APIs, and while they don't need to open up access to for everyone to use, they could publicly share the technological surface area their(our) apps depend on&mdash;which in my opinion is never the secret sauce, and a company should always be willing to share. (I know controversial) Think of it as the shared zone between provider and app.</p>
<p>The concept of a rogue API registry for internal APIs is one of those areas I see as pretty damn grey, and I'm unsure how I feel about it. I personally wouldn't recommend building a tool or a registry for mapping private APIs like this, because I worry about the repercussions it would have. One the other side it also fascinates me, and is a concept that is very much in the public domain already, and is something I feel is  worthy of discussion, or at least more thought.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-waiter.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I began exploring the <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">use a restaurant menu to help people understand API copyright</a>, and how your API definition is not your secret sauce, and that there is so much more to your API that just the surface area.</p>
<p>I'm continuing my exploration of using restaurants as an analogy to help onboard people with not just API copyright, but introducing APIs to the masses--helping them understand the layers to the API space, in a way that is familiar.</p>
<p>To prepare for future stories and conversations I'm expanding on my API definition = Menu analogy with:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Providers = Restaurant Owners</li>
<li>Developer Portal = Restaurant</li>
<li>APIs = Food &amp; Drink Items</li>
<li>API Definition + Docs = Menu</li>
<li>API Consumers (Apps) = Restaurant&nbsp; Customers (People)</li>
<li>Freemium - Samples Out Front</li>
<li>Partner Access = Catering</li>
<li>Terms of Service = We Reserve The Right To Refuse - No Substitutions</li>
<li>API Service Providers = Restaurant Equipment Providers</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously it is work in progress. I will need better stories and visuals to get the concept across. Then once I start working through the different types of restaurants (ie. American, Chinese, Mexican, Fusion, etc), I'm sure I'll flush out more, while also potentially hitting some dead ends.</p>
<p>Explaining what an API is, let alone the versatility and flexibility of an API, is really hard. I need as many tools in my API toolbox to help get people up to speed, understanding what an API is, and how it can apply to their business. We'll see where I go with the restaurant analogy, who knows it might be a dead end. It proved to be extremeley valuable in helping people understand API copyright, and I'm hopefull it will do the same for APIs in general.</p>
<p>Let me know your thoughts...</p>

<p>I spend a great deal of time looking at new APIs from companies, institutions, and government agencies during my weekly monitoring of the API space, and over the last couple years, I've come across an increasing number of APIs tht are out of higher educational institutions around the world. It began with a c<a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/2012/05/29/university-information-services-with-apis/">entralized developer area at the University of Washington (UW)</a>, and then <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/25/get-a-list-of-all-classes-at-uc-berkeley-with-api-call/">I saw the same from UC Berkeley</a>, with more recently noticing the impressive <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/23/browsing-the-261-apis-at-brigham-young-university/">conversion of 250+ services from a traditional Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), to a more modern web API approach, at Brigham Young University (BYU)</a>.</p>
<p>Along the way I began seeing that APIs at higher education institutions were going to be an important piece of the overall API puzzle, and as I do with any research area, I setup a Github repository (<a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university.apievangelist.com</a>), and began tracking on universities who were doing anything interesting with APIs, no matter how small. I now track on twelve separate higher education institutions that have active API efforts, and I have been engaging in active conversations with two of the institutions, regarding their strategy, working to understand how I can provide any guidance, but also learn from each team about the unique challenges higher education institutions face when designing, deploying, manage, and even evangelize their APIs.</p>
<p>My university API research has now reached a level, where I have enough material to produce a white paper, so over the last couple months, I&rsquo;ve worked to compile all of my work into a single downloadable narrative. As with all of my API research, this white paper will change often, as my work is never done. I&rsquo;ll keep adding institutions, and evolving my understanding an awareness of APIs in higher education as long as there is meaningful activity to be found. The reason I produced this white paper, before I finished other papers I&rsquo;m working on for <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com/">payment APIs</a>, and&nbsp;APIs in the federal government, is because I feel like higher education is going to be critical to the futrue of not just APIs, but also the overall web literacy of our society.</p>
<p><strong>Higher Education Is Front Line For Web Literacy</strong><br /> A large part of our worlds have moved online. Whether it is entertainment at home, education in the classroom, or out and about on our mobile devices, we are living more of our lives online&mdash;increasing the imperative that we are empowering every student with at least a minimum amount of web literacy. Think of web literacy, like understanding your personal finances, every single adult must have a certain level of awareness of how our financial system operates. You don't need to understand the inner workings of banking and global markets, but you need to know how to setup a bank account, apply for credit or debit cards, balance your checkbook and pay your taxes. As our lives move online and our digital footprint expands, our data is fast becoming the online currency of Internet platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, increasing the need for us to understand the mechanisms at play in this new digital economy, and empower each student to take back some control.</p>
<p>Web literacy goes beyond just what you will need to know in your job and career, it is what you will need to be a literate citizen, and use government services, conduct business, and even interact with your friends and community around you. Just as higher education has played a significant role in preparing our youth for the real world in the past, it will have to take the lead in providing them with the basic web literacy skills they will need to engage online in everyday scenarios, as well as the specialty career trajectories. API is a layer of web literacy, one that allows the tech savvy individual to peel back how the Internet works, and configure, tweak, and make the Internet work for them--not the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>Providing A Blueprint For Other University To Follow</strong><br /> As I spent more time looking at universities, I wanted to create a static snapshot of the current state of APIs in higher education, share some of what I learned looking through the leading universities in the space, and also apply some of my wider knowledge from the API industry beyond the university campus--in hopes university leaders are listening.</p>
<p>I want this paper to be a blueprint that any university CIO or CTO, student or energetic professor can pick up, and get an idea of what is going on across other universities when it comes to APIs. I&rsquo;m fascinated by what I&rsquo;m seeing out of BYU, UW, UC Berkeley, and UM, and as I do with the rest of the space, I&rsquo;m looking forward to monitoring their progress, and having more conversations about how we can make university API efforts more successful.</p>
<p>I will continue to update this white paper as I find more examples of institutions putting to APIs to work. While much of this research is rooted in what I'm seeing across these 12 higher education institutions, there is still much that is speculation based on my experience, and as I find more concrete examples in the wild I'll expand and add to this paper.</p>
<p>I can't emphasize enough, the important role that higher education will play in not just equipping the next generation with the web literacy skills they will need to be successful, but also help take the lead in defining the underlying pipes that will drive our increasingly digital economy. APIs are not good by default, they can be used is some very bad ways, and I'm confident that if higher education take a lead in the space, the patterns that can be established will provide a healthier path forward than if we let Silicon Valley continue to exclusively lead.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/08/05/the-hypermedia-api-debate-sorry-reasonable-just-does-not-sell/">The Hypermedia API Debate: Sorry Reasonable Just Does Not Sell</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-craft/detroit/apicraft-panel-0.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I moderated a panel of hypermedia experts at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft in Detroit</a> last week. One theme that dominated not just the panel, but was also pervasive in the conversation over the next two days of the API event, was how can the hypermedia space, improve its overall image, message, and potentially reach a wider audience, and maybe even converting some of the hypermedia skeptics, to hypermedia evangelists.</p>
<p>After a session at #APICraft, <a href="https://github.com/apicraft/detroit2014/wiki/Hypermedia%3A-Why-Y'all-Hatin'%3F">dedicated to understanding all the hypermedia hate</a>, Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) and I continued the conversation, where he stated: When it comes to hypermedia, and technology online, reasonable just doesn't sell.</p>
<p>This statement sums up my views of the current state of the hypermedia conversation. I went into the event expecting a very heated debate, filled with very intelligent, passionate, yet opinionated and hard-headed individuals. If you even lightly pay attention to the world of APIs, you probably have stumbled across the conversation between passionate REST practitioners (aka <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/whatisarestafarian/">Restafarians</a>), and the more recently the select group of hypermedia specialists&mdash;producing an image that is perceived by some as passionate, opinionated, and pushy, or even portrayed as being down right mean, nasty, delusional and confrontational by some.</p>
<p>What I saw on the hypermedia panel last Monday, and over the next two days at #APICraft, was anything but the popular image of REST and the hypermedia community. I don&rsquo;t dismiss that some REST, and hypermedia practitioners can be rude, mean, and less than tolerant of those of us who don&rsquo;t quite understand every detail, but this group of hypermedia leaders were anything but. They were humble, articulate, and eager to better understand the hypermedia approaches of their colleagues, and try to understand how to better get the message out to the larger public.</p>
<p>So where does this image come from? I think there are two camps, who are equally to blame: 1) The <strong><em>hypermedia pioneers</em></strong> 2) The <strong><em>hypermedia skeptics&nbsp;</em></strong>&mdash; the rest of us are just along for a ride on this hypermedia roller coaster.</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s look at from the hypermedia skeptic side:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>One Client To Rule Them All -</strong> You often hear claims, whether true or not, that hypermedia pioneers claim if all APIs were hypermedia, we could have a single, intelligent client to rule them all, and do away with all of the crap we have now&mdash;think web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Adds Unnecessary Complexity -</strong> Adding extra links, and payload to each response just adds more complexity, without any benefits to warrant the added work.</li>
<li><strong>Too Lofty, Dreamy, and Still Academic -</strong> Many say that Hypermedia is just to big of a vision, and the hypermedia pioneers are too dreamy, and stuck in just an academic discussion&mdash;it won&rsquo;t work in the real world.</li>
<li><strong>Solution For All APIs - </strong>There are many claims that hypermedia is something that all API designers should follow, applying to APIs in all industries as a silver bullet style solution.</li>
<li><strong>Will Prevent APIs From Breaking - </strong>When you use hypermedia, your APIs are completely protected from breakage, and your developers will never feel any pain from API versioning, and the evolution of your API.</li>
<li><strong>Solves Discoverability -</strong> With each payload, you get instructions for what is next, so if you know an API endpoint, you should be able to find everything else from there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next let&rsquo;s look at from the hypermedia pioneers side:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Haters Gonna Hate -</strong> It has nothing to do with Hypermedia being good or bad, haters gonna hate. There is nothing you can do.</li>
<li><strong>They Don&rsquo;t Care - </strong>Nobody even cares about learning new things like hypermedia, so there is no reason to even explain it to them.</li>
<li><strong>They Don&rsquo;t Need To Understand -</strong> Not everyone even needs to understand what hypermedia APIs are, they will just benefit from the results. </li>
<li><strong>They Just  Don&rsquo;t Understand - </strong>Skeptics just haven&rsquo;t taken the time to understand what APIs are, and would rather just remain ignorant.</li>
<li><strong>Its OK to Not Be Perfect -</strong> Hypermedia makes it ok to not build your API 100% correctly the first time, allowing you to change it along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Use Media Types -</strong> People don't read docs, we need to rely on media types help provide the information developers will need.</li>
<li><strong>Give Us A Break - </strong>This shit is hard, and the hypermedia community is working hard, and taking risks to push APIs forward.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-craft/detroit/apicraft-panel-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>Beyond both the hypermedia pioneers, and the hypermedia skeptic camps, I think the main problem with the hypermedia conversation is as Mike said, "reasonable just doesn't sell&rdquo;. I think this is the number one illness in the whole debate, that some bloggers feel the need to polarize any debate, sensationalize and use hyperbole at every turn. You can see this playing out in coverage of hypermedia, but also around other areas of the API space like API deprecation, where the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever-wait-nothey-can-go-away-at-any-time/">argument was either APIs can go away at any moment, to the other end where you have to support APIs forever</a>&mdash;not discussing the middle reality which would show there are plenty of APIs who handle deprecation very well, but year, that is boring, and really doesn't sell.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what the hypermedia pioneers can do to shift the conversation:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Strong Implementations - </strong>The space needs for examples of hypermedia APIs in the wild, providing as much detail about the implementation, and hopefully a public API that they can actually go play with.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling -</strong> There needs to be much more storytelling about hypermedia. Not the technical narrative of your implementation, but a story of hypermedia APIs, and the solutions it delivers. Keep stories, short, inviting, compelling, and published often&mdash;we are all busy and don't always have the time to commit to reading longer pieces.</li>
<li><strong>Patience -</strong> Have patience with the community, this is complex stuff, and it will take time for hypermedia to roll out, get the implementations we need to showcase the potential, the tooling and resources needed to support developers.</li>
<li><strong>Friendly -</strong> Make sure and keep things friendly&mdash;this will go a long way in defusing the skeptics, and you never know you might convert them, one by one along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Speak To Management - </strong>When you are telling stories, building case studies, and presenting on your work, make sure you speak to management level as well as to developers. It can be the leadership that carves out time for developers to learn about hypermedia, or possibly mandate that it should be part of an API design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what the hypermedia skeptics can do to shift the conversation:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Make The Time To Read - </strong>There is some great material out there about hypermedia, to get you up to speed if you can carve out the time. Sure, we need more examples of hypermedia in the wild, case studies, and tooling, but in the mean time, make sure and read as much as you can before casting judgement.</li>
<li><strong>Make Sure And Listen -</strong> I heard some really compelling stories around how hypermedia works, and I bet if you take the time to listen to more of the conversation you might at least evolve your opinion of hypermedia.</li>
<li><strong>Think Long Term - </strong>Hypermedia provides some long term benefits that are often overlooked in the short term concerns about time and resources needed to get up to speed with hypermedia, and actually implement as part of your API design.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Worry About What You Don&rsquo;t Know -</strong> I feel like some of the trolling of hypermedia might be based upon insecurity about what one doesn&rsquo;t understand. I have to admit I don&rsquo;t fully grasp everything about hypermedia, but I see enough to grasp the long term potential, and know I should worker harder to close the gaps in my understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Be Mean -</strong> I&rsquo;ve seen some pretty harsh responses to what hypermedia pioneers are working on, and I think it would be easier to just walk away, rather than shitting on someones hard work. Hypermedia pioneers are putting a lot of time and energy into moving the space forward in positive ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately the ball is in the court of the hypermedia pioneers.There really is no reason that skeptics, or anyone else should care, until there is more examples, tooling, and stories around why hypermedia is worth the extra work in getting up to speed, and implementing as part of our APIs designs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-craft/detroit/apicraft-hater-session.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I see hypermedia at the same place, as REST was in 2010 when I started API Evangelist. I had witnessed first hand the solutions a RESTful API provided, and saw what was playing out in the public API space with Amazon, Twitter, and Twilio. As I continue to  study the space I saw the RESTafarians arguing, shaming and generally making people feel stupid for not understanding HTTP, and fighting over exactly what REST was. It appeared to me that REST would suffer from the same image problems as the semantic web, and linked data.</p>
<p>The API space needed a friendlier layer, one that would help soften up some of the technical debates, and tell stories that would make all of this valuable knowledge more accessible&mdash;with this in mind, API Evangelist was born. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m responsible for web APIs moving into the mainstream consciousness, it has taken all the valuable implementations available out there to do that, but I do know I&rsquo;ve started some important conversations by working so hard to help everyone better understand the space.</p>
<p>After what I saw in Detroit last week, during the hypermedia panel I moderated, and over the following two days, I&rsquo;m confident that with a little more storytelling we can shift the tone of this conversation in just a year or two. It won&rsquo;t happen overnight, but I saw some really smart, hardworking folks who were very humble about their hypermedia work, and willing to admit there is a lot of work to be done, and eager to help the public to better understand the benefits hypermedia will bring to not just individual API operations, but the overall API space.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t believe that hypermedia offered significant benefits, I wouldn&rsquo;t be talking about it. In 2014 I&rsquo;m seeing the hypermedia conversation move beyond just the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/api-craft">API-Craft forum</a>, beyond just academic discussion, and we are seeing some meaningful implementations of hypermedia in the wild. I will keep working to evolve my understanding and storytelling around hypermedia, while also working with the experts to generate more stories, and examples of their own work.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>I changed the word hater to skeptic (except in the haters gonna hate bullet), John Sheehan said I should use, which seems sensible, and following my own advice. Thanks John.</p>

<p>What would a Twilio look like for the banking industry? Probably similar to <a href="http://openbankproject.com/en/">The Open Bank Project</a> or <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, and focusing on rebooting, and simplifying just a single slice of the insanely complex banking system. I'm not saying that these two startups are the next Twilio of banking, but I do see them as two potential dynamite holes being drilled into the bedrock of a very entrenched, highly regulated industry, and powerful industry.</p>
<p>I don't see APIs being the silver bullet to the banking industry, or any other industry for that matter. Slow change will happen through the solid execution of an API focused business strategy by one or more of the existing banking powerhouses, at the same time it will also take a wave of API driven banking startups, who hopefully emulate much of Twilio's game plan, to slowly to blast away at the bedrock core of the banking industry.</p>
<p>Another thing to pay attention to, is when the large banks do understand how APIs are becoming the pipes for this new digital economy, they will begin to wield their power and influence, just as other 1000lb gorillas do in business sectors like education, healthcare, and other critical areas of our economy. APIs don't just purify the distribution of legacy power like a rocky mountain stream does to water, it will take the development of some pretty sophisticated API facades to mask legacy complexity, every step of the way.</p>
<p>In a next post, I'll explore what this top down, and bottom up approach looks like, by examining the progress we have all made with open data, and APIs in the <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">federal government</a>.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Sorry Irakli, I just couldn't use Twilio the "HECK" out of them. I have an edgy image to uphold, but remember everyone Irakli is the first person to use Twilio as a verb!</p>

<p>I originally started writing this post after <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, where I had numerous conversations with banks, about the potential of APIs, and how banks might be starting to move from talk to action, when it comes to their API programs.</p>
<p>After recent talks with a couple more folks, behind the scenes at banks, I&rsquo;m pretty convinced, as the enterprise are doing in other sectors, banks are slowly waking up to the potential of APIs&mdash;something that has taken a long time, as they slowly come out of their bank vaults, where they were hiding during the economic meltdown.</p>
<p>When you Google the phase "<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=banking%20api">banking API</a>", you see the signs that the space is ripe for disruption with APIs from two open banking pioneers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://openbankproject.com/en/"><strong>The Open Bank Projec</strong>t</a> - an open source API and App store for banks that empowers financial institutions to securely and rapidly enhance their digital offerings using an ecosystem of 3rd party applications and services</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a></strong> - The Modern API for Banking Data, allowing developers to programmatically interact with banks and credit cards</li>
</ul>
<p>These players do not represent movement from the banking space itself, the conversation I&rsquo;ve had with Visa, Mastercard, Capital One, Rabobank, and others I can&rsquo;t even mention are notoriously closed about what they are doing, but these new open banking API platforms do represent the opportunity that exists in the space.</p>
<p>Until I see robust, open developer areas from Chase, HSBC, Citigroup, and other banking giants, I won&rsquo;t declare APIs getting traction in the banking sector, but I think the ice is thawing, and I feel we are moving from just banks talking about APIs, to banks maybe, kinda sorta considering taking action when it comes to APIs.</p>
<p>Hopefully I will get to talk about more of my conversations in the future, until then I will just showcase what The Open Bank Project and Plaid are up to, hopefully through public, competitive, and regulatory pressure, banks will open up more&mdash;I have little faith that they will do it on their own, without a little nudging.</p>

        <p><span>When visiting an API developer area, as soon as the page loads,&nbsp;you can tell if its an organized effort, or something that was thrown up by a single project or team. Half of the institutions I track on as part of my university API monitoring have a centralized developer area for their APIs, as well as what appears to be an organized approach behind the designing, deploying, managing or evangelizing their APIs.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <span>I&rsquo;ve talked with both&nbsp;University of California Berkeley and Brigham Young Universities about their API strategies, while only having light communication with University of Washington and Michigan.

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://wp-api.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/wordpress/wordpress-logo-stacked-rgb.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While at <a href="http://bit.ly/1zIq2sl">API Craft in Detroit</a> this week I had the pleasure of hanging with two leads on the WordPress(org) development team, and discuss the API strategy for the blogging platform. Andrew Nacin (<a href="https://twitter.com/nacin">@nacin</a>), Lead Developer, and Ryan McCue (<a href="https://twitter.com/rmccue">@rmccue</a>), WordPress Plugin Developer, facilitated an open circle discussion to work through the challenges that WordPress is facing when developing an API for the open source blogging platform.</p>
<p>At face value, I know a number of API developers who will be less than pleased when they hear about a <a href="http://wp-api.org/">WordPress API</a>, as both PHP, and WordPress are easy targets for developer&rsquo;s hatred, for generating less than perfect code. ;-) But, in the end you can&rsquo;t ignore some of the stats on WordPress usage:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">Used by more than 22.0% of the top 10 million websites as of August 2013</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">Most popular blogging system in use on the Web, used in more than 60 million websites</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wordpress.com/stats/">Over 409 million people view more than 15.5 billion pages each month</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wordpress.com/stats/">Users produce about 41.7 million new posts and 60.5 million new comments each month</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These stats don&rsquo;t even touch on the number of WordPress plugins and mobile solutions there are developed on the insanely popular website, and blogging platform. I couldn't think of a better platform to start rolling APIs out APIs to the masses, and quickly educating a very large group of tech savvy folks along the way.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wordpress.com/stats/"><img style="padding: 15px; margin-left: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/wordpress/wordpress-traffic.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Many of these WordPress sites are already integrated with popular API platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, so it makes sense to educate WordPress administrators on the APIs they are already using, as well as introduce them to the concept of having their own API around the potentially valuable content they generate.</p>
<p><strong>We Are Talking About Developing 60 M+ Distributed APIs</strong><br /> There is no API deployment or management service provider that is even close to numbers of this magnitude. When ready, the WordPress API will give millions of websites, and the individuals, companies, organizations and government agencies behind them, an Application Programming Interface (API). (weird, I haven't spelled that out in a while) What does this mean for the API sector? I do not know yet, but to me it definitely resembles the long tail of API deployment, that I, and <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> have been advocating for the last four years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building For The Lowest Common Denominator</strong><br /> One dominant theme in the conversation around the WordPress API at API Craft, was about building an API for the lowest common denominator. WordPress is an open source blogging platform built using PHP and MySQL, something that enables it to be installed on just about any hosting platform, which has contributed to the platform's growth. However, many of these platforms restrict common aspects of the Internet like the ability to use all of your HTTP verbs, like PUT or DELETE, or simply do not offer essentials like SSL, which is needed for oAuth. The bar for developing an API that will be used by 60 M+ providers has to be set pretty low, ensuring it will work across the entire ecosystem&mdash;something WordPress is already pretty damn good at.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring That The WordPress API Is Extensible</strong><br /> One of the hallmarks of WordPress is the ability to create custom themes and plugins, that extend the functionality of the blogging platform, and the API will be no different. WordPress is much more than just a collection of pages, posts, tags, and links. WordPress has been used as the core of just about any time of website, serving up books, photos, videos, maps, and any other content type you can dream up. The WordPress API has to be able to provide a common interface that can be used to create, read, update, and delete core WP content types, like pages and posts, as well as be extended to any other interpretation the WordPress community can dream up&mdash;adding another dimension to the already massive scope of delivering an API to 60M+ websites.</p>
<p><strong>Single Place To Educate Everyone About APIs</strong><br /> I can't think of another platform that has introduced the average person to web programming, more than WordPress (maybe Drupal?). When you go back to the concept of lowest common denominator, WordPress employs PHP and MysQL to drive its functionality, and combined with the plugin and theme extensibility, the platform has provided a rich gateway to the world of web, and mobile app development. The opportunities to introduce, and educate the masses of the benefits (and downside) of APIs, is huge! While the already established API developer community may not want the WordPress community developing APIs, it will be the quickest way we from 10K APIs, into the millions of APIs.  WordPress drives 22.0% of the top 10 million websites, which will instantly provide access to some potentially high value content and data, that will significantly increase the size of the overall API economy, as well as contribute to API literacy in every business sector, around the globe.</p>
<p>At the time of this post, the <a href="http://wp-api.org/">WordPress API is only a plugin</a>, which means it is an optional part of the platform, requiring a WordPress site administrator to know about the plugin, and install as part of their individual WordPress installation. However, the goal is to bake the API into WordPress as part of the 4.1 release, which could happen as soon as this fall, or at the latest the first or second quarter of 2015.  While not all 60 M+ WordPress sites will immediately update to the 4.1 release, a significant portion of websites around the world will instantly have an API--good or bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited at the idea of so many websites having APIs, then at the same time I'm completely terrified. It is kind of like flooding the market, with some very high value APIs, while also adding millions of very shitty APIs, and I'm sure a lot in the middle. With a lot of the problems we are facing around discovery and integration at 10K, imagine what things will look like with millions of APIs all of a sudden. Do we want every website to have an API this fast?</p>
<p>Beyond just giving a website an API, I'm also very interested in the potential of using WordPress API as purely an API core, allowing it to be used to drive content and data for mobile, and <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">single page applications (SPA)</a>. Considering the innovation we've seen around the core WordPress platform, from the community, I imagine we'll see similar when it comes to just raw API deployment, and when you start considering the potential when bundled with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">latest containerization movement</a>, led by <a href="http://docker.io">Docker.io</a>, and being driven by <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2014/04/23/aws-elastic-beanstalk-adds-docker-support/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/containers">Google</a>, <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/06/09/docker-and-azure-coolness/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/2014/4/red-hat-docker-expand-collaboration">Red Hat</a>&mdash;your head will start to spin.</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>WordPress API + Virtual Containers = API Deployment As Part Of The Fabric Of The Cloud</em></strong></blockquote>
<p>I will be carving out more time to consider the implications of the introduction of the WordPress API, and hopefully provide more feedback to the WordPress API development team. If you are a seasoned WordPress developer, and experienced API consumer, you might consider getting involved too.  You can get access to the source code for <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API">WP API over at Github</a>, and you can <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues">submit issues via the issue management</a> for the project&mdash;they also provide updates via the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/json-api/">WP blog tagged as json-api</a>.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-conductor.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring one possible API future more and more lately, a future which centers around the a concept of being able to deploy <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>, by employing the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/the-power-of-designing-and-deploying-api-driven-resources-in-containers/">power of deploying API resources in virtualized containers</a>, something that will free individual API resources up for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">orchestration in new and exciting ways</a>--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">doing for APIs, what APIs have been doing for companies</a>.</p>
<p>Driven by a recent evolution in cloud computing introduced by <a href="http://docker.io">Docker.io</a>, we are beginning to see new services emerge that get us closer to this vision of API orchesstration. Last week I wrote about how <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/23/the-new-strongloop-api-server-provides-a-look-at-future-of-api-deployment/">StrongLoop providing one look at the future of API deployment</a>, using Node.js. This week I was introduced to another API deployment solution that also resembles some of these earlier thoughts I have had on API orchestration, from <a href="https://api.blockspring.com/">BlockSpring</a>.</p>
<p>Blockspring deploys a containerized API for any Python, Ruby, and R scripts, so all you do is take some code resource, deploy using BlockSpring, and it generates API endpoints, and a form interface for working with the resource. Blockspring provides documentation to help you understand how to craft your code, and a library to publish your API to, when ready.</p>
<p>When you look at their API library, it even drops you into a folder called /blocks, which gives you into a list of APIs deployed using Blockspring, doing a range of functions from screen capture, applying image filters, to sentiment and text analysis. Blockspring enables, and encourages the design, and deployment of very granular API resources, that do one thing, and hopefully also doing it well, providing an interesting, and very modular way of deploying APIs--think legos.</p>
<p>This deployment of simple, programmatic API resources, using a very containerized architecture, is an important new layer to the growing world of API orchestration, complimenting the simpler content and data driven API resources we are seeing deployed from spreadsheets and databases, and common file stores. I&rsquo;m not seeing a pure spreadsheet to API, or database to API solution which solely employs virtual containers, but I&rsquo;m sure its not far off.</p>
<p>Seeing what Strongloop and Blockspring are up to makes me happy. Imagine a world where you can deploy exactly the data, content, and programmatic resources you will need for your web, mobile or single page application. This ability to define, deploy, scale and manage all of your API resources, in such a granular way will contribute significantly to the evolution how we build apps, and connect our devices to the Internet.</p>
<p>This emerging landscape of new API orchestration platforms will change how we deploy and consume APIs, making APIs much more remixable and composable, bringing APIs out of their silos. I also hope this new approach will also expand on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale opportunities for API providers</a>, and continue to change how we monetize our content, data, and programmatic resources in the API economy.</p>

<p>First, I called out @JeremiahLee because he happened to tweet right at the moment I was moderating the panel, and second because I thought his comment reflected the polarization of the conversation around hypermedia. I personally know @JeremiahLee, and I know he&rsquo;s not a hater, he a super smart, and critical leader in the API conversation, but he Tweeted a controversial tweet, at the perfect moment, and I seized the opportunity. ;-)</p>
<p>Hypermedia hating was a central theme to the event in Detroit, and I have several stories planned, hoping to further explore the phenomena, and make suggestions for moving the conversation forward, and @JeremiahLee provided a little more explanation of himself, so let&rsquo;s explore his position, and I'll add some commentary along the way:</p>

<p>Thank you so much for Tweeting this @JeremiahLee, it really did provide a great focal point for kicking off the panel, and made this topic be a pervasive part of the conversation across the next two days! ;-)</p>

<p>Very true, but you can when you call someone&rsquo;s conversation about a proposed solution, 99% bullshit. ;-) Something I think is a hallmark of many of the hypermedia haters, which immediately makes it easy to label as such, from a single Tweet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>It&rsquo;s not being a hater to expect a solution be less painful than the problem being solved. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APICraft?src=hash">#APICraft</a> 3/7</p>

<p>Spot on, and something the hypermedia has failed to do. I do see signs where the benefits are being demonstrated, and potentially outweigh the work involved, but they are poorly communicated. There is so much work to be done on educating people around what hypermedia even is, let alone demonstrating the solutions it provides, which will allow each person to individually assess whether it alleviates more pain then it creates, and is something they should consider.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>I want to see how hypermedia can reduce integration time and frustration. I want to see how it prevents clients from breaking. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APICraft?src=hash">#APICraft</a> 4/7</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Great feedback. I think this was heard loud and clear by the audience. They realize there is a lot of work to be done to increase the number hypermedia API implementations in the wild, which will result in better client tooling, which will also provide material for the stories and evidence you will need to satisfy this concern.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>Linking data is cool. Finding common ways to describe common data types can enable some use cases. Do we need the rest? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APICraft?src=hash">#APICraft</a> 5/7</p>

<p>Another area that was discussed at the event. I think <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a> provides a minimalist approach that fits this description, and I leave to each of the other hypermedia format designers to chime in on why their approach is preferred, and isn&rsquo;t extraneous baggage. I will also spend some time better acquainting myself with each of the formats, and try to lend my own view. I think linking data, and establishing a common data vocabulary are great starting points for demonstrating hypermedia value to API providers and consumers, and we will have to build a case for each addition layer added on from there--lots of work to be done!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced the problems being talked about are wide spread or painful enough to warrant much overhead. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APICraft?src=hash">#APICraft</a> 6/7</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>I agree, and we need to see stories of specific implementations, that demonstrate that more value is generated then pain, as I said above. I&rsquo;d also urge you to look beyond just pain, and looking at the potential for establish new ways to express ourselves using APIs. I think hypermedia can provide very subtle, simple ways of expression that don&rsquo;t impose a lot of overhead, but can make integration, and even the end-user experience much smoother, chipping off the rough edges of what we currently have, reducing pain incrementally as we go.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none" style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced the hypermedia solutions can live up to the bold claims that border on magic. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APICraft?src=hash">#APICraft</a> 7/7</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>The conversations I heard over the three days of API Craft do not reflect the &ldquo;bold claims&rdquo; I hear of online. I did not hear talk of a perfect API client, or APIs that never break, and the other &ldquo;magic&rdquo; that is pointed at in online discussions. The conversations were very humble, realistic, and talked of the challenges, pitfalls, and acknowledging hypermedia is not a fit for all scenarios. While I&rsquo;m sure there are some snake oil hypermedia practitioners who preach magic, but I&rsquo;m thinking &ldquo;magic&rdquo; and &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo; are the terms used by folks who aren&rsquo;t immersing themselves in the conversations around hypermedia, and will only change when there is more material to help onboard them, and demonstrate real world implementations, and the solutions they provide.</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to put the term bulldozers in the same toolbox as bullshit, and magic. By no means do I see adding simple linking at the bottom of an API response as a bulldozer. I saw many layers to what hypermedia is, and I think calling it a bulldozer is speaking to the entire stack, not acknowledging providers can implement any part, and developers can also choose to use or ignore any part, as well.</p>
<p>I will explore more of these thoughts in future posts on hypermedia, but I wanted to respond specifically to @JeremiahLee thoughts. You do have some excellent points @JeremiahLee, and I think they were heard loud and clear, and reflect the conversation that happened throughout API Craft.  I think for anyone who wants to refrain from being labeled a hater, when it comes to REST, hypermedia, or any other topic, should be cautious when using polarizing terminology, and encourage the community to produce more of the evidence you are requiring to make the leap--while also acknowledging their desire to pioneer into new areas, which is good for entire community.</p>
<p>I will do my part to continue producing stories about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/what-is-a-hypermedia-api/">what hypermedia is</a>, and provide more examples of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">where hypermedia is being applied</a>. I&rsquo;m paying attention to hypermedia in 2014, not because it is the latest trend, I&rsquo;m paying attention to it because in my monitoring of the API space I&rsquo;m seeing a significant amount of discussion around it beyond just the academic discussions on <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft</a>. I&rsquo;m seeing an increased amount of blog posts, and examples of hypermedia being used in the wild.</p>
<p>Thanks for playing so nicely into the discussion on hypermedia at API Craft, Jeremiah. I think you are asking the right questions, I just want to help both sides of the discussion better understand how we can better set the tone for the conversation, so that things are more productive, and the whole community can move forward in a healthy way.</p>

<p>I'm preparing for my hypermedia panel at&nbsp;<a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft Detroit</a>&nbsp;today. The API Craft organizers have brought together one of the most important line-ups, when it comes to the hypermedia API discussion, that I've ever seen. To prepare for the discussion, &nbsp;I've spent time profiling each of the panelist, to help me, and hopefully you, better understand who they are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

</ul>
<p>These six hypermedia leaders, spend their time discussing hypermeida on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/api-craft">API-Craft forum</a>, but it isn't just talk, each of the panelsts have each also contributed their formats and tooling to the discussion, resulting in 9 separate hypermedia formats to consider:</p>

</ul>
<p>To help guide the conversation, I've asked each panelists to give me two things that they want the audience at API Craft to walk away with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>adding hypermedia to an API is a way to improve the API's usability (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>)</li>
<li>the more hypermedia information in a response, the more stateless that response can be (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>)</li>
<li>Hypermedia allows us to go beyond CRUD-influenced API design,  enabling a task-based message design consisting of current resource  state and available transitions.  This provides a richer interaction  model between client and server.  (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>)</li>
<li>The best way to improve the state of the art is to see hypermedia  applied to more use cases and have feedback shared publicly with the  community. (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>)</li>
<li>What are the metrics of success for your API? How do hypermedia designs contribute to or detract from those metrics? (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>)</li>
<li>Is adding links to a response enough? (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>)</li>
<li>What are the benefits of adding HTTP method and payload encoding  information to links - aka forms/actions for APIs? What are the  problems? Is it worth it?  (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>)</li>
<li>Are more complicated media types, that require more than an HTTP  library and a JSON parser to deal with, moving away from the  "simplicity" that has been driving web API adoption over SOAP?  (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>)</li>
<li>Does adding hypermedia really help if the data itself can't be understood without out-of-band knowledge? (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>)</li>
<li>What are the pros and cons of moving hypermedia controls to a  separate, machine-readable document (API descriptions) compared to  embedding them directly in resource representations? (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>)</li>
<li>How would an ideal hypermedia client library look like? (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>)</li>
<li>People often have a knee jerk reaction to dismiss hypermedia APIs as  a complex approach to API design. What is your three sentence pitch to  convince these people that it is not overkill, and in fact can be a  simpler approach over time? (<a href="https://twitter.com/MattMcLartyBC">@MattMcLartyBC</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions you'd like to have asked, I have the list on a <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-craft-hypermedia-panel-detroit-2014">Github repository dedicated to the event</a>. You are welcome to do a pull request on the list, or leave as an issue for the repository, and I will consider including in the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panel kicks off today around 1PM (we may start late, as some panelists hit flight troubles), and the <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/api-craft">conversation is being live streamed via UStream</a>.</p>

I wanted to go into the panel with a snapshot, and at least a minimal understanding of each of the panelists. This is kind of an all-star panel of hypermedia experts, so I need to at least bump up my understanding of what they are contributing to the API space, and who they are, beyond what I know from my own interactions with these API leaders.</p>
<p>As I do with all of my research, I wanted to share my work with you, my reader. Next up is J&oslash;rn Wildt. I'm a fan of&nbsp;J&oslash;rn's conversations via API-Craft, but beyond that I know very little. I look forward to talking more at API Craft, and learning about his work through my research.</p>
<p>Here is the outline of my research into J&oslash;rn's&nbsp;work:</p>
<p><strong>J&oslash;rn Wildt</strong><br /> <br /> <span>Software developer with experience from web programming (C#, </span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ASP.NET</span></span><span> and PHP) - both web UI as well as RESTful web APIs, Windows desktop clients, SOA, asynchronous messaging, domain driven design, computer language design, compilers, formal verification.

<p>I'm not posting all of this information just so I can share my research, it is also because J&oslash;rn has contributed a lot of work to the space, and the wider world needs to understand his contributions.. While I learned a lot through this process, I will also use it as a reference for my panel at API Craft, and for other stories I write in the future.</p>
<p>I've already added <a href="https://github.com/JornWildt/Mason">Mason</a>&nbsp;as a tools in my&nbsp;<a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia API research</a>. I could spend days going through this research, but I also have 2 ther hypermedia API experts to profile, so I'm going to move on to the others, and come back to my profile of J&oslash;rn&nbsp;in the future to continue my own hypermedia education.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hypermedia.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking through each of the worlds, of my hypermedia panelists, <span>Mike Amundsen (</span><a href="http://bit.ly/1mtrwki">@mamund</a><span>), Mike Kelly (</span><a href="http://bit.ly/1hBxi4m">@mikekelly85</a><span>), Steve Klabnik (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a><span>), Kevin Swiber (</span><a href="http://bit.ly/1oC7Udw">@kevinswiber</a><span>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a><span>), and Markus Lanthaler (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a><span>),&nbsp;</span>for <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft</a> tomorrow, reaquainting myself on what they bring to the hypermedia table, adding to my knowledge, and hopefully sharing some of the findings with you.</p>
<p>As I look through each of the hypermedia definitions, developed by my panelists, I keep feeling, that as API providers, there is still a lot of education that has to occur, to not just helping us better communicate with APIs, but also be more skilled at sharing and interacting around the resources we are making available via APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been brushing up my knowledge on <a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/">Collection+JSON</a>, <a href="https://rawgit.com/mamund/media-types/master/uber-hypermedia.html">UBER</a>, <a href="http://alps.io/">ALPS</a>, <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a>, <a href="http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/">Hydra</a>, <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>, <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">json:api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JornWildt/Mason">Mason</a>--9 spearate format that contribute to how we design our APIs.</p>
<p>When I think about the state of APIs, i see that we are barely using our words in our communication using APIs, what we say, and how we are saying it with our APIs, is still very crude, and unstructured. I feel like we are just toddlers, learning to use our words, sentences and playing nicely together. With the rich formats available to us, I feel that in 2014, I think we have to collectively get our butts to hypermeida school, and get educated&mdash;a lot of the work has been done for, we just need to get up to speed.</p>
<p>I see a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">handful of API providers employing hypermedia in their designs</a>, but they are still few and far between.</p>

<p>I'm preparing for my hypermedia panel with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), Mike Kelly (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>), Steve Klabnik (<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a>), Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>), and Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>), at&nbsp;<a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft Detroit</a>&nbsp;next week. I wanted to go into the panel with a snapshot, and at least a minimal understanding of each of the panelists. This is kind of an all-star panel of hypermedia experts, so I need to at least bump up my understanding of what they are contributing to the API space, and who they are, beyond what I know from my own interactions with these API leaders.</p>
<p>As I do with all of my research, I wanted to share my work with you, my reader. Next up is Markus Lanthaler. I knew of JSON-LD from work I was doing in the federal government, around making government services available, before I knew Markus. I had the pleasure of meeting him when he spoke at <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> in Amsterdam, as well as share the stage with him in Germany at <a href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the outline of my research into Markus's work:</p>

<p>I'm not posting all of this information just so I can share my research, it is also because Markus has an important vision of where we should take API design, and how we should be linking our most valuable data. While I learned a lot through this process, I will also use it as a reference for my panel at API Craft, and for other stories I write in the future.</p>
<p>I've already added <a href="http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/">Hydra</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>&nbsp;as a tools in my&nbsp;<a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia API research</a>. I could spend days going through this research, but I also have 2 ther hypermedia API experts to profile, so I'm going to move on to the others, and come back to my profile of Markus in the future to continue my own hypermedia education.</p>

<p>I'm preparing for my hypermedia panel with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), Mike Kelly (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>), Steve Klabnik (<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a>), Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>), and Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>), at&nbsp;<a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft Detroit</a>&nbsp;next week.

<p>As I do with all of my research, I wanted to share my work with you, my reader. Next up is Steve Klabnik. I've known Steve for a while, and have had the pleasure of having him speak at <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, as well as joined him speaking at <a href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> in Paris. I'm thankful for Steve's work on JSON-API, but I think that his other projects, and his consistent presence across the Twittersphere, and the intensity of his contributions to the Ruby on Rails community, is what stands out.<br /> <br /> Here is the outline of my research into Steve&rsquo;s work:</p>
<p><strong>Steve Klabnik</strong></p>
<p>I'm Steve Klabnik, and I've been a Rubyist for years now. I'm a Rails committer, instructor with Jumpstart Lab, and a prolific Open Source contributor. I think that the web is the best thing that mankind has ever built, and I care about it a lot. As the web becomes more and more programmable, we need to understand how our applications interact with the overall ecosystem, and build great services to power our shared future</p>

</ul>
<p>I consider Steve a part of the consciousness of the API space, and the larger "API Economy". I feel Steve's contributions go beyond JSON-API, and provide us a critical perspective, one that is not rooted in technology, but our collective self, working to understanding not just the how, but the why of all of this crazy shit.</p>

<p>I'm not posting all of this information just so I can share my research, it is also because Steve is a voice that the API space needs to hear, and I want to better understand the role he plays, while also helping you understand along the way. While I learned a lot through this process, I will also use it as a reference for my panel at API Craft, and for other stories I write in the future.</p>
<p>I've already added <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">JSON:API</a> as a tools in my&nbsp;<a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia API research</a>. I could spend days going through this research, but I also have 3 other hypermedia API experts to profile, so I'm going to move on to the others, and come back to my profile of Steve in the future to continue my own hypermedia education.</p>

<p>I like to showcase examples of companies who use their API communities as incubators, establishing them as a sort of external R&amp;D lab that invests in 3rd party developers who are building cool stuff on top of their API driven resources.</p>
<p>I came across an <a href="http://www.indix.com/blog/announcing-indix-api-v1-0-kickstart-program">announcement from product intelligence platform Indix</a>, in my usual monitoring of the API space, and they have a pretty cool program for their developers:</p>
<blockquote><em>Indix KickStart &ndash; a program to help startups and small businesses accelerate the development of product-aware applications and deliver rich product-aware experiences.</em></blockquote>
<p>Indix is looking to jumpstart early stage startups use of the Indix product API. Companies that have less than $1 million in funding and $100,000 in revenue are eligible apply, and Indix will evaluate the startups potential for receiving access to the Indix API at a reduced price point.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to incentivize developers usage of an API, and Indix&rsquo;s approach is one possible way to established a trusted developer access tier, where you can raise access limits, reduce costs, and potentially reducing a new startup&rsquo;s overhead, and their chances of success.</p>

<p>I'm preparing for my hypermedia panel with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), Mike Kelly (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>), Steve Klabnik (<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a>), Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>), and Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>), at&nbsp;<a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft Detroit</a>&nbsp;next week. I wanted to go into the panel with a snapshot, and at least a minimal understanding of each of the panelists. This is kind of an all-star panel of hypermedia experts, so I need to at least bump up my understanding of what they are contributing to the API space, and who they are, beyond what I know from my own interactions with these API leaders.<br /><br />As I do with all of my research, I wanted to share my work with you, my reader. Next up is Mike Kelly. I'm been tracking on Mike's work around HAL for a while now, I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/20/hypermedia-in-the-wild-amazon-appstream-api/">wrote about Amazon using HAL for their AppStream API</a>, a while back. I'm eager to learn more about HAL, and what it brings to the API design process, and how Mike, and HAL size up against the rest of the panelists, and their offerings.</p>
<p>Here is the outline of my research into Mike's work:</p>
<p><strong>Mike Kelly</strong><br /> <br /> <span>Mike Kelly is a software engineer from the UK. He runs an API consultancy helping companies design and build beautiful APIs that developers love.</span></p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Web Engineer at <a href="http://stateless.co/">Stateless Consulting</a><br /><strong>Mission:</strong>&nbsp;I like using technology to solve interesting problems.</p>

<p>Mike brings the Hypertext Application Language (HAL) format to the hypermedia discussion. He's been at it since summer of 2011, so he's been a pretty strong advocate in the space for some time, applying his mad skills that are polished at his consultancy <a href="http://stateless.co/">Stateless.co</a>. Let's take a quick look at HAL, and what resources I could find to support it.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><strong>HAL </strong>- Hypertext Application Language</span><br /> <br /> <span>HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API. Adopting HAL will make your API explorable, and its documentation easily discoverable from within the API itself. In short, it will make your API easier to work with and therefore more attractive to client developers. APIs that adopt HAL can be easily served and consumed using open source libraries available for most major programming languages. It's also simple enough that you can just deal with it as you would any other JSON.</span><br /> <br /> <strong>Links:</strong></p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-analytics-4.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of processing multiple emails, as well as coming down off an early morning conversation, all on the subject of analytics. A portion of the conversations are about analytics at the web site, web or mobile app level, and a portion of it was around analytics for API developers, as well as API platform providers&mdash;basically the full stack of analytics including platforms, developers, apps, all the way to the end-user.</p>
<p>Increased visibility into the API layer, and how developers and their apps are consuming API resources, is a cornerstone of API management. There are numerous solutions out there to give you analytics in websites and web apps (<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>), and within the mobile app itself (<a href="http://bit.ly/1rggWl3">Mixpanel</a>), and there are analytics at the API layer for both API providers, and the many developers who are integrating APIs into their applications and systems (<a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>).</p>
<p>API providers, with the assistance of API infrastructure solutions like <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>, have done very well in making sense of how resources are composed through a service composition layer, that includes a robust number of metrics and analytics for both provider and developer. This is great for allowing API providers to understand how developers, and their applications are consuming API resources, while at the same time delivering a subset of analytics for each individual developer regarding their individual API usage. This is great, but if a developer wants more application level information, they usually have to look elsewhere to other tools and services. (this is evolving)</p>
<p>After my conversations this morning, I was left thinking big picture about the future of analytics for the API driven, multichannel, website, single page, mobile, and Iot application stack. I am left with a vision of a tool that can handle all channels, not just the needs of the platform, and its developers, but also bring the end-users in the conversation. I need a standalone, open source framework, that I can use for not just a single platform, but something that could deployed for each end users, so it can span multiple platforms, for a single user, or group of users.</p>
<p>This is where it gets challenging, I&rsquo;m trying to think of this from a users perspective, abstracting away the provider, developer, and even the app, making the end-user the focus of the conversation. I still want to meet the needs of the provider and developers, I just want to shift the perspective, to the end deliverable, the actual &ldquo;thing&rdquo; we are looking to deliver, aka. the human element&mdash;moving the conversation furhter out of the business and geek realm.</p>
<p>I immediately think of the <a href="http://tincanapi.com/">Tin Can API</a>, aka <a href="http://bit.ly/1lEVW0y">Experience API</a>. Ok, I have to admit <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@AudreyWatters</a> made me think of it, after I described the solution I was looking for, she said, &ldquo;that sounds like the Tin Can API&rdquo;?  To which I said DOH!!! If you are unfamiliar with the Experience API, they describe themselves as:</p>
<blockquote><em>...a service that allows for statements of experience to be delivered to and stored securely in a Learning Record Store (LRS)...</em></blockquote>
<p>If we swap out the concept of an LRS for education, and call it a Platform Record Store(PRS), or if we are going to give it to each end-user to track across platforms, we call it a User Record Store (URS)&mdash;basically a online place to store your experiences. For education its an LRS, but for the wider API world I&rsquo;m calling it a PRS or URS, depending on how it is deployed.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you store the data, the Experience API lets you record just that, &ldquo;experiences&rdquo;. You can define your own objects, and verbs (actions), to be taken against those objects. The Experience API gives you a language map, authentication, authority, and many other goodies to make each &ldquo;statement of experience&rdquo; as meaningful as possible. Ok, so you are thinking, WTF is all this? An experience API really? Ok, well to put it in geek speak, its a logging API, just in this scenario we are making it about user experience instead of app, API, or just platform needs. Entering a richer realm of context, and potentially asking much more meaningful questions, rather than just logging on some bullshit metric.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore a little--If I&rsquo;m a platform provider I can track on the experiences that matter to me:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/GET of a /user API resource</li>
<li>/POST of an /image API resource</li>
<li>/POST of a /blog API resource</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the API metrics that API providers are tracking on currently, and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1lEVW0y">Experience API</a> model accommodates these common API usage experiences, while also opening up a whole new world of exploration. I think this new model would encourage API providers to explore new ways of measuring their API usage, and how resources are actually being put to use--kind of like we've been doing for years with API infrastructure providers.</p>
<p>From a developer&rsquo;s perspective, I can now can tap into those platform defined experiences for my account, and use across my apps. This is essentially what we have today from API infrastructure providers like 3Scale. Lets take to the next level, let&rsquo;s allow each developer to define their own experiences, that they can track on and use in their own applications, for example:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>View a users settings</li>
<li>Share of an image</li>
<li>View of a blog post</li>
<li>Logged out of app</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these experiences would be meaningful to the application developer, helping them understand how users are engaging with their apps. This layer of the experience stack would be open, allowing each developer to define&mdash;leaving it up to them whether they wanted to share with platform providers or not. (controversial!)</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about end-users of applications that are built. We could also use this to drive end-user analytics, allowing them to see a report of their activity on any application, or depending on how this whole idea is deployed, across applications. It would provide a web and mobile dashboard like app users are growing accustom to, as well as provide a sort of notification layer, if end-users are interested.</p>
<p><a href="http://tincanapi.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tin-can-api/tin-can-api-scorm-cloud.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>What is important about this model is transparency. It gives platforms, and developers single place to record metrics (experiences), in a way that provides transparency to the end-user.(controversial!) We can also open up the experience definitions to the end-users, letting each end-user define the things that matter to them, and the experiences they want to capture. I imagine, this is only for the savvy app user, seems like you&rsquo;d end up with a lot of ridiculous experience statements, but even if 1% of the feedback was interesting, it could provide an interesting feedback loop about what really is meaningful to end-users. Not exactly sure how you&rsquo;d integrate user-defined experiences into the application operations, but at the minimum it could be a feedback mechanism, and integration is manual.</p>
<p>From my perspective, all of the current API analytics stuff is born out of a very necessary, but technical, and boring IT realm. The experiences we are creating are very database, system, platform, app or resource directed experiences, with monetization in mind&mdash;all while trying to build the most meaningful app for end-users. We need to flip the paradigm, like we are seeing from API pioneers like Netflx, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/12/17/future-api-design-orchestration-layer/">who are talking about designing experience based API</a>s, instead of resource based APIs. In this way of thinking, the API is designed with the end-user experience in mind, and not blinded with where the resource came from, or how its structured&mdash;it is all based upon how it will actually be used.</p>
<p>Think of what an &ldquo;experience&rdquo; based analytics approach could do for business models, rather than focusing on the few experiences we already know, like how to monetize with the page view, app session, ad view, and add click. We could start identifying much more meaningful experiences to end-users, and yes even experiences that people are willing to pay for&mdash;the monetized experience! <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a> will love that. Reducing everything to a transaction baby! Its my job.</p>
<p>Well that concludes my analytics brain vomit for the day. I responded to my two emails, and had a fruitful call with a leading tech company about the future of analytics in the API stack, and successfully puked up this post. If you read it, I&rsquo;m very sorry, and I hope it made sense. I&rsquo;m still working through these thoughts, but it is a bucket that has been overflowing for a while now. I&rsquo;ll put on the side burner, stir my thoughts around in future stories, and figure out what is next.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://hall.com/docs/integrations"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/hall/hall-api-integrations.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I saw two tweets from Zapier the other day, where they were highlighting two separate SaaS platforms, who had integrated Zapier into their own platform. Both <a href="http://help.gumroad.com/customer/portal/articles/1579321-integrations">Gumroad</a> and <a href="https://hall.com/docs/integrations">Hall</a> took the time to highlight the other platforms they are integrated with. I think there are a couple of interesting items in these stories&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Zapier &amp; IFTTT Integration</strong> <br /> A while back <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">I added reciprocity to this list</a> of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a>, because I was seeing enough API providers, taking it upon themselves to make sure their platform had both Zapier and IFTTT integration. Ensuring your API is working with leading reciprocity providers will become even more critical for API providers, as more non-developers are putting APIs to work managing their daily personal, and professional lives.</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated Integration Page</strong><br /> The fact that hall has a dedicated integration page is interesting. I think it is valuable to show the platforms that an API has been officially integrated with. It helps developers, and non-developers understand the potential that exists around a platform and its API. I can also see the benefit of opening up the ability for the API ecosystem to submit their own integrations as well--you never know it might encourage other platforms to integrate, if they know they have an opportunity to be showcased.</p>
<p>I like how <a href="https://hall.com/docs/integrations">Hall does their integration page</a>, and they 15+ integrations, they have a custom option, which is basically their very simple API, allowing you to post messages from your app. Hall doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a full blown API, allowing you to interact with all aspects of the platform, but I still their approach is interesting.</p>
<p>I think that integration with reciprocity providers like Zapier and IFTTT should be default for all API providers. I also think that API providers should consider highlighting other common platform integrations like with Heroku or Github, depending on the nature of your API. You can consider providing seamless integration between platforms, as well as what I&rsquo;d consider a platform development kit (PDK)&mdash;providing open source, white lable code that allows a developer to reverse engineer your integration with other leading platforms.</p>
<p>As we spend more time in the clouds, I think providing seamless integration with other platforms, providing platform development kits (PDK), and employing reciprocity providers like Zapier and IFTTT will become the norm.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/priorities/university-of-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a little biased at the moment, after participating in a <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/07/22/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon-wrapup/">Reclaim Your Domain hackathon</a> with some really smart folks from multiple universities, as well as working on my first white paper on APIs in higher education, but I feel pretty strongly that higher education institutions focusing on APIs will extremely important in the next two years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly working to understand the big picture of the emerging API economy, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/the-importance-of-a-government-api-phase/">the importance of the government API development phase</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">working to understand what is next for the US government API strategy</a>, while also <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">acknowledging we need the enterprise to continue waking up to the potential of APIs</a>. I think, right along with government, and the enterprise, another importance piece of the overall API puzzle is increasing the focus on <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">APIs in higher education</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The University Argument</strong><br /> If I am making a pitch to a university, I would <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">tell my Amazon API story</a>, and how APIs can open up access to institutional resources, making them more accessible across campus, and externally with partners and vendors. APIs are how startups, SMB, enterprise, and the government are increasing efficiency, agility, and delivering the web and mobile apps that are part of a larger, healthier digital strategy vision. Top universities like <a href="http://webservices.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>, and <a href="https://developer.byu.edu/wiki/dashboard.action">Brigham Young University</a> or leading the way with modern API platforms, that are changing the way they do business on campus&mdash;take a look at the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/23/browsing-the-261-apis-at-brigham-young-university/">250+ APIs from BYU</a>, to get a idea.</p>
<p><strong>The Student Argument</strong><br /> If I am making the pitch for why students should care about APIs, during the most formative years of their lives, I would point out that APIs are already touching every aspect of their lives, from the websites they visit, to the mobile phone in their pocket. If your college years are about preparing you for the world, APIs need to front and center in your education, giving you the basics, but also allowing you to peel back the black curtain on the technology that is slowly taking over our world, and establish skills that will give you an edge in your career.</p>
<p><strong>Web Literacy</strong><br /> Computers, and the Internet are part of the higher education experience, and it is increasingly important that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span></strong> students obtain at least a basic level of web literacy to be able to operate on the web. Understanding the workings of the Internet, like HTTP, SSL, URLs, DNS, Email, and fundamentals of privacy, security, and terms of service, are essential to the education of every individual. While they may not retain everything they learn, like the rest of their education, it will provide a fundamental base for them to work from the rest of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Domain Literacy</strong><br /> Students today are faced with understanding who they are in this big new world they are thrust into after being at home with their parents, and that includes understating and expanding their digital identity. What is the difference between university, commercial, and government web and mobile applications? Students need to have a sense of what is theirs, and what is a companies or institutions, and understand when some information or content is something they should personally own. Domain literacy is not just about learning about online domains like .com and .org, it is about understanding your own domain on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, or your student information system account, class forums, and the possibilities that are opened up when you are in control your own online domain.</p>
<p><strong>Portfolio Ownership</strong><br /> Every classroom, project and program experience for a student should be considered a potential candidate for addition to a student's portfolio. Contributing to, and managing a portfolio in 2014 is done online, allowing for a portfolio to potentially be spread across campus, corporate and other 3rd party sites, platforms, and systems. Educating students about owning their own content, data and other information, and the opportunities around data portability and APIs, in helping them assert ownership and control over their portfolio is essential to education in the digital age. I'm not talking traditional e-portfolio, I'm talking about defining, understanding, and aggregating the best of what you do online, during your college years--in preparation for entering the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Workplace Ready</strong><br /> Higher education is about preparing students for their role in society, and hopefully part of that is being a positive contributor to the workplace, and larger workforce. Modern web APIs are born out of the most tech savviest employees, developing the work-arounds, and access to resources they need to get their jobs done, and solve the problems they face. Whether it is pulling Census Bureau data, and populating a spreadsheet, or migrating the companies blog platform from blogger to a dedicated Wordpress instance, APIs are central to the skills that tomorrow's workforce will need. APIs aren&rsquo;t always about developing a website, or mobile application, they can be as simple as migrating form entries from an online form, and populating a Google Spreadsheet using <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. If one of our goals is to make sure students are prepared for the workforce, APIs have to be a regular part of their educational diet, ensuring that when they hit the ground as part of the workforce, API literacy is default.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Citizen</strong><br /> APIs are already touching every aspect of life from looking for a restaurant on Yelp, to paying your taxes using TurboTax. Not every individual needs to understand the inner workings of APIs and oAuth, but they <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/api-and-oauth-literacy-is-as-important-as-financial-literacy-in-the-api-economy/">need to have basic API literacy</a>, so they know APIs exist, and that they can get their photos and other information out of a service they use. Every citizen needs to understand the apps on their mobile phone, and the relationship to their online accounts, and who has access to their personal information using oAuth and APIs, and how they can manage these settings. To interact with government, APIs are playing an ever increasing role, and allowing citizens to participate in the political process, access student aid, pay their taxes, and get access to their energy and healthcare data. Let's prepare our students for the future.</p>
<p>In a perfect world students need to be aware of APIs by the time they first set foot on campus. Ideally they are already exposed to them in their daily online interactions, or someday through the FAFSA process, but at the very least it should be up to the university to expose them to APIs when it comes to class registration, student information systems, or ideally as part of the <a href="http://umw.domains/">school&rsquo;s Domain of One&rsquo;s Own program</a>.</p>
<p>My argument isn't just about colleges and universities getting on board with APIs across all of campus operations, this is about faculty and administrations becoming API literate, and exposing students to APIs as part of every interaction. You don't like the student information system or class schedule when you come in as freshman? Ok, make it better. Need a list of students for a class? Here is the Google Spreadsheet to class schedule API connector. Want to bring in your posts from Tumblr into the classroom? Use the Tumblr API to get your content out, and published where you want using Zapier. Let's teach them to solve the everyday problems they face, by applying technology in sensible ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some amazing movement during my last four years of evangelizing APIs, across mutiple industries, and within city and federal government, just by educating a handful of energetic entrepreneurs and civic activists, turning on the API light--resulting in incremental change in the way companies do business, organizations and government operates. Imagine if we turned on a whole generation of citizens, helping them understand that this is the way business is done, and how personal, corporate, organizational, institutional resources are accessed, shared, and managed?</p>
<p>Similar to my efforts on APIs in the federal government over the last two years, I&rsquo;m going to turn up the focus on APIs in higher education. By 2016, I want APIs to be ubiquitous at higher educational institutions around the globe.</p>

<p>I'm preparing for my hypermedia panel with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), Mike Kelly (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>), Steve Klabnik (<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a>), Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>), and Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>), at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft Detroit</a> next week. I wanted to go into the panel with a snapshot, and at least a minimal understanding of each of the panelists. This is kind of an all-star panel of hypermedia experts, so I need to at least bump up my understanding of what they are contributing to the API space, and who they are, beyond what I know from my own interactions with these API leaders.<br /> <br /> As I do with all of my research, I wanted to share my work with you, my reader. So, first up is Mike Amundsen. I'm very aware of Mike's presence in the space, but after doing just a couple hours of refresh on what he's been up to, I'm blown away by the leadership he has brought to how we communicate with APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's dive in, here is the outline of my research into Mike's work:<br /> <br /> <strong>Mike Amundsen</strong></p>

<p><strong>ALPS (</strong>Application-Level Profile Semantics)</p>
<p>The purpose of Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS) is to document the application-level semantics of a particular implementation. This is accomplished by describing elements of response representations for a target media type. For example identifying markup elements returned (i.e. semantic HTML ala Microformats) and state transitions (i.e. HTML.A and HTML.FORM elements) that advance the state of the current application.<br /> <br /> <strong>Links:</strong></p>

<p>I'm not posting all of this information just so I can share my research, it is also because Mike is a leader in the API space, and I want to better understand the role he plays, while also helping you understand along the way. While I learned a lot through this process, I will also use it as a reference for my panel at API Craft, and for other stories I write in the future.</p>
<p>I will also be adding Collection+JSON, UBER, and ALPS as tools in my <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia API research</a>. I could spend days going through this research, but I also have five other hypermedia API experts to profile, so I'm going to move on to the others, and come back to my profile of Mike Amundsen in the future to continue my hypermedia education.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://strongloop.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/strongloop/strongloop-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking through <a href="http://strongloop.com/strongblog/node-js-api-server-announcement/">the most recent API server release from StrongLoop</a>, and I can&rsquo;t help but see echoes of what I&rsquo;ve been researching, and covering across the <a href="http://kinlane.com/about/">API Evangelist network</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> has been front and center for years, but <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a> is something that is just now being productized, with a wealth of new service providers emerging to provide API deployment solutions that go beyond DIY frameworks, and enterprise API gateways.</p>
<p>Let start with walking through their announcement of their StrongLoop API Server:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>LoopBack 2.0 </strong>- An open source framework for quickly creating APIs with Node, including the client SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>mobile Backend-as-a-Service -</strong> An mBaaS to provide mobile services like push, offline-sync, geopoint and social login either on-premise or in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Connectors -</strong> Connectivity for Node apps leveraging over ten supported data sources including Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB and SOAP.</li>
<li><strong>Controller - </strong>Automated DevOps for Node apps including profiling, clustering, process management and log management capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring - </strong>A hosted or on-premise graphical console for monitoring resource utilization, response times and function tracing with the ability to send metrics to existing monitoring tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as StrongLoop did in their release post, let&rsquo;s dive deeper into LoopBack 2.0, the <a href="https://github.com/strongloop">open source core</a> of StrongLoop, which they say "acts as a glue between apps or devices and data via APIs written in Node&rdquo;:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Studio - </strong>A graphical interface to complement the command-line tooling and assist developers in building Loopback models.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> -</strong> The ability to script tasks, scaffold, and template applications and externalize their configurations for multiple environments.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS 4.0</a> - </strong>The latest update, for the well known Node.js package, bringing improvements by removing bundled middleware and refactoring them into maintainable modules, revamped router to remove confusion on HTTP verb usage and decoupling Connect, the HTTP framework of Node from the Express web framework. It is also the E in the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, Node.js).</li>
<li><strong>Project Structure -</strong> An expanded directory structure has been expanded to make it easier to organize apps and add functionality via pre-built LoopBack components and Node modules.</li>
<li><strong>Workspace API -</strong> Internal API making it easier to define, configure, and bootstrap your application at design time and runtime by simply defining metadata in the form of JSON.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of the few sophisticated, next generation, API deployment frameworks I have seen.  We have had gateways for a while, and we have a new breed of database and spreadsheet to API providers like <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark</a>. We also have a new wave of <a href="http://scraping.apievangelist.com">scraping</a> to API solutions from <a href="http://bit.ly/1kNmUGe">Kimono Labs</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1pKwOg9">Import.io</a>, but I&rsquo;d say <a href="http://bit.ly/1wWkDwH">Orchestrate.io</a> gets us closest to the vision I have for StrongLoop, when it comes to API deployment.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/legos.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve referenced this ability in my stories on virtual API stacks:</p>

</ul>
<p>This new approach to API deployment allows us to rapidly define, deploy, and orchestrate stacks of API resources for use in our web, single page, and mobile applications. I really feel like <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">BaaS</a>, as an entire company, was just a short growth phase, that leading us to this point, where anyone can quickly deploy their own BaaS, for any broad, or niche purpose. I also see my research into the world of <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">APIs and Single Page Apps (SPAs)</a> reflected here, in StrongLoops API platform vision.</p>
<p>I feel that StrongLoop has an important take on API deployment, one that reflects where leading API, web, single page, and mobile app developers have been for a while now. The difference is that StrongLoop is providing as a standardized platform, allowing developers to much more elegantly orchestrate their entire lifecycle. You have everything you need to connect to existing resources, generate new API resources, and organize work into reusable parts, to deliver the web, single page, mobile apps you need.</p>
<p>I am closely watching this new generation of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API deployment providers</a>, companies like StrongLoop, Orchestrate, Flynn, and Cosmic. I see these players being the next generation API gateway, that goes way beyond just providing an enterprise gateway to internal assets. This newer vision is much more directly aligned with the needs of developers, enabling them to rapidly design, deploy and manage the API services they need to drive the web, single page, and mobile apps that are the vehicles in the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-society-2.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had a conversation with a VC today who looking for some information on startups, who had APIs, and had built their company around public data. The two companies that were referenced in the original contact email, were companies like <a href="https://eligibleapi.com/">Eligible API</a>, and <a href="https://clever.com/">Clever API</a>. Two similar, yet very different approaches to aggregating public and data, into a viable startup&mdash;one thing to note, is Clever used to aggregate data from school districts, but now just provides login services.</p>
<p>During our conversation, we talked about the world of APIs, open data, both government and across the private sector. I spent 30 minutes helping them understand the landscape, and told them that when I was done I would generate of list of an APIs, I thought were interesting, that I would categorize into a similar space as Eligible and Clever&mdash;something that was much more difficult to quantify than I expected. Nonetheless I learned a lot, and as I do with all my research I wanted to share the story of my experience.</p>
<p>I started with the companies, that off the top of my head, had built interesting businesses around publicly available facts and data, a definition that would expand as I continued. I started with a couple APIs I know provide some common data sources via APIs:</p>

<li><a href=" http://dataweave.com/labs#ourapi"><strong>DataWeave</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Next I wanted to look at a couple of the business data APIs I depend on daily, and while I was searching I found a third. What I think is interesting about these business data providers, is their very different business models, and approaches to gathering and making the data available.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/"><strong>Crunchbase</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://opencorporates.com/"><strong>OpenCorporates</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mergent.com/"><strong>Mergent</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediately after looking through Crunchbase and Opencorporates, I queried my brain for other leading APIs, who are pulling content or data from public sources, and developing a business around them. It makes sense to look at the social data and content realm, but this is where I stop, I don&rsquo;t want to venture to far down the social media rabbit hole, but I think that these two providers are important to consider.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://dev.datasift.com/"><strong>DataSift</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://gnip.com/"><strong>Gnip</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>While Twitter data isn&rsquo;t the usual business, industry, product, and other common facts, it has grown to be the new data that is defining not just Twitter&rsquo;s business, but a whole ecosystem of aggregators, and other services that are built on consuming, aggregating and often publishing public raw or enriched social data.</p>
<p>I wanted to also step back again and look at Clever, and think about their pivot from aggregating school data to being a login service. There was another API that I was tracking on who offered a similar service to Clever, aggregating school data, that I think is important to list alongside with Clever.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://clever.com/"><strong>Clever</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.learnsprout.com/"><strong>LearnSprout</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I know both Clever and LearnSprout are adjusting to find the sweet spot in what they do, but I keep them on the list because of what they did when I was originally introduced with their services. I think we can safely say that there will be no shortage of startups to come, following in Clever and LearnSprout's footsteps, unaware of their predecessors, and the challenge they face when aggregate data across school districts.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare Data </strong><br />After taking another look at Clever, I also took another walkthrough at the Eligible API, and spent time looking for similar data driven APIs in the healthcare space. I think that Eligible is a shining example of what this particular VC was looking for, and a good model for startups looking to not just build a company and API around public data, but do it in a way that you can make a significant impact on an industry.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://eligibleapi.com/"><strong>Eligible API</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.goodrx.com/"><strong>GoodRX</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.openphacts.org/"><strong>Open Phacts</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I know that there are more healthcare data platforms out there, but these are a handful of the ones that have APIs, that I track on. Healthcare is one of those heavily regulated industries, where there is huge opportunity to aggregate data from multiple public and private sectors sources, and build an API driven business from.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Data </strong><br />After healthcare, my mind immediately moved into the world of energy data, because there is a task on my task list to study open data licensing as part of a conversation I&rsquo;m having with Genability. I think what this latest wave of energy API providers, and the work they do with the data of individual customers, but also wider power companies, and state and federal data, is very interesting.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://genability.com/"><strong>Genability</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wattzon.com/"><strong>WattzOn</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.tendrilinc.com/"><strong>Tendril</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.3tier.com/en/"><strong>3Tier</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>When I was in Maryland this last May, moderating a panel with folks from the Department of Energy, the conversation came up around the value of the Department of Energy data, to the private sector. I&rsquo;d say that the Department of Energy data is in the top 5 agencies, when it comes to viability for use in the private sector, and making a significant economic impact.</p>
<p><strong>Libraries</strong> <br />Pushing the boundaries of this definition again, I stumbled onto the concept of launching APIs for libraries, built around public or private collections. While not an exact match to other APIs is this story, I think what DPLA is doing, reflects what we are talking about, and about building a platform around public and private datasets (collections in this case).</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://dp.la/"><strong>Digital Public Library of America</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/"><strong>Open Library</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://api.repo.nypl.org/"><strong>New York Public Library</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Just like government agencies, public and private institutions possess an amazing amount of data, content, and media that is not readily available online, and provides a pretty significant opportunity to build API driven startups and organizations around these collections.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Data </strong><br />There is a wealth of valuable scientific data being made available via public APIs, from various organizations, and institutions. I&rsquo;m not sure where these groups are gathering their data from, but I&rsquo;m sure there is a lot of public funding, and sources included in some of the APIs I track on.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.dataone.org/"><strong>DataOne</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/"><strong>EMBL-EBI</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just two of the numerous scientific data APIs I keep an eye on, and I agree that this is a little out of bounds of exactly what we are looking for. However I think that the opportunity for designing, deploying and managing high performing, high value APIs from public and privately owned scientific data is pretty huge.</p>
<p><strong>Government Data </strong><br />As I&rsquo;m looking at these energy, and scientific APIs across my monitoring system, I&rsquo;m am presented with other government APIs, that are consumer focused, and often have the look and feel of a private sector startup, while also having a significant impact on private sector industries.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.epa.gov/envirofw/"><strong>EPA Envirofacts</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://data.energystar.gov/developers"><strong>EnergyStar</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/"><strong>Medline Plus</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>While all of these APIs are clearly .gov iniativies, they provide clear value to consumers, and I think there is opportunity for startups to play around in offering complimentary, or even competing services with these government generated, industry focused open data--going further than these platforms do.</p>
<p><strong>Quasi-Government Data </strong><br />Alongside those very consumer, industry oriented government efforts, I can&rsquo;t help but look at the quasi-government APIs I&rsquo;m familiar with, that are providing similar data driven APIs to the government APIs above.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/xml/fx.html"><strong>Federal Reserve</strong></a></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://cfpb.github.io/api/hmda/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While these may not be models for startups, I think they provide potential ideas that private sector non-profit groups can take action. Providing mortgage, energy, environmental, or even healthcare services, developed around public and private sector data, will continue to grow as a viable business model for startups and organizations in coming years.</p>
<p><strong>Watchers of Government Data </strong><br />Adding another layer to government data, I have to include the organizations that keep an eye on government, a segment of organizations that have evolved around building operational models around aggregating, generating meaning from, then republishing data that helps us understand how government is working (or not working).</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://community.openspending.org/help/api/"><strong>Open Spending</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/"><strong>Sunlight Foundation</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.opencongress.org/api"><strong>Open Congress</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are all non profit organizations doing this work, but when it comes to journalism, politics, and other areas, there are some viable services that can be offered surrounding, and on top of the valuable open data being liberated, generated and published by the watchers of our government.</p>
<p><strong>School Data Again </strong><br />One interesting model for building a business around government data is with Great School. There are some high value datasets available at the Department of Education as a well as Census Bureau, and using these sources have presented a common model for building a company around public data:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.greatschools.org/api/registration.page"><strong>Great Schools</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly a fan of the Great Schools, but I think it is worthy of noting. I&rsquo;ve talked with them, and they don&rsquo;t really have as open of a business model, and platform as I would like to see. I feel it is important to &ldquo;pay it forward&rdquo; when building a for profit company around public data&mdash;I don&rsquo;t have a problem with building businesses, and generating revenue around public data, but if you don&rsquo;t contribute to it being more accessible than you found it--I have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>News</strong> <br />After spending time looking through the APIs I monitor, I remembered the use of public data by leading news sources. These papers are using data from federal, state, and city data sources, and serving them via APIs, right alongside the news.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform">Guardian</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs">NY Times</a></strong></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/"><strong>Google Civic</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.usatoday.com/"><strong>USA Today</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These news sources don&rsquo;t make money off the APIs themselves, like Software as a Service providers they provide value-add to their core business. Census surveys, congressional voting, economic numbers, and other public data is extremely relevant to the everyday news that impacts us.</p>
<p><strong>Been Doing This For A While </strong><br />When we talk about building businesses around publicly available data, there are some companies who have been doing this a while. The concept really isn&rsquo;t that new, so I think it is important to bring these legacy providers into the conversation.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.melissadata.com/"><strong>MelissaData</strong></a></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.strikeiron.com/">StrikeIron</a></strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.xignite.com/"><strong>XIgnite</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.infoconnect.com/"><strong>InfoGroup</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these data providers have been doing it for over a decade. They all get the API game, and offer a wide range of API services for developers, providing access to data that is taken directly from, derived or enhanced from public sources. When it comes to building a business around public data, I don&rsquo;t think these four have the exact model I&rsquo;m looking for, but there are many lessons of how to do it right, and wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Weather Is Age Old Model&nbsp;</strong><br />When you think about it, one of the original areas we built services around government data is weather. Weather data is a common reference you will experience, when you hear any official talk about the potential of government data. There are numerous weather API services available that are doing very well, when it comes to digesting public data, and making it relevant to developers.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://developer.weathersource.com/"><strong>WeatherSource</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api"><strong>Wunderground</strong></a></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://openweathermap.org/API">OpenWeatherMap</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Weather is the most relevant API resource I know of in the space. Weather impacts everyone, making it a resource all web and mobile applications will need. With the growing concern around climate change, this model for using public data, and generating valuable APIs will only grow more important.</p>
<p><strong>Time Zone Data </strong><br />Right there behind weather, I would say that time and data information is something that impacts everyone. Time shapes our world, and government sets the tone of the conversation when it comes to date and time data&mdash;something that is driving many API driven business models.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://timezonedb.com/api"><strong>Time Zone DB</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://services.timeanddate.com/"><strong>TimeAndDate.com</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>What I like about time and date APIs is that they provide an essential ingredient in all application development. It is an example of how government can generate and guide data sources, while allowing the private sector to help manage vital services around this data, that developers will depend on for building apps.</p>
<p><strong>Currency Conversion</strong> <br />Along with time zone data, currency conversion is a simple, valuable, API driven service that is needed across our economy. You have to know what time it is in different time zones, and know what the conversion rate between different currencies to do business in the global API economy.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://www.currencyconvertapi.com/"><strong>Currency Converter</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.exchangerate-api.com"><strong>Exchange Rate API</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In our increasingly global, online world, currency conversion is only going to grow more important. Workforces will be spread across the globe, and paying employees, buying goods and services will increasingly span the globe, requiring seamless currency conversion in all applications.</p>
<p><strong>Transit Data </strong><br />Another important area of APIs, that are increasingly impacting our everyday lives, are transit APIs, providing real-time bus, train, subway, and other public transit data to developers.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/"><strong>Google Transit</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://silverrailtech.com/journeyplanner"><strong>Silverrail</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.commuterapi.com"><strong>Public Transit Community</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://thetransitapp.com/developers"><strong>Transit App</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Transit data will always be a tug of war between the public and private sector. some data will be generated in each sphere, with some projects incentivized by the government, where the private sector is unwilling to go. Establishing clear models for public and private sector partnerships around transit data will be critical to society functioning.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate </strong> <br />While I won&rsquo;t be covering every example of building a business around public data in this story, I think I would be ignorant if I didn&rsquo;t talk about the real estate industry, one of the oldest businesses built on public data and facts.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://zillow.com"><strong>Zillow</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.trulia.com"><strong>Trulia</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the real estate industry. One of my startups in the past was build around aggregating MLS data, and I can safely say that the real industry is one of the shadiest fucking industries I know of, that is built on top of public data. I don&rsquo;t think this industry is a model that we should be following, but again, I do think there are a huge lessons to be learned from the space as we move forward building business models around public data.</p>
<p>That is as far as I&rsquo;m going to go in this story in exploring API driven businesses built on public data. My goal wasn&rsquo;t meant to be comprehensive, I was just looking to answer some questions for myself around who else is  playing in the space. This list of businesses came out of my API monitoring system, so is somewhat limited in its focus, requiring the company who is building on top of public data, to also have an API&mdash;creating quite a blind spot for this research. However this is a blind spot I'm willing to live in, because I think my view represents the good in the space, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where we should be headed</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Open Data 500</strong> <br />For the next edition of this story, I&rsquo;d like to look through the 500 companies listed in the <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/list/">Open Data 500 project</a>. I like the focus of the project from the <a href="http://thegovlab.org/">GovLab</a>, out of New York University&mdash;their description from the site sums up the project:</p>
<blockquote><em>The Open Data 500 is the first comprehensive study of U.S. companies that use open government data to generate new business and develop new products and services. Open Data is free, public data that can be used to launch commercial and nonprofit ventures, do research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.</em></blockquote>
<p>I see a few of the companies I've listed above in the Open Data 500. I&rsquo;m stoked that they provide both a JSON and CSV version of the Open Data 500, making it much easier to process, and make sense of the companies listed. I&rsquo;d like to make a JavaScript slideshow from the JSON file, and browse through the list of companies, adding my own set of tags&mdash;helping me better understand the good from the bad examples, as well as where the trends and opportunities are around developing APIs around public data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty convinced that we have a lot of work to do in making government machine readable data at the federal, state, county and city level more available, before we can fully realize the potential of the API economy. Without, high quality, real-time, valuable public data, we won&rsquo;t be able to satisfy the needs of the next wave of web, single page, mobile and Internet of things application developers. I'm also hoping we can work to establish some healthy blueprints for developing private sector businesses and organization around public data, by reviewing some of the existing startups who are finding success with this model, and build on, or compliment this existing work--rather than re-invent the wheel.</p>

<p>I spent the weekend hacking away with a small group of very smart folks, at the <a href="http://lahackathon.reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain Hackathon in Los Angeles</a>. Fifteen of us gathered at Pepperdine University in west LA, looking to move forward the discussion around what we call &ldquo;Reclaim Your Domain&rdquo;. This conversation began last year, at the <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-open-learning/">#ReclaimOpen Hackathon</a>, continued earlier this year at <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/exploring-the-domain-universe-at-emory-university/">Emory University</a>, and we were looking to keep the momentum building this weekend at Pepperdine.</p>

<p>If you are unsure of what #Reclaim is all about, join the club, we are trying to define it as well. You can head over to <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a>, or you can also look at <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a>, and the original <a href="http://umw.domains/">Domain Of Ones Own at University of Mary Washington</a> which has provided much of the initial spark behind the #Reclaim movement, for more information. Ultimately, #Reclaim will always be a very personal experience for each individual, but Reclaim Your Domain is primarily about:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><em>Educating, and empowering individual to define, reclaim, and manage their digital self</em></blockquote>
<p>The primary thing I got out of this weekend, beyond the opportunity to hang out with such a savvy group of educators, was the opportunity to talk through <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/">my own personal #Reclaim process</a>, as well as my vision of how we can use <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/07/16/driving-the-reclaim-process-using-terms-of-service-didnt-read/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read as a framework for the #Reclaim process</a>. The weekend&nbsp;re-enforced the importance of APIs in higher education, in not just my own API Evangelism work, but contributing to the overall health of the Internet (which I will talk about in a separate post).</p>
<p>To recap what I said above, there are three domains, that you will need to learn about my current #Reclaim work:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org">Reclaim Your Domain</a></strong> - The project site for all of this work, where you will find links to all information, calendar of events, and link to individual reclaim sites.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/">Kin Lane Reclaim Your Domain</a></strong> - My personal #Reclaim website where I am working on reclaiming my domain, while I also work to define the overall process.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://tosdr.org">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a></strong> - A website for establishing plain english, yet machine readable discussions around the terms of service for the platforms we depend on.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the weekend I was introduced to some other very import tools, which are essential to the #Reclaim process:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://withknown.com/">Known</a></strong> - A publishing platform that empowers you to manage your online self, available as an open source tool, or available as cloud service. I&rsquo;m still setting up my own instance of Known, and will have more information after I get setup, and play with more.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://indieauth.com/">IndieAuth</a></strong> - IndieAuth is a way to use your own domain name to sign in to websites, which is a missing piece on the identity front for #Reclaim. Same as Known, I&rsquo;ll have more information on this after I play with.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also got some quality time, getting more up to speed on two other of tools that will be be important to #Reclaim:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors">Smallest Federated Wiki</a></strong> - A simple, and powerful wiki implementation that uses the latest technology to collaborate around content, with a very interesting approach to using JSON, and plugins to significantly evolve the wiki experience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a></strong> - Reclaim Hosting provides educators and institutions with an easy way to offer their students domains and web hosting that they own and control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the course of two days I was able to share what I was working on, and learn about <a href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a>, and what <a href="https://twitter.com/holden">@holden</a> is up to with Smallest Federated Wiki, and get a closer look at what <a href="https://twitter.com/timmmmyboy">@timmmmyboy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/">@mburtis</a> are up to with Reclaim Hosting, while also explore some other areas I think are vital to #Reclaim moving forward. #WIN There were also some other really important takeways for me.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon/reclaim-hackathon.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>POSSEE</strong><br /><a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE"> POSSE</a> is an acronym for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. For the first time I saw an application that delivers on this concept, while also holding potential for the whole reclaim your domain philosophy--<a href="http://withknown.com/">Known</a>. I am excited to fire up my own instance of Known and see how I can actually use to manage my digital self, and add this slick piece of software to the #Reclaim stack of tools that everyone else can put to use.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of API 101</strong><br /> During the second day of the hackathon, I was asked to give an API 101 talk. I headed to the other end of the meeting area, allowing anyone who wasn&rsquo;t interested in listening to me, to continue hacking on their own. I was surprised to see that everyone joined me to learn about APIs--well everyone except <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a> (API blah blah blah). I felt like everyone had a general sense of what an API was, but only a handful of folks possessed intimate knowledge. I used the separation of websites being for humans, and APIs being for other applications and systems as the basis for my talk&mdash;showing how websites return HTML for displaying to humans, and APIs return JSON meant to be used by applications. Later in the day I also wrote a little PHP script which made a call to an API (well JSON file), then displayed bulleted list of results, to help show how APIs can drive website content. Once again I am reminded of the importance of API 101 demos, and how I need to focus more in this area.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Github 101</strong><br /> One of the topics we covered was the basics of using Github. I walked through the basic concepts that surround Github usage like repositories, forks, commits, pull requests&mdash;demonstrating how multiple users can collaborate, and work together on not just code, but content. I demonstrated how issues, and milestones can also be used to manage conversation around the project, in addition to work with repository files. Lastly, I walked through Github Pages, and how using a separate branch, you can publish HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON for projects, turning Github into not just a code and content management platform, but also a publishing endpoint.</p>
<p><strong>APIs.json Playing a Role in #Reclaim</strong><br /> After hearing <a href="https://twitter.com/timmmmyboy">@timmmmyboy</a> talk about how Reclaim Hosting aggregates domain users within each university, I brought up <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and how I&rsquo;m using this as a index for APIs in both the public and private sector. While it may not be something that is in the immediate roadmap for #Reclaim, I think APIs.json will play a significant role in #Reclaim process down the road, and is worth noting here.</p>

<p><strong>Containerization Movement</strong><br /> One pattern I saw across the Reclaim Hosting and Domain of One&rsquo;s Own work from <a href="https://twitter.com/timmmmyboy">@timmmmyboy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/">@mburtis</a>, is that they are mimicking what is currently happening in the <a href="https://twitter.com/docker">@docker</a> dominated containerization movement we are seeing from tech leaders like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Red Hat. Then only difference is Reclaim Hosting is doing it as apps that can be deployed across a known set of domains, spanning physical servers, within a particular institution. Containers offer portability for the #Reclaim lifecycle, for when students leave institutions, as well as for the wider public space, when people are looking to #Reclaim their digital self.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of APIs in Higher Ed</strong><br /> APIs are central to everything about #Reclaim. It is how users will take control over their digital self, driving solutions like Known. With #Reclaim being born, and propagated via universities, the API stakes are raised across higher education. Universities need to adopt an API way of life, to drive all aspects of campus operations, but also to expose all students to the concept of APIs, making part of the university experience--teaching students to #Reclaim their own course schedule, student data, and other portfolio, and other aspects of the campus experience. Universities are ground zero, when it comes to exposing the next generation of corporate employees, government workers, and #Reclaim informed citizens--we have a lot of work to do to get insitutions up to speed.</p>
<p><strong>Evolving the Hackathon Format</strong><br /> The Reclaim Your Domain LA Hackathon has moved forward the hackathon definition for me. There were no applications built over the weekend, and there were no prizes given away to winners, but there was significant movement that will live beyond just this single event&mdash;something that the previous definition of hackathon didn&rsquo;t possess for me. Fifteen of us came together Friday night for food and drink at <a href="https://twitter.com/amichaelberman">@amichaelberman</a> house. Saturday morning we came together at Pepperdine and spent the day working through ideas and tool demonstrations, which included a lot of open discussion. Saturday night we came together at our house in Hermosa Beach, where we drank, continued conversations from the day, and Jazzercised on the roof until wee hours of the morning. Then Sunday we came together for breakfast, and went back to work at Pepperdine for the rest of the day. Once done, some folks headed to airport, and the rest of headed back to Hermosa Beach for dinner, more drinks, and conversation until late in the evening.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon/reclaim-hackathon-beers.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Over the two days, there was plenty of hacking, setting up Known and Smallest Federated Wiki, as part of Reclaim Your Domain. Most attendees got to work on their #Reclaim definitions, and POSSEE workflow using Known, and learned how to generate API keys, commit to Github, and other essential #Reclaim tasks. At many other hackathons I&rsquo;ve been to, there were tangible projects that came out of the event, but were always abandoned after the short weekend. #Reclaim didn&rsquo;t produce any single startup or application, but deployed and evolved on top of existing work, and processes, that will continue long after this single event, and will continue to build momentum with each event we do--capturing much more of the exhaust from a weekend hackathon.</p>
<p><strong>The Time Is Right For #Reclaim</strong><br /> I feel #Reclaim is in motion, and there is no stopping it now. Each of the three events I&rsquo;ve done, have been extremely fruitful, and the ideas, conversation, and code just flows. I see signs across the Internet, that some people are beginning to care more about about their digital self, in light of exploitation from government, and technology companies. It is not an accident that this movement is coming out of higher education institutions, and will continue to spread, and build momentum at universities. The time is right for #Reclaim, I can feel it.</p>

<p>In the API space it is easy to recognize the cool kids, the ones that are in the know. These types of personalities just understand how to get things done, don't take no for an answer, and understand the DIY, self-service nature of APIs.</p>
<p>I get a lot of folks who ask me to add them to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API Management provider section</a>, or my <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/">API Integration area</a>. I always add these people to my Evernote queue, and when I get time I go through and profile them, I add them to my master CRM, and when I publish the latest round of content and data to the <a href="http://kinlane.com/about/">API Evangelist network</a> site in question, the blog post, or company listing will be updated&mdash;something that can take minutes or weeks, depending on my workload.</p>
<p>In contrast, the savvy people in the space, understand that the API Evangelist network runs on Github, as <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ separate research projects</a>, and that they can add themselves. All you do is fork the project you want to update, add yourself to the blog post, or the JSON file that drives the data listing, and submit a pull request. I don&rsquo;t always guarantee I will accept your addition, but if it is correct, and brings value to the API community, there is a good chance I will.</p>
<p>I just finished publishing a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/17/it-takes-a-team-of-evangelists-to-raise-an-api/">list of all of the SendGrid developer evangelists</a>, and I mistakenly left off Will Smidlein (<a href="https://twitter.com/ws">@ws</a>), one of the SendGrid developer evangelists. Will, being one of the cool kids, didn&rsquo;t ask, he just forked API Evangelist, added himself to the list, and submitted a pull request. Minutes later, he&rsquo;s on the blog, listed correctly as one of the evangelist.</p>
<p>I wonder how long it will take for more of my audience to realize they can help curate, and publish to API Evangelist, right alongside me--it has been this way since January of 2013. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-key.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;m loving about where the API space is going, is the simplicity, and remixability of available API resources, when they are defined with machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>.  An example of this, can be found in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">my recent work to make federal government APIs more discoverable</a>.</p>
<p>I generated machine readable API definitions using Swagger, for four separate APIs out of the GSA. The APIs were spread across two separate domains:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">usa.gov</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/">explore.data.gov</a>. You can follow the details of research, at each of the project repositories, but as I continue with my work, I keep thinking about the power that having a machine readable definition for all four of these APIs, and my ability to now remix these simple, and powerful API resources into <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">virtual stacks</a>. After I work my way through the 120 government APIs I have targeted, I will have an amazing index of government API resources to compose from.</p>
<p>My vision around all of this goes beyond just <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>, and finding government APIs. I want to make it so we can compose virtual stacks of API resources, that can be used in different scenarios. If you are building a public engagement app for an election, you can assemble exactly the API resources your developers will need, aggregate them using their API definition, into a single developer area&mdash;even though the APIs may span multiple federal agency developer areas.</p>
<p>In this scenario, developers don't have to go find all the API resources they need, an architect, or API lead can aggregate everything into a one-stop-shop for what the developers will need. This evolution in API delivery makes me very happy, right up until I come up against the current state of on-boarding with APIs, to get the credentials you need to use the API resource. In this particular scenario, you would have to sign up for an account with 10 or 20 separate agencies, or outside groups&mdash;stripping away any benefits gained through the remixing and aggregation of APIs.</p>
<p>How do we solve API consumer access for the API economy? I know that API providers like Mashape, and Mashery have tried to solve with their platforms. These touch on the problem, but are providing very siloed solutions--I feel we need one that works for API consumers who are using many APIs, across many providers, in an adhoc manner. As a lead architect for a mobile project, I shouldn't have to spend hours signing up my application across many different API consumer accounts.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json specification</a>, we encourage API providers to include a link to their signup page, but this is just a link. Eventually we need a machine readable API registration flow, where trusted developers can ping, receive authentication instructions, and easily obtain keys to use an API resource. I&rsquo;m sure there are legacy SOA scenarios my readers will school me on, and I&rsquo;m hoping to also learn about any existing standards available that address this. My motivation here, is to push my understanding of what is available, and hopefully jump start a conversation with API providers, about any viable solutions to authenticating across multiple APIs as seamlessly as possible, when you are developing distributed apps.</p>

<p>There are a lot of lessons to be learned from the leaders of the API space, pioneers like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> and <a href="http://sendgrid.com/team">SendGrid</a>, when it comes to running our own API programs. Fortunately for the community, most of the leading API providers are willing to share their experience and wisdom with us, such as SendGrid, with their latest series<a href="http://sendgrid.com/blog/tips-tricks-beginner-developer-evangelist-part-2/"> Tips and Tricks for a Beginner Developer Evangelist</a>.</p>
<p>The blog series delivers some great API evangelism wisdom, from the mouths of evangelists, who are in the trenches, getting the word out about the email API platform, and supporting its large ecosystem of application developers.

<p>I think the blog series from SendGrid is a look into, what it takes to run a successful API evangelism campaign. I&rsquo;ve had multiple conversations in the last couple days with API providers who are just now beginning to build their API teams, and were looking for on advice on who to hire, and how to grow and train their evangelists.</p>
<p>To anyone who is just now constructing their API team, follow the SendGrid <a href="http://sendgrid.com/blog/">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SendGrid">Twitter accoun</a>t, then follow each of the SendGrid evangelist team on Twitter&mdash;they produce a lot of great content, that will help you understand what API evangelism success will look like. You can also follow the lead of Tim and Brandon, in how they have developed the team of evangelists, and the amount of resources they are investing in the success of the SendGrid API.</p>
<p>There is not a single API program I know of that is doing evangelism perfectly, but when you pay attention to the leading providers, there are endless things you can pick up, by watching them in action&mdash;both good and bad.</p>
<p><strong>P.S. </strong>- Every API provider should consider diversity diversity when organizing their teams.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/creative-commons/cc.logo.large.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When we first conceived <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, we were a little fuzzy about which of Creative Commons licenses API providers should apply to their API definitions. As long as a provider took a stance on API copyright around your API definitions, applied a Creative Commons license, we considered an API &ldquo;in the commons&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As time has evolved, and we've had time to reflect on the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dangerous-ruling-oracle-v-google-federal-circuit-reverses-sensible-lower-court">decision that the Federal Circuit Court handed down in the Oracle v Google case</a>, we've adjusted our vision of what Creative Commons licenses should &nbsp;be applied to an API, and still be considered as part of the "API Commons".</p>
<p>Moving forward the API Commons will accept two types of Creative Commons license:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a></strong> - At a minimum we want API designers to be recognized for their work, and other designers to recognize original authorship when relevant.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a></strong> - Ideally all API designers put their API definitions into the public domain, and wave all their copyright around API designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We feel pretty strongly that API definitions have to remain openly licensed, re-usable, even for commercial purposes. In a perfect world we wouldn't have to apply copyright at all, but in light of the Oracle v Google case we should take a proactive stance, and apply the copyright license that make the most sense.</p>
<p><a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> acknowledges the rights of API designers to recognized for their works, but strongly believe that for the API economy to grow and flourish, API definitions have to be re-usable, shareable and interoperable&mdash;publish your APIs into the API Commons today.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://tosdr.org/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/terms-of-service-didnt-read/tos-didnt-read-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been fascinated by the <a href="http://tosdr.org/index.html">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a> project. i&rsquo;m on the mailing list, and try to make time to stay in tune, but have yet to ever contribute any bandwidth to the EXTREMELY important project, around making sense of the crazy terms of services (TOS), that we agree to in our daily lives.</p>
<p>I finally found myself at a point where I'm forced to start paying more attention to API terms of service, and hopefully will be able to slice off a little bit of dedicated bandwidth to Terms of Service; Didn&rsquo;t Read. I have two projects that have floated up on my list, and deserve some priority attention.</p>
<p>First I&rsquo;m applying the TOS Didn't Read work to a side project of mine called <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a>, which is a project to help me define my digital self, and reclaim some of the content, data and other value I generate on a daily basis online. I&rsquo;m hoping TOS Didn't Read will provide a machine readable moral backbone to the #Reclaim process&mdash;which is a work in progress.</p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;m looking to build on the TOS Didn't Read work, and apply further to the world of APIs, by defining another one of the machine readable <a href="http://apisjson.org">API.json</a> properties. The first of which are machine readable properties like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger API definitions, and the <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> manifest, which allows you to reference the copyright for a specific API interface.</p>
<p>I want to build on the work TOS Didn&rsquo;t Read has done, apply their tracking and ranking system of online services, to the APIs that I monitor. Using APIs.json I want to encourage API providers to publish this machine readable index of their available APIs, allowing them to be indexed by API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Then, as part of each APIs.json I want to help API providers understand the benefits of machine readable API definitions, API copyright declarations, and API terms of service (TOS). I know, that is a pretty tall order, but I think it can be done.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>TOS Didn't Read provides me with a wealth of topics, and detailed points to apply when evaluating API provider&rsquo;s terms of service&mdash;which is an excellent foundation to build on top of. I've forked the <a href="https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org">TOS Didn't Read repository</a>, as part of the APIs.json organization, and will be establishing a supporting project for defining what a machine readable terms of service file might look like. I think I will call this project Terms of Service; Machine Readable, or TOS;MR.</p>
<p>My goal is to provide a meaningful list of questions (TOS;DR topics &amp; points), that we can use to quantify API providers. I want to enable API providers to answer these questions, and publish a machine readable list of relevant topics somewhere in their domain, and include as a property in their APIs.json file.</p>
<p>Ok, I have a lot of work. Luckily I'm not entirely re-inventing the wheel here. I&rsquo;m building on the existing work of TOS Didn't read, but applying specifically to APIs, and connecting it to my existing API discovery work with APIs.json.</p>

There are numerous cloud services available, that allow non-developers to execute common business tasks like registration forms, <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/surveymonkey/google-docs/18382/surveymonkey-new-response-to-google-docs-create-spreadsheet-row/">surveys</a>, payments, and product sales, and when you combine these business functions with <a href="https://zapier.com/app/dashboard">Zapier</a>, Google Docs and <a href="https://apispark.com/">APISpark</a>&mdash;you can deploy an API, no code skills required.</p>
<p>This story begins with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/30/deploy-an-api-from-a-google-spreadsheet-using-apispark/">ability to deploy an API from any Google Spreadsheet using APISpark</a>, putting API deployment within the grasp of the average business user. Next, I want the easiest possible way to get data, from multiple sources, into a Google Spreadsheet? Answer: <a href="https://zapier.com/app/dashboard">Zapier</a> (or <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">other reciprocity provider</a>, like <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>). &nbsp;To support this, I started looking through the numerous Zapier recipes, that allow my me to publish results to a Google Spreadsheet&mdash;there are 167!</p>
<p>The most obvious <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/twitter/google-docs/4396/add-tweets-to-google-docs-row/">data source I see is Twitter</a>. Everyone time there is a Tweet from specific user, or from a specific Twitter search, you can have it published to a Google Spreadsheet, and when you have that spreadsheet connected to an APISpark API, the results will be automatically available via API.</p>
<p>The second most common source of data I see, would be cloud based forms. I see providers like <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/wufoo/google-docs/4905/save-wufoo-entry-to-google-docs-row/">Wufoo</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/gravity-forms/google-docs/16647/save-gravity-forms-submission-to-google-spreadsheet/">Gravity Forms</a>, and <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/jotform/google-docs/3379/add-jotform-submission-to-google-docs-row/">JotForm</a>, to name a few, that allow you to submit form submissions to any Google Spreadsheet, and with the APISpark integration, all your form submissions are automatically available via API.</p>
<p>After that, I see numerous <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/woocommerce/google-docs/23762/woocommerce-new-order-to-google-docs-create-spreadsheet-row/">commerce</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/paypal/google-docs/1421/add-paypal-sales-google-docs-spreadsheet-row/">payment</a>s, and other key business functions, that Zapier enables publishing of data and content into a Google Spreadsheet from. All of these services have APIs, that is why Zapier is able to do what they do, but that would require a developer to tackle with custom API integration (not for this story). This story is all about enabling non-developers to deploy APIs, from common business functions, no coding necessary--Zapier is our middleman.</p>
<p>Beyond Twitter, forms, payments, and product sales, I will explore other easy to implement, API deployment using Zapier, Google Docs, and APISpark. These represent API deployment scenarios I don't think people are tracking on, and with a little education, I think we can bring problem owners up to speed, and increase the number of APIs available, driven by average person, and the common business problems they face every day.</p>

<p>The elite technology group at the <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/">GSA</a>, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">known as 18F</a>, has released the latest copy of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">API guidance for federal government agencies</a> to follow when designing their own APIs.</p>
<p>Using 18F&rsquo;s own description:</p>
<blockquote><em>This document captures 18F's view of API best practices and standards. We aim to incorporate as many of them as possible into our work.<br /><br />APIs, like other web applications, will vary greatly in implementation and design, depending on the situation and the problem the application is solving. </em></blockquote>
<p>I like the mix of info that is delivered as well:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>High level design guidance that individual APIs interpret to meet their needs.</li>
<li>Low level web practices that most modern HTTP APIs use.</li>
</ul>
<p>To top it off, <a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">the API Standards is hosted on Github</a>, in its own repository, and as Gray Brooks from 18F says:</p>
<blockquote><em> "Want a formal API Standards for your agency to adopt?  Fork ours, add your name to the top, and make it your own." </em></blockquote>
<p>Simple guidance like this goes a long way in helping, sometimes even very experienced developers, understand the best practices when it comes to designing, simple, modern APIs&mdash;a world where consistency and simplicity goes a long way!</p>

<p>I was looking through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis">federal government APIs</a> the other day, looking for the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government">low hanging fruit</a>, when it came to making government APIs more discoverable using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. During my initial work, I played with <a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">three separate APIs from www.usa.gov</a>, which I think demonstrates the importance of CORS, and how opening it up for APIs, makes them more portable and remix-able.</p>
<p>When it comes to the the three APIs from www.usa.gov, I do not have control over the API itself, but I wanted to create a self contained, site that showcased the government APIs, and provide interactive API documentation generated using Swagger. I made sure all three of the APIs had machine readable API definitions using Swagger, then I setup a simple HTML page, which allowed anyone to play with each of the APIs.</p>
<p>This worked great until I reached the third API, which was at a different domain than the previous two, and didn't have CORS enabled. If you aren't familiar with CORS, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</a>, which is a mechanism that allows many resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain the resource originated from&mdash;behavior that you may want to control on a web page, but for an API it is something you want to encourage.</p>
<p>CORS being enabled, is the difference between an API being portable, and remix-able, and it being locked down to its original developer portal. If an API is RESTful and has CORS enabled, any outside party (like me), can generate a machine readable API definitions for it, and compose a developer experience, that that includes the API&mdash;with or without consent of the original API provider. While this might scare the shit out of some API providers, it is the future of API driven, application architecture.</p>
<p>You can't expect all developers to find your API developer portal, and APIs need to be more portable, allowing for remixing by other API providers, backend as a service providers, and anyone who wants to feature the API resource in their developer portal. CORS is a simple thing that you can enable for your APIs that will make a big difference in how your API is found, and integrated into other applications and systems.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

        <span class="post-date">15 Jul 2014</span>

<p>Today, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker (<a href="https://twitter.com/PennyPritzker">@PennyPritzker</a>), <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/blog/2014/07/15/secretary-pritzker-discusses-power-government-data-and-announces-department-commerce">announced that the Department of Commerce will hire its first-ever Chief Data Officer</a>. I wanted to make sure that when this new, and extremely important individual assumes their role, they have my latest thoughts on how to make the Department of Commerce developer portal the best it possibly can be, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this port will be</span> the driving force behind the rapidly expanding API driven economy.</p>
<p>Secretary Pritzker does a pretty good job of summing up the scope of resources that are available at Commerce:</p>
<blockquote><em>Secretary Pritzker described how the Department of Commerce&rsquo;s data collection &ndash; which literally reaches from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun &ndash; not only informs trillions of dollars of private and public investments each year and plants the seeds of economic growth, but also saves lives.</em></blockquote>
<p>I think she also does a fine job of describing the urgency behind making sure Commerce resources are available:</p>
<blockquote><em>Because of Commerce Department data, Secretary Pritzker explained, communities vulnerable to tornadoes have seen warning times triple and tornado warning accuracy double over the past 25 years, giving residents greater time to search for shelter in the event of an emergency.</em></blockquote>
<p>To understand the importance of content, data and other resources that are coming out the Department of Commerce, you just have to look at the list of agencies that are underneath Commerce, who already have API initiatives:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usa.gov/directory/federal/department-of-commerce.shtml"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/matrix-dollar-sign.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>Then take a look at the other half, who have not launched APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.usa.gov/directory/federal/bureau-of-industry-and-security.shtml">Bureau of Industry and Securit</a>y</li>

<li><a href="http://www.usa.gov/directory/federal/national-technical-information-service.shtml">National Technical Information Service</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The data and other resources available through these agencies, underneath the Department of Commerce, reflect the heart of not just the U.S. economy, but the global economy, which is rapidly being driven by APIs, which are powering stock markets, finance, payment providers, cloud computing, and many other cornerstones of our increasingly online economy.</p>
<p>Look through those 13 agencies, the resource they manage are all vital to all aspects of the economy telecommunications, patents, weather, oceans, census, to other areas that have a direct influence on how markets work, or don't work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all behind the Department of Commerce, hiring a Chief Data Officer (CDO), but my first question is, what will this person do?&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><em>This leader, Secretary Pritzker explained, will oversee improvements to data collection and dissemination in order to ensure that Commerce&rsquo;s data programs are coordinated, comprehensive, and strategic.</em></blockquote>
<p>Yes! I can get behind this. In my opinion, in order for the new CDO to do this, they will have to quickly bring all of the agencies /developer program up to a modern level of operation. There is a lot of work to be done, so let's get to work exploring what needs to happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Central Department of Commerce Developer Portal To Rule Them All</strong><br /> Right now the <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/developer">Department of Commerce developer portal</a> at commerce.gov/developer, is just a landing page. An after thought, to help you find some APIs--not a portal. The new CDO needs to establish this real estate as the one true portal, which provides the resources other agencies will need for success, while also providing a modern, leading location for developers of web, mobile, Internet of things applications, and data journalists, or analyst to come to find the data they need. If you need a reference point, go look at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/">SalesForce</a>, <a href="https://go.developer.ebay.com/">eBay</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/">Googe&rsquo;s</a> developers areas&mdash;you should see this type of activity at commerce.gov/developer.</p>
<p><strong>Each Agency Must Have Own Kick Ass Developer Portal</strong><br /> Following patterns set forth by their parent, Department of Commerce portal, each agency underneath needs to posses their own, best of breed developer portal, providing the data, APIs, code, and other resources, that public and private sector consumers will need.  I just finished <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">looking through all the available developer portals for commerce agencies</a>, and their is no consistency between them in user experience (UX), API design, or resources available. The new CDO will have to immediately get to work on taking existing patterns from the private sector, <a href="https://github.com/18F/API-All-the-X">as well as what has been developed by 18F</a>, and set a establish common patterns that other agencies can follow when designing, developing and managing their own agencies developer portal.</p>
<p><strong>High Quality, Machine Readable Open Data By Default</strong><br /> The new CDO needs to quickly build on existing data inventory efforts that has been going on at Commerce, making sure any existing projects, are producing machine readable data by default, making sure all data inventory is available within their agency's portal, as well as at data.gov. This will not be a one time effort, the new CDO needs to make sure all program and project managers, also get the data steward training they will need, to ensure that all future work at the Department of Commerce, associated agencies, and private sector partners produces high quality, machine readable data by default.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Tooling To Support The Public And Private Sector</strong><br /> Within each of the Commerce, and associate agency developer portals, there needs to be a wealth of open source code samples, libraries and SDKs for working with data and APIs. This open source philosophy, also needs to be applied to any web or mobile applications, analysis or visualization that are part of Commerce funded projects and programs, whether they are from the public or private sector. All software developed around Commerce data, and receive public fundeing should be open source by default, allowing the rest of the developer ecosystem, and ultimately the wider economy to benefit and build on top of existing work.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Readable API Definitions For All Resources</strong><br /> This is an area, that is a little bit leading edge, even for the private sector, but is rapidly emerging to play a central role in how APIs are designed, deployed, managed, discovered, tested, monitored, and ultimately integrated into other systems and applications. Machine readable <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/15/an-api-definition-as-the-truth-in-the-api-contract/">API definitions are being used as a sort of central truth</a>, defining how and what an API does, in a machine readable, but common format, that any developer, and potentially other system can understand. Commerce needs to ensure that all existing, as well as future APIs developed around Commerce data, possess a machine readable API definition, which will allow for all data resources to be plug and play in the API economy.</p>
<p><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/18f/18F_logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Established An Assortment Of Blueprints For Other Agencies To Follow</strong><br /> The new Commerce CDO will have to be extremely efficient at establishing successful patterns that other agencies, projects and programs can follow. This starts with developer portal blueprints they can follow when designing, deploying and managing their own developer programs, but should not stop there, and Commerce will need a wealth of blueprints for open source software, APIs, system connectors, and much, much more.  Establishing common blueprints, and sharing these widely across government will be critical for consistency and interoperability--reducing the chances that agencies, or private sector partners will be re-inventing the wheel, while also reducing development costs.</p>
<p><strong>Establish Trusted Partner Access For Public And Private Sector</strong><br /> Open data and APIs, do not always mean publicly available by default. Private sector API leaders have developed trusted partner layers to their open data and API developer ecosystems, allowing for select, trusted partners greater access to resources. An existing model for this in the federal government, is within the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint">IRS modernized e-file ecosystem</a>, and the trusted relationships they have with private sector tax preparation partners like H&amp;R Block or Jackson Hewitt. Trusted partners will be critical in Department of Commerce operations, acting as private sector connectors to the API economy,  enabling higher levels of access from the private sector, but in a secure and controlled way that protects the public interest.</p>
<p><strong>Army of Domain Expert Evangelists Providing A Human Face</strong><br /> As the name says, Commerce spans all business sectors, and to properly "oversee improvements to data collection and dissemination in order to ensure that Commerce&rsquo;s data programs are coordinated, comprehensive, and strategic&rdquo;, the CDO will need another human layer to help increase awareness of Commerce data and APIs, while also supporting existing partners and integrators. An army of evangelists will be needed, possessing some extremely important domain expertise, across all business sectors, that Department of Commerce data and resources will touch. Evangelism is the essential human variable, that makes the whole open data and API algorithm work, the new CDO needs to get to work writing a job description, and hiring for this army&mdash;you will need an 18F, but one that is dedicated to the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Commerce As The Portal At The Center Of The API Economy</strong><br /> The establishment of CDO at the Department of Commerce is very serious business, and is a role that will be central to how the global economy evolves in the coming years. The content, data, and digital resources that should, and will be made available at commerce.gov/developer and associated agencies, will be central to the health of the API driven economy.</p>
<p>Think of what major seaports have done for the the economy over the last 1000 years, and what role Wall Street has played in the economy over the last century&mdash;this is the scope of the commerce.gov/developer portal, which is ultimately the responsibility of the new Department of Commerce Chief Data Officer.</p>
<p>When the new CDO get started at the Department of Commerce, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">I hope they reach out to 18F</a>, who will have much of what you need to get going. Then sit down, read this post, as well my other one on, <a href="http://govfresh.com/2014/01/next-us-government-api-strategy/">An API strategy for the U.S. government</a>, and once you get going, if you need any help, just let me know&mdash;as my readers know, I&rsquo;m full of a lot of ideas on APIs.</p>

<p>One conversation I had at #Gluecon this year,  was around the role an API plays in being a contract between providers and consumers, with Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) from <a href="https://helloreverb.com/">Reverb</a>. API contract, is a common phrase to describe how API services are consumed, and depending on the on-boarding process, an API provider and consumer can enter into a contract for services around a set of resources, in a self-service way.</p>
<p>In the last couple years, with the increased use of API definition formats like API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML, we often reference this API definition as a tangible representation of the contract API providers and consumers enter into. In my mind, I see the API definition as one building block, in a larger set of building blocks, that are working together to form a contract, with the API definition acting as the truth.</p>
<p>If you step back and look across multiple API providers, you start to see a variety of building blocks that contribute to the overall "API Contract", that is negotiated between API provider and consumer, starting with the API definition.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br /> A machine readable definition of an API interface, using a common format like API Blueprint, Swagger or RAML, providing a definition of the surface area of the resources that are available via API. API definitions are proving to be very useful in establishing a common way to describe, communicate and collaborate around APIs, which are often extremely abstract.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong><br /> Terms of service are the legal portion of the API contract, determining how the service can be used, keeping the company&rsquo;s interest in mind, but should also be liberal enough to allow developers and 3rd party integrators to be successful. Plain english version of terms of service go a long way in seamlessly fitting into the API contract, allowing API consumers to quickly understand where they stand.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong><br /> The privacy of a platform, is definitely a very critical element of the API contract, and sets the tone for a platform operations, contract with developers, and their promise to the end-users. An awareness, and respect of privacy issues is part of every success API platform, and feeds into the overall health of the contractrual relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Service Level Agreement</strong><br /> A service level agreement (SLA), sets the quality of service expectations within the API contract. All API consumers should have some sort of SLA that provides a definition of the services being offered, and the level of service, and the reliability end-users can expect as part of API consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Service Accord</strong><br /> As an API provider, if you can&rsquo;t offer a formal SLA, you should at least provide a service accord with users, setting expectations around what level of service will be offered around an API, and while a service accord isn&rsquo;t legally binding, it can at least help set expectations, and the tone of API operations for consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Interface License</strong><br /> The Oracle v Google legal battle has brought API licensing front and center, making them part of the overall contract of API operations. Whether you apply copyright, or some other license, an API license will be part of the contract entered into between API provider and consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Data License</strong><br /> Like an API interface, the licensing of underlying data stored, and returned by an API needs to have a license defined, providing guidance for developers, and businesses that are consuming an APIs data, and how they can store, remix, and put data to use.</p>
<p><strong>Code License</strong><br /> Providing code in the form of samples, libraries, and SDKs is common practice for API providers, and the how the code is licensed will determine how API consumers integrate an API into their, providing another layer of licensing within the API contract. This doesn't end with client side code, many APIs will also offer server side API implementations, which should also be appropriately licensed.</p>
<p><strong>Deprecation Policy</strong><br /> How long can API consumers depend on an API? What sort of notification will I get before an API is deprecated? The deprecation policies of an API, play a significant role in the trust established as part of the API contract that API providers and consumers agree to.</p>
<p><strong>Roadmap</strong><br /> Contracts are know for targeting a specific period of time, but API contracts are considered to be open ended, and part of that obligation is communication and openness around an APIs roadmap, providing critical details on what is next for an API, allowing API consumers to trust that a contract will not change to quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Changelog</strong><br /> Providing a place where API consumers can see a recent history of changes to an API platform offers a reference, for how often an API changes, and how its evolved over time, balancing out marketing and potential rhetoric around API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Rate Limits</strong><br /> As an API consumer, if we are entering into a contract, I need to know how my contract will scale, and where I exist in the API supply chain. Rate limits provide a unit of measurement that can be used as part of the API contract, quantifying expectations and deliverables.</p>
<p><strong>Uptime / Availability</strong><br /> You can offer a low cost, high value API service, but if your availability and uptime sucks, you are not delivering on the contract entered into with API consumers, making this aspect of operations a very important piece of the API contract.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong><br /> Stipulating the price paid for a service is fundamental to any contract, and the pricing of a particular API represents the value that is exchanged between API provider and consumer, as part of the API contract.</p>
<p><strong>Service Tiers</strong><br /> Most modern APIs have multiple access levels, providing contract negotiation opportunities between API provider and consumer, a feature that allows API contracts to be negotiated, or re-negotiated in real-time, based upon known service tiers.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong><br /> A contract is a relationship between two businesses, and any relationship requires support to be successful. Direct, and indirect API support provides assurances to API consumers that once they enter into a contract, the API provider will be there to help in all phases of contract execution.</p>
<p>An API definition provides a tangible, machine readable lens to look at the API contract through, providing a quantifiable truth that describes how an API will be delivered, but the actual API contract requires a suite of other supporting elements, starting with terms of service, and continuing through to how a company supports an API, before the API contract is fully realized.</p>
<p>I'm very optimistic about the evolution of API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a> in 2014, now that we have the ability to define an API, and quantify the resources interface in a machine readable format. Next we need the same for the other portions of the "API contract", so that we can negotiate contracts for online resources in an automated, frictionless, real-time way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-telescope.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is a pretty basic concept&mdash;look at other competing or complimentary APIs in the space, before designing your own. This seems like common sense to me, but I look at APIs for a living, and I&rsquo;m interested in finding the best API patterns across business or government sectors. Even though this topic seems like a no-brainer to me, I still encounter many folks who contact me to discuss their API strategy, but have not looked at any APIs, in the same genre as the one they are looking to enter--which tells me I should be writing about this topic on a regular basis.</p>
<p>My first advice to any API provider, looking to begin new API effort, is to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/08/thirty-apis-to-look-at-when-planning-your-api/">look at as many of the leading APIs out there</a>, as you have time for. Even if they aren&rsquo;t in the same genre as your API, they are leaders for a reason, and do many things that you can learn from. If nothing else, at least look at the pioneers like SalesForce, Amazon, Twitter and Google&mdash;they know what they are doing.</p>
<p>Secondarily I urge developers to go look at any APIs that are doing the same thing, or portentially exist in the same genre, as your API. If you are doing a bookmark API, go look at Delicious and Pinboard. If you are doing an image API go look at Flickr and Instagram. Even if your API will be slightly different, you should look at all, accessible, patterns, that are similar to what you are trying to do do. Try to understand why these APis providers designed their interface the way they did, and actually make calls against the API, to see what you like, and what you don&rsquo;t like about their approach.</p>
<p>Once you have looked at all the APIs you can, take the best patterns you found, and make it into your own. Even if you come back around, and still think your API design is superior, you will have learned something through the process&mdash;even if you learn what you don&rsquo;t want to do, or just receive validation of your idea.  If you haven&rsquo;t done your due diligence, looking for other healthy API patterns in the space, you are wasting valuable development cycles, on something that may not actually be innovating, and moving the conversation forward.</p>

<p>In the API section, they provide a nice introduction to what is an API, and why you would use an API, including nine library focused APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://copac.ac.uk/developers/webapi/">copac</a></strong> - search over 70 UK and irish academic national &amp; specialist library catalogues</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.culturegrid.org.uk/use/">culture grid</a> -</strong> provides uk library listings, searchable by location, authority, region - and also lists associated collections</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/api">europeana</a> -</strong> an interface giving full and searchable remote access to all of the Europeana collection data</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/access/data/opensearch">european library api v2.0 </a>-</strong> data describing the collections and catalogues of national and research libraries in 48 countries</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/books/">google books family</a> -</strong> APIs to integrate with google data on books such as searching via title and retrieving data such as isbn and cover images</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.nature.com/developers/documentation/api-references/opensearch-api/">nature.com website data</a> - </strong>bibliographic search for content on nature.com: news, research articles and citations</li>

<li><a href="http://www.nature.com/developers/documentation/api-references/opensearch-api/"></a><strong><a href="/admin/blog/">oclc worldcat search</a> -</strong> provides catalogue search facilities across all participating libraries (worldwide). also search for libraries by location</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api">open library</a> -</strong> one web page for every book. open library exposes an API to gain access to all their book data in various formats</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/access/data/lod">rluk linked open data</a> -</strong> not really an API, but research libraries uk have published nearly 20 million bibliographic records from 34 libraries as linked open data</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.librarieshacked.org/">Libraries Hacked</a> is available as a Github, so any librarian, can fork, and launch for their own purposes, with everything licensed CC-BY.  I think that librarians hold the key to our future, and ensuring librarians have the latest resources they need when it comes to APIs, open data, and open source software is critical to all of this working.</p>
<p>Sites like Libraries Hacked, not only save me a lot of time in researching priority areas like libraries, but also make me hopeful for the future, in a world where I&rsquo;m bombarded by warning signs around how technology is used, and knowing that librarians are getting equipped, makes me feel a lot better for all us.</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> I also love it when people use icons. I think I have an icon problem.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.yodlee.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/yodlee/yodlee-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spoke with the leading financial data API aggregation providers&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yodlee.com/">Yodlee</a> last week, regarding their <a href="http://www.yodlee.com/about-us/careers/">hunt for a director of developer evangelism</a>.  Yodlee provides an aggregation API that is designed for developers who need secure access to their users&rsquo; bank, credit card, investment, and loan accounts&mdash;if you think about it, this is a pretty critical API, in what we are all calling the &ldquo;API Economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yodlee isn&rsquo;t just looking for a junior evangelist, they are looking for a director&mdash;someone to lead the charge, when it comes to evangelizing Yodlee to potential API consumers, while also supporting the community and applications that are already integrated with the financial data aggregation platform. While there are well published job descriptions for the API evangelist role, there are no universities training up, cranking out the next generation of evangelism leaders&mdash;they are a unique breed, leaving a major hurdle for API providers like Yodlee to jump.</p>
<p>Evangelists are equal parts engineer, business development, product development, sales, and marketing&mdash;a combination that is not easy to find. Yodlee and I discussed the difficulties of finding the right candidates for the role, and whether or not you emphasize the technical or the marketing skills? There are extremely few candidates who know they are evangelist material, you often have to sculpt one out of many different personality traits, and both technical and business skils.</p>
<p>Evangelism talent, at both junior, and leadership levels is going to continue to be a major stumbling block for the expanding API economy. Even with some movement in the world of API discovery in 2014, we will never be able to fully automate API discovery, let alone evangelism, management and support. At some point we are going to need more agencies, and institutions focusing on training up the next generation of evangelists, similar to social media marketing did in the last 5 years&mdash;of course, hopefully we can scale a little more sensibly, than the social media marketing world did.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the developer evangelist position at Yodlee, <a href="http://www.rockitrecruiting.com/jobs.php?cjobid=JB197383618">head over to the recruiters site</a>, and let them know I sent you.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://autodevbot.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/autodevbot/autodevbot-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://autodevbot.com/">API monitoring service AutoDevot</a> has opened sourced their JavaScript API monitoring solution, built on Frisby.js, called <a href="https://github.com/AutoDevBot/API-Monitor-Runner">API Monitor Runner</a>. The API monitoring tool, allows for a pretty robust configuration file, that lets you detail exactly what the service should monitor, and how it should behave when something out of the ordinary happens.</p>
<p>I though the trigger actions stood out, allowing you to take common actions when something occurs with an API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>TRIGGER_EMAIL</strong> - enable email notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_PAGER_DUTY</strong> - enable PagerDuty notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_WEBHOOK</strong> - enable a generic webhook notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_HIPCHAT</strong>- enable HipChat notification</li>
</ul>
<p>AutoDevBot, even takes things to another level, providing a ready to go Docker container, to quickly deploy API Monitor Runner, and then configure it on setup, using Docker environment params--a very interesting approach to deploying open tooling to support APIs.</p>
<p>I really like this type of deployment for vital API services, focusing on providing a simple, valuable, cloud-based service, as well as an open source version that anyone can put to use. We just saw the same moves from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/apitools-raises-the-bar-with-open-onpremise-api-testing-and-monitoring-tools/">3Scale with the release of APITools</a>, and now AutoDevBot with API Monitor Runner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see other critical building blocks of the API economy emulate this approach&mdash;there is plenty of money to be made from cloud services, while also providing open tool that will stimulate API growth across many business sectors. Which, creates more need for services.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">looked through 77 of the developer areas for federal agencies</a>, resulting in reviewing approximately 190 APIs. While the presentation of 95% of the federal government developer portals are crap, it makes me happy that about 120 of the 190 APIs (over 60%) are actually consumable web APIs, that didn't make me hold my nose and run out of the API area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the 190, only 13 actually made me happy for one reason or another:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html">OpenFDA</a></strong> - Well, I've already <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">gushed about OpenFDA</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2">Climate Data Online Web Services</a>&nbsp;</strong>- Just a clean, valuable, well done API for government.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/">National Climate Data Center</a> -</strong> Nice portal, valuable datasets, just needs some nice APIs and BOOM!</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> - </strong>NREL just get it, they are doing some great APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a> - </strong>DOL's approach to their API design and developer area makes me happy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://va-data.github.io/va-facilities/#!/facilities">VA Facilities Locator Web Service</a> -</strong> Only makes me happy because I did the work already. ;-)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://va-data.github.io/va-press/#!/press">VA Press Releases</a> - </strong>Only makes me happy because I did the work already. ;-)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> -</strong> Slick stuff. Nice Area. Great APIs. interactive docs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://my.usa.gov/developer/">MyUSA Citizen API</a> -</strong> Interestingly simple API, yet massive API concept, curious of the scope, implementation and use of oAuth in federal gov.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://exoapi.com/">ExoAPI</a> -</strong> Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.asterank.com/skymorph">SkyMorph/NEAT API</a>&nbsp; - </strong>Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://marsweather.ingenology.com/">{MAAS} API</a> -&nbsp;</strong>Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://predictthesky.org/"> Predict the Sky API</a> -</strong>Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there are other nice implementations in there. I like the simplicity and consistency in APIs coming out of GSA, SBA, but overall federal APIs reflect what I see a lot in the private sector, some developer making a decent API, but their follow-through and launch severeley lacks what it takes to make the API successful. People wonder why nobody uses their APIs? hmmmmm....</p>
<p>A little minimalist simplicity in a developer portal, simple explanation of what an API does, interactive documentation w/ Swagger, code libraries, terms of service (TOS), wouild go a looooooooooooong way in making sure these government resources were found, and put to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, so where the hell do I start? Let's look through theses 123 APIs and see where the real low hanging fruit for demonstrating the potential of APIs.json, when it comes to API discovery in the federal government.</p>
<p>Let's start again with the <strong>White House&nbsp;</strong>(<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers">http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;">White House Petition API</a>&nbsp;-</strong> No swagger, but simple, high value API that is totally worth doing.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Only one API made it out of the <strong>USDA</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Research Service</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2">http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2</a></span>&nbsp;- Almost there. The landing page looks good, but the API documentation isn't really there. Could be really easily. Looks like a well crafted API.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>That is a lot of potentially valuable API resource to consume. From my perspective, I think that what has come out of GSA, SBA, and White House Petition API, represent probably the simplest, most consistent, and high value targets for me. Next maybe the wealth of APis out of Interior and FDA. AFter that I'll cherry pick from the list, and see which are easiest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm lookig to create a Swagger definition for each these APIs, and publish as a Github repository, allowing people to play with the API. If I have to, I'll create a proxy for each one, because CORS is not common across the federal government. I'm hoping to not spend to much time on proxies, because once I get in there I always want to improve the interface, and evolve a facade for each API, and I don't have that much time on my hands.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent most of the day yesterday, looking through <a href="/admin/blog/http:/18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs">77 of the developer portals listed on the 18F Github portal</a>. While I wanted to evaluate the quality and approach of each of the agencies, my goal for this review cycle was to look for any APIs that already had machine readable API definitions, or would be low hanging fruit for the creation of <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger definitions</a>, as part of my wider API discovery work.</p>
<p>I had just finished updating all my API Evangelist Network APIs to use verion 0.14 of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and while I wait for the search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> to update to support the new version, I wanted to see if I could start the hard work of applying API discovery to federal government APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally all federal agencies would publish APIs.json on their own, placing it within the root of their domain, like they do with data.json, and provide an index of all of their APIs. Being all to familiar with how this stuff work, I know that if I want this to happen, I will have to generate APIs.json for many federal agencies first. However for the APis.json to have their intended impact, I need many of the APIs to have machine readable API definitions that I can point to--which equals more work for me! yay? ;-(</p>
<p>My thinking is that I will look through all of the 77 developer areas, and resulting APIs looking for the low hanging fruit. Basically I would grade each API on its viability to be included in my federal government API discovery work. I spent minimal amount of time look at each API, and in some cases looking for the API, before giving up. I would inspect the supporting developer area, and the actual interface for complexity, helping me understand how hard it would be to hand craft a Swagger spec, and APIs.json for each agency and their APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(warning contains my raw un-edited notes from doing this research, not suitable for children)</em></p>
<p>As I went through, I wrote a couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/&lt;/a&gt;">National Climate Data Center</a> is nice looking, and is a high profile--they should have a kick ass API!</li>
<li>Inversely <a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted&lt;/a&gt;">NOAAA Climate Data Online</a> very simple, clean and well done.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ed.gov/developers">Department of Education</a> is acceptable as dev area, only because of Socrata</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> just gets it. They just get it.</li>
<li>Some of these are billed as developer areas, but really just a single API. It is a start I guess.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I love me some <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a>. Their developer area and API is freak'n cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://my.usa.gov/developer/">MyUSA citizen API </a>has oAuth!!! WTF. How did I not notice this before? Another story, and work here.</li>
<li>MyUSA has really good, simple, high value, API resources.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://exoapi.com/">NASA ExoAPI</a> not just API cool, but space cool!!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.foia.gov/developer.html">FOIA</a> needs a fucking API. No excuses. FOIA needs an API!</li>
<li>Some APIs it might be better to go back to data source and recreate API from scratch, they are so bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to share some of my notes, before the long list of developer areas, and their APIs. There are some specific notes for each APIs, but much of it is very general, helping grade each API, so I can go back through the list of B grade or higher APIs, and figure out which are candidates for me to create a Swagger API definition, APIs.json and ultimately adding to APIs.io.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this work I went down the <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs">77 federal agency links</a>, which were billed as developer areas, but many were single APIs. So when a developer area resulted in multiple APIs, I grouped them together, and many of the agencies who have a single API I will group together, and include my commentary as necessary. I'm leaving the URLs visible to help as a reference, show the craziness of some of them, and because it would have been sooooo much work to apply all of them.</p>
<p>Let's start with the <strong>White House</strong>(<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers">http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;">White House Petition API</a>&nbsp;-</strong> No swagger, but simple, high value API that is totally worth doing.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next up is the <strong>USDA</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_DEVELOPER">http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_DEVELOPER</a>), which is a hodgepodge of service, no consistency whatsoever between services in interface, supporting content or anything.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Farmers Market Directory API</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html">http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html</a></span> - worthwhile API, but soap,</li>

</ul>
<p>Overall I give USDA a <strong>D</strong> on all their APIs. A couple might be high value sources, and going after, but definitely not low hanging fruit for me. It would be easier to tackle as independent project for generating brand new APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Research Service</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2">http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2</a></span>&nbsp;- Almost there.

</ul>
<p>Next up is Department of Commerce (<a href="http://www.commerce.gov/developer">http://www.commerce.gov/developer</a>), who definitely high some higher value resources, as well as some health API initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bureau of Economic Analysis API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm">http://bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm</a> -&nbsp;</span>Signed up for key, don&rsquo;t see any docs? Looks clean, but we&rsquo;ll see if anything there. An email address. yay!<strong> (C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Census Bureau API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/">http://www.census.gov/developers/</a></span>&nbsp;- Yes, a real developer area with supporting building blocks. (Update, News, App Gallery, Forum, Mailing List).&nbsp;Really could use interactive document though. There are urls, but not active calls.

<p>Ok that was it. I know there are more APIs to look at, but this is derived from the master list of federal government developer portals. This gives me what I need. Although, I'm a little disappointed I have less than 5 Swagger definitions, after looking at about 190 APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After looking at all of this, I'm overwhelmed. How do you solve API discovery for a mess like this? Holy shit!</p>
<p>I really need my fucking head examined for taking this shit on. I really am my own worst enemy, but I love it. I am obsessed with contributing to a solution for API discovery that will work in private sector, as well as a public sector mess like this. So where the hell do I start? &nbsp;More to come on that soon...</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently updated my APIs.json files for all my API Evangelist network domains, to use version 0.14, which is getting pretty close to a stable version. While I await <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a> to be updated to use this version, I wanted to to spend some time publishing APIs.json files, but this time across federal government APIs.</p>
<p>The thing I like most about APIs.json, is that you can do one for anybody else&rsquo;s APIs. In the case of our federal government, I don't anticipate any agency getting on board with APIs.json anytime soon, but I can do it for them! There are a lot of APIs in federal government, where do I get started?</p>
<p>To help me understand the scope of API discovery in our federal government <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">I looked through 77 developer portals</a>, outlined by <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. While browsing these developer portals for federal government agencies, I look at almost 190 APIs--with a goal of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">identifying the low hanging fruit</a>, when it came to API discovery across hundreds of government APIs.</p>
<p>Out of the 190 APIs, around 120 of them were actual web APIs, that were something I felt I could work with. I settled on a handful of APIs out of the GSA, hosted at <a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">www.usa.gov</a>, and <a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/index.html">explore.data.gov</a>, and got to work creating APIs.json for their APIs.</p>
<p>Before I could generate an APIs.json at each of the two domains (www.usa.gov and explore.data.gov), I needed machine readable API definition for the four APIs. I purposely picked federal agency APIs that were REST(flu), and were something I could easily generate a Swagger definition for.</p>
<p><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://explore.data.gov/developers/docs/federal-executive-agency-internet-domains">federal agency domain API at explore.data.gov</a> was pretty easy, ony taking me a few minutes to handcraft a Swagger definition. Then I moved on to the <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/index.shtml">Federal Agency Directory API at www.usa.gov</a>, and I was happy to see there was already a Swagger definition for the API. After that I tackled the <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml">Social Media Registry API</a>, and <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/mobile-app-gallery/index.shtml">Mobile App Gallery API</a>, both of which I had to handcraft a Swagger definition for. The Mobile App Gallery API has a CORS issue, but I'm moving on and will setup a proxy to handle later.</p>
<p>Now I have four machine readable API definitions for some pretty valuable government APIs, and I got to work creating my APIs.json that would act as a directory for these API resources. APIs.json are designed to go into the root domain of any API provider, and the four GSA APIs I selected ran under two separate domains (www.usa.gov and explore.data.gov), so I needed two separate APIs.json files:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">www.usa.gov/apis.json</a></li>
<li><a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">explore.data.gov/apis.jso</a>n</li>
</ul>
<p>When APIs.io gets updated to the latest version of APIs.json, I will submit both of these APIs.json files for indexing. Even though I&rsquo;m not the owner of these domains, I can still submit for inclusion in the API search engine. It would be better if the GSA published the APIs.json, and Swagger API definitions at the actual domains, and submitted themselves--the listings would then show as being authoritative, and hold more weight in API searches.</p>
<p>I still have about 115 more federal government APIs to create machine readable API definitions for, and the resulting APIs.json files that will enable discovery of these APIs--this isn&rsquo;t something that will happen overnight, and will take a shit-ton of work.</p>
<p>My goal is to help harden the APIs.json format, while making APIs in federal government more accessible, and part of the larger API discovery conversation that is going on in the private sector. One of the powerful features of APIs.json, is that external actors can craft APIs.json collections, from the outside. You don&rsquo;t have to be an owner of a domain, where an API is hosted, to publish an APIs.json on its behalf--I think this represents the potential of the public sector and private sector working together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>APis.json are meant to work as collections of APis, or virtual stacks of valuable API resources. Sometimes these virtual stacks are defined internally, within a domain, and sometimes they are mashups of multiple API resources, across numerous domains, by outside actors, or API curators. I will keep curating federal government APIs, generating machine readable API definitions, APIs.json files for their supporting domains--helping define this fun new world of API discovery.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2014</span>

<p>An <a href="http://apis.json">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;file lives in the root of any domain, or subdomain, and provides references to a collection of API resources. The APIs.json is meant to be a lightweight framework, where someone can build a collection of APIs, give it a name, description, some tags, and the APIs collection points you where you need to go, to get more information about those APIs.</p>
<p>For each API, you can define a list of URLs, each with a defining &ldquo;type&rdquo;, letting you know what to expect when you visit the URL. Right now, most of those URLs are just for humans, pointing to the developer portal, document, and terms of service (TOS). We are adding other API url types, that API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> can expose in their search interfaces, like code samples, and application gallery, to the next version of APIs.json.</p>
<p>These human API URL types provide a reference, that API search engines can use to guide human users who are searching for APIs. However, where the real power of APIs.json comes in, is when an API URL type references a machine readable source, like a <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger definition</a>, or an <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">API Commons manifest</a>. When it comes to API discovery, we need as many meaningful locations, that we can point human API consumers to, but also machine readable locations, that will help make API discovery much more rich, automated, and precise.</p>
<p>Imagine when I can do more than just search name, description, and tags, by keyword, much like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> works currently. Imagine when you can specify that you only want APIs that are in the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, and openly licensed. Imagine when I can search for APIs that allow me to use all my HTTP verbs, not just GET. Now, go even more in the future, when I can search for APIs who have a specific allowance in their terms of service, with a machine readable TOS type for APIs.json.</p>
<p>This is where I want to take APIs.json, and ultimately API discovery. Machine readable API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger are the very first API URL type that helps automate API discovery, and the API Commons manifest is the latest. My goal is to tackle terms of service, pricing, and other critical aspects of API integration, and push forward a machine readable definition, that can ultimately be baked into the API discovery process--in all API search engines.</p>
<p>What is important to me, is that the API URL types, in each APIs.json, remain independent, and only loosely coupled with the APIs.json format, using a simple label, and URL. I&rsquo;m not directly invested in the evolution of each Swagger version, however I am with API Commons, and potentially other future APIs.json API URL type definitions. I want anyone to be able to step up and suggest API URL types for the APIs.json spec, making APIs.json URL types a community driven API discovery layer, for the API economy.</p>

<p>When I first published 11 simple API definitions, I had developed using <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, into the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, I made a mistake when I referenced the Swagger specifications for each of the APIs. I linked to the machine readable Swagger spec, but not the raw JSON stored on Github, errorneously I linked directly to the Github page.</p>
<p>I want the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-commons/api-commons/gh-pages/data/apis.json">machine readable API datastore</a>, at API Commons, which is used to drive the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API listing page</a>, to be completely machine readable, referencing all APIs, their machine readable API Commons manifest, as well as machine readable API definition. As the smart folks over at <a href="https://www.apimatic.io/">APIMatic</a> pointed out to me, I had been flip-flopping on this. Some of my later entries were machine readable pointers, but my earlier entries were not.</p>
<p>Now all of the entries in the commons, have machine readable references to both their API Commons manifest, and API definition. I've also added a &ldquo;<a href="http://apicommons.org/format.html">format</a>&rdquo; page, to explain each of the fields, in the the API Commons manifest format, to help API providers better understand, and not make the same mistake I made.</p>
<p>The API Commons manifest is meant to be a standalone, machine readable pointer to an APIs central truth (a machine readable API definition), and associated CC-BY-SA or CC0 licensing, and now, I think we have achieved our original goals around making this happen.</p>

        <p><a href="https://apimatic.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apimatic/apimatic-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve expanded my monitoring on the world of APIs, from just API management, which I&rsquo;ve been doing for four years, into tracking on APIs across multiple buckets I'm calling <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a title="API monetization" href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">monetization</a>, <a title="API Evangelism" href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, <a title="API discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, <a title="API integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, <a title="API aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">aggregation</a>, <a title="reciprocity" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">reciprocity</a>, and <a title="API real time" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com">real-time</a>. I am always working to understand who the key players are across the API space, but also make sure they are categorized into one, or many of these expanding buckets--helping me quantify things.</p>
<p>It is always very interesting to see how an API service provider fits into more than one of these buckets, as well as when new players emerge to cater to just one of these buckets, like Apiary did with API design. Playing on this theme, I was introduced to new a new API service provider, called <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMatic</a> the other day, who on the surface seems to cater to API providers with the automatic generation of SDKs, but really is a cross-over into API design, discovery, and integration, bringing a new perspective to the table.</p>
<p><strong>Generating SDKs Is The Carrot</strong><br /> As soon as you land on the APIMatic home page, they state very clearly what they do "Automatic SDK Generation for APIs&rdquo;. You can search common APIs that are available in the APIMatic API marketplace, import your own API definition, or build one using their web-based user interface&mdash;which pretty squarely makes APIMatic for API consumers, providing clear API integration benefits, but via the generation of SDKs.</p>
<p><strong>GUI Tool For API Design</strong><br /> The third option for generating an SDK from an API, is using the APIMatic web-based user interface, which allows you to build a definition of your API, using a web interface&mdash;no coding necessary.  You can create a new definition, manage its settings, define endpoints, and the underlying data model. When ready, you can generate your SDK, which is rendered, I&rsquo;m guessing using the default APIMatic format, and then also allows you to generate mock APIs, and sandbox environments--pretty squarely in the world of API design for me.</p>
<p><strong>Provides API Discovery</strong><br /> Then the first option for generating an SDK is from a marketplace of existing APIs, allowing developers to generate SDKs for the most common APIs they depend on. From an API provider standpoint, this is a huge incentive for generating machine readable API definitions like Swagger, and register with marketplaces like APIMatic. I&rsquo;d say APIMatic starts with a very Mashape style API marketplace for discovery, but then quickly focuses heavily on quality SDKS, and API integration as the end deliverable.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting API Integration</strong><br /> Since APIMatic generates the code that sits between your app and the API resources it depends on, it has a unique lens for looking into how your applications are using APIs. This provides an alternative approach to the proxies and tooling I'm seeing emerge to monitor, track, test, and report on API integration. I&rsquo;m not sure of the pros and cons to this type of API integration, but think APIMatic vision is worth taking a closer look at.</p>
<p><a href="https://apimatic.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apimatic/apimatic-search-import-specify.png" alt="" width="575" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Focused Software Development Kits (SDK)</strong><br /> APIMatic focuses on delivering mobile SDKs, for iOS, Android, Windows, and Java platforms. When I talked to the founders, they said they would eventually provide more web focused SDKs, but mobile is obviously a major driver of API consumption, and was the low hanging fruit.</p>
<p><strong>Centered Around Machine Readable API Definitions</strong><br /> Everything about APIMatic is centered around API definitions. When you select to import an API, you are given the option to import APIMatic, WADL, Swagger, IODocs, GoogleREST, and MashapeJSON. Each of the APIs available in marketplace have a machine readable definition, as well as the web-based form builder generating a machine readable API definition as well. These definitions are then used to generate SDKs, mock interfaces, and full circle back to listing you in the APIMatic marketplace for discovery&mdash;if you wish to make your API public.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Software Development Kits (SDK)</strong><br /> Another aspect I find interesting about APIMatic, is that they focus on not just generating code stubs, they focus on high quality SDKs. Which in an era where you here a lot of rhetoric around SDKs being poorly written, out of date, hard to maintain, and unecessary--this gives APIMatic a potentially important differentiator if they do it right. APIMatic takes pride in their code being well written, looking nice, and following good conventions--something that could go a long ways in benefiting both API providers, and consumers.</p>
<p>Seeing new breeds of API service providers continue to emerge, with even new perspectives on how the API lifecycle operates, makes me happy, and with everything centered around machine readable, common API definitions, I'm even more pleased. This is in sync with what I&rsquo;m seeing come out of the API design, deployment, management, and integration providers I've been tracking on&mdash;that API definitions are increasingly driving all stops along the API lifecycle subway.</p>
<p>I will play with APIMatic some more. To be honest, I was approaching this from an API providers perspective when I jumped on the Google Hangout with them, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they crossed over into API design, integration, discovery, as well as management. Now that I have a good idea of what they offer, I will revisit what the benefits to API providers could be. At the very least, it is another carrot for API providers to be sure and generate machine readable definitions for their APIs&mdash;without it your APIs won&rsquo;t be found, or be able to be imported, and drive the next generation of API tooling like APIMatic.</p>
<p>APIMatic is looking to meet API providers, and get your API listed, so if you reach out, make sure and let them know I sent you. If you <a href="https://apimatic.io/Account/Register?Reference=C402F205-7E97-40EF-9894-BF1AFDBA9055">use this link</a>, and sign up, you will automatically be let into the beta users group--APIMatic is currently &ldquo;invite only&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Oh, I also had a good conversation with them about the possibilities around integration of APIMatic with <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a>, and distributed API search engines like <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a>, using <a href="http://bit.ly/1ij6TTP">APIs.json</a>&mdash;so more to come. Much more!</p>

<p>I talk about this concept often, but couldn't find any definitive post on APIs opening up a company, organization, or agency to outside ideas. This is something I hear from startups, up to federal government agencies, and from well known business brands, such as Absolut Vodka.</p>
<p>Absolut was one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXk1dvLKl-U">keynotes at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, this last march. Eva Sjokvist, from Absolut, walked us through the development of their <a href="https://addb.absolutdrinks.com/docs/">Absolut Drinks Database API</a>.&nbsp;An amazing story by itself, but one thing she said that stood out to me, which is an interestingly common by-product of the API lifecycle, was the process itself opened up the company, making it more receptive to outside ideas, and collaboration.</p>
<p>I hear this sentiment often from groups who are developing API programs at their companies, and you see shining examples, like <a href="http://developer.edmunds.com/">from Edmunds.com</a> with their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/internal-api-summit-within-every-company/">internal API Summit</a>, but rarely do I see a metric to measure API driven, cultural change. APIs don't just open up your company&rsquo;s assets and resources for access by trusted partners, or potentially the public, establishing a sort of external R&amp;D lab, it has the potential to open up a valuable feedback loop as well, bringing in new ideas that have the potential to change how a group sees the world--evolving internal culture.</p>
<p>The potential for opening up a company, bringing them closer to their partners and customers, or a government agency, opening up healthier dialogue with constituents, is the most important results of an API program&mdash;greater than any single application that will get built on an API.</p>

<p>I was exchanging emails with someone regarding API design considerations at their large institutions today, and where they could find healthy patterns for API designs within their industry. As with any API provider, they were concerned with emulating the best API design patterns they could, and evolve the design of their own services. They put it like this:</p>
<blockquote><em>..."our APIs largely expose our internal mess and legacy design rather than presenting a well thought out, consistent view of the important resources and operations"...</em></blockquote>
<p>We all want to deploy the best designed API that we possibly can, but with a lack of meaningful API definition formats (until recently), and nowhere to go and search or browse for common API design patterns (something 3Scale and API Evangelist want to fix with <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1ij6TTP">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a>), it can be difficult to know exactly what is good API design for our respective industries.</p>
<p>It would be nice, if all of the APIs we designed were brand new, perfectly architected to follow best of breed REST patterns, and we had all the time in the world to research and design. In reality, many of the APIs we design will ony act as a facade for some legacy beast of a system, that won't go away anytime soon. We are working to get more places like API Commons and APIs.io available to find the best API design patterns, and you should always look at as many of the APIs in your industry as you can, when designing your APIs, but most importantly, don't be concerned with a perfect interface--right out of the gate.</p>
<p>In reality, we have to just walk a line between the perfect API design, and the ugly legacy IT worlds, we are building these API facades to hide. The sooner we get the first version of the facade up, we can then iterate, and turn our APIs into the mirror image of the designs we ultimately desire&mdash;until then it is just smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors.</p>

<p>I am continuing my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">research into how universities are using APIs</a>, and while I was going through the developer areas for the universities I track on, I noticed an interesting mobile developer toolkit, from <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>.</p>
<p>When you land on the homepage of the <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">University of Michigan developer portal</a>, to the right you will see some valuable resources that is looking to help developers think through the bigger picture of designing, developing, deploying, testing and distributing, mobile application that are built on campus resources.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan mobile developer toolkit is broken down into four separate groups:</p>
<h3>Design</h3>

</ul>
<p>I think the resources they provide, represent a very long term vision around delivering API resources to developers, who will be building applications for the institution--something that all universities should look at emulating.</p>
<p>You want developers, who are building mobile applications on top of campus API resources to be successful, so providing them with the education, training and resources they need to deliver, is critical.</p>
<p>I also think it is cool, that at the bottom of the mobile developer toolkit, they provide two other links:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://mobileapps.its.umich.edu/devtoolkit/collaborate">Collaborate</a> - Campus and local developer groups.</li>
<li><a href="http://mobileapps.its.umich.edu/devtoolkit/opportunities">Opportunities</a> - App competition notices.</li>
</ul>
<p>They want their app developers to socialize with other campus application developers, and be aware of opportunities to compete in hackathons and other competitions--on and off campus.</p>
<p>Developing mobile applications is the number one incentive for universities to deploy APIs, and jumpstart their API efforts like at <a href="https://developer.byu.edu/wiki/display/SOA/Home">BYU</a>, <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">UW</a> and <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>, and&nbsp;it just makes sense to provide a mobile developer toolkit for developers. Education around APIs and mobile application development is critical to the success of any API initiative, but even more so, when it occurs across a large institution, by a variety of internal and external groups.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add the mobile developer toolkit to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">list common building blocks</a> for not just university APIs, but all API initiatives.</p>

<p>I'm working a wider campaign focused on getting my shit together around my images, and part of that is continueing work I had started with my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, and launch more image manipulation API resources.</p>
<p>I have a wide range of needs to resize, crop, filter, and apply other filters to photos I work with, as part of my storytelling, and if I had a set of image manipulation APIs, life would be better--so as I do with anything, I got to work building an API.</p>
<p>The result is the first, in a series of&nbsp;<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation APIs</a>. Right now I focused on some low hanging fruit, like applying filters to images, which includes Charcoal, Oil Painting, Polaroid, and Sketch. Next, I will tackle some more utility APIs like resize, crop, and rotate.</p>
<p>Like my other APIs, I will use my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">operational harness</a>, and operate a <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">cloud version of my image manipulation API</a>, where anyone can access, and take advantage of my API resources. Using my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/service-composition-for-my-screen-capture-api/">API service composition</a>, I setup access tiers for public, partners and internal usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also open source any code behind so that others can deploy image manipulation within their own infrastructure, or I'm happy to setup for you--for a fee! :-)</p>
<p>I have a number of APIs I want to get built, and image manipulation has been on my list for a while, I'm glad I finally was able to get this work started.</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas while being the API Evangelist. It just comes with the territory. I have an Evernote folder that I publish these ideas to, and some of them, like my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">Screen Capture API</a>, I actually make a reality.</p>
<p>The other night while writing, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/02/shadow-api-launching-an-api-before-someone-else-does/">Shadow API: Launching An API Before Someone Else Does</a>, I went to add the Nebraska homestead record API idea to my Evernote, and I said, ENOUGH! I need a public place to store these ideas, and while I'm at it, I'll enable others to publish ideas there too.</p>
<p>What better way to allow collaboration around a content store or dataset, than a Github repository plus API. So I launched <a href="http://ideas.apievangelist.com/">API Ideas</a>, as an individual API project, on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist Network</a>. I allows me to retrieve, and add to a list of API ideas, all stored on Github, using a simple web API.</p>

<p>In the tech space, when we see a pattern that works, we run with it. This is why you hear, &ldquo;It is the Uber for X&rdquo;, or &ldquo;It is the Github for X&rdquo;, and I recently talked about how I&rsquo;m starting to see more of, &ldquo;<a title="It is the If This Then That (IFTT) for X" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/16/its-if-this-then-that-for-x/">It is the If This Then That (IFTT) for X</a>&rdquo;. The IFTTT model, or what I call &ldquo;reciprocity&rdquo;, is an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">evolution on the classic enterprise ETL model</a>, resulting in over 25 companies that I&rsquo;m tracking on in the space.</p>
<p>Reciprocity works, because it is about solving a simple problem for everyday users, using APIs to take a single action&mdash;if this happens over there, use APIs, to do that over there. There are many other words used to describe this evolution of ETL in the clouds, including interoperability, and automation, I use reciprocity because it better describes what is happening as part of the growing global API economy.</p>
<p>I recently went through all <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">65+ of my research projects</a>, one of them being <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, and as I was working on new research areas around open data, analysis, and visualization, I started thinking about how the IFTTT (reciprocity) model could be applied to analysis and visualization&mdash;resulting in a draft model I would call <strong><em>If This Then Visualize That (IFTVT)</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The IFTVT model provides the similar feedback loop as IFTTT, but instead of a resulting action, the end goal is a visualization.  If &ldquo;end of month&rdquo;, show me overview of Foursquare checkins. If &ldquo;Tweet receives 10 favorites&rdquo;, show me a list of Twitter users. If &ldquo;bank account goes below $50&rdquo;, show me last 25 charges. How you get your IFTVT visualizations would be up to you, maybe it is email, maybe SMS, maybe some sort of iGoogle like dashboard unit.</p>
<p>As with the IFTTT model, IFTVT gives us actionable, meaningful results from our increasingly disparate digital worlds. Using reciprocity, we are slowly being able to get a handle on the cloud versions of ourselves, and I think the next step could be analysis and resulting visualizations, in bit-size, meaningful, informative chunks via the channels that matter most to us.</p>
<p>Ok, get to work geeks! I&rsquo;ll tell the story, if you build it. ;-)</p>

We are moving beyond the API directory as our primary mode of API search, in favor of a distributed approach using APIs.json, and supporting <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">open source search engines like APIs.io</a>. Another area of API discovery I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/18/integrated-development-environment-ide-for-apis/">watching for a while</a>, and predict will become an important layer of API discovery, will be via the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source SalesForce API IDE Plugin</strong><br /> SalesForce just<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/07/new-eclipse-plugin.html"> announced they have just open sourced their API IDE plugin on Github</a>, after developing on it since 2007, when <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/index_Left.htm">APEX</a> was born. The plugin is old, but is very much in use in the SalesForce ecosystem, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/04/salesforce-discusses-its-eclipse-plugin-release-approach/">something I&rsquo;ve written about before</a>. They will be accepting pull requests on the main branch, looking to improve on the codebase, while looking to also maintain a community branch, as well as encouraging you to establish your own branch.</p>
<p><strong>Does Your API Have An IDE Plugin?</strong><br /> How far along are you on your own APIs Eclipse Plugin? Are you trying to reach enterprise developers with your API resource? You should probably look at the pros and cons of providing your API developers with a plugin, for leading IDEs. With the open sourcing of SalesForce API IDE plugin, <a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/idecore">you can reverse engineer their approach</a> and see what you can use for your own APIs IDE plugin&mdash;smells like a good opportunity to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/07/new-eclipse-plugin.html" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/salesforce/apex_doc_plugin_menu.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Opportunity For General Or Niche API IDE Plugins</strong><br /> Not that using SalesForce open source IDE would be the place to start for this kind of project, but I think there is a huge opportunity to develop API focused IDE plugins, for top developed environments, across many popular APIs. Developers shouldn&rsquo;t have to leave their development environments to find the resources they need, they should be able to have quick access to the APIs they depend on te most, and discover new API resources right from their local environment, aking IDE plugins an excellent API discovery opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Native Opportunities For IDE Platforms</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of new development environments emerge, many are web-based, with varying degrees of being &ldquo;integrated&rdquo;. I think that IDE developers can take a lead from <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/companies.html">Backend as a Service (BaaS) providers</a> and build in the ability to define an integrated stack of API resources, right into a developer's web, mobile, or Iot development environment. If you are building a platform for developers to produce code, you should begin baking in API discovery and integration directly into your environment.</p>
<p>All I do as the API Evangelist, is shed light on what API pioneers like SalesForce are up to, and expand on their ideas, using my knowledge of the industry--resulting in these stories. SalesForce has been doing APIs for 14 years now, and the IDE has been part of their API driven ecosystem for the last seven years. I think their move to open source the technology, is an opportunity for the wider API space to run with, by helping improve the community SalesForce API IDE plugin, but also apply their experience, and legacy code to help evolve and improve on this layer of API discovery, available within the IDE.</p>

<p><strong>Open Source SalesForce API IDE Plugin</strong><br /> SalesForce just<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/07/new-eclipse-plugin.html"> announced they have just open sourced their API IDE plugin on Github</a>, after developing on it since 2007, when <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/index_Left.htm">APEX</a> was born. The plugin is old, but is very much in use in the SalesForce ecosystem, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/04/salesforce-discusses-its-eclipse-plugin-release-approach/">something I&rsquo;ve written about before</a>. They will be accepting pull requests on the main branch, looking to improve on the codebase, while looking to also maintain a community branch, as well as encouraging you to establish your own branch.</p>
<p><strong>Does Your API Have An IDE Plugin?</strong><br /> How far along are you on your own APIs Eclipse Plugin? Are you trying to reach enterprise developers with your API resource? You should probably look at the pros and cons of providing your API developers with a plugin, for leading IDEs. With the open sourcing of SalesForce API IDE plugin, <a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/idecore">you can reverse engineer their approach</a> and see what you can use for your own APIs IDE plugin&mdash;smells like a good opportunity to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/07/new-eclipse-plugin.html" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/salesforce/apex_doc_plugin_menu.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Opportunity For General Or Niche API IDE Plugins</strong><br /> Not that using SalesForce open source IDE would be the place to start for this kind of project, but I think there is a huge opportunity to develop API focused IDE plugins, for top developed environments, across many popular APIs. Developers shouldn&rsquo;t have to leave their development environments to find the resources they need, they should be able to have quick access to the APIs they depend on te most, and discover new API resources right from their local environment, aking IDE plugins an excellent API discovery opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Native Opportunities For IDE Platforms</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of new development environments emerge, many are web-based, with varying degrees of being &ldquo;integrated&rdquo;. I think that IDE developers can take a lead from <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/companies.html">Backend as a Service (BaaS) providers</a> and build in the ability to define an integrated stack of API resources, right into a developer's web, mobile, or Iot development environment. If you are building a platform for developers to produce code, you should begin baking in API discovery and integration directly into your environment.</p>
<p>All I do as the API Evangelist, is shed light on what API pioneers like SalesForce are up to, and expand on their ideas, using my knowledge of the industry--resulting in these stories. SalesForce has been doing APIs for 14 years now, and the IDE has been part of their API driven ecosystem for the last seven years. I think their move to open source the technology, is an opportunity for the wider API space to run with, by helping improve the community SalesForce API IDE plugin, but also apply their experience, and legacy code to help evolve and improve on this layer of API discovery, available within the IDE.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apis.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-io/apis-io.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to stop and reflect for a moment on the open source, distributed API search engine, that <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist developed, in support of the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json discovery format</a>. When we conceived the APIs.json API discovery format, we knew that the project would be dead in the water, if there wasn&rsquo;t a clear incentive for API providers to generate an <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>&mdash;helping them get their APIs found.</p>
<p>Until 2014, when you said "search for APIs", it meant going to a website (<a href="http://programmableweb.com">programmableweb.com</a>), and searching for an API in a curated directory of APIs. In the last couple years, we&rsquo;ve seen an evolution on this directory search model from Mashape, in the form of a hub or marketplace. Managed directories have their place in the world of API discovery, similar to the web directory realm, but as the number of APIs grow, we are desperately needing to go beyond just directory based API discovery, and like with the web, establish a meaningful search layer&mdash;we need a Google of API search.</p>
<p>This is why 3Scale and API Evangelist developed APIs.json, and the first open tooling on top of the API discovery format, we called <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>. We do not believe APIs.json + APIs.io is the next Google, but we do feel it will jumpstart the conversation around what is needed when it comes to API discovery. How do we find the best of breed APIs, not just on keyword search in the title and description, or driven from tags? We need a way for API providers to describe their APIs, and supporting building blocks, in a machine readable, distributed way, that can be indexed by many API discovery solutions.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When searching for APIs, we will need to find specific API interfaces, with very specialized terms of service, and pricing. We will need API rating solutions like <a href="http://api500.com/">API Rating Agency</a> baked into our API search algorithms. We need an extensible API discovery format, this is APIs.json. We need an open source search engine, that can be deployed as general search engine, or deployed as a specialized, niche, API search engine serving a specific business sector, like government--this is APIs.io.</p>
<p>APIs.io now has 128 APIs in its index, submitted by 91 maintainers. We are just getting started, defining what is next for both APIs.json, and APIs.io, make sure and get involved early on, and help make your mark on this rapidly expanding world of API discovery.  You can <a href="http://apis.io/apis/add">add your APIs to APIs.io</a>, <a title="fork the open source API search engine code" href="https://github.com/apisio/apis.io">fork the open source API search engine code</a>&nbsp;(coming soon) and launch your own API search engine, or <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">provide feedback on the next version of APIs.json</a>, the format that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> help discover the valuable API resources everyone will be depending on in the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-aud-shadow.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In a perfect world, every government agency, non-profit organization, and company would have an API, and the content and data available via their website, mobile applications, and other systems, would be accessible in an easy, machine readable way. This perfect world does not exist. Even though many government agencies, non-profit organizations, and companies are getting hip to the world of APIs, there is still massive amounts of work to be done, and I'm afraid if we want to see APIs across our government, we are going to have to do much of it ourselves.</p>
<p>I was listening to an <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/07/02/327797193/digital-homestead-records-reopen-a-crucial-chapter-of-u-s-history">NPR story on the release of files detailing Nebraska's homesteading history</a>, a project between the National Archives and National Park Service, today. I wish I could be at all federal agencies, in all meetings, advocating for an API first approach to these projects--I can&rsquo;t. So, while we can celebrate the fact that the records around Nebraska&rsquo;s history have been digitized, and <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/homestead/">the website is very nice</a>, and usable for humans, THERE IS NO API!</p>
<p>This is when the private sector has to step in and help our federal government realize the importance and potential of an API--we need a shadow API for the homestead records database. While the <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/homestead/">website is great for human consumptio</a>n, we also need a simple, machine readable API that other applications can put to use. It would be nice if the National Archives and National Park Service had made the API a priority, but I think this is where the private sector needs to step in, and make it happen.</p>
<p>I have direct orders from my super secret White House contact(s) to challenge you, Joe and Jane citizen to see who can launch an API faster, around content or data that is already public (no hacking)&mdash;the federal government, or you the average tech savvy citizen. I won&rsquo;t give up my sources, but I&rsquo;m dead serious when I say the White House asked me to put the word out on this.</p>
<p>Data sources like Nebraskas homestead records, are well structured web searches, and not that difficult to scrape. A savvy programmer could easily write a script to do it, and hand roll a simple API for others access the records. I also think a tech savvy non-programmer, could make happen by employing a modern API deployment tools like <a href="http://bit.ly/1iZ9EQ6">ScraperWiki</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1pKwOg9">Import.io</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1wWkDwH">Orchestrate.io</a>, or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>. I don&rsquo;t imagine it taking more than a day or two, to scrape the data, and deploy a simple API interface from the results.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a new concept, something API devlopers have been doing a while. The <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/2010/12/15">first Instagram API was a shadow API,</a> deployed by independent 3rd party developer, who reverse engineered the mobile application. Kimono Labs also just launched an <a href="http://www.kimonolabs.com/worldcup/explorer">unofficial World Cup API</a>, allowing for <a href="http://webkite.com/world-cup/">some pretty cool applications to be built on top of the shadow API</a>. Shadow APIs have been being deployed for years, we just need to make them more of a mainstream, acceptable way to make resources available via APIs, real fast!</p>
<p>If you know of a shadow API you would like to see built, or you are available to deploy shadow APIs, let me know. There are some things I&rsquo;d like to see in quality shadow API deployments around government data (maybe another story), and I can help you get the word out when the time is right. In my opinion, if content or data is already available via a government website, or as a full data dowload, there should be an API for it. Period.</p>
<p>What do you think? Who is going to build my Nebraska homestead record API, before I can harass the National Archives and National Park Service to do it?</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a style="padding: 15px;" href="http://www.caulfield.pw:3000/view/welcome-visitors"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/smallest-federated-wiki/smallest-federated-wiki.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I'm always working to better understand the best of breed technology solutions available online today, and to me, this means, lightweight, machine readable apps that do one thing and do it well. One solution I&rsquo;m looking at is called the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caulfield.pw:3000/view/welcome-visitors">Smallest Federated Wiki</a>, from Mike Caulfield(<a href="https://twitter.com/holden">@holden</a>), which has been on my list for several weeks now, but one of his <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/06/20/smallest-federated-wiki-as-a-universal-json-canvas/">latest posts has floated it back onto my priority list</a>.</p>
<p>To understand what the Smallest Federated Wiki (SFW) is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikA5rHA1uDg">check out the video</a>. I haven&rsquo;t personally downloaded and installed yet, which is something I do with all solutions that I&rsquo;m evaluating. SFW is Node.js, and <a href="https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki-node-server">available on Github</a>, if you want to play with as well--I'm going to be installing on AWS if you need an AMI. This post is all about understanding SFW, and light the fire under my own use of SFW, and hopefully stimulating your interest.</p>
<p><strong>Simple</strong><br /> Building off the simplicity of the Wiki, SFW borrows from the best features of Wiki, Github, and rolled together into simple, but ultimately powerful implementation that embraces the latest in technology from Node.js to HTML5. I know how hard it can be to achieve "simple", and while playing with SFW, I can tell a lot of work has gone into keeping things as fucking simple as possible. #win</p>
<p><strong>Federated</strong><br /> I love me some Wikipedia and Github, but putting my valuable content, and hard work into someone else&rsquo;s silo is proving to be a very bad idea. For all of my projects, I want to be able maximize collaboration, syndication and reach, without giving away ownership of my intellectual exhaust (IE) . SFW reflects this emotion, and allows me to browse other people&rsquo;s work, fork, re-use, while also maintaining my own projects within my silo, and enable other people to fork, and re-use from my work as well--SFW is a sneak peak at how <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span> modern applications <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHOULD</span> operate.</p>
<p><strong>JSON Extensible</strong><br /> SFW has the look and feel of a new age wiki, allowing you two generate pages and pages of content, but the secret sauce underneath is JSON. Everything on SFW is JSON driven, allowing for unlimited extensibility. <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/06/20/smallest-federated-wiki-as-a-universal-json-canvas/">MIke's latest blog post on how SFW&rsquo;s extensibility is unlimited</a>, due to it's JSON driven architecture, is why I'm floating SFW back on my review list. My 60+ API Evangelist projects all start with basic page, and blog content, but then rely on JSON driven research for companies, building blocks, tools, services, and many other data points that I track on for the space&mdash;SFW reflects the JSON extensibility I&rsquo;ve been embracing for the last couple years, but I'm doing this manually, SFW is by default.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity And Complexity</strong><br /> SFW achieves a simplicity, combined with the ability to extend the complexity in any way you choose. I can create a simple 3 page project site with it, or I could create a federated news application, allowing thousands of people to publish, curate, fork, remix, and collaborate around links&mdash;think Reddit, but federated. I envision SFW templates or blueprints, that allow me to quickly deploy a basic project blog, or CRM, news, research, and other more complex solutions. With <a href="http://www.docker.com/">new cloud deployment options like Docker emerging</a>, I see a future where I can quickly deploy these federated blueprints, on the open web, on-premise, or anywhere I desire.</p>
<p>I have a lot of ideas that I want to contribute to the SFW roadmap, but I need to get more seat hours, playing with the code, before I can intelligently contribute. Once i get my base SFW setup, I will start brainstorming on the role APIs can play in the SFW plugin layer., and scenarios for rapidly building SFW blueprint containers.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> While SFW has been on my Evernote todo list for several weeks, it was Mike's continued storytelling which bumped up the priority. Without the storytelling and evangelism, nothing happens--something Mike references in his post.</p>

<p>As I generate shitloads of content playing the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>&nbsp;on the Internets, I struggle with certain words, as I write each day&mdash;one of these words is intellectual property (IP), which Wikipedia defines as:</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual property (IP) rights are the legally recognized exclusive rights to creations of the mind.[1] Under intellectual property law, owners are granted certain exclusive rights to a variety of intangible assets, such as musical, literary, and artistic works; discoveries and inventions; and words, phrases, symbols, and designs. Common types of intellectual property rights include copyright, trademarks, patents, industrial design rights, trade dress, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets.</a></em></blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the phrase intellectual property, specifically because it includes &ldquo;property&rdquo;. Nothing that comes from my intellect is property. Nothing. It isn&rsquo;t something you can own or control. Sorry, what gets generated from my intellect, wants to be free, not owned or controlled&mdash;it is just the way it is. I cannot be creative, generate my ideas and projects, if I know the output or results will be locked up.</p>
<p>With this in mind I want to craft a new expression to describe the result of my intellectual output, I&rsquo;m going to call intellectual exhaust (IE). I like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust">term exhaust, which has numerous definitions</a>, and reflects what can be emitted from my daily thoughts. You are welcome to collect, observe, remix, learn from, or get high off of the exhaust off my daily work&mdash;go right ahead, this is one of the many reasons I work so hard each day. You my loyal reader. One. Single.</p>
<p>In my opinion, you can even make money off my intellectual exhaust, however, no matter what you do, make sure you attribute back, letting people know where your ideas come from. And if you do make some money from it, maybe you can kick some of that back, supporting the things that fuel my intellectual exhaust:  sleep, food, water, beer, and interactions with other smart people around the globe. ;-)</p>
<p>P.S. There are other things that fuel my intellectual exhaust, but my lawyer and my girlfriend say I can&rsquo;t include some of them.</p>
<p>P.S.S. My girlfriend is not my lawyer.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/Amazon_S3_Site.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm spending a lot of time updating my<a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com"> API deployment research</a>&nbsp;lately, making sure it reflects what is truly going on out there in the space. In addition to tracking on legacy approaches to API deployment like enterprise API gateways, or using an open-source API frameworks, I am also trying to understand the realities of scraping data for deployment of APIs, and new solutions from API platforms like <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1jLr1Pf">StrongLoop</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1wWkDwH">Orchestrate.io</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1pKwOg9">Import.io</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to the realities of deploying an API, your data or content sources is likely to come from a myriad of file stores, databases, and other systems, and I&rsquo;m looking to explore as many of the as I possibly can. Todays exploration is focused on deploying an API, using Amazon S3 as a file store. I use Amazon S3 for all my heavy object storage which includes images, PDFs, XML, JSON and CSV data stores&mdash;it makes sense that someone companies would want to deploy APIs using their Amazon S3 stores.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/api-spark/apispark-s3.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using APISpark as my API deployment platform, which allows me to first establish a datastore, which is mapped to a specific bucket within my Amazon S3. What I put into my buckets, and folders is up to me. I might use it to quickly provide access to my images, a folder of XML files, PDFs, or other resource. Once I have my datastore defined, I can deploy a simple web API using APISpark, which gives me all the expected features of an API&mdash;URL API endpoints, documentation, code samples, basic authentication (username / password), analytics, and much more.</p>
<p>As with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/30/deploy-an-api-from-a-google-spreadsheet-using-apispark/">Google Spreadsheet to API example I wrote on Monday</a>, this scenario allows anyone who manages content and data, to easily organize it on S3, then deploy an API for access, with no IT or developer experience required. You might need to share images, files, or other content with another department within your company or organization, partners outside the corporate firewall, or maybe some 3rd party developers you have building a new website or mobile application.</p>
<p>API deployment is getting easier, and cloud API service providers like APISpark are making API deployment something ANYONE can do&mdash;stop waiting for IT or developer resources! ;-)</p>

<p>As I continue my research the world of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a>, I'm trying to distill the services, and tooling I come across, down into what I consider to be a common set of building blocks. My goal with identifying API deployment building blocks is to provide a simple list of what the moving parts are, that enable API providers to successfully deploy their services.</p>
<p>Some of these building blocks overlap with other core areas of my research like <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">design</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a>, but I hope this list captures the basic building blocks of what anyone needs to know, to be able to follow the world of API deployment. While this post is meant for a wider audience, beyond just developers, I think it provides a good reminder for developers as well, and can help things come into focus. (I know it does for me!)</p>
<p>Also there is some overlap between some of these building blocks, like API Gateway and API Proxy, both doing very similiar things, but labeled differently. Identifying building blocks for me, can be very difficult, and I'm constantly shifting definitions around, until I find a comfortable fit--so some of these will evolve, especially with the speed at which things are moving in 2014.</p>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>CSV to API</strong>&nbsp;- Text files that contain comma separate values or CSVs, is one of the quickest ways to convert existing data to an API. Each row of a CSV can be imported and converted to a record in a database, and easily generate a RESTful interface that represents the data stored in the CSV. CSV to API can be very messy depending on the quality of the data in the CSV, but can be a quick way to breathe new life into old catalogs of data lying around on servers or even desktops. The easiest way to deal with CSV is to import directly into database, than generate API from database, but the process can be done at time of API creation.</td>

If you have valuable data, generally in 2013, it will reside in a Microsoft, MySQL, PostgreSQL or other common database platform. Connecting to a database and generate a CRUD, or create, read, updated and delete API on an existing data make sense for a lot of reason. This is the quickest way to open up product catalogs, public directories, blogs, calendars or any other commonly stored data. APIs are rapidly replace database connections, when bundled with common API management techniques, APIs can allow for much more versatile and secure access that can be made public and shared outside the firewall.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Framework</strong>&nbsp;- There is no reason to hand-craft an API from scratch these days. There are numerous frameworks out their that are designed for rapidly deploying web APIs. Deploying APIs using a framework is only an option when you have the necessary technical and developer talent to be able to understand the setup of environment and follow the design patterns of each framework. When it comes to planning the deployment of an API using a framework, it is best to select one of the common frameworks written in the preferred language of the available developer and IT resources. Frameworks can be used to deploy data APIs from CSVs and databases, content from documents or custom code resources that allow access to more complex objects.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Gateway</strong>&nbsp;- API gateways are enterprise quality solutions that are designed to expose API resources. Gateways are meant to provide a complete solution for exposing internal systems and connecting with external platforms. API gateways are often used to proxy and mediate existing API deployments, but may also provide solutions for connecting to other internal systems like databases, FTP, messaging and other common resources. Many public APIs are exposed using frameworks, most enterprise APIs are deployed via API gateways--supporting much larger ideployments.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Proxy</strong>&nbsp;- API proxy are common place for taking an existing API interface, running it through an intermediary which allows for translations, transformations and other added services on top of API. An API proxy does not deploy an API, but can take existing resources like SOAP, XML-RPC and transform into more common RESTful APIs with JSON formats. Proxies provide other functions such as service composition, rate limiting, filtering and securing of API endpoints. API gateways are the preffered approach for the enterprise, and the companies that provide services support larger API deployments.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Connector</strong>&nbsp;- Contrary to an API proxy, there are API solutions that are proxyless, while just allowing an API to connect or plugin to the advanced API resources. While proxies work in many situations, allowing APIs to be mediated and transformed into required interfaces, API connectors may be preferred in situations where data should not be routed through proxy machines. API connector solutions only connect to existing API implementations are easily integrated with existing API frameworks as well as web servers like Nginx.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-hosting" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Hosting</strong>&nbsp;- Hosting is all about where you are going to park your API. Usual deployments are on-premise within your company or data center, in a public cloud like Amazon Web Services or a hybrid of the two. Most of the existing service providers in the space support all types of hosting, but some companies, who have the required technical talent host their own API platforms. With HTTP being the transport in which modern web APIs put to use, sharing the same infrastructure as web sites, hosting APIs does not take any additional skills or resources, if you already have a web site or application hosting environment.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Versioning</strong>&nbsp;- There are many different approaches to managing different version of web APIs. When embarking on API deployment you will have to make a decision about how each endpoint will be versioned and maintained. Each API service provider offers versioning solutions, but generally it is handled within the API URI or passed as an HTTP header. Versioning is an inevitable part of the API life-cycle and is better to be integrated by design as opposed to waiting until you are forced to make a evolution in your API interface.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Documentation</strong>&nbsp;- API documentation is an essential building block for all API endpoints. Quality, up to date documentation is essential for on-boarding developers and ensuring they successfully integrate with an API. Document needs to be derived from quality API designs, kept up to date and made accessible to developers via a portal. There are several tools available for automatically generting documentation and even what is called interactive documentation, that allows for developers to make live calls against an API while exploring the documentation. API documentation is part of every API deployment.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Code Samples</strong>&nbsp;- Second to documentation, code samples in a variety of programming languages is essential to a successful API integration. With quality API design, generating samples that can be used across multiple API resources is possible. Many of the emerging API service providers and the same tools that generate API documentation from JSON definitions can also auto generate code samples that can be used by developers. Generation of code samples in a variety of programming languages is a requirement during API deployment.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Scraping</strong>&nbsp;- Harvesting or scraping of data from an existing website, content or data source. While we all would like content and data sources to be machine readable, sometimes you have just get your hands dirty and scrape it. While I don't support scraping of content in all scenarios, and business sectors, but in the right situations scraping can provide a perfectly acceptable content or data source for deploying an API.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Github</strong>&nbsp;- Github provides a simple, but powerful way to support API deployment, allowing for publsihing of a developer portal, documentation, code libraries, TOS, and all your supporting API business building blocks, that are necessary for API effort. At a minimum Github should be used to manage public code libraries, and engage with API consumers using Github's social features.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Terms of Use / Service</strong>&nbsp;- Terms of Use provide a legal framework for developers to operate within. They set the stage for the business development relationships that will occur within an API ecosystem. TOS should protect the API owners company, assets and brand, but should also provide assurances for developers who are building businesses on top of an API. Make sure an APIs TOS pass insepection with the lawyers, but also strike a healthy balance within the ecosystem and foster innovation.</td>

<p>Spreadsheet are the most used datastore in business. When Google came out with their web-based spreadsheet, it was a game changer (for those who have access), when it came to managing, collaborating and sharing small data sets.</p>
<p>When it comes to data management, not all of us live in the world of big data, and spreadsheets are a quick and dirty data store that gets the job done.  As the web was maturing, Google saw an opportunity, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs">launched the labs version of Google Spreadsheets in mid 2006</a>, bringing spreadsheets into the web 2.0 era of the Internet. In 2014, the next step, in the evolution of the spreadsheet, is to be able to plug spreadsheets directly into the API economy, allowing spreadsheet data stewards to make their valuable content and data available to web, mobile and Internet of things (Iot) developers via simple web APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/gdata/samples/spreadsheet_sample">Google Spreadsheets allows for accessing data via a JSON feed natively</a>, and I wrote about adding an API, plus management layer on top of a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">public</a> or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">private</a> Google Spreadsheet, but there is also an instant, cloud-based approach to deploying an API from Google Spreadsheet, using <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark</a>. Restlet has taken their open source REST framework, launched it as a service, and opened up the possibility for anyone to deploy an API, from an existing Google Spreadsheet&mdash;no coding necessary.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-spreadsheet-api.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>APISpark has provided both the API deployment, plus API management layer, spreadsheet owners will need. This is an important evolution in the API economy, because it allows people who are actually managing vital data to securely expose it, for use in applications, without needing any developer or IT resources. This will bring data stewards closer to the actual people who need their data, whether it be internally between systems or business units, externally with partners, or even publicly for anyone looking to use a dataset on a website or application.</p>
<p>A lot can be lost in translation, when a dataset has to go through IT, or developers before it can be made available as an API, not to mention the cost savings in being able to cut out the middleman. If we can equip any small business, enterprise, non-profit, or government data steward, who spends their day managing content and data in spreadsheets, with the ability to securely expose, and easily manage APIs from those data sources&mdash;imagine the fuel that will be fed to the API economy.</p>
<p>I am working on other walk-throughs, demonstrating how to expose datasets managed in <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">Google Spreadsheets, as APIs, using APISpark.</a> When I get up, I will publish here on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, as well as on my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API Deployment research site</a>, for folks to learn from.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working the great feedback we've had on <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, an adding everything to the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">Github issues for consideration in the next version</a>. Today I&rsquo;m spending a little time thinking through the big picture of APIs.json, and some of the building blocks I'd like to see reflected when API providers generate their APIs.json.</p>
<p>Each API listed in an APIs.json has what we are calling: <em>"Properties Elements&rdquo;.</em> The properties element is a collection, with two values: <em>type and url.</em> While we provide you with a base set of property element types you can reference:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Swagger</li>
<li>RAML</li>
<li>Blueprint</li>
<li>WADL</li>
<li>WSDL</li>
<li>TermsOfService</li>
<li>InterfaceLicense</li>
<li>StatusPage</li>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Forums</li>
<li>AlertsTwitterHandle</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to continue providing, &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; types that we recognize, while also leaving properties elements, being as organic as possible&mdash;meaning you can define your own references, and tell the story of why these are important building blocks in your own API strategy. We will continue adding the best properties we see being used, to the APIs.json spec.</p>
<p>To prepare for the next version of APIs.json, I want to have the next list of reserved property types. Working from my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a> I&rsquo;ve identified X I&rsquo;d like to see in the next version:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

<p>These are the building blocks I think are important to API operations. Currently all of these will be links to human readable pages, within an APIs developer portal, but eventually I envision all of these potentially being machine readable.</p>
<p>I know, this is a big vision, but I intend to make it a reality. The first machine readable element on this list is the InterfaceLicense, which will reference the <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">machine readable JSON manifest</a> for <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.</p>
<p>Next on the list is TermsOfService, which I will be using <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read&rsquo;s</a> machine readable format, and applying it to the world of APIs. If there are any types you&rsquo;d like to see in the next version of APIs.json, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues/44">Github issue I created for this discussion</a>, and make sure it is on the list.</p>

<p>My research for API Evangelist <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">spans 50+ projects</a>, but my core research is focused on seven projects in&nbsp;<a href="http://101.apievangelist.com">API 101</a>, <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com">history</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a> and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>. In each of these areas, I evaluate who the key players (companies and individuals) are, and the tools and services they produce.</p>
<p>Using my own, custom developed system, I monitor these key players, in all of the research areas, consuming blog posts, tweets, code commits, and much more, trying to establish a deep awareness in each of these fundamental layers of the API economy.  The goal of my monitoring is to help me in producing blog posts (short form), and white papers (long form), while generating valuable analysis for my research, and increasing my own understanding and awareness of the API economy.</p>
<p>I have already produced white papers for <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-evangelist-api-101-white-paper-2.png">API 101</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-evangelist-white-papers-history-of-apis-2.png">History of APIs</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-deployment-pdf-cover-3.png">API Deployment</a>, and <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-evangelist-api-providers-guide-api-management-white-paper.png">API Management</a>, and I just now finished one for <a href="http://bit.ly/1pFDGeP">API Design</a>. As with all of my research projects, and the resulting white papers, they are a work in progress, and meant to be a living snapshot of my research. I generate this white paper using the same tools I publish my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design research to Github</a>. My CMS lets me format the static content, while also pulling dynamic content from my tracking system(s), and rolls it up into single PDF white paper, you can take with you and learn about the world of API design--it isn't perfect, but provides a good summary of my research.</p>
<p>The other white papers I've produced are all due for an update, but first I need to focus on producing the first version white paper for API discovery, and integration, both areas that are extremely relevant, fast moving layers of the API economy. Looking at the date on my other white papers, June 2013, it seems that summer is a good time to hibernate and produce these new, long form snapshots of my ongoing research into the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-comment-bubbles.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>We are still in the infancy of the API economy, and now with barely 14 years of evolving web API design, we are only just now developing the languages we will need to communicate around APIs throughout their lifecycle, from the first mock of the API resource, to monitoring of a production API in the wild, or making available to a new breed of API search engines.</p>
<p>There has long been standards for describing APIs, such as WSDL for SOAP, and WADL for web APIs, but these formats would never actually enable the meaningful interactions around APIs that it would take to find widespread adoption. WSDL was too programmatic, and heavy handed, while WADL never possessed the incentives for API providers to take the time to define their APIs using the heavy XML format.</p>
<p>It wasn't until early 2011, we would see the first signs of a meaningful language for defining web APIs, that would enable us to have productive conversations, and take action around our API designs. In February 2011, <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">online word meaning and definition site Wordnik</a>, launched a <a href="http://blog.wordnik.com/calling-all-developers-check-out-our-new-developer-site">new API developer portal, complete with a new way to document APIs</a>, that was interactive, and allowed developers to make live API calls, while learning about an API. In an effort to keep their API documentation up to date, Wordnik has also established a new way to not just document and communicate with an API, but allow us to actually have a shared conversation about the actual design of the API itself.</p>
<p>Later on that year, API management provider Mashery emulated Wordnik's approach, and <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/mashery-unveils-next-generation-of-api-documentation-1541728.htm">launched their I/O Docs</a>. Immediately after, in August 2011, <a href="http://blog.wordnik.com/wordnik-news-swagger-jobs-nosql-now">Wordnik formally launched their approach to defining APIs</a>, generate interactive documentation, and server or client side code&mdash;which they called <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>. Over the next two years the Swagger ecosystem would grow and evolve, producing new versions, tooling, and implementations of both private and public API implementations.</p>
<p>During this time, the concept of API design would expand, with tech giants like Google establishing their own approach, which they called <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">Google Discovery</a>, and we would see a new breed of API design service providers emerge with <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a>. By March 2013, Apiary had <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2013/03/28/New-API-Blueprint-Format-Roll-Out/">launched their own API definition format called API Blueprint</a>, which allowed API providers to define an API using markdown, and iterate on the design using Apiary.io services. Apiary moved the incentives for defining APIs in a machine readable format earlier on in the lifecycle. Now we didn't just generate machine readable definitions to deploy server code, or generate interactive docs and client side code, we would do it before we actually deployed the API, allowing us to mock our API designs, and collaborate around designing the actual API prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Then by the end of 2013, <a href="http://blogs.mulesoft.org/raml-web-tooling-unleashed/">we'd see another API definition language emerge, this time from enterprise technology provider Mulesoft</a>, called <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. This new approach to defining APIs, would use YAML to produce a machine readable, yet human friendly way to describe APIs. Now we had four new ways to describe our APIs, and as we push into 2014, we have a wealth of tooling, services, and a selection of maturing API design editors to choose from when planning and designing our APIs.</p>
<p>I feel like we are just moving from infancy, into the toddler phase of communicating throughout the web API lifecycle. We now have several languages to choose from, we just have to work hard to educate people that they exist, help them become fluent, and expand the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">incentives for generating machine readable definitions for our APIs</a>. In the next year, I predict we will see an increased adoption of the leading API definition formats, new tooling and services that helps us design, deploy, manage, monetize, evangelize and integrate with APIs that are driving the API, and app economy--driven from a central, machine readable API definition.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/api-spark/restlet-apispark.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for common patterns that are working within the API space, and shine light on them, work to understand why they work, so that others can emulate these successful patterns in the space. One approach I&rsquo;ve seen work well, in many situations, is a combination of open source and a Platform as a Service (PaaS), and I&rsquo;m going to highlight the implementation of this model by one of the API Evangelist partners&mdash;<a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">Restlet / APISpark</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source For Developers</strong><br /> First and foremost, Restlet is an open source web API framework, that any developer can download, and install to deliver their own API. The community benefits from this, Restlet benefits from this&mdash;open source API tooling is a fundamental building block for all of this to work. Many companies feel that open sourcing their core platform is just giving away their intellectual property, when in reality many consumers of your software won&rsquo;t have the resources to implement on their own, and will still need consulting resources to get the solution off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS) For Everyone</strong><br /> If you want the power of Restlet, but don&rsquo;t have the time or resources to download and install, and you just want to get up and running with APIs, Restlet provides a PaaS version of Restlet, called APISpark.  Using APISpark, anyone can deploy an API from new or existing data or file stores--no coding resources necessary. APISpark is a natural companion for Restlet, providing an out-of-the-box web API framework, that anyone can put to use--providing a viable commercial layer built on top of the open source Restlet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Professional Services For Everything Else</strong><br /> Of course, at any stage of development, whether you are looking to put Restlet or APISpark to work, there are professional services to help you achieve your goals. The Restlet team provides professional services, commercial licensing, and other opportunities to get the skills and resources you need to make your API deployment successful. Since Restlet is open source, this isn&rsquo;t limited to the Restlet professional services team itself, a community has evolved around the Restlet platform, allowing for community options when looking for assistance with any API deployment.</p>
<p>I believe the Restlet business model is significant, and represents the future of the API economy. It makes sense to have your core technology be open source, and allow the community to benefit from the availability of open tooling, as well as the platform to benefit from community driven software development.  This model acknowledges that not every will have the time and resources to deploy on their own, and provides a PaaS version, as well as the required paid support necessary to find success with any API deployment.</p>
<p>Open API frameworks are essential to the success of the API economy, and Restlet is a better product because its source code is open. They have acknowledged that there is plenty of money to be made around the platform version of Restlet (APISpark), and professional services surrounding both platforms. I believe this formula is fundamental to the API economy working, and is something other API infrastructure should look to follow.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.nest.com/documentation/nest-api-intro"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/nest/nest-developer-program.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had several folks point me to the <a href="https://developer.nest.com/documentation/nest-api-intro">Nest API</a> release the other day. I enjoy this, because I&rsquo;m not always the fastest in finding news&mdash;eventually I&rsquo;ll find it, but I rely on my human API monitoring network, just as much as my algorithmic API monitoring network, to bring stories to my attention. I&rsquo;m still reviewing the Nest API release, but one thing that stood out to me, was how real-time is baked into the API by default, and specifically using <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>.</p>
<p>The Nest API documentation states:</p>
<blockquote><em>Use the official Firebase client libraries (Web, iOS, Java, and Node), which allow you to synchronize your data with a subscription-based, near-real time platform. As you develop your client, you'll find these resources useful: Firebase Data Structure, Reading and Writing data.</em></blockquote>
<p>Nest also provides options, if you can&rsquo;t use the Firebase library (not sure why this would be):</p>
<blockquote><em>In cases where the platform you're developing your integration on has no available Firebase library, you may want to use REST or REST Streaming instead.</em></blockquote>
<p>I track on <a href="http://bit.ly/11RorBM">real-time technology</a> like Firebase as part of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">API trends research</a>, and much like other trends like <a title="aggregation" href="http://bit.ly/11RojT4">aggregation</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/19Li6cS/">reciprocity</a>,&nbsp;I think we&rsquo;ll start seeing these trending layers baked into API operations by default. I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">APIs reference default API reciprocity, using platforms like Zapier</a>, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more APIs adopt real-time frameworks by default in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.firebase.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/firebase/firebase-logo.png" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API providers need to focus on what they do best, providing API access to their valuable data, content and other programmatic resources. It is wise for providers to leverage existing providers to deliver real-time, aggregation, reciprocity, <a href="http://bit.ly/10sgWQI">voice</a>, and other complimentary API layers. I will continue to keep my eye out for how APIs are providing a much fuller stack of resources for developers, using their own resources, while also augmenting with other leading technology platforms.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not at Google I/O this week, enjoying some downtime in SoCal, but I am watching some of the news coming out of the event. One thing I noticed, was the addition of monitoring to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developer Console</a>, where&nbsp;Google is slowly working their <a href="https://www.stackdriver.com">StackDriver acquisition</a> into their fast growing API driven, cloud development platform.</p>
<p>You have to request access to the new monitoring services, and Google will open up "Stackdriver's monitoring capabilities available to select Google Cloud trusted testers at no charge&rdquo;. Wile Stackdriver is about monitoring your cloud infrastructure, it also provides <a href="http://www.stackdriver.com/announcing-endpoint-monitoring/">granular level, API endpoint monitoring solutions</a> that you can use to monitor the health of the API resources you depend on in your apps.</p>
<p>When Google makes a move to support a specific feature across its world of APIs, I take notice. Much like when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/14/google-api-access-with-oauth-20/">Google adopted OAuth 2.0 across all APIs</a>, I think their move to provide monitoring services, is a sign that monitoring of the resources you depend is going mainstream--something all web, mobile and Iot API resource providers need to have in place by default in 2014.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about API design lately, the services and tooling coming from Apiary, RAML and Swagger, and wanted to explore some thoughts around what I would consider to be killer features for the killer API design editor.  Some of these thoughts are derived from the features I&rsquo;ve seen in Apiary and RAML editor, and most recently the Swagger Editor, but I&rsquo;d like to *riff* on a little bit and play with what could be the next generation of features.</p>
<p>While exploring my dream API design editor, I&rsquo;d like to walk through each group of features, organized around my indentations and objectives around my API designs.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong><br />When kicking off the API design process, I want to be able to jumpstart the API design lifecycle from multiple sources. There will be many times that I want to start from a clean slate, but many times I will be working from existing patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blank Canvas -</strong> I want to start with a blank canvas, no patterns to follow today, I&rsquo;m painting my masterpiece.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import Existing File -</strong> I have a loose API design file laying around, and I want to be able to open, import and get to work with it, in any of the formats.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Fork From Gallery </strong>- I want to fork one of my existing API designs, that I have stored in my API design taller (I will outline below).&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import From API Commons -</strong> Select an existing API design pattern from API Commons and import into editor, and API design gallery.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goals in getting started with API design, will be centered around re-use the best patterns across the API space, as well as my own individual or company API design gallery. We are already mimicking much of this behavior, we just don&rsquo;t have a central API design editor for managing these flows.</p>
<p><strong>Editing My API Design</strong><br />Now we get to the meat of the post, the editor. I have several things in mind when I&rsquo;m actually editing a single API definition, functions I want, actions I want to take around my API design. These are just a handful of the editor specific features I&rsquo;d love to see in my perfect API design editor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Lingual -</strong> I want my editor to word with API definitions in API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger. I prefer to edit my API designs in JSON, but I know many people I work with will prefer markdown or YAML based, and my editor needs to support fluid editing between all popular formats.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Internationalization - How will I deal with making my API resources available to developers around the world? Beyond API definition langugages, how do I actually make my interfaces accessible, and understood by consuers around the glob.e</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary - </strong>I will outline my thoughts around a central dictionary below, but I want my editor to pull from a common dictionary, providing a standardized language that I work from, as well as my company when designing interfaces, data models, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Annotation -</strong> I want to be able to annotate various aspects of my API designs and have associated notes, conversation around these elements of my design.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Highlight</strong> - Built in highlighting would be good to support annotations, but also just reference various layers of my API designs to highlighting during conversations with others, or even allowing the reverse engineer of my designs, complete with the notes and layers of the onions for others to follow.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Source View -</strong> A view of my API design that allows me to see the underlying markdown, YAML, or JSON and directly edit the underlying API definition language.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>GUI View - </strong>A visual view of my API design, allowing for adding, editing and removing elements in an easy GUI interface, no source view necessary for designing APIs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Interactive View -</strong> A rendered visual view of my API, allowing me to play with either my live API or generated mock API, through interactive documentation within my editors.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Save To Gallery -</strong> When I&rsquo;m done working with my API designs, all roads lead to saving it to my gallery, once saved to my working space I can decide to take other actions.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions -</strong> I want my editor to suggest the best patterns available to me from private and public sources. I shouldn't ever design my APIs in the dark.</li>
</ul>
<p>The API design editor should work like most IDE&rsquo;s we see today, but keep it simple, and reflect extensibility like <a href="https://atom.io/">GIthub&rsquo;s Atom editor</a>. My editor should give me full control over my API designs, and enable me to take action in many pre-defined or custom ways one could imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Action </strong> <br />My API designs represent the truth of my API, at any point within its lifecycle, from initial conception to deprecation. In my perfect editor I should be able to take meaningful actions around my API designs. For the purposes of this story I&rsquo;m going to group actions into some meaningful buckets, that reflect the expanding areas of the API lifecycle. You will notice the four areas below, reflect the primary areas I track on via API Evangelist.</p>
<p><strong>Design Actions</strong><br />Early on in my API lifecycle, while I&rsquo;m crafting new designs, I will need to take action around my designs. Designs actions will help me iterate on designs before I reach expensive deployment and management phases.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mock Interface - </strong>With each of my API designs I will need to generate mock interfaces that I can use to play with what my API will deliver. I will also need to share this URL with other stakeholders, so that they can play with, and provide feedback on my API interface.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Copy / Paste - </strong>API designs will evolve and branch out into other areas. I need to be able to copy / paste or fork my API designs, and my editor, and API gallery should keep track of these iterations so I don&rsquo;t have to. The API space essentially copy and pastes common patterns, we just don&rsquo;t have a formal way of doing it currently.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Email Share - </strong>I want to easily share my API designs via email with other key stakeholders that will be part of the API lifecycle. Ideally I wouldn&rsquo;t be emailing around the designs themselves, just pointers to the designs and tools for interacting within the lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Social Share - </strong>Sometimes the API design process all occur over common social networks, and in some cases be very public. I want to be able to easily share all my API designs via my most used social networks like Github, Twitter and LinkedIn.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration - </strong>API design should not be done in isolation, and should be a collaborative process with all key stockholders. I would like to to even have <a href="http://etherpad.org/">Etherpad style real-time interactions</a> around the design process with other users.</li>
</ul>
<p>API design actions are the first stop, in the expanding API design lifecycle. Being able to easily generate mocks, share my interfaces and collaborate with other stakeholders. Allowing me to quickly, seamlessly take action throughout the early design cycles will save me money, time and resources early on&mdash;something that only become more costly and restrictive later on in the lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment Actions </strong><br />Next station in the API design lifecycle, is being able to deploy APIs from my designs. Each of the existing API definition formats provide API deployment solutions, and with the evolution in cloud computing, we are seeing even more complete, modular ways to take action around your API designs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - With each of my API designs, I should be able to generate server side code in the languages that I use most. I should be able to register specific frameworks, languages, and other defining aspects of my API server code, then generate the code and make available for download, or publish using Github and FTP.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong> - Cloud computing has matured, producing a new way of deploying very modular architectural resources, giving rise to a new cloud movement, being called containers.  Container virtualization will do for APIs, what APIs have done for companies in the last 14 years. Containers provide a very defined, self-contained way of deploying APIs from API design blueprints, ushering a new ay of deploy API resources in coming years.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need help to deploy my APIs, and with container solutions like <a href="http://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, I should have predefined packages I can configure with my API designs, and deploy using popular container solutions from Google, Amazon, or other coud provider.</p>
<p><strong>Management Actions </strong><br />After I deploy an API I will need to use my API definitions as a guide for an increasing number of areas of my management process, not just the technical, but the business and politics of my API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Generating of interactive API documentation is what kicked off the popularity of API design, and importance of API definitions. Swagger provider the Swagger UI, and interactive, hands-on way of learning about what an API offered, but this wasn&rsquo;t the only motivation&mdash;providing up to date documentation as well, added just the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">incentives API providers needed to generate machine readable documentation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> - Second to API documentation, providing code samples, libraries, and SDKS is one of the best ways you can eliminate friction when on boarding new API users. API definitions provide a machine readable set of instructions, for generating the code that is necessary throughout the API management portion of the API lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - JavaScript provides a very meaningful way to demonstrate the value of APis, and embeddable JavaScript should always be part of the API lifecycle. Machine readable API definitions can easily generate visualizations that can be used in documentation, and other aspects of the API lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>I predict, with the increased adoption of machine readable API formats like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, we will see more layers of the API management process be expanded on, further automating how we manage APis.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery Actions </strong><br />Having your APIs found, and being able to find the right API design for integration, are two sides of an essential coin in the API lifecycle. We are just now beginning to get a handle on what is need when it comes to API discovery.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> - </strong>I should be able to organize API designs into groupings, and publish an APIs.json file for these groups. API designs should be able to be organized in multiple groups, organized by domain and sub-domain.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a> -</strong> Thanks to Oracle, the copyright of API of API definitions will be part of the API lifecycle. I want the ability to manage and publish all of my designs to the API Commons, or any other commons for sharing of API designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The discovery of APIs has long been a problem, but is just now reaching the critical point where we have to start develop solutions for not just finding APIs, but also understanding what they offer, and the details of of the interface, so we can make sense of not just the technical, but business and political decisions around API driven resources.</p>
<p><strong>Integration Actions</strong><br /> Flipping from providing APIs to consuming APIs, I envision a world where I can take actions around my API designs, that focus on the availability, and integration of valuable API driven resources.  As an API provider, I need as much as assistance as I can, to look at my APIs from an external perspective, and being able to take action in this area will grow increasingly important.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Using my machine readable API definitions, I should be able to publish testing definitions, that allow the execution of common API testing patterns. I&rsquo;d love to see providers like SmartBear, Runscope, APITools, and API Metrics offer services around the import of API design generated definitions.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Just like API testing, I want to be able to generate definition that allow for the monitoring of API endpoints. My API monitoring tooling should allow for me to generate standard monitoring definitions, and import and run them in my API monitoring solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that API integration is the fastest growing area of the AP space, second only to API design itself. Understanding how an API operates, from an integrators perspective is valuable, not just to the integrator, but also the provider. I need to be thinking about integration issues early on in the API design lifecyle to minimize costly changes downstream.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Actions</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ve laid out some of the essential actions I&rsquo;d like to be able to take around my API definitions, throughout the API lifecycle. I expect the most amount of extensibility from my API design editor, in the future, and should be able to extend in any way that I need.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Links</strong> - I need a dead simple way to take an API design, and publish to a single URL, from within my editor. This approach provides the minimum amount of extensibility I will need in the API design lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - I will need to run JavaScript that I write against all of my API designs, generating specific results that I will need throughout the API design process. My editor should allow me to write, store and execute JavaScript against all my API designs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Marketplace</strong> - There should be a marketplace to find other custom actions I can take against my API designs. I want a way to publish my API actions to the marketplace, as well as browse other API actions, and add them to my own library.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve reached a point where using API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger are common place, and being able to innovate around what actions we take throughout the API design lifecycle will be critical to the space moving forward, and how companies take action around their own APIs.</p>
<p><strong>API Design Gallery</strong><br /> In my editor, I need a central location to store and manage all of my API designs. I&rsquo;m calling this a gallery, because I do not want it only to be a closed off repository of designs, I want to encourage collaboration, and even public sharing of common API design patterns. I see several key API editor features I will need in my API design gallery.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - I need to be able to search for API designs, based upon their content, as well as other meta data I assign to my designs. I should be able to easily expose my search criteria, and assist potential API consumers in finding my API designs as well.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import</strong> - I should be able to import any API design from a local file, or provide a public URL and generate local copy of any API design. Many of my Api designs will be generated from an import of existing definition.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong> - I want the API editor of the future to track all versioning of my API designs. Much like managing the code around  my API, I need the interface definitions to be versioned, and the standard feature set for managing this process.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong> - I will be working on many API designs, will various stakeholders in the success of any API design. I need a set of features in my API design editor to help me manage multiple groups, and their access to my API designs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Domains</strong> - Much like the Internet itself, I need to organize my APIs by domain. I have numerous domains which I manage different groups of API resources. Generally I publish all of my API portals to Github under a specific domain, or sub-domain&mdash;I would like this level of control in my API design editor.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Github plays a central role in my API design lifecycle. I need my API design editor to help me manage everything, via public and private Github repository. Using the Github API, my API design editor should be able to store all relevant data on Github&mdash;seamlessly.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>Diff</strong> - What are the differences between my API designs? I would like to understand the difference between each of my API resource types, and versions of each API designs. It might be nice if I could see the difference between my API designs, and other public APIs I might consider as competitors.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong> - The majority of my API designs will be public, but this won&rsquo;t be the case with every designer. API designers should have the control over whether or not their API designs are public or private.</li>
</ul>
<p>My API design gallery will be the central place i work from. Once I reach a critical mass of designs, I will have many of the patterns I need to design, deploy and manage my APIs. It will be important for me to have access to import the best patterns from public repositories like API Commons. To evolve as an API designer, I need to easily create, store, and evolve my own API designs, while also being influenced by the best patterns available in the public domain.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable Gallery </strong><br />Simple visualization can be an effective tool in helping demonstrate the value an API delivers. I want to be able to manage open, API driven visualizations, using platforms like D3.js. I need an arsenal of embeddable, API driven visualizations to help tell the store of the API resources I provide, give me a gallery to manage them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - I want to be able to search the meta data around the API embeddable tools I develop. I will have a wealth of graphs, charts, and more functional, JavaScript widgets I generate.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> - Give me a way to group, and organize my embeddable tools. I want to be able to organize, group and share my embeddable tools, not just for my needs, but potentially to the public as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words, and being able to easily generate interactive visualizations, driven by API resources, that can be embedded anywhere is critical to my storytelling process. I will use embeddable tools to tell the story of my API, but my API consumers will also use these visualizations as part of their efforts, and hopefully develop their own as well.</p>
<p><strong>API Dictionary </strong><br />I need a common dictionary to work from when designing my APIs. I need to use consistent interface names, field names, parameters, headers, media types, and other definitions that will assist me in providing the best API experience possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - My dictionary should be available to me in any area of my API design editor, and in true IDE style, while I&rsquo;m designing. Search of my dictionary, will be essential to my API design work, but also to the groups that I work with.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Schema.org </strong>- There are plenty of existing patterns to follow when defining my APIs, and my editor should always assist me in adopting, and reusing any existing pattern I determine as relevant to my API design lifecycle, like <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Dublin Core</strong> - How do I define the metadata surrounding my API designs? My editor should assist me to use common metadata patterns available like <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Media Types</strong> - The results of my API should conform to existing document representations, when possible. Being able to explore the existing media types available while designing my API would help me emulate existing patterns, rather than reinventing the wheel each time I design an API.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Custom</strong> - My dictionary should be able to be driven by existing definitions, or allow me to import and and define my own vocabulary based upon my operations. I want to extend my dictionary to meet the unique demands of my API design lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want my API design process to be driven by a common dictionary that fits my unique needs, but borrows from the best patterns already available in the public space. We already emulate many of the common patterns we come across, we just don&rsquo;t have any common dictionary to work from, enforcing healthy design via my editor.</p>
<p><strong>An Editor For Just My Own API Design Process</strong> <br />This story has evolved over the last two weeks, as I spent time in San Francisco, discussing API design, then spending a great deal of time driving, and thinking about the API design lifecycle. This is all part of my research into the expanding world of <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design</a>, which will result in a white paper soon, and my intent is to just shed some light on what might be some of the future <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks of the API design space</a>.  My thoughts are very much based in my own selfish API design needs, but based upon what i&rsquo;m seeing in the growing API design space.</p>
<p><strong>An Editor For A Collective API Design Process </strong><br />With this story, I intend to help keep the API design process a collaborative, and when relevant a public affair. I want to ensure we work from existing patterns that are defined in the space, and as we iterative and evolve APIs, we collectively share our best patterns. You should not just be proud of your API designs, and willing to share publicly, you should demonstrate the due diligence that went into your design, attribute the patterns you used to contribute to your designs, and share back your own interpretation&mdash;encouraging re-use and sharing further downstream.</p>
<p><strong>What Features Would Be Part of Your Perfect API Design Editor</strong> <br />This is my vision around the future of API design, and what I&rsquo;d like to have in my editor&mdash;what is yours? What do you need as part of your API design process? Are API definitions part of the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; in your API lifecycle? I&rsquo;d love to hear what tools and services you think should be made available, to assist us in designing our APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Swift-Federal-Data-SDK"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/images/logos/labor.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It is a common theme, that government of any kind, especially the US federal government is too slow when it comes to adopting new technology. While this may be a popular meme for anti-government crusaders, and is true in many areas of government, there are growing pockets of resistance across federal agencies, who are not just keeping up with the latest technology, but they are leading.</p>
<p>An example of this is out of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a> (DOL), with their new <a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Swift-Federal-Data-SDK">Swift Federal Data SDK</a>, which provides a powerful SDK that allows you to work with multiple federal government data APIs, using the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift programming language</a>. Swift is only a couple weeks old, and DOL didn't miss a beat in getting a new SDK published on Github for developers to take advantage of.</p>
<p>In my opinion, we can no longer use the tired old meme, that government is just too slow to adopt new technology. There are an increasing number of examples out there that prove otherwise. In the future when you want to criticize an agency for being to slow in their adoption of tech, don&rsquo;t tell the same old tired story&mdash;point to examples like what DOL and <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> are up to, and incentivize the agencies to change in a positive way.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/multiple-types-of-apisjson-for-discovery/">Multiple Types of APIs.json For Discovery</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working through thoughts around a suggestion for future versions of&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json API discovery format</a>, and as I do with other things I&rsquo;m trying to make sense of, I wanted to write a blog post on API Evangelist. If you aren't familiar with the format, APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable JSON file that provides an overview and listing APIs available within a specific domain.</p>
<p><strong>Authoritative APIs.json</strong><br /> This is an APIs.json that is made available in the root of a domain, that is providing detail on an API that is managed within the same domain. This use case is for API providers to list the APIs that they offer publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Tribute APIs.json</strong><br /> There is an API you use, and want to see it indexed in an API search engine like APIs.io&mdash;so you create a tribute APIs.json. This APIs.json index is not done by the owner of the API, but by a fan, or outside contributor. Tributes will weave together the world of APIs, when providers do not have the time.</p>
<p><strong>Facade APIs.json</strong><br /> There is an API you use, but doesn&rsquo;t have exactly the interface you would want. Some resourceful API architects will be building facades to existing, external API resources. In the API economy you do not settle if an API isn't exactly what you need. The remix able nature of APIs allow for extending by designing facades that transform and extend existing API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Cache APIs.json</strong><br /> If I learned anything working in the federal government last year, it is that APIs can go away at any point. In the future there will be a need for cached versions of existing APIs, providing redundancy and access to some important data and content.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate APIs.json</strong><br /> In fast growing areas of the API economy, we are seeing API aggregation trends, with sectors like social, media, cloud, financial, analytics, and other areas that have matured, and users are depending on potentially multiple API platforms.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Derived APIs.json</strong><br /> I envision derived APis as just an evolution of tribute or facade, stating that I started with a certain API design, but have evolved it beyond what it once was. Not acknowledging where we got our API patterns is a darker side of the API space that needs to go away&mdash;let&rsquo;s be honest about where we learned our patterns and give a nod to these sources.</p>
<p>In the API economy, I think there will be multiple types of APIs that are deployed. As APIs proliferate, if the industry focuses on interoperability and reuse, there will be more types of APIs than the single API provider and APIs.json will help us keep tabs on this.</p>
<p>Not all API providers will have time, desire and the access to resources to publish their APIs.json, and the augmentation, replication and other possible derivatives that will emerge to organically expand on existing patterns.</p>
<p>Right now we are working on just stabilizing the latest release of APIs.json, so that people can get to work on publishing their own APIs.json. My goal with these thoughts is to just explore what is possible, and maybe, if successful some of these thoughts will be incorporated in future versions.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.apitools.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-tools/api-tools-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a>, the cloud-based API integration services is raising the bar for the space by <a href="https://docs.apitools.com/2014/06/11/announcing-apitools-on-premise-with-open-source-release.html">introducing an open source, on-premise version of their API monitoring service</a>. APITools only launched this year, and because of consumer demands, they moved up the timeframe for open sourcing the platform, which was already on the roadmap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say after <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">API integration</a> services and tooling, for testing, monitoring, and transforming API calls is one of the fastest growing segments of the API space. We are seeing solid solutions from <a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a>, <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>, <a href="http://www.therightapi.com/">TheRightAPI</a>, <a href="http://nomos-software.com/">Nomos Software,</a> and from API pioneer John Musser, with <a href="https://www.apiscience.com/">API Science</a>, but APITools is definitely raising the stakes with open sourcing theirs offering.</p>
<p>The world of API integration service and tooling is rapidly expanding, and only time will tell whether developers prefer running in the cloud, or on-premise, and what features they are looking for, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">something I've been documenting as I study what each of the companies offer</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect, that along with other API design, deployment, and management tools we'll need a mix of freemium, open tiers, on-premise, and enterprise API integration services and tooling, to meet the demands of this fast growing segment that overlaps with both providing and consuming APIs.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> APITools is a 3Scale service, and 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently reviewed a new API initiative from the Food &amp; Drug Administration, called <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">OpenFDA</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">I gave a whole list of things that they did right when launching the API</a>, but one item that I thought was particularly interesting, was the actual interactive documentation for the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/">Drugs API endpoint</a>.</p>
<p>I talk a lot about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/21/interactive-api-documentation-with-swagger/">interactive documentation for APIs</a>, something that has become commonplace, and a building block that developers are starting to expect. What is different about the OpenFDA Drug API, is that the interactive documentation provides a visual interface for building API calls, going beyond the interactive, and often very form based documentation that is commonly seen in other developer areas.</p>
<p>Via the OpenFDA Drug API documentation you can actually build an API query by selecting from radio button values, which then updates the resulting URL query, some summary text, and generates a graph visualization of the resulting query. After building your filter, you can run the API query, and see the request and response, which is a common feature other interactive API documentation implementations.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-endpoint-visualization.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>The addition of a visualization, that is driven by each endpoint is very interesting, and something I&rsquo;d like to see baked into the DNA of interactive API documentation.  Helping me build an API call, visualize and understand the value contained within an API has huge potential. Currently we have Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML generated interactive documentation solution, which are pretty similar&mdash;I&rsquo;d love to see more visualizations integrated into future interactive documentation implementations.</p>
