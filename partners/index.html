<h1>API Evangelist Partners</h1>
<p>API Evangelist exists because of its partners. Without them I wouldn't be able to do the research I do, focus on the important issues like API copyright, and other critical aspects of the API industry.</p>
<h2>Soul Partner</h2>
<p>The one partner that sees the space as I do, and has been key to the last 2 years of operations at API Evangelist.</p>

<h2>Brand Partners</h2>
<p>These are the select partners I'm happy to showcase alongside the API Evangelist brand, and I give them my time and energy for monthly financial support.</p>
