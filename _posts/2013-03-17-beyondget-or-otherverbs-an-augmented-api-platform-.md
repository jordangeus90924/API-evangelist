{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have a idea for a new API platform.Since I do not have any startup aspirations, I prefer setting my ideas free, for anyone to use, instead of acting on them myself.This idea is an evolution from an earlier one, which I had while working with the CityGrid API, called “augmented places”. While at CityGrid I constantly had people asking if they could submit data back to the API.Stating they had a better list of pizza places in Brooklyn or vegan restaurants in Santa Cruz.</p>
