<p>It has taken me a while to respond to a post I read this weekend, by Mike Caulfield (<a href="https://twitter.com/holden">@holden</a>) called <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/01/03/revenge-of-the-os/">Revenge of the OS</a>. In short he points out the fragment world we live in with all of our apps, and the shortcoming of tech companies to actually deliver a solution that truly works for end-users.</p>
<p>Our desktop computer has always been the doorway to our digital worlds, and then came the Internet, and the Web 2.0 age where iGoogle (now dead), Facebook Apps (how many apps do you use these days), and other &ldquo;mega-services&rdquo; promised to be the doorway to our now online digital worlds.</p>
<p>Mike talks about how his daughter, who 4 years ago depended on Facebook to access her world, now &ldquo;moves fluidly between Tumblr, Snapchat, Instagram, and Vine accounts, with the notifications panel her point of integration&rdquo;. Our devices have become the doorway to our online, digital lives.</p>
<p>All of this is the result of tech companies, driven by their VC overlords, pushing to become the point of control for user identity and the pipes in which that users data flows&mdash;-at all costs! Sure these companies pay lip service to the interoperability that could fix this and employ OpenID, oAuth and use APIs, but without true investment and an honest belief in interoperability with other platforms, even competitors, it all means absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>The tech giants have the power to lead, come together and establish strong openID or oAuth alliances, strengthening tools, simplifying user experience, but they don&rsquo;t. Innovative startups like <a href="http://oauth.io">oAuth.io</a> from Webshell, and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> are left to do the heavy lifting, and the user is still left with a fragmented, cumbersome experience as they jump from cloud to cloud, across potentially several devices like smart phone, laptop, xBox, and tablets.</p>
<p>This world is only going to get worse, tech companies of all sizes show very little interest in truly working together. Sure, there are anomalies, and every has their own APIs, but there are no meaningful API standards, very little sharing of API interface designs and no investment in common identity approaches and tooling.</p>
<p>This insanity will grow exponentially defined by the number of internet connected devices that we adopt, including phones and tablets, but is being extended to our cars, homes, clothing, glasses and much, much more.</p>

<p>Building on my thoughts around <a title="preparing your API for wholesale access" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/09/is-your-api-ready-for-wholesale/">preparing your API for wholesale access</a>, I&rsquo;m thinking through the problem of developer API access when you have API providers offering up each others APIs, and bundling them seamlessly as part of their own API stack.</p>
<p>In this scenario I&rsquo;m working through, API provider A has an API they offer up wholesale to partners, and API provider B wants to bundle API provider A&rsquo;s API along with their own, adding value to their API and developer community.</p>
<p>In this scenario API provider B doesn&rsquo;t want their developers to have to sign up for a separate API key with API provider A, the developer should just have to create one account and use one key for their application.</p>
<p>To make this seamless, both API providers need to have their own APIs for their API management system, allowing users and keys to be provisioned programmatically. All API provider A needs to do is create a service tier for their wholesale partners to have access to account and application provisioning, so their partners can seamlessly generate new accounts for their new developer accounts and switch API keys when developers uses the wholesale API.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just an academic exercise. It is possible when your <a title="API management infrastructure has an API like 3Scale provides their customers" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API management infrastructure has an API like 3Scale provides their customers</a>. I just think API providers aren&rsquo;t thinking at this level yet, and thinking about how the future of how their APIs will be consumed in the future, and the potential of sharing users with their API partners.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep exploring the various elements needed to make your API available in a wholesale way. Having an <a title="API for your API management infrastructure" href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/activedocs#/account_management_api">API for your API management infrastructure</a> is definitely essential, and next I will be looking at having a machine readable API definition, and permissible terms of service (TOS).</p>

<p>As the number of public APIs grows well beyond 10K, expecting that developers will discover, let alone come to your developers area regulary will be reduced to just a fantasy. In this new API driven economy, your API will need to be decoupled, portable, and available in a wholesale manner, allowing other API providers to hang your valuable API resources in their own developers area.</p>
<p>If your API is developed in a simple, standard way, described using a common API definition format like Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML, your account provisioning and management has an API, and terms of service (TOS) are flexible--you will be bundled with leading API platforms, available in the growing number of backend as a service (BaaS) platforms, and easily listed in API hubs like Mashape and APIHub.</p>
<p>In 2014 it won&rsquo;t be enough to just have an API and a developer area with all the <a title="essential API building block" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">essential building blocks</a>, you need to make sure your API is ready for re-use and re-sale. Sure we all want to be the Twilio of the API universe, but in reality we need developers to use our resources. Of course this approach to API deployment won&rsquo;t be for every API, some resources just can&rsquo;t be resold like this, but for many of the API resources I&rsquo;m seeing in the space, it will be the difference between life or death.</p>

<p>Currently the timestamps look like: <em>9/20/2013 12:45:07 AM</em></p>
<p>After the switch to UTC they will look like: <em>2010-11-12T13:14:15Z</em></p>
<p>Formatted according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 standard</a>. This is a much cleaner, internationalized approach. I&rsquo;ve seen this mistake a lot, and still do it myself on some new systems. As an self-centered american, we tend to think the world evolves around us, and we don&rsquo;t think about these scaling issues ahead of time.</p>
<p>Are your API data formats in UTC? No? Maybe it is something you want to change before you grow too big and get too many developers on your API.</p>

<p>I stopped counting the number of successful applications that have had their private APIs reversed engineered by some savvy users,&nbsp;<a title="Snapchat API reverse engineered" href="http://apivoice.com/2014/01/08/are-your-api-security-practices-in-better-shape-than-the-snapchat-api/">Most recently Snapchat</a>, and famously the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/">original rogue Instagram API</a> was developed this way, and even auto maker <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/forum/forums/flaws-rest-api-authentication">Tesla had their API reverse engineered</a>.</p>
<p>This is fresh on my my mind because of the <a title="Snapchat security breach" href="http://apivoice.com/2014/01/08/are-your-api-security-practices-in-better-shape-than-the-snapchat-api/">Snapchat security breach</a>, in which this savvy tech user notified Snapchat back in August, and the company instituted rate limiting, but still left the API exposed for further attack, which the user took full advantage of in December by scraping all users after documenting and expoiting the private API.</p>
<p>If you are developing a mobile application, you are building an API. Even if you never intend on making this API public, there are huge benefits of going through the motions of pretending like it is&mdash;you will learn a lot! Every application API I&rsquo;ve seen reverse engineered was clearly developed in a rush, thinking that security through obscurity was a solid production strategy.</p>
<p>When you are planning your apps API, stop! Consider what you will need to make this publicly available. The exercise is healthy. Allow for registration of developers and apps, even if it will just be your team signing up. Put in place rate limits, analytics, etc. There are a ton of features that have evolved in the public API space that are transferrable to private APIs.</p>
<p><a title="API Infrastructure Providers" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API infrastructure providers like 3Scale</a> have been working at this for years. You can sign up for a free account, get started without any extra work from your dev team, and you can save any resources for making sure you monitor your API stats on a daily basis and responding to not just security threats, but find tuning how your apps are using your own API.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make the mistake that the Snapchat, Instagram and Teslas of the world have made. Treat your API like it is public, even if you never intend to open it up publicly. You will think differently and be ahead of the curve when it comes to monitoring and security.</p>

<p>If you weren't following the news over the holidays, a rogue group released <a href="http://www.snapchatdb.info/">SnapchatDB</a>, containing the 4.6 million <a title="snapchat" href="http://www.snapchat.com/" target="_blank">Snapchat</a> user profiles, after exploiting the poorly secured mobile application API.</p>
<p>There are opposing views of what's happened, but apparently the group contacted Snapchat in August 2013 letting them know of a potential vulnerability in their API, in which Snapchat claims they responded by instituting rate limiting to address the problem.</p>
<p>Apparently the actual vulnerability wasn't addressed, and in December the group mapped the private API, the company uses for their mobile app. They don't officially have an API, but like most mobile applications, it is right beneath the surface.</p>
<p>After mapping the interface the group proceeded to suck all the data, organized and publish as SnapchatDB, in an effort to raise awareness of the issue and point out that Snapchat was to slow in responding to the exploit.</p>
<p>Regardless of the exact facts, it is clear that Snapchat was lax on security. API rate limiting and other common security measures are pretty common place. <a title="API infrastructure provider" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API providers like 3Scale have been around for years delivering plug and play infrastructure</a> to help you deal with this. There is no reason to be caught with your pants down.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter whether your API is public, private or just for partners, you need to have your security practices tight. You owe it to your users and developers.</p>

<p>After watching the API space evolve, I've learned one thing, that there are lots of factors that influence the industry, and that the best solution doesn't always win.</p>
<p>As I'm studying the rise of Internet enabled devices, also known as Internet of Things (IoT), you see some devices embrace a RESTful approach to integration with their devices, but often times you see APIs released, but they are wrapped with SDKs.</p>
<p>I'm not making any assumption that SDKs or REST is better when it comes to IoT devices, technically an SDK may or may not provide a stronger solution. However within this approach I think it is easy to pave over the API, making it an after thought--stifling potential innovation that can occur around open endpoints.</p>
<p>When it comes to developing APIs for IoT I don't think engineers are consciously pushing out REST and web APIs, I think they stick with what they know. Without proper education around the larger potential of APIs + SDK, vs SDK only, engineers with go the path of least resistance, and the one they are familiar with.</p>
<p>As the space expands, we need to make sure there are sufficient stories available for IoT engineers to discover, making them aware of the potential of keeping their APIs front and center when integrating their devices to the Internet.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/what-is-a-hypermedia-api/">What Is A Hypermedia API?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hypermedia.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>The time has come. In 2014 I will be spending a lot more energy, helping you understand what a Hypermedia API is, and if you should be considering it as part of your own API strategy. I won&rsquo;t be in the business of telling you Hypermedia is always the answer, or that it is bad, I will be working to better understand myself, and along the way hopefully I can share some knowledge with you.</p>
<p>As I do with other technical issues that surround APIs, I will work to simplify, to help reach a wider audience, beyond the development community. If you are a developer and looking to understand Hypermedia APIs I recommend Googling, and exploring other resources (there are plenty). I want to help business leaders understand the potential, not sell developers on the concept.</p>
<p>In my mind, there are two key things that make hypermedia APIs different from common web APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Shared, common way that developers can communicate with the API</li>
<li>Guiding developers with what actions they can take along the way</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of other differentiators, but these are the two that stand out to me. So let&rsquo;s apply. Say you have a product API. A common web API approach might be to return a product, in a JSON format, which will probably be just a list of fields from the database where the products are stored, with the JSON structured in a way that makes sense to you and your development team. It is now up to the developer to interpret how the API responses are structured, and how to integrate into their application. Pretty standard stuff, right?</p>
<p>Now with a Hypermedia API, the API will use a registered media type such as&nbsp;<a title="HAL" href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Collection-JSON" href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/">Collection-JSON</a>, providing a common framework for developers to communicate with the API&mdash;reducing the unknowns in API integration. With the product request, you will get get the same details on the product, but along with the product details you will also get a list of links, providing key insight into what you can actually do with the products returned.</p>
<p>Providing developers with a common way to understand how to communicate with an API, as well as the actions they can take with resources that are available via an API, will increase the chances an API will get used, as well as ensure that the APIs is used in ways that are in alignment with the API providers overall business goals.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions about Hypermedia APIs, let me know, I&rsquo;m happy to address particular topics as I explore this fascinating area of APIs.</p>

<p>I was doing some research in the area of harvesting and scraping APs. I was taking another look at <a href="http://webscrapemaster.com/" target="_blank">Web Scrape Master</a>, a simple scraping API that allows you to pass it a URL and it harvests structured data and content from the page.</p>
<p>The Web Scrape Master is a pretty dead simple API, with a purpose. It does one thing and it does it well. What I found really interesting though, was the fact that lower on the page, below the API documentation the API was for sale. You could buy a copy of the server side of the API and client side tooling as a bundle.</p>
<p>It is a pretty interesting approach, especially for these utility style APIs. You can either use the API provided as a service or you can download, install and use it within your own infrastructure, adding the API to your own stack.</p>
<p>While this isn't possible for all APIs, I think it has promise for many API providers, delivering a sort of on-premise version of their API. I'm getting in the habit of publishing server side code for many of my API designs, I'm will consider some APIs for possible sale in the future as well.</p>
<p>When you think about the growth of containers like <a title="Docker" href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a> and the PaaS solutions like <a title="OpenShift" href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a>, it makes the possibility of rapidly deployment of utility APIs much more of a reality.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">What Is Next For The US Government API Strategy</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Building-a-21st-century-platform-to-better-serve-the-american-people-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was asked to provides some thoughts on what is next for the US Government API strategy.  I've been thinking about it during my work and travels over the last couple months, and I keep coming back to one thought:&nbsp;<strong>Strengthen What We Have!</strong></p>
<p>I wish I had some new technology or platform for the next wave of government APIs that would ensure success with APIs in Washington, but in reality we need to do what we've been doing, but do it at scale, and get organized and collaborative about how we do it.</p>
<p><strong>Release More Data Sets</strong><br /> There are thousands of data sets available via <a href="http://data.gov">Data.gov</a>, across 176 agencies and numerous categories. We need more. When any content or data is published via a government website, that data needs to also made available via agencies data repositories and Data.gov. Agencies need to understand that releasing open data sets it not something you do every once in a while to meet a mandate or deadline--it is something you do always, forever.</p>
<p><strong>Refine Existing Data Sets</strong><br /> There is a lot of data available currently. However much of it is in various formats, inconsistent data models and isn't always immediately available for use in spreadsheets, applications, visualizations or analysis. There is a great deal of work to be done in cleaning, normalizing and refining of existing data, as well as deploying APIs around open data that would increase adoption and the chances it will be put to use.</p>
<p><strong>Refine Existing APIs</strong><br /> Like open data, there are many existing APIs across the federal government, and these APis could use a lot of work to make them more usable by developers. With a little elbow grease, existing APIs could be standardized by generating common API definitions like Swagger, API blueprint and RAML, which would help quantify all APIs, but also generate interactive documentation, code samples and provide valuable discovery tools for helping understand where interfaces are and what they offer. The mission up until now for agencies is to deploy APIs, and while this remains true, the need to evolve and refine APIs will go a long way towards building those valuable case studies to get to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Robust /developer Areas</strong><br /> There are over 50 agencies who have successful launched a /developer area to support open data and API efforts. Much like open data and the APIs themselves, they represent a mishmash of approaches, and provide varied amounts of resources and necessary support materials. <a href="http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government">HowTo.gov already provides some great information on how to evolve an agencies developer area</a>, we just need some serious attention spent on helping each agency make it so. It doesn't matter how valuable the open data or APIs are, if they are published without proper documentation, support and communication resources, they won't be successful. Robust developer areas are essential to federal agencies finding success in their API iniatives.</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated Evangelist</strong><br /> Every successful API initiative in the private sector from Amazon to Twilio has employed evangelists to spread the word and engage developers, helping them achieve success in putting API resources to use. Each federal agency needs their own evangelist, to help work with internal stakeholders, making sure open data is published regularly, new APIs are deployed and existing resources are kept operational and up to date. Evangelists should have counterparts at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp">OSTP</a> / <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb">OMB</a> / <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/">GSA</a> levels providing feedback and guidance, as well as regular engagement with evangelists in the private sector. Evangelism is the glue that will hold things together across agency, as well as provide the critical outreach to the private sector to increase adoption of government open data and APis.</p>
<p><strong>Build Public / Private Sector Partnerships</strong><br /> Opening up data and APIs by the federal government is about sharing the load with the private sector and the public at large. Open data and APIs represents the resources the private sector will need to build applications, sites, fuel industry growth, and stimulate job creation. A new type of public / private sector partnerships need to be defined, allowing for companies and non-profit groups to access and use government services and resources in a self-service, scalable way. Companies should be able to build businesses around government Internet services, much like the <a title="ecosystem that has grown from the IRS e-File system" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint">ecosystem that has grown from the IRS e-File system</a>, with applications like TurboTax that reaches millions of US citizens and allows corporations to help government share the load while also generating necessary revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Establish The Meaningful Case Studies</strong><br /> When it comes to open data and APIs nothing gets people on board more than solid examples of successfel applications that have been build on open data, APIs. Open government proponents use weather data and GPS as solid examples of open data and technology impacting not just government, but also the private sector. We need to fold the IRS e-file ecosystem into this lineage, but also work towards establishing numerous other case studies we can showcase and tell stories about why open data and APIs are important--in ways that truly matter to everyone, not just tech folks.</p>
<p><strong>Educate &amp; Tell Stories Within Government</strong><br /> In order to take open data and APIs to the next level in government there needs to an organized and massive effort to educate people within government about the opportunities around open data and APis, as well as the pitfalls. Regular efforts to educate people within government about the technology, business and politics of APIs needs to be scaled, weaving in relevant stories and case studies as they emerge around open data and APIs. Without regular, consistent education efforts and sharing of success stories across agencies, open data and APIs will never become part of our federal government DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire &amp; Tell Stories Outside Government</strong><br /> As within government, the stories around government open data and APIs needs to be told outside the Washington echo chamber, educating citizens and companies about the availability of open data and APIs, and inspire them to take action by sharing successful stories of other uses of open data and APIs in development of applications.  The potential of using popular platforms like Amazon and Twitter spread through the word of mouth amongst developer and power user communities, the same path needs to be taken with government data and api resources.</p>
<p>The next 2-3 years of the API strategy for the US government will be about good ol fashioned hard work, collaboration and storytelling.  We have  blueprints for what agencies should be doing when it comes to opening up data, deploying APIs and enticing the private sector to innovate around government data, we just need to repeat and scale until we reach the next level.</p>
<p>How do we know when we've reached the next level? When the potential of open data and APIs is understand across all agencies, and the public instinctively knows that you can go to any government domain /developer, and find the resources they need, whether they are individual or a company looking to develop a business around government services.</p>
<p>The only way we will get here is by achieving a solid group of strong case studies showing that we are making change in government using open data and APIs. Think of the IRS e-file system, and how many citizens this ecosystem reaches, and the value generated through commercial partnerships with tax professionals. We need 10-25 of similar stories of how APIs impact people's lives, strengthened the economy and has made government more efficient, before we consider getting to the next level.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/open-platform" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/guardian/guardian-open-platform.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Major newspapers having APIs is nothing new. We've heard stories out of the Guardian, New York Times and USA Today having APIs, but after several years where are these API initiatives headed? What is next? Is there innovation going on in the area journalism when it comes to APIs?</p>
<p>This dive into the world of journalism will take some time, but I will start with what I consider to be the leader, <a title="The Guardian Open Platform" href="http://www.theguardian.com/open-platform">The Guardian Open Platform</a>. The UK paper has all the essential <a title="building blocks I would want in an API provider" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks I would want in an API provider</a>, starting with a clean overview and getting started pages to get developers and data journalists up to speed.</p>
<p>The Guardian Open Platform revolves around two API resource, the Content API and Politics API and a vast data store of spreadsheets and other data sets that the Guardian has gathered throughout news cycles. There is an API Explorer which allows you to quickly get your hands dirty with the Guardian APIs, which is essential.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/open-platform" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/guardian/guaridan-data-visualization.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There is also a variety of code libraries including Java, Scala, Ruby and ColdFusion flavors, as well as an App Gallery showcasing what has been built on the Guardian APIs.</p>
<p>The Guardian Open Platform is supported by an active blog, forum and Twitter account, providing the necessary building blocks to build community around the API.</p>
<p>There appears to be some unique gems under the surface with the Guardian Wordpress plugins and their MicroApp Framework looks like it could be interesting, but I just don't see a lot of information available on it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/guardian">Guardian Github account</a> is pretty active, but most of it is around the Guardian front-end, not for any innovation that you'd expect around open data and APIs.</p>
<p>On the surface, the Guardian Open Platform appears to have everything you need for a successful API platform, but I just don't see anything that stands out and screams "innovation in journalism using APIs". With that said, I have to mention the <a href="http://n0tice.org/">N0tice</a> platform, which is a separate user generated content publishing platform that is developed by the Guardian Media Group.</p>
<p>Maybe there is more going on behind the scenes than I can find in the API portal, but currently it looks like business as usual in the Guardian Open Platform. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I think all newspapers should have this, but you'd think with the leadership position in the space, the Guardian would have some secret sauce simmering on the back burner. I will look at NYT, USA Today and other publications API initiatives, tae a look at N0tice and then come back and take another look before I wrap-up my state of APIs in journalism.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2014</span>

<p>I use screenshots across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>. I take screenshots of stories I curated, companies I track on and API developer areas I'm monitoring. Historically I've used a variety of screenshot APIs, to generate the 1000's of screenshots I need to make my network function.</p>
<p>This last week I was running through my network, and noticed the screenshot API had stopped working. It isn't a critical piece of infrastructure so I've used free services and don't really feel the need to monitor in real-time, I just respond when I stop seeing screenshots on the news listing page.</p>
<p>This is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, and when I started looking for a new screenshot API I noticed the majority of them now charge, and was in a range I just didn't feel I couldn't afford being a one man show. I knew in the back of my mind that I could develop my own screenshot API solution.</p>
<p>After test driving several image libraries I settled in with <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>, which allows me to load and manipulate web pages in an object, and then take a screenshot of the web page in that state. I quickly wrapped in a web API using the Slim Framework in PHP.</p>
<p>Once I had the API deployed I wrapped with my <a title="3Scale API Management Infrastructure" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API management infrastructure</a>, which requires an API key before you can use any of my APIs. Next I updated my company, API and news screenshot tool to use my new screenshot API.</p>
<p>After I get some free time I will clean up the code and publish via Github, so others can deploy their own screenshot API and take the same path I chose.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/15/irs-modernized-efile-mef-a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy-draft/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/bw-irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I look at a lot of APIs, I work hard to brainstorm ideas for potential new APIs, and I can't think of a more important API to not just the API economy, but to the overall economy, than an IRS API that would give citizens access to their income and tax history.</p>
<p>We know the APIs exists, since the same resources are made available via the <a title="IRS Modernized e-File System" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/15/irs-modernized-efile-mef-a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy-draft/">IRS Modernized e-File system</a> to tax professionals. I'm not talking about an API that gives access to every detail of my tax history, but the data I've entered into common forms like W2, 1099, and 1042.</p>
<p>This IRS API would provide simple REST API access to these values, along with an oAuth framework allowing any <span style="text-decoration: underline;">approved application developer</span> to access all or portions of our most relevant income and tax data. With oAuth being the access layer to all of this, it would give us, the citizen control over who has access to our history, and how applications can use it.</p>
<p>An IRS API would be used to streamline numerous processes like home loans, student financial aid and other transactions actions we take in our everyday lives. These transactions occur over and over each year, and require manual entry, manual validation and other often cumbersome interactions.</p>
<p>The introduction of an IRS API with oAuth, would also do amazing things for basic digital literacy around oAuth, and who is accessing to our vital information. This type of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/api-and-oauth-literacy-is-as-important-as-financial-literacy-in-the-api-economy/">literacy around APIs, oAuth, and data access</a>, is critical to not just a healthy API economy, but is quickly blending with the regular economy.</p>
<p>I'm not naive regarding the politics of such a move, which would uncover huge amounts of corruption, false statements, potentially disrupt existing jobs that are dedicated to these bureaucratic functions, and introduce a new wave of security concerns. However I think the benefits will outweigh the negatives and this represents the next generation of financial literacy.</p>
<p>It is up to the IRS to take the steps necessary to make such an API possible. The data is there, and we know existing web services are in place that facilitate these types of interactions. The IRS just needs to realize the importance role that web APIs and oAuth play in the current digital landscape, prioritize a simple web API design, oAuth deployment and supporting developer area.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/example-form.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm working on an <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">API design for the free application for federal student aid form</a>, also known as FAFSA, over the last couple weeks. I took <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/fotw1314/pdf/PdfFafsa13-14.pdf">the form</a> which had over 150 separate fields, and turned into a basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) API. I even added an endpoint that allows you to query and get a list of the fields.</p>
<p>The project is a proof of concept to show the Department of Education what is possible around a FAFSA API. I'm not sure if the API will ever be deployed or adopted by the Department of Education or if by other 3rd party providers, establishing a sort of federated FAFSA API network. My goal is to just generate the API definition with supporting server and client side tooling, to show what is possible.</p>
<p>As I assess my work over the last couple weeks on FAFSA, I can't help but think how this should be standard practice for all forms. If you do a simple search at google for "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=forms&amp;oq=forms&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i65j69i60l3j69i59.752j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">forms</a>", you get IRS forms, immigration, legal, voter registration and yes the FAFSA forms. It is clear that forms still dominate our lives--print and PDF.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that simple, open designs and tooling around forms would help us continue evolve the concept of the "form" beyond the just the PDF. Sure the PDF still has a place, and some tooling can work with consuming and publishing as PDF, but APIs could help us innovate around what is a form, how users enter their data into them, and take advantage of newer technologies like tablets.</p>
<p>In my opinion, every form should be an API. If you'd like help developing a new form as an API or evolving an older print or PDF form as an API, feel free to <a href="http://kinlane.com/contact/">reach out</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Pop Up Archive" href="https://www.popuparchive.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pop-up-archive/pop-up-archive-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time talking to folks on the phone, Skype, in Google Hangouts and in person about their API business models. Not everyone I talk with is willing to share their story public, so I'm also happy when I meet folks who are as open and transparent about figuring all of this out as I am.</p>
<p>This morning I spoke with Anne and Bailey over at the <a title="Pop Up Archive" href="https://www.popuparchive.org/" target="_blank">Pop Up Archive</a> about their upcoming API, and potential business model(s) for their API when ready. We talked about their immediate API release and then brainstormed about how to get the word out, how people might use the API, and possible approaches monetization.</p>
<p>The Pop Up Archive is an <a href="https://www.popuparchive.org/">audio transcription service</a>, allowing you to publish audio files and receive back full text transcriptions of the audio. It is a pretty straightforward service, and they will be releasing an API so others can use the audio transcription service in their own apps, as well as access the wealth of audio resources they are amassing in their archive.</p>
<p>Even with the straightforward nature of this upcoming API resource, the question of who will use this service, and what they are willing to pay comes up--something we spent the good part of an hour discussing. We should have recorded, then we'd have the transcription, but since we didn't here are some of my thoughts from today's discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Your API Is Tech and Business Research &amp; Development</strong><br /> The tech space moves fast, and success is all about getting your API up and running, allow for developers to use, even if it is just within a trusted group, then iterate and evolve as you gain more knowledge about what people want and how they will be using it. You can speculate from now until the cows come home about how people will use, but until you have it up and running you won't know for sure. When you approach your API with a R&amp;D mindset, you will be much more open to opportunities and more resilient when things go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Rolling Out With Minimum Viable Monetization Strategy</strong><br /> When you are pioneering into a new area of API resources, it can be tough to know what the market is willing to pay. Start with identifying your hard costs like compute, storage and bandwidth, tack on a reasonable profit and get your API open for business in a beta release. Make it clear that things will change, but let people start using your API, pay for basic services and begin understanding more about their usage and what your first wave of customers are willing to pay. Over time, you can evolve your monetization strategy, building on what your hard costs are, the value you deliver to your users, and ultimately what they are willing to pay for your service(s).</p>
<p><strong>Casting A Wide Net To Identify Target Audience Beyond Obvious Ones</strong><br /> When identifying their potential target audience, the Pop Up Archive starting with the obvious ones like radio and journalists, but then how do they potentially identify other areas, that aren't so obvious? You do this by first by getting your API up and available in some sort of private beta. To support the API release, publish a blog and twitter account and get to work telling the stories of your API, which Pop Up Archive has done. Then get to work telling the details of every step of your journey, and every use case of the obvious target groups. These stories will become your net, and the wider you cast the net, including as many keywords as you can, and the number of stories you tell, the wider possible audience you will draw in. The Pop Up Archive introductory video says that if you don't provide text representations of your audio, they won't be found in searches--when it comes to APIs, if you don't tell stories of the problems your API solves, users will never find it when searching for solutions to their problems.</p>
<p><strong>Not All API Consumers Are Created Equally</strong><br /> When identifying your API consumers make sure you get to know their needs and goals. In the case of the Pop Up Archive, some users may be using the API for audio transcription, while others may be using it to gain access to the rich library of audio uploaded by other users. These two groups will have radically different needs, and possess very differ thresholds of what they will pay for API access. While it makes sense to charge audio transcription users for the heavy lifting of transcribing, you want to incentivize archive users to access, syndicate and share as much content as you can. Why even charge them? With a proper branding strategy these users can become the marketing vehicle of the API, building directories, sites, widgets and other content syndication that could potentially drive new users to the API.</p>

<p>Anne and Bailey are doing a great job of approaching their API strategy in a very open and agile way. The worst thing any API provider can do is approach their strategy with a very rigid view, thinking they understand exactly how developers should use an API resource. The Pop Up Archive has built a great service that does two things, and does them well:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Audio Transcription</li>
<li>Audio + Transcription Archive</li>
</ul>
<p>They provide a clean, easy to use website, and now they are preparing a first version of their API, with accompanying documentation, code samples and widgets. They have identified their operational costs and are developing an appropriate fee for the service that is based upon the number of minutes of audio you are processing.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Pop Up Archive will open their API for business with a handful of beta partners and begin iterating on the technology and business of their API platform. While there are a lot of unknowns, Anne and Bailey realize they just need to just get up and running, engage their users, and establish a feedback loop that will then help define the future of their API and its business model.</p>
<p>Your API is a an external, R&amp;D lab for your business. While you will be producing real products and services out of this lab, you need to approach operations with an agile state of mind, enabling you to be open to use cases and business models you may never have conceived when you set out  on this road. If you do this, your chances of success will significantly increase.</p>
<p>What sort of uses cases and business models do you envision for the Pop Up Archive?</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://portal.ehawaii.gov/page/subscriber-services/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/state-government/hawaii-gov-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The question of whether government should charge for APIs and other digital services came up again this week during a Google Hangout I did with Luke Fretwell(<a href="https://twitter.com/lukefretwell">@lukefretwell</a>) of <a href="https://twitter.com/govfresh">@GovFresh</a>. I began exploring this concpet last year in my post, <a title="Should the Government Subsidize and Profit from Data Market" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/02/01/should-the-government-subsidize-and-profit-from-data-markets/">Should the Government Subsidize and Profit from Data Market</a>, after talking with several city government open data folks.</p>
<p>Luke had pointed me to a page on the <a href="https://portal.ehawaii.gov/page/subscriber-services/">Hawaii.gov website that described their subscriber services</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>A subscriber account offers the benefit of monthly invoicing and payment and provides convenience to users who conduct large volumes of online transactions through our website. In some cases, a subscriber account is also required to access a specific online service.</em></blockquote>
<p>Many people I talk to in the open data space have reacted negatively when I propose the idea of government charging for access to services, but as reflected in Hawaiis approach, this is just for higher volume and heavy commercial use cases.</p>
<p>It costs money to gather and organize government data, design, deploy and manage APIs. I feel strong that many of the resources coming out of government should be free and open for access, but in the cases where it is incurring huge costs for government to provide, it might make sense to pass costs off to consumers.</p>
<p>Think of any other physical government assets like city, county, state, or national parks. These are open for anyone to access, and many are even free, but if you want to use them for commercial purposes, you have to pay. Virtual resources should be seen in a similar light.</p>
<p>However, this could easily evolve into a negative analogy, because park access fees sometimes can seem ridiculous, and I want to incentivize consumption of government open data and APIs through as wide of access as possible--not scare people away.</p>
<p>My goal here is to not take a for or against stance, but to stimulate conversation around the topic and see where it makes sense to apply. I don't think government charging for access is applicable in all areas of open data and APIs, but if it will ensure better quality of service and potentially fund new data and APIs, I think it can be a good idea. What do you think?</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Swedish API License" href="http://apilicens.se/en/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swedish-api-license/swedish-api-license-2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The terms of service for APIs is the single most important building block of an API strategy, one that dictates how developers can access and put API resources to use and sets the tone for an entire API ecosystem. Your API can be publicly available, but the terms of service and licensing will determine whether it is truly open.</p>
<p>Even with the importance of this area of API operations, there aren't a lot of open resources to help guide you through crafting your API licensing and terms of service properly--until now.</p>
<p>A group of swedish entrepreneurs <a href="http://se.linkedin.com/in/danielrudmark">Daniel Rudmark</a> of <a href="https://www.viktoria.se/">Viktoria Swedish ICT</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elias-arnestrand/1/922/64b">Elias Arnestrand</a> of  <a href="http://www.samtrafiken.se/">Samtrafiken</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/anna-mirsch/83/936/14a">Anna Mirsch</a> lawyer at <a href="http://www.mannheimerswartling.se/">Mannheimer Swartling</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/andreaskrohn">Andreas Krohn</a> at <a href="http://dopter.se/">Dopter</a> have come together to create a new project to address this need, called <a title="Swedish API License" href="http://apilicens.se/en/">Swedish API License</a>.</p>
<p>The goals with the project was to create an API license that...</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Is open and free for anyone to use, encouraging maximal adoption</li>
<li>Is flexible enough to fit many different use cases</li>
<li>Respects both the publisher and the consumer of the API.</li>
<li>Easy to understand for people without a law degree</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apilicens.se/en/dokumentation/wizard/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swedish-api-license/swedish-api-license-wizard-2.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The Swedish API license covers the following areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>License</li>
<li>Intellectual Property Rights</li>
<li>Processing of Personal Data</li>
<li>Technical Requirements and Limitations</li>
<li>Other Requirements of Use</li>
<li>Liability</li>
<li>Changes</li>
<li>Terms and Conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>The Swedish API license even has an <a href="http://apilicens.se/en/dokumentation/wizard/">API license wizard</a> that walks you through 13 steps of constructing and customizing your license, keeping within the legal and commercial considerations your company has around your API.</p>
<p>While the Swedish API License is published in Sweden, the site and licenses are in english and all the work is licensed under CC-BY license. This opens up a whole lot of opportunity to use the model around the globe.</p>
<p>I will be spending more time getting familiar with the approach to developing terms of service by the Swedish API License, and consider it side by side with existing efforts like <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn't Read</a> and <a href="https://tosback.org/">TOS Back</a> from EFF. I'm thinking we are approaching a critical point in API growth, where we really need to start getting our house in order when it comes to open resources for API providers and API consumers.</p>

<p>Over the last 3 years I have looked at all the APIs available in <a href="https://bitly.com/10rGRbg+">ProgrammableWeb API directory</a>, with about 2500 of which I monitor regularly. Throughout this process I've evolved an eye for what building blocks go into a successful API program.</p>
<p>When I review an existing API area or program, public or private, I spend as little or as much time as I need to look at an API initiative through the following 20 lenses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- The general look, feel and initial impression of an API at the high level.</li>
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong>&nbsp;- Review of API endpoints, looking at the detail.</li>
<li><strong>On-boarding</strong>&nbsp;- How easy is it to get up and going? Where is the friction?</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>&nbsp;- General API documentation review and critique.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved with authentication and security.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong>&nbsp;- A look at all available code libraries, SDKs, apps and language or platform availability.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a mobile fit and how does an API address this world.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- What do direct and indirect support practices look like and what are activity levels.</li>
<li><strong>Communications</strong>&nbsp;- How are communications handled, and is it done in a transparent way.</li>
<li><strong>Change Practices</strong>&nbsp;- How are updates, changes, and communication around the roadmap handled.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model</strong>&nbsp;- What is the business model of an API, how does it make ends meet.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>&nbsp;- What resources are provided from how-to, case studies to videos and workshops.</li>
<li><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong>&nbsp;- Does an API reflect a research &amp; development group.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Department&nbsp;</strong>- Covering the legal areas of terms of use, privacy and branding.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong>&nbsp;- How portable and embeddable are aspects of the API? Can it be distributed easily?</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong>&nbsp;- A look at the underlying environment of the API, sandboxing, testing, monitoring, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Developers</strong>&nbsp;- What does this look like for a developer? What tools do we get to ensure success?</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>&nbsp;- How consistent are API endpoints and the support resources, and the overall operations.</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong>&nbsp;- If the API is public, to what degree of open are API efforts?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Evangelism</strong>&nbsp;- What does outreach around the API look like, regarding events, social, storytelling, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look across the&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html" target="_blank">building blocks I have listed for API management</a>&nbsp;to get a better idea of the detail I'm looking for across API operations. These building blocks have been assembled through over 3 years of reviewing APIs, and can provide a good checklist to use when applying the above lenses.</p>
<p>Each review involves visiting an API area, applying the above 20 lenses, register and often times hack on an API. When done I write up a review report, which in many cases will be privately shared with a company and key&nbsp;stakeholders&nbsp;for review and discussion.</p>
<p>In some cases, when approved, I will publicly write up a review, providing a more polished view of an API area based upon final review report, and publish on my API Evangelist network of blogs.</p>
<p>The goal with a review is to better understand the balance of technology, business and politics going on within an API ecosystem, providing feedback that will help a company better achieve balance and success with their API initiative.</p>

<p>I got back from Paris, France this Sunday, after Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) and I spoke at <a href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> last Thursday. This was the second annual API event, which kicked off last year around the same time. I've been a supporter of the event since Mehdi (<a href="https://twitter.com/medjawii">@medjawii</a>) of Webshell told me about the idea.</p>
<p>Last years event was small, and over half the audience seemed to be imported API specialists such as myself, where this year it was clear--this was a french conference. A passionate community of API enthusiasts has grown over the last year, producing an impressive line-up of speakers and attendees.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about the space ranging from containers and oAuth to revelations about how we can learn from history and make the right decisions as we move forward in a world of APIs.</p>
<p>I encountered some pretty smart folks who knew a lot about technology, APIs and open data, that I hadn't encountered before in the online API world. This shows me the value of this type of event, and the importance of bringing folks together from around the world and share API stories.</p>
<p>Thanks <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> and <a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/">FaberNovel</a> for making it happen, and bringing Audrey and I out to be part of such an important event.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/ed/fafsa-form.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was able to give my <a title="FAFSA API Project" href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">FAFSA API project</a> a little more attention in preparation for some data jams later this week. While there is still a lot of work to happen, I feel pretty good about what I have been able to get done. I'd love to reflect on the API design, get some feedback before I move it forward too much more.</p>
<p><strong>75% Github</strong><br /> As with all of my projects, the FAFSA API is mostly deployed via Github, except for the actual API. The project was born as a Github repository and expanded as a Github Page. Using Github I'm able to manage the project, while also making it open by default so anyone else can fork and put the work to use.</p>
<p><strong>Designing The API</strong><br /> Once the repository was created, I got to work on an API design. For this project I started with a <a title="Swagger" href="https://bitly.com/1j2KERU+">Swagger</a> specification, and developed a basic CRUD interface and data model that was derived from the list of 100+ fields from the <a title="FAFSA Form" href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/fotw1314/pdf/PdfFafsa13-14.pdf">FAFSA form</a>.  Now I had a basic API design I could work with as guide for developing my API, generating my documentation and code samples. It isn't perfect, but it is a good start.</p>
<p><strong>Deploying The API</strong><br /> Next with API design in hand, I got to work deploying an actual API that would allow developers to build applications that could create, update and manage FAFSA application. I selected the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim framework</a> and PHP to deploy the first iteration of the FAFSA API. This allowed me to rapidly produce server side code in a common programming language. I will be deploying Python, Ruby and Node.js versions in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Interactive Documentation</strong><br /> The first step in quantifying an API interface and make it something you can see and understand, is by developing documentation. In 2013 the common way to do this is with interactive documentation, which you can generate directly from the previously generated Swagger specification. Swagger has a slick JavaScript implementation that I can easily run from my Github project pages.</p>
<p><strong>Code Samples</strong><br /> I want to make sure my basic API design works I need to actually hack against it. Like the server side code, I'm developing the first code samples in PHP. I developer a set of samples that allow me to add, update, delete and pull all or an individual FAFSA entry. Next on the roadmap is to develop Python, Ruby, JavaScript and hopefully some mobile code samples for iPhone and Android (eventually).</p>
<p><strong>Secondary APIs</strong><br /> Once I started hacking on the FAFSA API I realized I would need more resources to actually make an application possible. First I needed a list of states and provinces--basic I know, but something I would need. Next there are other form fields, supporting processing logic, form rejection codes and lists of colleges and universities that would help developers be successful in building applications. I got to work downloading, and extract the data I would need and added these secondary APIs to my FAFSA API stack.</p>
<p><strong>A Portal To Round It Off</strong><br /> I have good amount of resources available for my FAFSA API project. I need a portal to hang all my resources within, establishing one stop access to everything generated as part of my work. Using Github Pages I generate a gh-pages branch of my Github repository, upload a graphical template, home page, about page, and a blog to provide a single portal gateway that developers can get at everything I've done. The portal blog will provide a real-time journal to chronical the evolution of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Data Behind</strong><br /> I've launched a suite of secondary APIs to support developers when building FAFSA applications, but this project is just a prototype API and even if it was a production deployment, some developers will just want access to the data behind. To support this, I published JSON data stores of FAFSA form fields, business process logic, rejection codes, and a list of states and schools that users can put to use. All data is stored as basic, machine readable JSON files in the master Github repository behind the FAFSA project portal.</p>
<p><strong>A Roadmap For The Future</strong><br /> While I made significance progress on the FAFSA API work, there is always more work to be done.  I need a roadmap to help me remember the various features I will be adding to the FAFSA API, but also a way to allow other contributors to submit suggestions to the roadmap. I developed a simple Javascript widget that was driven from the underlying Github Milestones system. This way milestones would list in the FAFSA API project roadmap, but would also allow anyone to submit potential features using the underlying Github platform.</p>
<p><strong>Providing Necessary Resources </strong><br /> I used a variety of PDF and website resources to understand the FAFSA program and derive the API interface and data model for this project. I wanted to make sure an provide an <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/resources.html">easy list of resources</a> for other developers to use. A significant part of this project was derived from existing resources, making these part of the living project is important to support it's evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Adding To The Commons</strong><br /> With a first draft of the API definition and underlying data model for the FAFSA form published, i wanted to make sure I put forth the definition for public comment and consumption. To do this I create an <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> manifest which registers the FAFSA API swagger definition with the commons. As I evolve the project and update the specification the manifest will keep it actively published in the API commons.</p>
<p><a href="http://apicommons.org"><img class="c1" style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Licensing</strong><br /> Beyond adding the FAFSA API definition to the API Commons, I make sure all code that is published as part of my FAFSA project is licensed using the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>, and any content is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY license</a>. I want the entire project to be freely and widely used, but make sure the central project is attributed to help build awareness and contributions to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /> That is where I stand. The goal of my FAFSA API project is to show what is possible with a simple API, and supporting resources. Developers can now build web applications that support students in applying for aid. Anyone can not just build applications, but deploy their own FAFSA API, becoming a node in a federated FAFSA ecosystem. Think of the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint">ecosystem that has emerged as part of the IRS e-file system</a>. Popular apps like Turbo Tax that help taxpayers file their federal and state taxes, providing a successful blueprint for public and private sector partnerships.</p>
<p>This is all just a beginning. I'm just getting going on this project. It should provide a base prototype for building FAFSA solutions. I'm using this base model for other projects I'm working on, but FAFSA has provided a great project to evolve my approach. I need help on this project. It is unpaid work and I can use financial support, code contributions or just <a href="https://github.com/ed-data/fafsa-api/issues?state=open">feedback on what should be on the roadmap</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-voice/oraclevgoogle/oraclevgoogle.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm just getting time to read through the news coming out of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the next phase of the Oracle v. Google case, which kicked off December 4th in California courts.</p>
<p>A panel of three judges presided over the Oracle v. Google Android/Java copyright appeal hearing, and after <a href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2013/12/detailed-analysis-of-federal-circuit.html">reading several accounts of the hearing</a>, all three judges seem to all agree that the Java API should protected under copyright, but whether Google's use of portions of the Java API is fair use, is still unclear--potentially overturning Judge William Alsup earlier ruling.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that APIs are the "fair use tip" of software that could potentially be covered by copyright and patents. As demonstrated by <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google/amici">my support</a> of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/2013.1021.1022.computer.scientists.amici_.brief_.pdf">Electronic Frontier Foundation amicus brief</a>, I think API definitions remaining fair use is critical to interoperability and and not just a healthy API economy, but the the larger economy.</p>
<p>The hearing last week is just the beginning, the legal battle is likely to go on for a while,  potentially making its way to the Supreme Court and / or possibly heading back to a lower court. Even if the earlier Oracle vs. Google ruling, that APIs aren't copyrightable is upheld, I anticipate we will see many, many legal battles on this front in coming years.</p>
<p>As we increase our vocabulary for describing and designing API interfaces, with approaches such as <a title="Swagger" href="https://bitly.com/1j2KERU+">Swagger</a>, <a title="RAML" href="https://bitly.com/16ZTZYt+">RAML</a> and <a href="https://bitly.com/1cl8tCc+">API Blueprint</a>, attempts to protect these definitions by copyright will increase. While I will continue to support efforts to defend APIs in their entirety as being protected under fair use and free from copyright, I will be focusing my efforts on encouraging healthy API design, sharing and collaboration through placement of API definitions into the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.</p>
<p>While Oracle vs. Google remains a critical case that will have a major impact on the world of APIs, whichever way the case goes, it won't change the importance of <a title="publishing APIs to the commons" href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">publishing API definitions to the commons</a>, setting the precedent for fair use, reinforcing the fact that this open use of API designs is critical to getting us from 10K APIs to millions of APIs, ensuring the interoperability we will need for our increasingly Internet enabled world.</p>

<p>We have added the <a title="OpenEd API" href="http://www.opened.io/#/developer">OpenEd API</a> to the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>. OpenEd provides open educational resources like courses, videos and games for teachers to use in their classes.</p>
<p>Using the API, developers can read and write resources to the platform, which currently houses 250K openly licensed educational resources.</p>
<p>In addition to making all of the content openly licensed, the <a href="https://github.com/openedinc/opened.io">OpenEd.io site is also open sourced on Github</a>. Making the OpenEd API definition a perfect candidate for the API commons.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.opened.apiary.io/">OpenEd team designed their API using Apiary.io</a>, defining it using API Blueprint, a <a href="http://apiblueprint.com/">web API language that allows for the description of APIs using markdown</a>.</p>
<p>OpenEd is a great open educational content API blueprint to follow, and we are honored to have it in the commons!</p>

<p>I'm getting more PR folks reaching out to me trying to get me to review their client's API program. I'm happy to add these to my list and make time each week to review them alongside the other new APIs I find each week.</p>
<p>I'm not willing to jump on the phone and hear a pitch about the API. You should send me a short succinct email, or even better a Tweet with a URL and I'm happy to add to my list and make time when i can.</p>
<p>I'm not the usual blogger who just wants to regurgitate what you told me in a briefing or in a press release. Your API and its supporting area should do the talking. I should be able to click on a single link, understand what you do, and be able to find what I need within 5 minutes or less.  If I can't? Well I will let you know.</p>
<p>Think of me as a developer. I will be reviewing your product from that perspective.</p>
<p>So if you are doing PR for an API company, make sure and read my blog, engage me on Twitter and save the briefings and emails for other bloggers. I'm more concerned with the value your client is bringing to the table, and their approach to delivering a self-service API platform.</p>
<p>No briefing required. :-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><span>This fall while working in Washington D.C. I was introduced to the concept of</span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/government-services/RepresentingGovernmentServiceswithJSON-LD.pdf">representing government services with JSON-LD</a><span>. Using the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/CivicServices">civic services schema.org</a><span>&nbsp;proposal you can represent common government services that target indvidiuals and businesses, providing a standard that developers can use when presenting government services in websites and mobile applications.</span></p>
<p>I was working on a project to help publish services from the Department of Veterans Affairs, and I wanted to enable people who work at the VA, as well as other agencies to be able to generate and manage JSON-LD representations of their services in the easiest way possible. So I thought to myself, what is the number one way for people in government to manage data? Spreadsheets of course!</p>
<p>I decided to start with Google Docs, and generate a simple JavaScript tool to take a Google Spreadsheet template that was setup with the required fields for a government services schema. Next I wrote an import script using Tabletop.js that would grab the contents of the Google Spreadsheet template and using JavaScript to generate the JSON-LD.</p>
<p>This thanksgiving holiday I decided to add one more tool to my work with government services and JSON-LD, and build a form that anyone could fill out and generate their own government services JSON-LD. The result is a Bootstrap, JQuery form that you can fill out, then hit publish JSON and using JavaScript it generates the JSON-LD representation for you.</p>
<p>I started a <a href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/index.html">project to organize my work around government services</a> and published the <a title="Google Spreadsheet to JSON-LD" href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/google-doc.html">Google Spreadsheet to JSON-LD</a> and the <a title="form to JSON-LD generators" href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/form.html">form to JSON-LD generators</a>. Next I will be adding the ability to save generated files to the Github master repository, making the whole thing a formable, government JSON-LD generator and storage repo.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying developing forms that generate JSON lately. I built an <a href="http://apicommons.org/manifest-generator.html">API Commons manifest generator</a> the other night, and using the same momentum I developed the government services JSON-LD generator. I couldn't think of a more worthy project to spend my time on over Thanksgiving. Hopefully government agencies of all shapes and sizes can more easily generate and publish machine readable lists of the valuable services they offer, so that Google, Yahoo, Bing and other web or mobile app developer can more easily and accurately represent these services in their apps.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Nov 2013</span>

<p>My friend <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>, Director of Platform for the <a href="http://developer.klout.com/">Klout API</a>, wrote up a great piece before <a title="#APIStrat" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">#APIStrat</a>, called <a href="https://medium.com/p/4d36eab870c9">A Short Proposal for Robots.json</a>.</p>
<p>This is a topic that I've been meaning to make time to discuss, but only now finding time. I love exchanging ideas with <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>, because we tend to disagree on some important API related topics, however he is extremely knowledgeable on the space, and like me he possesses some strong opinions and is very open to lively discussion via blogs, twitter and on stage at events.</p>
<p>On the topics of web scraping, API rate limits, and API access that exist in the realm of what I call the politics of APIs, <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> and I couldn't disagree more on what is acceptable use in the API economy. What is interesting though, within this disagreement we find affinity in the topic of the robots.json.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>&nbsp;has a very succinct description of what a robots.json file would be:</p>
<blockquote><em>A Robots.json file, or something like it, would contain all desired rules for retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody, business models and other use cases allowed and encouraged for developers.</em></blockquote>
<p>I think a machine readable file that provides access to all aspects of an APIs terms of use is a great idea. Beyond the obvious benefits of publishing a robots.json file for API providers and consumers, I think the practice would help standardize industry best practices for API terms and conditions. In my experience most API providers just emulate what they see in the space and if top players lead on this subject, others will follow.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> and I both agree that there should be a robots.json, however we come at it from two opposing viewpoints. <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> is coming at from an API vendor  position, and I'm coming at from the stance of an API consumer. <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> wants to establish a definition of where the provider stands, setting the "rules of the road" as Twitter would say--where I want a single location to find the same definition, so that as an API consumer I can understand the "rules of engagement", and decide if I want to even waste my time, based upon their stance.</p>
<p>With a standardized robots.json, as a developer I could very easily set the bar for which API providers I integrate into my applications. If a company's views on "retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody and business models" are not in alignment with my businesses, I can easily determine this without spending any time learning about their API--something that can be very costly and time consuming.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> uses Craigslists as the lead in for what a possible robots.json file could be used for, and the tone that it could set. While the tone of Craiglist's robots.json file might be very stern, setting what I would consider to be a very uninformed, "get off my lawn" vibe, I don't think all robots.json would reflect this tone.</p>
<p>Forward thinking companies could use a robots.json to easily differentiate themselves from outdated viewpoints on what "retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody and business models" means, allowing developers to quickly identify leading players, and through "markets" set what is the prevailing definition is for the current times.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://asuc.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/universities/uc-berkeley/associated-student-university-california-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>On November 6th, 2013 the <a title="ASUC" href="http://asuc.org/">Associated Students, University of California(ASUC) Senate</a> submitted SB 48: <a href="http://asuc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Week-10-Agenda-Packet-11.6.131.pdf">A Bill in Support of Student Information Systems Application Developers</a>, stating that "open data and API compatibility is a necessary feature in the new Student Information System".</p>
<p>UC Berkeley has embarked on a "Student Information System Replacement Project" that is looking to "replace its constellation of aging, unique, disparate home-grown student systems with a modern, nimble and effective vendor-supported system".  Systems including financial aid, registration, enrollment, admissions and records are being targeted for replacement.</p>
<p>The existing Student Information Systems(SIS) has been in place for over two decades, and facing the same for future systems, the students led organization that represents over 35K students, is taking a stance to ensure that all future systems have APIs. That is some serious forethought and leadership on behalf on the ASUC Senate!</p>
<p>SB 48 puts forth that:</p>
<blockquote><em>an API, or Application Programming Interface, is a foundation put in place on top of a system to securely make specific information and data public to developers for those developers to create third-party extensions and applications pertaining to their specific uses for the data and program</em></blockquote>
<p>API and Integration Architect of UC Berkeley, George Atala(<a href="https://twitter.com/gmatala">@gmatala</a>) adds:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;An SIS API would be critical for supporting the many user applications and other campus systems that serve students. These systems change and evolve continuously, and a real time read/write API is necessary to enable this. The API must cover the full range of core functionality in the SIS, and should support appropriate levels of security for private and public data.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The bill authored by Sahil A Pandya and Quinn Z Shen nails some of the critical areas around APIs being a vital aspect of university operations, and that much of the SIS overhaul will not happen all at once, when in reality the evolution of all campus systems should happen in smaller, bite-size chunks. APIs would help evolve campus information systems from a 20-30 years technology procurement cycle, to a real-time, ongoing, agile systems lifecycle.</p>
<p>Current SIS are operating without APIs, limiting which applications can be integrated and deployed on top of university systems. Even with this current closed approach, there are a handful of student-made applications such as <a title="BerkelyTime" href="/admin/blog/berkeleytime.com">BerkeleyTime</a> and <a href="/admin/blog/ninjacourses.com">NinjaCourses</a>&nbsp;that have emerged showing the demand for better quality SIS applications and tools.</p>
<p>These existing, student-developed applications often obtain their information by scraping publicly available information on the Internet. APIs would provide direct access to information, eliminate scraping load on public websites, and provide analytics and insight into what applications exist, and how they use university and student information.  APIs provide higher level of control and security for UC IT operations, than even the currently closed systems offer. UC Berkeley uses <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a> to manage acess, analytics and other vital aspects of their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/25/get-a-list-of-all-classes-at-uc-berkeley-with-api-call/">recently launch API operations</a>, but unfortunately is not fullly taken advantage of across all university systems..</p>
<p>In addition to current student-developed applications, there are also other faculty-developed extensions to SIS that apply to specific departments, but are not covered by central information systems. All of these student, faculty and third party applications have proven to be so beneficial to students in serving purposes, that many of them have been officially adopted and endorsed by the University.</p>
<p>Imagine a university where each entering student experiences the financial aid, enrollment and registration process, then one of their first opportunities to learn involves actually contributed to building applications and tools that make that process better. In a world where university resources are increasingly strained, the institutions that remain relevant will allow for student, faculty and third party access to all campus resources via APIs.</p>
<p>I think SB 48 nails it again with?</p>
<blockquote><em>"the university with the top computer science department should also have the top student information system in place and harness the talent in its students by allowing them to create applications that enhance and extend features in the information system (i.e. the mantra 'Created by students, for students')"</em></blockquote>
<p>Wait! Information systems created by students for students? What if businesses students could help with data analysis and reporting? What if marketing students could help build interactive campaigns? Sounds like the recipe for some interesting education and work experience for students, and a huge opportunity for the university system to maximize the valuable intellectual exhaust generated by its faculty and students eacUh day.</p>
<p>I have to go out with the last section of SB 48, I think it speaks for itself:</p>
<blockquote><em>"THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Associated Students of the University of California stand in solidarity with student, faculty, and administrative developers under the unified opinion that open data and API compatibility is a necessary feature in the new Student Information System to ensure its longevity and holistic usefulness to students, not only in its core features, but in the potential add-ons from third-party applications and extensions"</em></blockquote>

<p>I'm working on an <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">API for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form</a>. I'm working my way through a document from Department of Education called the <a href="http://www.ifap.ed.gov/appprocspecsswd/1314AppProcSysSoftwareDevSpecsAugust2013Update.html">2013-2014 Application Processing System Specifications for Software Developers</a>.</p>
<p>I'm isolating various datasets, and data models, trying to get a feel for all the API resources I will need for the FAFSA API. The specifications provides several tables of data and data models for me to use, including the actual fields for the FAFSA form.</p>
<p>One dataset that is provided in the PDF is a list of states. It makes sense that a list of states is included for any developer who is building a federal student aid application. And I have a states API available elsewhere, that I've used in several other applications, so building this API will for the project will be easy.</p>
<p>Next I'm thinking..how do I replicate this utility API easily for an external API project like this? One of the architectural considerations for the FAFSA API is to make an API that anyone could fork and easily setup for their own use. That includes the state API resource.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about APIs in general. When it comes to APIs, they are ften attached to brands, like the Twilio API or Twitter API. We do not think of single API definitions as ubiquitous, as utilities or as commodities yet. However there are a lot of common API resources like states, IP addresses, counties, cities and many more, that are essential to many web and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Sure these datasets are widely available, but you need to actually design and deploy the actual API. How do we make utility APIs like this deployable anywhere? Anytime? I should be able to select from a library of common API definitions and easily fork, then deploy to my AWS EC2, AWS Cloud Formation or OpenShift platform. I shouldn't have to rely on 3rd party services for all of these resources.</p>
<p>Of course, not all APIs should be this portable, but there are a number of very common APIs that could. I should be able to launch a new API portal for a public audience or even a private development group, and easily publish the unique, as well as the utility APIs they will need to be successful, in a single, easy to navigate API area.</p>

<p>I was asked to help put some thought into an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid iniative. First, what is FAFSA:</p>
<blockquote>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requires to determine your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The government conducts a &ldquo;need analysis&rdquo; based on financial information, such as income, assets, and other family information, which you (and your parents if you are a dependent student) will be asked to provide.</blockquote>
<p>I'm just getting started with this project, and as I do with all my Public / Private Sector work, I created <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">this umbrella site for my Department of Education open data and API work</a>, and created an individual project site just for the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">Free Application for Federal Student Aid API</a>.</p>
<p>You can participate in the design and development process via the <a href="https://github.com/ed-data">Gitihub repositories</a>, and feel free to ping me @kinlane if you want to get involved. I will post stories here, and on the individual site to chronical its progress, and reference on API Evangelist when applicable.</p>

I have a project I've been evolving since August called <a title="Simple API" href="http://simple-api.github.io/central/">Simple API</a> and its sister implementation <a title="api.ongithub.com" href="http://api.ongithub.com">api.ongithub.com</a>, which allows you to launch an API by forking common API definitions that are hosted on Github.</p>
<p>I was recently introduced to similar approach to geospatial API deployment using GeoJSON stored on Github called <a href="http://gitspatial.com/" target="_blank">GitSpatial</a>. Using the same approach, GitSpatial lets allows you to oAuth into the API deployment platform using your Github login, then spiders your repositories and let's you sync the repositories that contain GeoJSON.</p>
<p>Then using three URL parameters:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>user_name</strong> - Your GitHub user name</li>
<li><strong>repo_name</strong> - A GitHub repo name</li>
<li><strong>feature_set_name</strong> - A file in your repo that contains GeoJSON</li>
</ul>
<p>GitSpatial allows you to construct a geo spatial API resource URI: <strong><em>http://gitspatial.com/:user_name/:repo_name/:feature_set_name</em></strong></p>
<p>Pretty cool stuff! I might be a little biased here, but I think this type of API deployment via Github blueprints, plus JSON data stores is going to be big. I've been experimenting with <a title="API deployments from Github blueprints via Amazon Cloud Formations and Redhat OpenShift" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/20/server-side-api-templates-on-aws-cloud-formation-and-openshift/">API deployments from Github blueprints via Amazon Cloud Formations and Redhat OpenShift</a>, and it seems like the next evolution in cloud driven API deployment to me.</p>
<p>The best part to this approach is that your data, configurations and core elements are maintained within your world as simple, open formats like JSON--then you get to externally connect, using Github, to premium API services that augment and enhance your existing resources.</p>
<p>Lookout for an increase in the number of Github + API solutions in the coming months...</p>

<p>I created <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">11 very simple API designs</a> for the launch of <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>. We needed some API definitions to show the potential of the commons, so I wanted to design a handful of common API patterns to seed the launch.</p>
<p>For all 11 API designs I started with a <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki">Swagger definition</a>, then using PHP and the Slim framework I quickly generated server side code for each API. I generate this code programmatically from the Swagger spec, but I also prefer going through the generated code and giving it a human touch.</p>
<p>This approach isn't just for these 11 API design templates, I'm using it for all my projects right now. I'm designing the API definition, generating and modifying the server side code, publishing Swagger UI documentation, then any client side code libraries I will need.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openshift.com/"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openshift/openshift-logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm publishing the API definition and Swagger UI, plus a project overview completely on Github. Currently I'm generating PHP / Slim framework driven code on AWS EC2 instance. I'm will expand this to include server side frameworks in Ruby, Python, Node.JS.</p>
<p>Next I will take each API definition + server-side code in PHP, Ruby, Python and Node.js and running on Amazon EC2 and port to run in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS Cloud Formation</a> and <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a> from RedHat--providing an open API blueprint that others can deploy in the cloud.</p>
<p>This will be my basic process for any standard API design I'm evolving for <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, APIs I develop internally, as well any API that I design, develop and build for external projects.  As with my stories and open data, I want any API I design to be open and reusable by anyone who is in need of the same API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/appstream/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/appstream/amazon-appstream-main.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>With the growing number of hypermedia API deployments, hypermedia haters&copy; are going to lose a major argument, that hypermedia is just an academic exercise and will never work in the wild. ;-)</p>
<p>The latest hypermedia API I was told about&nbsp;in the wild(thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), is from Amazon Web Services with the recent <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream/latest/developerguide/rest-api.html#rest-api-hal">AppStream API</a>--"a flexible, low-latency service that lets you stream resource intensive applications and games from the cloud".</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream/latest/developerguide/rest-api.html#rest-api-hal">The AWS AppStream API</a> is an API that uses <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">Hypertext Application Language</a> (HAL),  a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between API resources, created by Mike Kelly(<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>) of <a href="http://stateless.co/">Stateless.co</a>. When HAL is used, with each API request, you get a  wealth of links that allow you to programmatically explore the functionality of an API.</p>
<p>For example, you can explore the JSON returned in each response from the application API endpoint, about a specific app you are streaming including using the services, you will find links to determine application status, show information on current session and many more.</p>
<p>Normally with APIs, developers have to explore each API endpoint, and read through documentation to understand the different actions that can be taken against an API. With HAL, API owners can craft links that provide meaningful actions that can be discovered and implemented by developers along the way, teaching them about what is possible with each API call.</p>
<p>Hypermedia goes a long way in extending business rules to developers, not just directing them to what next steps may be taken at each API request, but really save them a lot of homework on how your API business model works, and how to best build an application around an API.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">other hypermedia APIs</a> in the wild, including the very important <a href="http://publicmediaplatform.org/">Public Media Platform (PMP)</a>, but the numbers are still low. I will keep finding quality hypermedia solutions in the wild and sharing them with you as I find.</p>

        <p><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apache-solr/apache-solr-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was going through the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/#search-endpoint">Free Law Project Court Opinion API</a> today, playing with the API and data, while developing some server and client side tooling.  All the API endpoints are pretty consistence because they used their Django model and the <a href="http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Tastypie framework</a> to generate most of the API.</p>
<p>There is one endpoint that is radically different from the rest of the opinion API: the /search endpoint. The Free Law Project used <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> to generate the /search endpoint results and instead of directly hitting just the database for information it utilized Solr index to do the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Using Solr opens up a whole world of search by introducing common concepts like AND, OR, NOT, fielded queries, wildcards, fuzzy searches and much more when it comes to searching for court opinions.</p>
<p>While the on-boarding of Solr newbies to an endpoint like this takes some education, and the opinion API /search endpoint docs could use a little more polishing to  make it easier to start using, but the concept of a Solr driven endpoint is still very interesting.</p>
<p>Using Solr like this might not work for all API providers, but for some who are heavily using data stores that include document repositories as well, it might be a good idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While <a title="Have A Bunch Of Documents? Launch An API With Apache Solr" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/08/13/have-a-bunch-of-documents-launch-an-api-with-apache-solr/">I have advocated for using Solr to generate an API before</a>, this is the first time I've seen it bundled alongside another API offering so seamlessly, just to drive the search endoint.  I'll be keeping an eye out for others during my regular monitoring.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/">Court Listener Opinions API</a> is a well designed, dead simple REST API with 7 endpoints to search opinions, citations across jurisdictions, using Basic Auth to secure the API.</p>
<p>Along with the simple API and docs, the Court Listener provides a blog and forum to support developers, and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/">bulk downloads of all data</a> in addition to the REST API.</p>
<p>The court opinions API implementation is a model to follow for other public sector open data and API projects. The API and supporting developer area is simple and very well done, providing all the essential building blocks needed to grow an ecosystem around the API and data.</p>
<p>The entire API and data is released in the  public domain, and relies on donations to do the work and keep the lights on--something that should be the bar set for all public data projects.</p>
<p>This external, open approach to liberating, aggregating and improving on vital public sector data, is a model we need to replicate across all areas of city, county, state and federal government in all sectors.</p>

The piece that I'm tracking on specifically right now is around the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/policy-memo">OMB Memorandum M-13-13</a> Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset, in which one of the items require agencies to publish a data.json file that provides a machine readable inventory of each agencies public data assets.</p>
<p>Much like the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/11-more-federal-departments-and-agencies-have-published-their-api-digital-strategies/">tracking I did around the digital strategy</a>, I've <a href="http://data.json.monitor.publicprivatesector.org/">stood up a monitoring script</a> that I got from <a href="https://github.com/philipashlock/farm-server">Philip Ashlock's Github</a>, which I will be running daily to track on which agencies have published their data.json in anticipation of the November 30th deadline. A handful of agencies already have their data.json file up, others show a green check, but in reality their HTTP status codes are incorrect, as <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/11/06/knowing-your-http-status-codes-in-federal-government/">I've talked about before</a>.</p>
<p>I'll re-run this script nightly and keep an eye on which agencies publish their data.json and highlight what types of data sets they've made available. I think in reality, the challenges faced in taking inventory of open data, getting them published will prevent many agencies from making the deadline. Something that was just made worse by the government shutdown in October.</p>
<p>Even with these challenges, I'm hopeful that agencies will surprise us and publish some amazing stuff.</p>

<p>I'm totally thankful for the experiences I've had over the last 90 days in Washington D.C. as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and even more thankful I'm able to keep doing much of the work I was doing during my fellowship. In reality, I'm actually doing more work now, than I was in DC.</p>
<p>While there were several challenges during my time as a PIF, the one that I regret the most, and is taking the longest to recover from, is losing my storytelling voice. This is my ability to capture everyday thoughts in real-time via my Evernote, sit down and form these thoughts into stories, and then share these stories publicly as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>During my time in DC, I was steadily losing my voice. It wasn't some sort of government conspiracy. It is something that seems to happen to me in many institutional or corporate settings, amidst the busy schedule, back to back meetings and through a more hectic project schedule--eventually my voice&nbsp;begins to fade.</p>
<p>In July I wrote 61 blog posts, August 41 and September 21. A very scary trend for me. My blog is more than just just stories for my audience and page views generated. My blog(s) are about me working through ideas and preparing them for public consumption.</p>
<p>Without storytelling via my blog(s) I don't fully process ideas, think them through, flush them out and think about the API space with a critical eye. Without this lifecycle I don't evolve in my career, and maintain my perspective on the space.</p>
<p>In October I've written 28 posts and so far in November I've already written 27 posts, so I'm on the mend. In the future, I'm using my voice as a canary in the coal mine. If a project I'm working on is beginning to diminish my voice, I need to stop and take a look at things, and make sure I'm not heading in a negative direction.</p>

<p>Sometimes no matter how hard you try, you can't get the buy in for APIs within a company or organization. There are many reasons why API efforts will fail within entrenched companies, organizations or government agencies, but in the end you may have to look for alternatives.</p>
<p>If you want to fullfill your API vision, many times you will need to go outside normal operations to get things done. I have multiple projects on my plate right now that have been started as internal projects, but after hitting roadblock after roadblock, key players have approached me to consider doing as an outside project.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to get people interested in APIs, is to get everyone around them talking about APIs or even getting key partners to adopt an API driven approach to a problem. If you can get traction for an API design externally, you may be able to change attitudes.</p>
<p>APIs are about opening up resources for access and use. If you can't get an API designed, developed and deployed internally, consider maybe doing it from the outside-in.</p>

<p>While API Commons is about providing a place to house these very technical design specifications, the largest benefit of API commons will be the process  , community and culture that will form around it. Bringing API design across government and industries out into the open, focusing on sharing, collaboration, reuse and operability will be the true end product--not just the tangible API definition.</p>
<p>As I work on a handful of new API designs for various projects, that I plan on putting in the commons when ready, the importance of API Commons becomes ever clearer. While the end goal appears to be populating the commons with API designs, the real work is about bringing everyone out of the shadows, working on their API designs in a collaborative, re-usable way.</p>

<p>I'm doing a lot more API deployments from dead simple data sources since I started working in the federal government. As part of these efforts I'm working to put together a simple toolkit that newbies to the API world can use to rapidly deploy APIs as well.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I worked through the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">simple, open API implementations</a>, and this week <span>I want to show how to secure access to the API by requiring an AppID and AppKey which will allow you to track on who has access to the API.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.openshift.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openshift/openshift-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm working on a variety of ways that anyone can easily deploy API on common cloud platforms. I'm working through a series of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">open</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/secure-api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">secure</a>, modular API demos written in PHP, using the Slim framework.</p>
<p>All of these demos are pretty basic, but currently I'm deploying them on Amazon EC2, because it is where most of my infrastructure runs and a top platform with wide user base. Ultimately my goal is to make them as simple to deploy as I possibly can, and while EC2 is definitely the leader, I know there are even simpler ways to launch simple APIs in the clouds.</p>
<p>I was doing a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/1zVJwxQfyBw">survey of which PaaS platforms government agencies allow their workers to deploy projects on</a>, via the US government API group and was reminded of <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a>, from Redhat. If you aren't familiar with OpenShift, it is a PaaS platform that allows you to define applications in a variety of languages, then deploy, automate, manage and scale in a very modular way.</p>
<p>With OpenShift I can define a very modular application, such as an API running PHP, using Slim framework and even apply what is known as a database cartridge, providing MySQL or Postgres storage for the API--all with a single command line.  I can instruct each application to derive its code from a Git location, allowing me to manage a central library of applications, then deploy specific instances as needed.</p>
<p>While I'm heavily using Github as the primary place to deploy <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">single page applications</a>, that are completely written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON, I still need server side locations to rapidly deploy API driven resources in PHP, Python, Ruby and Node.  OpenShift is a much more modular approach that AWS, and while I'll still be using Amazon for many of my deployments I'm going to play around more with what is possible on OpenShift.</p>
<p>What I really like about this approach, in addition to the modular design is that I can maintain blueprints for common APIs on Github and reference these designs when deploying APIs via OpenShift. This matches up well with what I'm doing with <a title="api.ongithub.com " href="http://api.ongithub.com">api.ongithub.com</a> and <a title="data.ongithub.com" href="http://data.ongithub.com">data.ongithub.com</a> where I working to define simple Git driven approaches to open data and APIs.</p>
<p>Good stuff, I look forward to playing around more.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/introducing-data-ongithub/">Introducing Data Ongithub</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://data.ongithub.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/github/github-matrix.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am a big fan of opening up data in city, county, state and federal government and across companies of all shapes and sizes. One thing I've learned in my 20+ years of working with data is that when it comes to data management, the spreadsheet is king. While there are always centralized database systems at companies and government organizations, the spreadsheet is actually how data is generally managed, shared and distributed by the average person.</p>
<p><a href="http://data.ongithub.com">Data Ongithub</a> is a project that is focused on tapping the wealth of data available in spreadsheet form and provide a simple platform for converting and managing open data, that anyone can use. While working on open data initiatives I consistently see two major hurdles for individuals who are opening up data:</p>
<blockquote><strong>How Do I Convert My Data To JSON?</strong> JSON is the reigning open data format. It is a light-weight, portable, machine readable format and is the preferred format of programmers over CSV or XML. Even with this popularity there is no common way for individuals to easily convert common data formats like Excel, CSV or XML to JSON without being a programmer.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Where Do I Put My Converted JSON Data Files?</strong> Once users are able to convert their data in JSON, they quickly struggle with where they should put these files to make publicly available.  Even though website hosting is widely available and inexpensive, users have not associated open data with online website storage. Especially within government organizations, individuals struggle with easy storage of their open data files.</blockquote>
<p>Data Ongithub looks to address both these concerns by delivering a lightweight application for conversion of Excel and CSV files to JSON formats, that is developed completely in client-side JavaScript, which means it can run anywhere in any browser. Since it is JavaScript, Data Ongithub lends itself to running completely on the social coding platform Github, which in this scenario acts as the backend storage for the application.</p>
<p>Data Ongithub can be forked and deployed to run under any Github account as a Github page. Every Github repository starts as a master branch, then once you add a Github Page, it adds a gh-pages branch to the repository. Data Ongithub uses the gh-pages branch as the user interface of the application and then employs the master branch as the backend JSON file storage.</p>
<p>Using <a title="oauth.io" href="http://oauth.io">oAuth.io</a>, Data OnGithub enables completely client-side authentication using Github oAuth, and if a user is a member of the repository, they are allowed to not just upload and convert common open data file formats, but also save them as JSON files to the master repository.  This approach creates a self-contained data conversion, management and storage platform that if you keep open source, is completely free to operate.  Think of it as a "pod" for your open data.</p>

<p>I'm working on a series of simple scripts that help people deploy APIs from some of the most common data sources. I'm starting with a series of PHP scripts, and a couple weeks ago I did a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">public Google Spreadsheet to API demo</a>, and this week I want to show how to secure access to the API by requiring an AppID and AppKey which will allow you to track on who has access to the API.</p>
<p>For this PHP implementation, I'm using the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">SLIM framework</a>, which provides a dead simple REST framework you can use to deploy an API from a variety of data sources.   To begin deploying an API from your Google Spreadsheet datastore, download the REST library and upload to your server that runs PHP.</p>
<p>Slim is pretty straightforward to work with, to add each API endpoint you just add a single PHP file under methods. For this how-to guide we are going to add a simple endpoint from our spreadsheet products data store.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7104824.js"></script>
<p>Next you just add an include reference in the index page for your slim implementation. Everything up until now was the same as the open public Google Spreadsheet to API solution, but not on the index page we will wrap the entry point to the API, with a <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale API Management</a> layer. 3Scale is free to sign up and you pay as you scale, so all it takes to get going is register for a 3Scale account and choose the base account, and under your account settings you will find your key to link this code to your account.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7510004.js"></script>
<p>This API just uses ID, Name, Price and Description of the product, and queries by a simple query parameter. You can use this as a template for your own product database, adding and removing fields as you need, or completely retrofitting for any database table.  That is it, now you have a simple product API that pulls a list of products from a Google Spreadsheet data store.</p>
<p>There are any number of reasons you would want to secure an API driven from a Google Spreadsheet file, to offer advanced search, filtering or just to track on who is accessing resources. This solution just uses 3Scale to secure the API interface, requiring an AppID and Appkey to use the API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully that demonstrates a simple approach to securing an API that is driven from a Google Spreadsheet file.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439653.js"></script>
<p>Before all of this works you need to have an oAuth token, which I created a simple script to handle:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439681.js"></script>
<p>I leave it to you to figure out where you want to store your oAuth tokens, and other goods. I use a config.php file, but can easily be done from database or other:</p>

<p>This week I got a sneak peak of the Smithsonian EDAN API which provides access to meta data of collections housed at the Smithsonian Institute, along with the ability to tag items and build collections.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian is <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/luce-foundation-center-hackathon-tickets-7945919459">holding a hackathon this weekend</a> and I wanted to contribute what I could, so I pulled together a PHP code library as I explored and hacked not the Smithsonian EDAN API.

<p>Up next: I was asked for some feedback on the FDA Recall API that is in pre-production currently, and I thought, what better way to offer feedback on API design than actually <a href="http://api.fda.publicprivatesector.org/swagger/kinlane/recalls/recalls">sculpting a Swagger definition of the changes</a> and making it <a href="http://fda-data.github.io/fda-recalls/">usable via Github</a>.</p>
<p>Overall the FDA Recall API design was perfectly suitable for launch, even though the interface isn't perfect and some of the data is pretty messy, but I'm a big fan of just getting things out there, letting developers hack on it and gather feedback for the next iteration.</p>
<p>The existing FDA Recall API allows you to pull weekly recalls for 5 separate product types including Food, Drugs, Veterinarian, Devices and Biologics. Using the API you can pull each week listing of recalls as well as pull detail on individual recalls.</p>
<p>To get a handle on where they should take the interface I needed to hack on it like I was a developer, so I setup a proxy that runs on AWS EC2 and started coding against each endpoint, then adjusting a Swagger definition until I had something that was acceptable for a v.01.</p>
<p>You can find the result of this work over at the <a href="http://fda-data.github.io/fda-recalls/">FDA Recall API working project I stood up on Github</a>, it should work until they make any adjustments to the pre-production API. You can follow any work I do on <a href="http://fda-data.github.io/developer/index.html">FDA open data and APIs at the main project site</a> I setup.</p>

        <p><a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/ed/fafsa-form.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was asked to help put some thought into an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid iniative. First, what is FAFSA:</p>
<blockquote>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requires to determine your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The government conducts a &ldquo;need analysis&rdquo; based on financial information, such as income, assets, and other family information, which you (and your parents if you are a dependent student) will be asked to provide.</blockquote>
<p>I'm just getting started with this project, and as I do with all my Public / Private Sector work, I created <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">an umbrella site for my Department of Education open data and API work</a>, and created an individual project site just for the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">Free Application for Federal Student Aid API</a>.</p>
<p>You can participate in the design and development process via the <a href="https://github.com/ed-data">Gitihub repositories</a>, and feel free to ping me @kinlane if you want to get involved. I will post stories here, and on the individual site to chronical its progress, and reference on API Evangelist when applicable.</p>
<p>Next up, understanding what the details of the FAFSA form are, and start considering what some possible architectural designs might work for FAFSA...</p>

<p>I am a programmer with a full understanding of how to deploy, consume and put APIs to use. Even with this knowledge and ability I'm continually blown away by the opportunities APIs afford, even without possessing any programming skills whatsoever.</p>
<p>One API I depend on for my daily monitoring of the API space is the <a title="Pinboard API" href="https://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard API</a>. As I browse the web, using the Pinboard bookmarklet I can pin any web page for use later, then using the Pinboard API I pull these curated pages into my monitoring, reporting and story development platform. To take this feature one step further, when I star a Tweet on Twitter, Pinboard watches this and automatically bookmarks the Tweet, adding it to my curation as well.</p>
<p>This approach to using APIs has allowed me to define how I use bookmarking as well as what a favorited Tweet means in my personal world of online curation. Using APIs I'm able to wield this power, and drive my story curation and development lifecycle. Of course I wrote the code that interfaces with Pinboard API, but it still shows the ability to define and execute actions in my world using APIs.</p>
<p>As I was pondering this self-defined action that I use on a daily basis, I was trying to think of any new actions that I could define and add to my toolbox. I was looking through the <a title="Youtube Videos from APIStrat Conference" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat?feature=watch">Youtube videos from my recent #APIStrat conference</a>, and I thought how nice it would be to turn these into audio segments available as podcasts through SoundCloud. After a quick search I found an IFTTT recipe that does this automatically when I flag any Youtube video for watching later and automatically uploads as an audio file to SoundCloud. Sweet!</p>
<p>This type of action again shows the power of being able to define and execute your own actions that you can take in your everyday worlds, but in this case you don't have to be a programmer to make it work. Using APIs I was able to define further meaning beyond just watching a video for later, something that ultimately increases the chance I will be able to consume a topic via my SoundCloud iPhone player as I'm walking somewhere, waiting for a plane or who knows where. Also #APIStrat gets the added benefit of syndication to SoundCloud as part of the action.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to educate the masses that these potential recipes for taking action exist out there in the world, but it definitely makes me optimistic for the future of APIs and how they can benefit anyone, even if you aren't a developer.</p>

<p>I just found an interesting brainstorm going on via Github, about how to make government more efficient and interoperable using APIs, that was created by government consultant Leah Bannon (<a href="https://twitter.com/leahbannon">@leahbannon</a>), called <a title="If Gov Then That" href="https://github.com/leahbannon/if-gov-then-that/">If Gov Then That</a>.</p>
<p>The idea?  <strong>Promote gov APIs by making them dead simple and suggesting clever recipes (like IFTTT and Zapier)</strong></p>
<p>Leah has started a rough list of some possible recipes, but needs your help to brainstorm what you'd like to see for developing interoperability and automation recipes in our government.</p>
<p>You can contribute via the <a href="https://github.com/leahbannon/if-gov-then-that/">Github project</a>, on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/no4TjQFGfaw">conversation thread she started on the US Government APIs Google Group</a>, and she will be working on as part of <a href="http://codefordc.org/">Code for DC</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-google-docs.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm working on a series of simple scripts that help people deploy APIs from some of the most common data sources. I'm starting with a series of PHP scripts, and next up is a private Google Spreadsheet to API, using JSON stored in Github.</p>
<p>For this PHP implementation, I'm using the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">SLIM framework</a>, which provides a dead simple REST framework you can use to deploy an API from a variety of data sources.   To begin deploying an API from your Google Spreadsheet datastore, download the REST library and upload to your server that runs PHP.</p>
<p>Slim is pretty straightforward to work with, to add each API endpoint you just add a single PHP file under methods. For this how-to guide we are going to add a simple endpoint from our JSON products data store.</p>
<p>This project also depends on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/">Google Drive API</a> and I use the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-api-php-client/">Google API PHP Client</a> to connect to Google and provide necessary oAuth connectivity.&nbsp;</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439653.js"></script>
<p>Before all of this works you need to have an oAuth token, which I created a simple script to handle:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439681.js"></script>
<p>I leave it to you to figure out where you want to store your oAuth tokens, and other goods. I use a config.php file, but can easily be done from database or other:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439703.js"></script>
<p>Next you just add an include reference in the index page for your slim implementation:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439726.js"></script>
<p>This API just uses ID, Name, Price and Description of the product, and queries by a simple query parameter. You can use this as a template for your own product database, adding and removing fields as you need, or completely retrofitting for any database table.  That is it, now you have a simple product API that pulls a list of products from a private Google Spreadsheet data store.</p>
<p>This project is more excercise than anything else. I don't recommend deploying a public API driectly off a private Google Spreadsheet. Next up, will be to secure it using an <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API infrastructure provider like 3Scale</a>, and possibly build in some caching.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've been working through several demos of how to go from common data sources like MySQL and Google Spreadsheet to API over the last couple of weeks.  So far I have five basic working demos:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/21/deploy-api-mysql-to-api">MySQL to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/21/deploy-api-json-to-api">Local JSON to API</a></li>

<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api">Public Google Spreadsheet to API</a></li>
<li><a title="Private Google Spreadsheet to API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">Private Google Spreadsheet to API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These demos are meant to show how easy it is to deploy a simple API from common places you already have data stored. Right now I'm building them in PHP, but will also be building Python, Ruby and Node.JS versions.</p>
<p>These exercises are meant for my newbie readers but are also helping me see API deployment in different ways. I realize how difficult it is to write code that will work for all scenarios. There is a lot of custom work on the data store side, as well as possible the API side, making me feel like it is best to use an API definition in the middle.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the next phase of my API deployment tools will be about generating API definitions, which currently will be <a href="http://bit.ly/1j2KERU">Swagger</a>, but will also develop <a href="http://bit.ly/16ZTZYt">RAML</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a> versions of the same code eventually.</p>
<p>Once I have some data store to Swagger tooling I will evolve some of the code I have for generating APIs from Swagger definitions.</p>
<p>Then I will have the different custom parts decoupled from each other, all centered around an API definition and data model which I can publish in <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a> and evolve in an open, collaborative environment where everyone can benefit, and contribute to my API work.</p>

<p>I was working with Google APIs over the last couple days while building <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">Google Spreadsheet to API tools</a>. It gave me a chance to look around the <a href="https://developers.google.com">Google Developers Area</a> and rediscover some of the positive approaches the API pioneer brings to the table.</p>
<p>In this post I wanted to highlight the <a title="Google Drive Code Libraries" href="https://developers.google.com/drive/downloads">Google Drive Code Libraries</a>. While the Google approach isn't perfect, I think it sets a good bar for what can be achieved by API providers when delivering their own API code libraries.</p>
<p><a title="Google Drive Code Libraries" href="https://developers.google.com/drive/downloads"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-drive/google-drive-code-samples-2.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I think the languages represented are the baseline for any modern API, and all API providers should consider providing the following languages:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>.NET</li>
<li>Go</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p>Languages like Go and Node.js are definitely forward leaning, but represent very fast growing areas of the API integration space.</p>
<p>Java and Objective-C represent the mobile space, something API providers can't be ignoring in 2013.</p>
<p>If your target audience is the enterprise, you have to have .NET and Java as part of your API library.</p>
<p>PHP, Python and Ruby are the web staples, that are default for any API that is catering to general web developers.</p>
<p>It should get easier to generate code libraries automatically for API providers who have developed some sort of API definition for their APIs, but for others you will still have eto hand-roll your own code lbiraries.</p>

<p>Complete mobile applications is a great way to showcase what a complete API integration will look like, helping developers see the end goal clearly, while also teaching them best practices.</p>

<p>I've created a new playground for some of my work. Pretty much everything at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> runs on Github, and each new project I produce starts its life as a Github repository.  To support this work I established a new domain called ongithub.</p>
<p>My first series in the ongithub realm is based upon an approach I'm using to deploy very simple APIs, while also introducing and educating people about APIs. I have a handful of simple API designs from working in the government, so I married them with data models derived from <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>, and publish over 10 very simple API design patterns.</p>
<p>Every one of these demo APIs began as a simple <a title="swagger" href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger specification</a>, which I quickly spun into a web API using the <a title="SLIM REST Framework" href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim REST Framework</a>, then generated a simple API microsite complete with interactive documentation.</p>
<p>These Swagger specifications were the seed of the recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/05/3scale-launches-api-commons-to-allow-developers-to-share-apis-under-creative-commons-licenses/">API Commons that 3Scale and API Evangelist just launched</a>. I have plenty of other API designs laying around, but this seemed like a good way to seed the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> with some simple and common designs.</p>
<p>You can find the following 11 designs at <a title="api.ongithub.com" href="http://api.ongithub.com">api.ongithub.com</a>:</p>

<p>Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) from API infrastructure provider <a title="API infrastructure provider" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist launched a new partner project yesterday at <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag</a>, that we are calling <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.  The mission with API commons is to provide a simple and transparent mechanism for the copyright free sharing and collaborative design of API specifications, interfaces and data models.</p>
<p>For a space that is about open access and interoperability the API industry has been very closed about their API designs, and after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/02/helping-eff-urge-the-courts-to-block-copyright-claims-in-oracle-v-google-api-fight/">helping the EFF urge the courts to block copyright claims in the Oracle v. Google API fight</a>, Steve and I thought it would be a good idea to introduce an API commons that would help put the "open" into API designs and data models, and back into the API space in gernal.</p>
<p>API Commons is build entirely on Github and is meant to act as a common index of API definitions and data models that <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">anyone can add by generating what we are calling an API Commons Manifest</a> that points to your API definition(s). Using the existing layers of Github, anyone can fork, favorite or follow the best API design patterns and eventually help establish some clear best practices across any government or business sector.</p>
<p>Everything you need to get going is on the site at <a title="apicommons.org" href="http://apicommons.org">apicommons.org</a>. You can join the discussion on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/api-commons">Google Group</a> or by <a href="https://twitter.com/apicommons">following us on Twitter</a>. We are in early stages, but will be dedicating a great deal of time over the holidays to get more API definitions in the commons.</p>
<p>3Scale and I strongly believe that API Commons is what the API industry needs to help deal with some of the clutter in the number of API designs, incentivize the development of open and common tooling around the best API designs and bring reuse, collaboration and copyright concerns out into the open.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/open-government-partnership.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"> </a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">On the second anniversary of the </a><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">Open Government Partnership (OGP)</a>, where we are celebrating a "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/10/31/fact-sheet-marking-progress-second-anniversary-open-government-partnersh">global effort to encourage transparent, effective, and accountable governance</a>", and that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>OGP has grown to 60 countries that have made more than 1000 commitments to improve the governance of more than two billion people around the globe.  OGP is now a global community of government reformers, civil society leaders, and business innovators working together to develop and implement ambitious open government reforms and advance good governance.</em></p>
<p>That is some pretty significant platform growth! While reading this I'm reminded of how any amount of perceived growth and value delivered via an "open data or API platform" can be immediately muted by the omission of very fundamental building blocks like privacy.</p>
<p>Let's review the building blocks of the Open Government Alliance:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Expand Open Data -&nbsp;</strong>Open Data fuels innovation that grows the economy and advances government transparency and accountability.  Government data has been used by journalists to uncover variations in hospital billings, by citizens to learn more about the social services provided by charities in their communities, and by entrepreneurs building new software tools to help farmers plan and manage their crops.  Building upon the successful implementation of open data commitments in the first U.S. National Action Plan, the new Plan will include commitments to make government data more accessible and useful for the public, such as reforming how Federal agencies manage government data as a strategic asset, launching a new version of Data.gov, and expanding agriculture and nutrition data to help farmers and communities.</li>
<li><strong>Modernize the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) -&nbsp;</strong>The FOIA encourages accountability through transparency and represents a profound national commitment to open government principles.  Improving FOIA administration is one of the most effective ways to make the U.S. Government more open and accountable.  Today, the United States announced a series of commitments to further modernize FOIA processes, including launching a consolidated online FOIA service to improve customers&rsquo; experience and making training resources available to FOIA professionals and other Federal employees.</li>
<li><strong>Increase Fiscal Transparency -&nbsp;</strong>The Administration will further increase the transparency of where Federal tax dollars are spent by making federal spending data more easily available on USASpending.gov; facilitating the publication of currently unavailable procurement contract information; and enabling Americans to more easily identify who is receiving tax dollars, where those entities or individuals are located, and how much they receive.</li>
<li><strong>Increase Corporate Transparency -&nbsp;</strong>Preventing criminal organizations from concealing the true ownership and control of businesses they operate is a critical element in safeguarding U.S. and international financial markets, addressing tax avoidance, and combatting corruption in the United States and abroad.  Today we committed to take further steps to enhance transparency of legal entities formed in the United States.</li>
<li><strong>Advance Citizen Engagement and Empowerment -&nbsp;</strong>OGP was founded on the principle that an active and robust civil society is critical to open and accountable governance.  In the next year, the Administration will intensify its efforts to roll back and prevent new restrictions on civil society around the world in partnership with other governments, multilateral institutions, the philanthropy community, the private sector, and civil society.  This effort will focus on improving the legal and regulatory framework for civil society, promoting best practices for government-civil society collaboration, and conceiving of new and innovative ways to support civil society globally.</li>
<li><strong>More Effectively Manage Public Resources -&nbsp;</strong>Two years ago, the Administration committed to ensuring that American taxpayers receive every dollar due for the extraction of the nation&rsquo;s natural resources by committing to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).  We continue to work toward achieving full EITI compliance in 2016.  Additionally, the U.S. Government will disclose revenues on geothermal and renewable energy and discuss future disclosure of timber revenues.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can you argue with that? Its very sensible set of open government platform building blocks right? However, when you look at the bigger picture you realize there is a significant building block, that us in the tech sector have realized is essential to a healthy platform ecosystem missing:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Citizen Data Privacy -</strong> Ensuring that government respects the online privacy of each and every U.S. citizen, preventing unwanted harvesting of private data or meta data that exists in cloud environments, computer and mobile devices as well as transported across telecommunications infrastructure locally or abroad. When privacy is compromised in the name of law enforcement or national security, the laws, rules and procedures around these accepted situations are made publicly accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is great that our government is committed to expanding open data, increasing transparency and efficiently engaging citizens, and sensibly manage public resources. However if our government wants to act as an open platform, just like any private sector platform, they must respect user privacy.</p>
<p>Without ensuring privacy for users, it doesn't matter how forward thinking your open data, information and API strategy is. Privacy and security are essential building blocks any private or public sector entity looking to build an open platform.</p>
<p>Nice work around the Open Government Partnership, but without addressing the privacy of citizens it is rendered pretty useless.</p>

<p>This API just uses ID, Name, Price and Description of the product, and queries by a simple query parameter. You can use this as a template for your own product database, adding and removing fields as you need, or completely retrofitting for any database table.

<p>I'm doing a lot more API deployments from dead simple data sources since I started working in the federal government. As part of these efforts I'm working to put together a simple toolkit that newbies to the API world can use to rapidly deploy APIs as well.</p>
<p>Currently I have four separate deployment blueprints done:</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/bureau-of-labor-statistics/bureau-of-labor-statistics-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm working to expand my awareness of APIs in our federal government by spending time each week discovering, reviewing and trying to brainstorm ways to expand and evolve existing government API efforts.</p>
<p>Today I was reviewing the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics API</a>, where I was pleased to find this valuable labor data available via single series, multiple series, one or more series specifying years.  The API is a pretty straightforward web API, which could use some polishing, but overall it provides machine readable access to this very important data as I would expect.</p>
<p>When I look at federal government APIs I'm trying to find at least one or two ways to help move the API forward, either as constructive criticism for the API providers or ways that the public (me included) can help evolve the community or the API itself from the outside.</p>
<p>My current contributions to the Bureau of Labor Statistics is to add support for the Series ID to the API stack. The Series ID is the single, central parameter you pass to each of the API endpoints, but nowhere does it link to or help the users understand the Series ID, which plays a central role in API operations.</p>
<p>This type of omission by API providers is common. You have the domain expertise in your area, you know the Series ID is the central character, but to people stumbling across or intentionally pulling up the Bureau of Labor Statistics API, this might not be common knowledge.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the roadmap of the Bureau of Labor Statics API should include an API for all of the building blocks and meta data for the Series ID. <a href="http://www.bls.gov/help/hlpforma.htm">There is a lot of rich data available on a Series ID</a>, and while it would take a significant amount of work to develop additional APIs around this data, I think it would significantly add value to the Bureau of Labor Statistics API and increase adoption.</p>
<p>I'm adding this to my list of potential future projects, which could be done external to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but also could be something they may consider doing internally as well.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>During the recent federal government shutdown many sources of open data and APIs were suddenly rendered unavailable, including the flagship <a href="http://www.data.gov/">Data.gov</a>. As government workers went home and lights were turned off at federal agencies, so too were the servers that hosted much of the open data and APIs that have been opened up in the last couple years.</p>
<p>Across the web I've encountered discussions from many individuals who state this is how government services work. When government funding disappears, the government services go away, suck it up.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable in the Internet age. If you see things this way, you are part of the machine that allows government services to be used as a political tool. I agree, that human powered government services go away when funding disappears, but in the age of open data, APIs and the cloud, services are designed and deployed to be self-service and highly available.</p>
<p>When you launch APIs in the cloud, you bundle your budget, service level agreement and the tech into a single package. My funding went away this month and couldn't afford my AWS bill on 10/1, but my server didn't shut down the minute the shutdown happened. I had until the end of the month. Ideally the federal government could go with reserved instances annually or at least quarterly, securing the funding needed to outlast any shutdown.</p>
<p>Even with my heavy usage of AWS for much of my infrastructure, the majority of my world runs on open repositories on Github. I have carefully crafted my public presence using open formats like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON and host these as openly licensed, public repositories that I can operate as no cost the social coding platform.</p>
<p>There is no excuse for government open data data and API services to go away during a shutdown like we just experienced. Open data and APIs represent a new, self-service future for government services. This model won't ever completely replace vital government services, but augment the physical services we depend on every day.</p>
<p>The fact that open data and API driven services are bundled with legacy web and physical government services represents a lack of vision, passion and drive to push government services into the digital age. If an agency is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> making assets available via open data or APIs, or is bundling them along with other legacy services, they are allowing these services to be used political tool in the current Washington D.C. game.</p>
<p>Let's make sure that open data and APIs are not federal government services business as usual in DC. C'mon it is 2013!</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/universal-library-sign.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The primary mission of API Evangelist is to spread awareness of APIs amongst the masses, expanding the audience beyond just the IT crowd, and developer community. Initially I wanted to make sure business leaders understood the potential of APis, so that they funded API initiatives within their companies. In 2012 I feel that APIs have hit a critical mass, and while I still evangelize APIs to business leaders I'm shifting a portion of my focus to the average Internet user.</p>
<p>APIs impact almost every aspect of our daily lives from logging into Facebook on our mobile phones to purchasing gasoline at the corner gas station. As API usage spreads across business, the government and the Internet of Things (IoT), the everyday citizen will be using APIs more and more each day. While many of these citizens will never hack on an API at the code level, I'm seeing a need emerge for everyone individual to be aware of APIs, much like they need a certain level of economic and financial awareness in every day life.</p>
<p>When it comes to our world of finances, every single adult must have a certain level of awareness of how our financial system operates. You don't need to understand the inner workings of banking and global markets, but you need to know how to setup a bank account, apply for credit or debit cards, balance your checkbook and pay your taxes. As our lives move online and the API economy grows, our data is fast becoming the online currency on Internet platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, the need for us to understand the mechanisms at play in this new digital economy increases.</p>
<p>Virtually every platform we use online employs APIs in some capacity. These platforms use APIs and often an open authentication standard called oAuth to allow us to give access to our data that resides on platforms to the applications and other systems we use daily. We login to news and media sites using our Facebook login, we give access to our Instagram photos to scrapbooking applications using oAuth and APIs and much more. If you use Facebook or Pinterest on your cell phone, you are using APIs daily.</p>
<p>Much like your bank accounts, you are giving access to your Facebook or Pinterest accounts to 3rd parties, and you don't want just any companies application to make deposits or withdrawals of information without your knowledge. This is where a certain level of awareness around APIs and oAuth comes into play. As an average user you may not need to actually handle an oAuth token or parse JSON, but you will initiate the oAuth flow regularly and potentially import and export JSON data between systems regularly.</p>
<p>In the API economy users will initiate potentially thousands of transactions daily, in contrast to the handful of transactions you may initiate via your credit cards and bank accounts. Yet we have less literacy around APIs than we do about these financial systems. We are giving financial management courses in high school and college, and are required to take them as part of debt management, divorce and bankruptcy cases. Similar awareness around APIs, security and privacy is needed for the average citizen in the Internet age.</p>
<p>When I tell developers or the technically savvy user that I'm educating the masses about APIs, they often state that there is no reason the average person will ever need to know about APIs. Consciously or subconsciously this is part of the current climate of Internet technology and the exploitative stance Silicon Valley investors have set into motion. The Facebooks and Twitters of the world do not want you understanding how your data is being accessed and transacted, because behind the curtain they are profiting from your information, which is the lifeblood, currency and value of the API economy.</p>
<p>I will continue to work for more API and oAuth literacy amongst the "normals", establishing at least a high level awareness of how the API economy works within in every online citizen, helping evolve toward a more web literate society, which will benefit everyone, even Silicon Valley--whether they like it or not.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.mapbox.com"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mapbox/mapbox-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>On June 29th, 2006, Google launched Google Maps API allowing developers to put Google Maps on their own sites using JavaScript. The API launch was just shy of 6 months after the release of Google Maps as an application, and was in direct response to the number of rogue apps developed that were hacking the application--demonstrating the demand for a JavaScript based, API driven mapping solution for developers.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 7 years, and maps are a central fixture of virtually every web and mobile application we depend on daily. While Google Maps is still the heavyweight in the space, their now classic map interface, proprietary tooling and search centric mindset leaves a huge opportunity for disruption in the app economy, and the venture capital firm <a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/">Foundry Group</a> is betting that startup mapping provider <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> is the solution that will de-throne Google, with a <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/10million-funding-foundry-group/">10M investment in MapBox</a>&nbsp;earlier today.</p>
<p>What makes MapBox such a good investment? At first look, it is clear that MapBox is winning over developers and existing players like Foursquare and Evernote by providing very clean, attractive mapping solutions that contain street, terrain and satellite layers, but when you take a closer look at the platform, you see the MapBox allure isn't just about maps. The value of MapBox is also about their approach to delivering a platform that begins with a heavy focus on open specifications, embracing of APIs, heavy investment in JavaScript, and a knowledge of modern cloud architecture, with strong support for mobile apps.</p>
<p><strong>Open Specifications</strong><br />In 2013, when you are looking to deploy a true platform, you have to shed your self-centered approach to technology, do your homework on what are the best practices and standards that exist across your industry, and don't re-invent the wheel or try to keep things closed and proprietary, making everything you do a two-way street that benefits the entire ecosystem. This is how you establish a true platform ecossytem, one that developers will believe in and embrace. This is what MapBox has done by building their platform around four very critical open mapping specifications:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec">TileJSON</a></strong> - TileJSON is a standard format for describing various aspects of a map and makes for an easy entry point for loading, showing, and describing maps, allowing developers to keep track of information about maps,where their tiles are stored, their centerpoints, bounds, supported zoom levels, markers data, attribution, and more.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec">simplestyle-spec</a> </strong>- The simplestyle spec is a practical approach to describing visual markers on a map, for styling markers and maintaining a distinction between content and visual styling can be tricky when annotating maps.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec">mbtiles-spec</a></strong> - The mbtiles specification is an open approach to storing<span>&nbsp;tiled map data in&nbsp;</span><a href="http://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a><span>&nbsp;databases for immediate usage and for transfer, making invidual tiles portable and easily migrated between apps and systems.</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/mapbox/utfgrid-spec">utfgrid-spec</a></strong> - UTFGrid is a format for interactive data that uses JSON and can be transferred tile-by-tile to fit maps of any scale, allowing scalable interaction of maps within applications.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.mapbox.com"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/openstreetmaps/openstreetmap-logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Open standards help provide grounding anchors for any platform, and MapBox is going all in, by not just employing these four open specifications--MapBox is also entirely powered by <a title="OpenStreetMap" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.500/-0.100">OpenStreetMap</a>, an active community of tens of thousands of dedicated open source mappers who keep MapBox maps up to date and accurate in a real-time, crowdsourced way.</p>
<p>The approach MapBox is taking to building their platform on top of an existing open platform, and embracing the best of breed open standards, sends a signal to its fast evolving ecosystem, that MapBox is not just about building out their own intellectual property like Google, Bing, Apple and other providers are. MapBox is  about investing in an open ecosystem of maps, standards, tools and resources that benefit the entire world of mapping.</p>
<p><strong>API Driven Integration </strong><br />MapBox provides static and REST API access to all aspects of the mapping platform providing developers with programmatic interfaces for all aspects of the mapping ecosystem. Developers can work with maps, tiles, markers and geocoding services directly via API interface, and use SSL to secure integration, and JSONP to integrate with mapping services across any domain.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Layers</strong><br /> The ability to customize every layer of a map, making it as meaningful as possible to each application is the future of mapping. MapBox allows for the development of custom maps, markers and related data, allowing developers to define mapping layers as containers of rich context that will benefit the end-user experience and establish millions of virtual map tiles and layers as rich stores of geo and context relevant information.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mapbox/mapbox-streets.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p><strong>Next Generation Architecture</strong> <br />MapBox reflects the latest approaches to scalable, real-time platform development using Node.js, a JavaScript driven approach that delivers high input / output throughput which naturally scales on top of a redundant, distributed cloud infrastructure deployed using Amazon Web Services. The MapBox approach to architecture is fast becoming the standard for API driven, scalable platforms, something that developers and companies are recognizing provide the elastic base that web and mobile applications are demanding.</p>
<p><strong>Ubiquitous JavaScript </strong><br />The use of JavaScript is present across all aspects of MapBox, from the server-side Node.js platform to client-side MapBox.js JavaScript API. MapBox has developed MapBox.js as a plugin that leverages Leaflet, an existing, leading open-source JavaScript library that provides the basic ability to embed a map into a page, and handles the fundamental operation of map interaction. MapBox employs JavaScript to provide a resilient back-end, the embeddable and client side tools developers have grown used to, while also extending its embrace of existing open standards, by integrating with the existing mapping frameworks like Leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Focused </strong><br />MapBox identifies that mobile is a major driver of the growing role maps are playing in our daily lives, with a GPS in all of our pockets, and providing realtime location data to applications. MapBox has invested in providing iOS SDKs for developing rich mapping solutions for the iPhone, including native mapping based upon Apple's MapKit with their MapBox MBXMapkit. Beyond mobile specific SDKs, the MapBox API provides many mobile focused resources including the ability to optimize resolution of mapping images and overall access via modern, mobile friendly web APIs.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mapbox/mapbox-mobile.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p><strong>Simplicity Rules </strong><br />The simple, attractive approach to mapping that MapBox introduces goes being just the visual, with simplicity being a key aspect in the deployment and management of MapBox integrations. MapBox has expanded the opportunity within map layers for developers with many advanced features, but MapBox also provides a suite of ready-to-go HTML, CSS and JavaScript bundles for rapid copy / paste of maps by publishers and hackers who only know enough tech to be dangerous. MapBox also provides an add-on script for Google Docs Spreadsheets called Geo, that lets anyone geocode arbitrary addresses and export spreadsheets as GeoJSON that works fluently with MapBox maps.</p>
<p><strong>Priced to Scale&nbsp;</strong><br />The pricing of cloud platforms are always an immediate signal of the potential of an ecosystem, and developers have been trained to be weary and avoid deeply integrating with platforms who do not have a clear business model. MapBox has a four tier pricing framework starting at $5 a month, then stepping up to $49, $149 and up to $499 a month. MapBox base pricing is derived from map views and storage with an additional rate for any overage charges. MapBox pricing reflects modern cloud utility pricing that provide developers with an essential pay-as-you-go model, ensuring a healthy approach to monetization that is doable for developers, covers MapBox operating costs while also generating sensible revenue for the company.</p>
<p><strong>Serious Client Portfolio</strong><br /> MapBox isn't just a favorite for the usual alpha tech developer community. The existing portfolio of MapBox users includes tech heavyweights like Foursquare, Evernote, Github and Uber including leading news and media groups like NPR, US Today, Financial Times and National Geographic. This is just a sampling of some of the best known brands who have embraced MapBox, and understand the importance of custom, open attractive maps that compliment their brand, while also providing the best user experience possible.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mapbox/mapbox-foursquare.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p><strong>A Platform Blueprint </strong><br />The MapBox approach to delivering their platform by building it on top of existing open standards, baking in APIs access to all resources, while embracing the latest architectural design patterns that focus on lightweight JavaScript and JSON, and having a mobile focus that operates in the cloud, is more than just a blueprint for a successful mapping platform. MapBox is a model that other cloud platforms can follow in their own operations, focusing on simplicity, customization and all the vital features that make a platform truly an open, vibrant ecosystem, while still employing a viable business model.</p>
<p>The opportunity for mapping solutions in the new app economy makes Foundry Group's investment in MapBox a wise one, but it is the embracing of open standards, APIs, JavaScript, the cloud and mobile that will make that investment return at a scale that I think will surprise even the Foundry Group, and deliver similiar to that of existing platforms like Github.</p>
<p>MapBox is a model of how successful technology ecosystems will deliver the resources developers will need to build the next generation of web and mobile applications.</p>

<p>I'm working through the schedule for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference (#APIStrat) in San Francisco</a>, preparing for the 3Scale / API Evangelist produced event October 23rd through 25th.</p>
<p>I'm pretty excited about the lineup we've managed to assemble including keynotes from Pamela Fox (<a href="https://twitter.com/pamelafox">@pamelafox</a>) from Khan Academy, Daniel Jacobson (<a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>) of Netflix, Wynn Netherland (<a href="https://twitter.com/pengwynn">@pengwynn</a>) from Github and Kristin Calhoun (<a href="https://twitter.com/KCalhoun">@KCalhoun</a>) the director of the Public Media Platform, just to name a few of them.</p>
<p>We've worked hard to put together <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/schedule.php">sessions that would speak to all aspects of the API spac</a>e including creation, design and documentation of APIs, API discovery, hypermedia APIs, API testing &amp; debugging, API marketing &amp; evangelism and business models. The goal was to cover topics from basic to advanced, while covering APIs from start to finish.</p>
<p>I'm particularly stoked about the location of the conference. It is right downtown at the <a href="http://www.parc55hotel.com/">Parc55 Hotel</a>, easy walking distance to and from anything.  I always hate conferences that are off the beaten path, and Parc55 will make it easy to hang out and eat, drink and network around the event before and after.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013NYC/">New York City edition of #APIStrat back in February</a> was sold out with over 350 people in attendance. San Francisco is also on track to be sold out, this time with over 600 people in attendance.  Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of 3Scale and I have a blast MC'ing the entire event and facilitating the API conversations, both business and technology, and gearing up to make sure #APIStrat flows.</p>
<p>Make sure and <strong><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/register.php">GET REGISTERED</a></strong>. It was painful to turn away everyone last time, and I'd hate for you to not be able to get in. It is going to be an informative three days with the people who make the API space move forward. I look forward to seeing you there.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time finding valuable data sets and manually converting, processing and outputting into more usable formats, so that they can be used in APIs that drive mobile and web applications.</p>
<p>I am always on the lookout for new tools that will help me be more efficient in to my work. I'm currently test driving a new platform called <a href="http://delray.io/">Delray</a> that focuses on taking an older concept of extract, transform and load (ETL) and bringing it into the API age by allowing me to define common data resources as inputs, process them one time or on schedule and output data in a cleaner, more usable format.</p>
<p><a href="http://delray.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/seabourne/delray/DelRay-Inputs-Processors-Outputs.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Using Delray I can define an input from CSV, JSON, MSSQL and other common formats, and save this as the input for my workflow.</p>

<p>Next I can setup a configure a cleansing stage to process the data, allowing me to trim whitespace, replace space, make lowercase and other common things I tend to do manually with my data sets.</p>

<p>Finally I can output the CSV inputed data as a JSON file for use in my APIs and other open data efforts.</p>

<p>Delray represents the next generation of tools that will turn anyone into a data steward, allowing non-developers to take control of critical data flows within your business, organization or government agency.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/tag-cloud-education.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>In 2010 when I started API Evangelist I saw the technological potential of APIs, but while the rest of the online space was focused on what APis could do for developers, I was focused on what APIs could do for the average person.  APIs don't just open up access for developers, they open up access for end-users, introducing interoperability, data portability and ultimately tools that give them control over their own data, content and other valuable resources.</p>
<p>This realization has been central to my mission at API Evangelist, which is about educating the masses about APIs. What is an API? Why are APIs important? I strongly feel that APIs empower end-users to make better decisions about which platforms they use, which applications they adopt, and gives them more ownership, control and agency in their own worlds. When you help an individual understand they can host their own Wordpress blog and migrate from the cloud hosted version of Wordpress, or migrate their blog from Blogger to Wordpress via APIs, you are giving the gift of web literacy.</p>
<p>Leading technology platforms like Amazon, Google, eBay and Flickr have long realized the potential of opening up APIs and empowering end-users. Since then, thousands of platform providers have also realized that opening up APIs enables developers and end-users to innovate around their platform and services, and that there is much more opportunity for growth, expansion and revenue when end-users are API literate. Users are much more likely to adopt a platform and deeply integrate it into their personal or business lives, if they are able to connect it with their other cloud services, taking control and optimizing their information and work flow.</p>
<p>Helping business owners, developers and end-users understand the potential that APIs introduce is essential to the future of education, and will be the heart of a healthy and thriving economy. There is a key piece of technology that reflects this new paradign and is currently operating and thriving across the web, called oAuth. This open authentication (oAuth) standard provides the ability for platforms to open up access to content and data that enables developers to build web and mobile applications, but in a way that gives the control to end-users, who are ulimately the owners of a platforms content and data, and are the target of the applications that developers are building.</p>
<p>oAuth has introduced a new online dance, that is widely known as three-legged authentication, and is being used across common platforms from Google to Facebook, allowing end-users, developers and platforms to interact in a way that makes the Internet go round.  If any of these three legs are out of balance and security or privacy is compromised, or one of the players is not educated and exploitation occurs, the cycle quickly breaks down. This delicate balance encourages all three legs to be educated, empowered and in control over their role in this critical supply chain of the Internet.</p>
<p>Online platforms, and the web and mobile applications that are built on them, are playing an ever increasing role in every aspect of our personal, professional and public lives, from turning in class assignments in high school to paying our taxes as adults.  APIs and oAuth are being used as the pipes and gatekeepers for everything from photos and location data to our vital healthcare records. These online platforms will play a central role in our education from infancy to retirement, and being educated, aware and literate in how these platforms operate is essential to it all working--for everyone involved.</p>

<p>The future of education depends on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all online platforms</span> providing access, interoperability and data portability, while also fully respecting end-users privacy and security and investing in their education about these features and the opportunities they open up.  Education will continue to exist within traditional institutions, but will persist throughout our lives in this new online environment. It is imperative that every citizen possesses a certain level of web literacy to be able to learn, grow and evolve as a human being in this increasingly digital society.</p>
<p>I will be speaking at <a href="http://openva.org/2013/10/09/minding-the-future-program-at-a-glance/">OpenVA, Virginia&rsquo;s First Annual Open and Digital Learning Resources Conference</a> on this topic and continue to work this message into my overall API Evangelist message. The link between APIs, the access they provide, and education is critical. It is something that I feel provides just as many opportunity for exploitation as it does for benefiting end-users, developers and platforms--requiring a great deal of transparency and scrutiny.</p>
<p>Lots to think about, and discuss. &nbsp;I look forward to seeing you at University of Mary Washington for OpenVA.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/defrag-2013/DEFRAG-2013-2.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend the year going from city to city, attending conferences, meet-ups and hackathons--speakng, networking and doing the things that makes my world go around. Every November I find myself a little spun out from the year and need to Defrag my brain, re-organize what I know and re-enforce the most meaningful relationships across my professional career.  This is is done in Broomfield Colorado each November at the <a href="http://defragcon.com/2013/">Defrag Conference</a>.</p>
<p>I arrive the evening before the conference at the Omni Interlocken Resort. It is late at night, the lobby is empty and I walk up to the counter and quickly get my room from the young lady running the desk. I turn around to head to the elevators and notice Brad Feld(<a href="https://twitter.com/bfeld">@bfeld</a>) sitting on the couch, lost in his phone. I spend some time engaging him about the latest trends in technology and investing and the current political climate in the country before I head off to bed.  Where else do you get casual focus time with folks like Brad, then at Defrag?</p>
<p>In the morning I wake up, grab some coffee and pastries and head for the main stage. As I walk in I feel like I've walked into a 1980's rock concert as I'm blasted a classic rock soundtrack from Tom Petty to AC/DC.  I grab a seat in the dark and as I'm waiting for keynotes to start I notice I've accidently joined a table of the cloud computing mafia ranging from Alex Williams(<a href="https://twitter.com/alexwilliams">@alexwilliams</a>)&nbsp;of TechCrunch to cloud pundit Ben Kepes (<a href="https://twitter.com/benkepes">@benkepes</a>) of <a href="http://diversity.net.nz/">Diversity.net.nz</a>.</p>
<p>The morning moves by fast with a engaging array of talks from Amber Case of Esri, to Paul Kedrosky of Bloomber and Kauffman Foundation. After they are done, I roll out of the main stage and get in line for some lunch, which is the only conference lunch I will actually eat, as the Omni Interlocken catering is not the normal fare.</p>
<p>As soon as I'm done I weave in and out of the session stages absorbing talks ranging from business and tech investing, to developer marketing as well as deep dives into data architecture, but I notice one growing trend this year--APIs. Defag's sister event GlueCon was the OG(Original Gangster) API event, but as APIs move from the future of technology into reality across all aspects of the business world, APIs become part of every session at Defrag as well.</p>
<p>After the sessions I go back to main stage for another mind blowing assortment of talks around identity, security, privacy and of course some more APIs, and a very important talk on imperative of women in technology.  Just at the point where I feel like my brain can't absorb any more, the doors open and Eric Norlin, our host, let's us go for the evening.</p>
<p>Before the official reception begins, I need to get some nourishment, so I run over to the Tap Room and devour an assortment of sliders and enjoy an IPA to wash down the enormous amount of API knowledge I had to absorb today. Alright, now I'm ready for some networking at the reception.</p>
<p>I quickly realize the Defrag reception is just an appetizer for a long evening of meaningful conversations with the who's who in the technology space. I spend the next 7 hours bouncing from table to table, toasting with the likes of Mike Maney(<a href="https://twitter.com/the_spinmd">@the_spinmd</a>) the Spin Dr himself, Andy Thurai of Intel and Uri Sarid of <a href="http://mulesoft.com">Mulesoft</a>, to name just a few. Drink after drink I re-enforce existing relationships and make numerous other new connections with faces I might know from their Twitter photos, but haven't actually had the chance to meet in person and take the connection to the next level.</p>
<p>Its 2 AM. With a head full of IPAs and APIs I head off to bed, knowing I have another full two days of this! When I'm done I know I can head home for the holidays, finish off the year properly with the one event I will never miss, because I know my year will not be complete and properly closed out if I miss it.</p>
<p>I hope to see you at <a href="http://defragcon.com/2013/">Defrag</a>, and have a chance to buy you a beer!</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/baas-trends.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just got off the phone with a new Backend as a Service provider <a href="http://bizmobify.com/">BizMobify</a>, who is looking to deliver BaaS services to the enterprise.  The timing for the call couldn't be better, as I'm updating up my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/08/overview-of-backend-as-a-service-baas-white-paper/">BaaS white paper</a> this week, and one thing I'm expanding is looking at it through the enterprise lens.</p>
<p>As I dust off my research on BaaS I'm re-visiting my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/08/overview-of-backend-as-a-service-baas-white-paper/">BaaS research site</a> and re-watching the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mobile-Back-end-Service">BaaS Panel from API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC</a> last February. This is helping me understand where the space what last winter and early spring.</p>
<p>As we move into the last quarter of 2013 I'm reminded of how fast the BaaS space is maturing. There are new providers continuing to enter the space, but I also see continued energy and releases from the BaaS leaders like Parse and Kinvey.</p>
<p>Kinvey, AnyPresence and StackMob will all be at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php">#APIStrat on October 24th and 25th in San Francisco</a>. While we won't be having another BaaS focused panel, they will be sharing their insight on the space in separate sessions.</p>
<p>From my vantage point I see BaaS providers being a key channel for API providers to reach developers in 2014, and definitely an area I will keep tracking on and working to understand.</p>
<p>If you are an API provider, you should be paying attention to BaaS providers, because they offer a channel for your API resources to reach developers. Developers may not care about your resource all by itself, but when bundled with the best of breed BaaS tools as well as other API resources, it may look much more appealing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/data-gov/data-gov-shutdown.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>The federal government shutdown today. At the Department of Veterans Affairs we are still working through next monday, so it was business as usual today for me.</p>
<p>One of my projects is preparing a list of APIs and data assets for a hackathon in NYC that is focusing on developing apps for veterans, called <a href="http://feastongood.com/2013/conference/hackathon">The Feast</a>. My goal is to aggregate a list of as many usable assets as possible so developers don't have to go to multiple locations to locate them.</p>
<p>Many of the assets are available at <a title="VA.gov" href="http://www.va.gov/">VA.Gov</a>, but there are others that I knew were on <a title="Data.gov" href="http://data.gov">Data.Gov</a>. As soon as the page loaded at Data.Gov, I got a friendly message:</p>
<blockquote><em>Due to the lapse in federal government funding, this website is not available. We sincerely regret this inconvenience.</em></blockquote>
<p>Basically, no data for me. No datasets for download, no APIs allowing me access information.  Which leaves me questioning the entire reason I'm in government. I came here to open up data and build APIs, then convince you to use them in your applications, widgets, visualizations and other innovation projects.</p>
<p>It is my way to find a way around <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANY</span> obstacle. There is nothing that will stop me. I will keep working no matter what. However, this is a pretty big obstacle, something that makes me question my faith in APIs in government. I can deal with just about anything, but if I evangelize APIs, that can be turned off at any point, for an unknown amount of time? Ummm&hellip;WTF? Unnacceptable!!</p>
<p>There is always a work-around. I will find a solution that will work for me(and you), but it leaves me questioning quite a bit about this API evangelism from within the federal government.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure to connect with the talented Code for America fellow, Moncef Belyamani(<a href="https://twitter.com/monfresh">@monfresh</a>)&nbsp;this week and talk about a very meaningful API project, called the <a title="The Ohana API" href="http://ohanapi.org/">Ohana API</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The Ohana API is a project from the San Mateo County team of Code for America fellows that is aiming to create open access to community social services, with an initial emphasis on food security."</em></p>
<p>I couldn't' think of a more important use of APIs, than making sure people can find the soical services they need--especially services that ensure people are fed.</p>
<p>I'm also impressed with the approach of <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/&lrm;">Code for America</a> in giving Github a central role in the project. The <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/">API project</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohanakapa-ruby/">API wrapper in Ruby</a> and a cool <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-pdf/">API to PDF generator</a> are all available on Github.</p>
<p>The Oahana API is only in alpha, they are looking for people to help the Code for America team take it to the next level with approaches to keep the data current and developing an SMS interface.</p>
<p>The Ohana API project itself, and the model used by Code for America, provides an important blueprint for how technology can be applied, and make a difference in our daily lives in a scalable way.</p>
<p>This type of work keeps me coming back back and working on API Evangelist, even after three years of covering a space that often leaves me pretty discouraged.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Sep 2013</span>
        <p>I'm working on taking inventory of data assets at the Department of Veterans Affairs. While eventually this will include private data assets, in the beginning we are focusing on data that can be made public without being worried about personally identifiable information or health information.</p>
<p>There are a lot of hurdles to get over, including educating people about what is a data asset, as well as the process of identifying, preparing, publishing and listing the data assets in a publicly available marketplace.</p>
<p>We are at the point where everyone is looking around for potential data assets that can be included in the current open data inventory cycle.  It is proving to be a challenge for folks to find datasets they can include. To help the process along I've set my focus on the public website, va.gov, and finding data that has already been published in various formats on the site.</p>
<p>Data and content is already available on the public web site represents the low hanging fruit when it comes to identifying open data that should be made available in machine readable formats like JSON and XML as well as available in APIs.</p>
<p>This approach works in both the public and private sector. If you feel it is valuable enough to have on your already, it is a perfect candidate to make available as open data or API.  Once you get the hang of identifying, processing and publishing this open data and APIs, you can start the much more difficult process of looking for harder to identify data sets and resources.</p>

<p>I'm playing with different approaches to rapidly design, develop, deploy and manage APIs using Github. While about 90% of what I'm building runs on Github, there is still about 10% that runs on Amazon EC2.</p>
<p>There are just some aspects of a proper API interface that I can't do on Github. My recent prototypes use swagger and allow for much of the API interactions to occur via Github. I a working to carve off any elements I can from the architecture, including using JSON files stored at Github as the database backend for the API.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If you look at my recent <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/dev-hub/index.html">Dev Hub</a> prototype, you can browse the API interface, thanks to <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>, and when you make API calls to the endpoints via Amazon EC2, the REST interface is just acting as a search, filter and REST facade for the JSON files that are actually stored on Github--eliminating the need for a database backend.</p>
<p>This approach allows me to develop light-weight REST facades for JSON data stores as well as for other APIs. I'm playing around with different ways that I can use this thought process to push government APIs to the next level, and building on my earlier thoughts today on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/25/a-huge-need-for-writeable-apis-in-government/">need for writable APIs in federal government</a>.</p>
<p>I'm evolving earlier designs I have in my archives of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/17/beyondget-or-otherverbs-an-augmented-api-platform-/">BeyondGET or OtherVerbs, an Augmented API Platform</a>, where I'm looking to provide an augmented layer that makes existing APIs writable.  Marrying these legacy thoughts with my current approaches using Github plus EC2 APIs, I strongly feel that Github has huge potential for being a POST, PUT and DELETE layer for federal government APIs.</p>
<p>Using a REST facade on EC2 I can easily proxy existing government APIs, then using a swagger definition I could seamlessly weave in a POST, PUT and DELETE layer that would write to JSON files hosted at Github using the Github API.</p>
<p>I'm in early thoughts on this work, and will start playing with examples of how this can work with real, live government APIs.  I think it has legs though. I'm not very confident that we can get the government to allow users to write and update data via APIs without demonstrating the value of this. Which means we need to make it happen externally of government, show the value and then get buy in from key decision makers.</p>

<p>I asked a question on Twitter last night: <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/status/382685108014428160">Any examples of government APIs that allow for write (POST, PUT, PATCH) capabilities? I'm looking for existing agencies who have implemented already</a>. While I was asking for examples of APIs, by motivations were specifically about finding an example of terms of use for a government writable API.</p>
<p>After spending some time looking and listening to peoples responses, there isn't much in the wild when it comes to writable government APIs, however it is clear that there is a huge demand for writable APIs, and a lot of opinion that this could be the thing that changes how government operates for the better.</p>
<p>The best examples that my followers pointed me to was with the <a href="http://open311.org/">Open 311</a> iniative:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://dc.gov/DC/About+DC.Gov/Terms+and+Conditions#1">Washington, DC</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/mcg/user_rights.html">Montgomery County MD</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There was another DoD API that allows users to POST information, and then only allows them to only update their own information, but wasn't exaclty the open write I was looking for.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

</ul>
<p>Clay Johnson (<a href="https://twitter.com/cjoh">@cjoh</a>), the author of <a href="http://www.informationdiet.com/">The Information Diet</a>, has a great <a href="http://dobtco.github.io/fixing-procurement-ebook/final/fixing-procurement-ebook/#how-to-fix-procurement-2-up-the-api-game">post on how writable APIs can help fix the government procurement process</a>. Demonstrating one solid example of how government could be more efficient through the sensible use of APIs.</p>
<p>The biggest <a title="case study I can find of writable APIs in federal government was the IRS Modernized e-File system" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/15/irs-modernized-efile-mef-a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy-draft/">case study I can find of writable APIs in federal government was the IRS Modernized e-File (MeF) system</a>, but the goal of this research is to find an existing example of terms of use for writable APIs in the federal government, and after looking through all the e-File documentation I couldn't find any terms of use that covered developers submitting tax forms to the IRS via MeF web services.  I will spend more time looking, I'm sure they are in there somewhere.</p>
<p>If you know of any examples of of the federal government using APIs and allowing the public to to submit data, content or forms through APIs, please let me know.  It is something I will keep researching, writing about and advocating for.</p>
<p>Executing APIs as a two-way street is essential to successful API and open data strategies in both the public and private sector.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Sep 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/csv-converter/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/csv-converter-github.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to building applications within the federal government, there are numerous road-blocks to innovation. I'm currently assisting with the inventorying of open data assets at the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as across numerous other federal agencies.</p>
<p>The two biggest bottlenecks of this process are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>File Conversion</strong> - Converting Excel and CSV data assets into JSON and XML</li>
<li><strong>File Storage</strong> - Where do you put data assets once you have available in CSV, JSON and XML</li>
</ul>
<p>When I hit these road-blocks, it is my nature to find quick and dirty technical solutions (hacks) to get around these obstacles, and do it in a way that can be taught to others, allowing them to overcome these challenges in their own worlds.</p>
<p>The solution I've employed involved discovering and forking of a kick ass data conversion tool called <a href="https://github.com/shancarter/Mr-Data-Converter">Mr. Data Converter</a>, and quickly the tool retrofitted with some of my own enhancements:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/">HTML5 File API</a> - Allows me to acces file content without server side technology.</li>
<li><a title="oAuth" href="https://oauth.io/">oAuth.io</a> - Dead simple, client side oAuth for Github and other platforms.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/michael/github">Github.js</a> - A JavaScript API wrapper for Github, enabling client-side interaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>I quickly stripped down Mr. Data Converter to have only the features I desired, added a file upload capabilities that used the File API to access CSV files without a server side layer, then after authenticating with oAuth.io via Github, I used Github.js to post the original CSV and converted JSON or XML files directly to the same Github repo that the file conversion application runs in.</p>
<p>This approach allows me to run the Excel / CSV conversion app 100% on Github using Github Pages--an blueprint that allows anyone to fork and run within their own Github accounts.  I'll spend more time hardening the code, and documenting it, to make it easier to use, and empower anyone to use in their own open data inventorying initiatives.</p>

        <p><a href="http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/#api"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/fuck-yeah-markdown/fuck-yeah-markdown-api.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm slowly getting my blog world in order after the move from my own proprietary blogging platform to using Github + Jekyll hosted using Github Pages.</p>
<p>I've been using HTML pages for blog posts at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and other blogs, with 3 years of blog posts at API Evangelist and about 6 years at Kin Lane. There is a lot of legacy content to move from my EC2 driven blogs to Github.</p>
<p>Every time I would try and publish the posts as is, Github would reject my commit when it hit posts that didn't have compliant HTML, making it near impossible to publish everything.  I was trying to clean up as much of it as I could, but it wasn't good enough.  I needed a way to convert to markdown and clean house.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Ben Balter(<a href="/admin/blog/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a>) from Github recommend a very cool API called <a href="http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/#api">Fuck Yeah Markdown</a>, which takes my legacy HTML pages and converts it to much cleaner markdown.</p>
<p>When I first started using Jekyll I wasn't really sold on markdown, in my mind I didn't mind hand rolling my HTML tags--I have been doing it for years. After Ben suggested I use markdown in my newly minted Github Jekyll projects I started to see the benefits.  It is way easier to manage content that is being published as a blog, page or otherwise when it is markdown.</p>
<p>I am just finishing up converting all of API Evangelist and Kin Lane to use markdown, and will be using the <a href="http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/#api">Fuck Yeah Markdown API</a> to convert blog posts from HTML generated in my blog editor to markdown before publishing to Github.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/bw-irs-logo.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/bw-irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>The Internal Revenue Service is the revenue arm of the United States federal government, responsible for collecting taxes, the interpretation and enforcement of the Internal Revenue code.</p>
<p>The first income tax was assessed in 1862 to raise funds for the American Civil War, and over the years the agency has grown and evolved into a massive federal entity that collects over $2.4 trillion each year from approximately 234 million tax returns.</p>
<p>While the the IRS has faced many challenges in its 150 years of operations, the last 40 years have demanded some of the agency's biggest transformations at the hands of technology, more than any time since its creation.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the IRS began wrestling with the challenge of modernizing itself using the latest computer technology. This eventually led to a pilot program in 1986 of an new Electronic Filing System (EFS), which aimed in part to gauge the acceptance of such a concept by tax preparers and taxpayers.</p>
<p>By the 1980s, tax collection had become very complex, time-consuming, costly, and riddled with errors, due to what had become a dual process of managing paper forms while also converting these into a digital form so that they could be processed by machines. The IRS despereatly needed to establish a solid approach that would enable the electronic submission of tax forms.</p>
<p>It was a rocky start for the EFS, and Eileen McCrady, systems development branch and later marketing branch chief, remembers, &ldquo;Tax preparers were not buying any of it--most people figured it was a plot to capture additional information for audits." But by 1990, IRS e-file operated nationwide, and 4.2 million returns were filed electronically. This proved that EFS offered a legitimate approach to evolving beyond a tax collection process dominated by paper forms and manual filings.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="even-federal-agencies-cant-do-it-alone" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#even-federal-agencies-cant-do-it-alone"></a>Even Federal Agencies Can't Do It Alone</h3>
<p>Even with the success of early e-file technology, the program did not get the momentum it needed without the support of two major tax preparation partnerships--H&amp;R Block and Jackson-Hewitt. These helped change the tone of EFS efforts, making it more acceptable and appealing to tax professionals. It was clear that e-File needed to focus on empowering a trusted network of partners to submit tax forms electronically, sharing the load of tax preparation and filing with 3rd party providers. And this included not just the filing technology, but a network of evangelists spreading the word that e-File was a trustworthy and viable way to work with the IRS.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/irs-efile-logo.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/irs-efile-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="bringing-e-file-into-the-internet-age" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#bringing-e-file-into-the-internet-age"></a>Bringing e-File Into The Internet Age</h3>
<p>By 2000, Congress had passed IRS RRA 98, which contained a provision setting a goal of an 80% e-file rate for all federal tax and information returns. This, in effect, forced the IRS to upgrade the e-File system for the Internet age, otherwise they would not be able meet this mandate. A working group was formed, comprised of tax professionals and software vendors that would work with the IRS to design, develop and implement the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Modernized-e-File-(MeF">Modernized e-File(MeF)</a>-Program-Information) system which employed the latest Internet technologies, including a new approach to web services which used XML that would allow 3rd party providers to submit tax forms in a real-time, transactional approach (this differed from the batch submissions required in a previous version of the EFS).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="moving-beyond-paper-one-form-at-a-time" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#moving-beyond-paper-one-form-at-a-time"></a>Moving Beyond Paper One Form At A Time</h3>
<p>Evolving beyond a 100 years of paper process doesn't happen overnight. Even with the deployment of the latest Internet technologies, you have to incrementally bridge the legacy paper processes to a new online, digital world. After the deployment of the MeF, the IRS worked year by year to add the myriad of IRS forms to the e-File web service, allowing software companies, tax preparers, and corporations to digitally submit forms into IRS systems over the Internet. Form by form, the IRS was being transformed from a physical document organization to a distributed network of partners that could submit digital forms through a secure, online web service.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="technological-building-blocks" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#technological-building-blocks"></a>Technological Building Blocks</h2>
<p>The IRS MeF solution represents a new approach to using modern technology by the federal government in the 21st century Internet age. In the last 15 years, a new breed of Internet enabled software standards have emerged that enable the government to partner with the private sector, as well as other government agencies, in ways that were unimaginable just a decade ago.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="web-services" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#web-services"></a>Web Services</h3>
<p>Websites and applications are meant for humans. Web services, also known as APIs, are meant for other computers and applications. Web services has allowed the IRS to open up the submission of forms and data into central IRS systems, while also transmitting data back to trusted partners regarding errors and the status of form submissions. Web services allow the IRS to stick with what it does best, receiving, filing and auditing of tax filings, while trusted partners can use web services to deliver e-Filing services to customers via custom developed software applications.</p>
<p>Web services are designed to utilize existing Internet infrastructure used for everyday web operations as a channel for delivering trusted services to consumers around the country, via the web.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="an-xml-driven-communication-flow" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#an-xml-driven-communication-flow"></a>An XML Driven Communication Flow</h3>
<p>XML is a way to describe each element of IRS forms, and its supporting data. XML makes paper forms machine readable so that the IRS and 3rd party systems can communicate using a common language, allowing IRS to share a common set of logic around each form, then use what is known as schemas, to validate the XML submitted by trusted partners against a set of established business rules that provide enforcement of the IRS code. XML gives the ability for IRS to communicate with 3rd party systems using digital forms, applying business rules to reject or accept the submitted forms, which then can be stored in an official IRS repository in a way that can be viewed and audited by IRS employees (using stylesheets which make the XML easily readable by humans).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="identity-and-access-management-iam" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#identity-and-access-management-iam"></a>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h3>
<p>When you expose web services publicly over the Internet, secure authentication is essential. The IRS MeF system is a model for securing the electronic transmission of data between the government and 3rd party systems. The IRS has employed a design of the Internet Filing Application (IFA) and Application to Application (A2A) which are features of the Web Services-Interoperability (WS-I) security standards. Security of the MeF system is overseen by the IRS MITS Cyber Security organization which ensures all IRS systems receive, process, and store tax return data in a secure manner. MeF security involves an OMB mandated Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) Process, requiring a formal review and testing of security safeguards to determine whether the system is adequately secured.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="business-building-blocks" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#business-building-blocks"></a>Business Building Blocks</h2>
<p>To properly extend e-File web services to partners isn't just a matter of technology. There are numerous building blocks required that are more business than technical, ensuring a healthy ecosystem of web service partners. With a sensible strategy, web services need to be translated from tech to business, allowing partners to properly translate IRS MeF into e-filing products that will deliver required services to consumers.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="four-separate-e-filing-options" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#four-separate-e-filing-options"></a>Four Separate e-Filing Options</h3>
<p>MeF provided the IRS with a way to share the burden of filing taxes with a wide variety of trusted partners, software developers and corporations who have their own software systems. However MeF is just one tool in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.irs.gov/Filing">suite of e-File tools</a>. These include Free File software that any individual can use to submit their own taxes, as well as free fillable digital forms that individuals can use if they do not wish to employ a software solution.</p>
<p>Even with these simple options, the greatest opportunities for individuals and companies is to use commercial tax software that walks one through what can be a complex process, or to depend on a paid tax preparer who employ their own commercial versions of tax software. The programmatic web service version of e-file is just one option, but it is the heart of an entire toolkit of software that anyone can put to use.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="delivering-beyond-technology" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#delivering-beyond-technology"></a>Delivering Beyond Technology</h3>
<p>The latest evolution of the e-file platform has technology at heart, but it delivers much more than just the transmission of digital forms from 3rd party providers, in ways that also make good business sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster Filing Acknowledgements - Transmissions are processed upon receipt and acknowledgements are returned in near real-time, unlike the once or twice daily system processing cycles in earlier versions</li>
<li>Integrated Payment Option - Tax-payers can e-file a balance due return and, at the same time, authorize an electronic funds withdrawal from their bank accounts, with payments being subject to limitations of the Federal Tax Deposit rules</li>
<li>Brand Trust - Allowing MeF to evolve beyond just the IRS brand, allowing new trusted commercial brands to step up and deliver value to consumer, like TurboTax and TaxAct.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without improved filing results for providers and customers, easier payment options and an overall set of expectations and trust, MeF would not reach the levels of e-Filing rates mandated by Congress. Technology might be the underpinning of e-File, but improved service delivery is the thing that will seal the deal with both providers and consumers.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="multiple-options-for-provider-involvement" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#multiple-options-for-provider-involvement"></a>Multiple Options for Provider Involvement</h3>
<p>Much like the multiple options available for tax filers, the IRS has established tiers of involvement for partners to be involved with the e-File ecosystem. Depending on the model and capabilities, e-File providers can step up and be participate in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic Return Originators (EROs) - ERO prepare returns for clients or have collected returns from taxpayers who have prepared their own, then begin the electronic transmission of returns to the IRS</li>
<li>Intermediate Service Providers - These providers process tax return data, that originate from an ERO or an individual taxpayer, and forward to a transmitter.</li>
<li>Transmitters - Transmitters are authorized to send tax return data directly to the IRS, from custom software that connect directly with the IRS computers</li>
<li>Online Providers - Online providers are a type of transmitter that sends returns filed from home by taxpayers using tax preparation software to file common forms</li>
<li>Software Developers - write the e-file software programs that follow IRS specifications for e-file.</li>
<li>Reporting Agents - An accounting service, franchiser, bank or other person that is authorized to e-file Form 940/941 for a taxpayer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The IRS has identified the multiple ways it needed help from an existing, evolving base of companies and organizations. The IRS has been able to design its partner framework to best serve its mission, while also delivering the best value to consumers, in a way that also recognizes the incentives needed to solicit participation from the private sector and ensure efforts are commercially viable.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="software-approval-process" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#software-approval-process"></a>Software Approval Process</h3>
<p>IRS requires all tax preparation software used for preparing electronic returns to pass the requirements for Modernized e-File Assurance Testing (ATS). As part of the process software vendors notify IRS via an e-help Desk, that they plan to commence testing, then provide a list of all forms that they plan to include in their tax preparation software, but do not require that vendors support all forms. MeF integrators are allowed to develop their tax preparation software based on the needs of their clients, while using pre-defined test scenarios to create test returns that are formatted in the specified XML format. Software integrators then transmit the XML formatted test tax returns to IRS, where an e-help Desk assister checks data entry fields on the submitted return. When IRS determines the software correctly performs all required functions, the software is approved for electronic filing. Only then are software vendors allowed to publicly market their tax preparation software as approved for electronic filing -- whether for usage by corporations, tax professionals and individual users.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="state-participation" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#state-participation"></a>State Participation</h3>
<p>Another significant part of the MeF partnership equation is providing seamless interaction with the electronic filing of both federal and state income tax returns at the same time. MeF provides the ability for partners to submit both federal and state tax returns in the same "taxpayer envelope", allowing the IRS to function as an "electronic post office" for participating state revenue services -- certainly better meeting the demands of the taxpaying citizen. The IRS model provides an important aspect of a public / private sector partnership with the inclusion of state participation. Without state level participation, any federal platform will be limited in adoption and severely fragmented in integration.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="resources" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#resources"></a>Resources</h3>
<p>To nurture an ecosystem of partners, it takes a wealth of resources. Providing technical, how-to, guides, templates and other resources for MeF providers is essential to the success of the platform. Without proper support, MeF developers and companies are unable to keep up with the complexities and changes of the system. The IRS has provided the resources needed for each step of the e-Filing process, from on-boarding, to how to understanding the addition of the latest forms, and changes to the tax code.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="market-research-data" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#market-research-data"></a>Market Research Data</h3>
<p>Transparency of the MeF platform goes beyond individual platform operations, and the IRS acknowledges this important aspect of building an ecosystem of web service partners. The IRS provides valuable e-File market research data to partners by making available e-file demographic data and related research and surveys. This important data provides valuable insight for MeF partners to use in their own decision making process, but also provides the necessary information partners need to educate their own consumers as well as the general public about the value the e-File process delivers. Market research is not just something the IRS needs for its own purposes; this research needs to be disseminated and shared downstream providing the right amount of transparency that will ensure healthy ecosystem operations.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="political-building-blocks" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#political-building-blocks"></a>Political Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Beyond the technology and business of the MeF web services platform, there are plenty of political activities that will make sure everything operates as intended. The politics of web service operations can be as simple as communicating properly with partners, providing transparency, or all the way up to security, proper governance of web service, and enforcement of federal laws.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="status" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#status"></a>Status</h3>
<p>The submission of over 230 million tax filings annually requires a significant amount of architecture and connectivity. The IRS provides real-time status of the MeF platform for the public and partners, as they work to support their own clients. Real-time status updates of system availability keeps partners and providers in tune with the availability of the overall system, allowing them to adjust availability with the reality of supporting such a large operation. Status of availability is an essential aspect of MeF operations and overall partner ecosystem harmony.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="updates" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#updates"></a>Updates</h3>
<p>An extension of MeF platform status is the ability to keep MeF integrators up-to-date on everything to do with ongoing operations. This includes providing alerts when the platform needs to tune-in platform partners to specific changes with tax law, resource additions, or other relevant news of operations. The IRS also provides updates via an e-newsletter, providing a more asynchronous way for the IRS MeF platform to keep partners informed about ongoing operations.</p>
<p>Updates over the optimal partner channels are an essential addition to real-time status and other resources that are available to platform partners.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="roadmap" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#roadmap"></a>Roadmap</h3>
<p>In addition to resources, status and regular updates of platform status of the overall MeF system, the IRS provides insight into where the platform is going next, keeping providers apprised with what is next for the e-File program. Establishing and maintaining the trust of MeF partners in the private sector is constant work, and requires a certain amount of transparency -- allowing partners to anticipate what is next and make adjustments on their end of operations. Without insight into what is happening in the near and long term future, trust with partners will erode and overall belief in the MeF system will be disrupted, unraveling over 30 years of hard work.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="governance" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#governance"></a>Governance</h3>
<p>The Modernized e-File (MeF) programs go through several stages of review and testing before they are used to process live returns. When new requirements and functionality are added to the system, testing is performed by IRS's software developers and by IRS's independent testing organization. These important activities ensure that the electronic return data can be received and accurately processed by MeF systems. Every time an IRS tax form is changed and affects the XML schema, the entire development and testing processes are repeated to ensure quality and proper governance.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="security" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#security"></a>Security</h3>
<p>Secure transmissions by 3rd parties with the MeF platform is handled by the Internet Filing Application (IFA) and Application to Application (A2A), which are part of the IRS Modernized System Infrastructure, providing access to trusted partners through the Registered User Portal (RUP). Transmitters using IFA are required to use their designated e-Services user name and password in order to log into the RUP. Each transmitter also establishes a Electronic Transmitter Identification Number (ETIN) prior to transmitting returns. Once the transmitter successfully logs into the RUP, a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Handshake Protocol allows the RUP and transmitter to authenticate each other, and negotiate an encryption algorithm, including cryptographic keys before any return data is transmitted. The transmitter&rsquo;s and the RUP negotiate a secret encryption key for encrypted communication between the transmitter and the MeF system. As part of this exchange, MeF will only accommodate one type of user credentials for authentication and validation of A2A transmitters; username and X.509 digital security certificate. Users must have a valid X.509 digital security certificate obtained from an IRS authorized Certificate Authority (CA), such as like VeriSign or IdenTrust, then have their certificates stored in the IRS directory using an Automated Enrollment process.</p>
<p>The entire platform is accredited by the Executive Level Business Owner, who is responsible for the operation of the MeF system, with guidance provided by the National Institute of Standards (NIST). The IRS MITS Cyber Security organization and the business system owner are jointly responsible and actively involved in completing the IRS C&amp;A Process for MeF, ensuring complete security of all transmissions with MeF over the public Internet.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy" href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#a-blueprint-for-public--private-sector-partnerships-in-a-21st-century-digital-economy"></a>A Blueprint For Public &amp; Private Sector Partnerships In A 21st Century Digital Economy</h3>
<p>The IRS MeF platform provides a technological blueprint that other federal agencies can look to when exposing valuable data and resources to other agencies as well as the private sector. Web services, XML, and proper authentication can open up access and interactions between trusted partners and the public in ways that were never possible prior to the Internet age.</p>
<p>While this web services approach is unique within the federal government, it is a common way to conduct business operations in the private sector -- something widely known as Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), an approach that is central to a healthy enterprise architecture. A services oriented approach allows organizations to decouple resources and data and open up very wide or granular levels of access to trusted partners. The SOA approach makes it possible to submit forms, data, and other digital assets to government, using XML as a way to communicate and validate information in a way that supports proper business rules, wider governance, and the federal law.</p>
<p>SOA provides three essential ingredients for public and private sector partnership:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology - Secure usage of modern approaches to using compute, storage and Internet networking technology in a distributed manner</li>
<li>Business - Adherence to government lines of business, while also acknowledging the business needs and interest of 3rd party private sector partners</li>
<li>Politics - A flexible understanding and execution of activities involved in establishing a distributed ecosystem of partners, and maintaining an overall healthy balance of operation</li>
</ul>
<p>The IRS MeF platform employs this balance at a scale that is unmatched in federal government currently. MeF provides a working blueprint can be applied across federal government, in areas ranging from the veterans claims process to the financial regulatory process.</p>
<p>The United States federal government faces numerous budgetary challenges and must find new ways to share the load with other federal and state agencies as well as the private sector. A SOA approach like MeF allows the federal government to better interact with existing contractors, as well as future contractors, in a way that provides better governance, while also allowing for partnership with the private sector in ways that goes beyond simply contracting. The IRS MeF platform encourages federal investment in a self-service platform that enable trusted and proven private sector partners to access IRS resources in predefined ways -- all of which support the IRS mission, but provide enough incentive that 3rd party companies will invest their own money and time into building software solutions that can be fairly sold to US citizens.</p>
<p>When an agency builds an SOA platform, it is planting the seeds for a new type of public / private partnership whereby government and companies can work together to deliver software solutions that meet a federal agency's mission and the market needs of companies. This also delivers value and critical services to US citizens, all the while reducing the size of government operations, increasing efficiencies, and saving the government and taxpayers money.</p>
<p>The IRS MeF platform represents 27 years of the laying of a digital foundation, building the trust of companies and individual citizens, and properly adjusting the agency's strategy to work with private sector partners. It has done so by employing the best of breed enterprise practices from the private sector. MeF is a blueprint that cannot be ignored and deserves more study, modeling, and evangelism across the federal government. This could greatly help other agencies understand how they too can employ an SOA strategy, one that will help them better serve their constituents.</p>

<p>In preparation for the event I am working through my thoughts around potential monetization strategies and business models that will emerge in this fascinating adn scary new world where everything can be connected to the Internet---creating an Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p><strong>Where Is The Value In The IoT?</strong><br /> When it comes to monetizing APIs of any type, there first has to be value. When it comes IoT where is the value for end-users? Is it the device themselves, is it the ecosystem of applications built around a device or will it be about the insight derived from the data exhaust generated from these Internet connected devices?</p>
<p><strong>Evolving From What We Know</strong><br /> After almost 10 years of operating web APIs, we are getting a handle on some of the best approaches to monetization and building business models in this new API economy.  How much of this existing knowledge will transfer directly to the IoT? Freemium, tiered plans, paid API access and advertising--which of these existing models will work, and which won't.</p>
<p>Another existing model to borrow from when it comes to IoT is the telco space. The world of cellphone and smart phones are the seeds of IoT and one of the biggest drivers of the API economy. How will existing telco business models be applied to the world of IoT? Device subsidies, contracts, data plans, message volumes are all possible things that could be borrowed from the existing telco world, but we have to ask ourselves, what will work and what won't?</p>
<p><strong>Will Developers Carry the Burden?</strong><br /> When it comes to API access, developers often pay for access and the privilege of building applications on top of API driven platforms. Will this be the case in the IoT? Will the monetization of IoT platforms involve charging developers for API usage, number of users and features? Is this a primary channel for IoT device makers to make money off their products? In the beginning this may not be the case, with providers needing to incentivize developers to build apps and crunch data, but it is likely that eventually developers will have to carry at least some of the burden.</p>
<p><strong>Micro-Payment Opportunities</strong><br /> The payment industry is booming in the API Economy, but micro-payments are still getting their footing, doing better in some areas than others. Certain areas of IoT may lend itself to applying micro-payment approaches to monetization.  When you pass through toll booths or parking, there are clear opportunities for micro-payments to engage with Internet connected automobiles. Beyond the obvious, think of the opportunities for traffic prioritization--do you want intelligence on where you should drive to avoid traffic or possibly pay per mile to be in a preferred lane? Another area is in entertainment, in generating revenue from delivering music, audiobooks and other entertainment to drivers or passengers in IoT vehicles and public transportation.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-internet-of-things.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Will IoT Be All About The Data</strong><br /> As we sit at the beginning of the era of big data, driven from mobile, social and the cloud, what will big data look like in the IoT era. Will the money be all about the data exhaust that comes from a world of Internet connected device, not just at the individual device and the insight delivered to users, but at the aggregate level and understand parking patterns for entire cities or the electricity consumption for a region.</p>
<p><strong>Security Will Be Of High Value In IoT</strong><br /> We are already beginning to see the importance of security in the IoT world, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/13/the-perils-of-api-transport-over-the-public-internet/">missteps by Tesla</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/05/building-internet-of-things-products-you-better-secure-it-says-the-ftc/">camera maker <span>TRENDnet</span></a>. Will security around IoT be a monetization opportunity in itself?  Device manufacturers will be focused on doing what they do best, and often times will overlook security, leaving open huge opportunities for companies to step up and deliver b2b and b2c security options and layers for IoT. How much will we value security? Will we pay extra to ensure the devices in our lives are truly secure?</p>
<p><strong>I Will Pay For My Privacy In An IoT World</strong><br /> When all devices in my life are connected to the Internet, but also the world around me is filled with cameras, sensors and tracking mechanisms, how will privacy change? Will we have the opportunity to buy privacy in an IoT world? Will the wealthy be able to pay for the privilege of being lost in a sea of devices, not showing up on cameras, passed by when sensors are logging data? Privacy may not be a right in an IoT world it by be purely something you get if you can afford it. Will companies establish IoT business models and drive monetization through privacy layers and opportunities?</p>
<p><strong>A IoT Las Vegas for Venture Capital</strong><br /> With IoT centered around costly physical devices, and potentially large platforms and networks, will anything in the IoT space be able to be bootstrapped like the web 2.0 and mobile space was? Or will all IoT companies require venture capital? At first glance IoT looks like a huge opportunity for VC firms, allowing them to specialize for the win, or gamble on the space like they would in Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Will We Plan For Monetization Early On In IoT?</strong><br /> When it comes to IoT, it is easy to focus on the monetization the physical device, either leaving money on the table with new an innovative ways of generating revenue, or possibly having monetization strategies that are behind the scenes and not obvious to users--something that could be damaging to security, privacy and overall trust in the IoT space.</p>
<p>We learned a lot from mistakes made in early social, cloud and mobile API monetization. We need to make sure and have open conversation around healthy IoT business models and monetization strategies. Generating revenue from IoT needs to be a 3-legged endeavor that includes not just IoT platform providers, but sensibly includes ecosystem developers as well as end-users.</p>
<p>The world of IoT is just getting going, but is picking up momentum very quickly. We are seeing IoT devices enter our homes, cars, clothing, bodies and will become ubiquitous in the world around us, embedded in signs, doorways, roadways, products in rural and metropolitan areas.  It is clear there is huge opportunities to make money in this new Internet connected world, but let's make sure and have open conversations about how this can be done in sensible ways to make sure the IoT space grows in a healthy and vibrat way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://apps.npr.org/playgrounds/#playground-help" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/npr/accessible-playgrounds/ramps-to-play-components-600.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was impressed with some of the data journalism behind the recent NPR story, <a href="http://apps.npr.org/playgrounds/#playground-help" target="_blank">Playgrounds For Everyone, a community-edited guide to accessible playgrounds</a>.</p>
<p>The story is definitely an important one, but it is the data behind it I think is significant to highlight. You can download the data of the 1700 playgrounds in 20 different cities in a CSV and JSON format. Something I think is ripe for an API, by the way.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect is they are asking for submissions from the public, and they even provide a template Google spreadsheet, providing a framework for how the public should gather and organize data into a standard way, that NPR can import.</p>
<p>While I think this project could go further, I think it is an excellent example of using data journalism in public reporting.  The only suggestions I have is making the project a Github repository so the story, JSON and CSV can be versioned, forked and downloaded much more easily.</p>
<p>I think Google Spreadsheets and Excel templates are a perfectly acceptable way to gather data from the public and 3rd party sources. It allows you to solicit data from others in a format that they understand, while still making sure it is structured enough to easily merge with a master database.</p>
<p>Additionaly, it would be pretty easy to add the ability for users to email their spreadsheets to a central email address, and programmatically convert to JSON, and CSV, then commit to the Github repository that contains the master JSON and CSV files.  This way the repository administrator could accept or deny submissions as a pull request.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying seeing these scrappy spreadsheet, CSV and JSON solutions to data storytelling. Even if they aren't perfect I like seeing people play with different approaches, in hopes of finding an approach that works for them.</p>
<p>Lots to learn from. Nice work NPR.</p>

<p>George Reese has a very interesting post from last week over at O'Reilly. It is about an earlier post he did on the unpublished <a href="http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/08/tesla-model-s-rest-api-authentication-flaws.html">Tesla REST API</a>.&nbsp;I'll let you read the post, "T<a href="http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/09/the-myth-of-the-private-api.html">he Myth of the Private API</a>"--I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Reese talks about the mistakes made by Tesla, Phillips and other Internet of Things companies, when they take advantage of the power of web APIs, intending them to be private, but do not put any thought into what happens when you deploy APIs using the public without securing your API endpoints from unintended use.</p>
<p>I find a particular statement he made, fascinating:</p>
<blockquote><em>I sincerely believe that ultimately there is no such thing as a private API for consumption over the public Internet.</em></blockquote>
<p>After reading his post, I have to agree. I think many technology companies are just considering the Internet to be some sort of constant, magic transport layer for anything we want to use it for. I think this can be true to a point, but as the Intenret matures, we have slow down a bit and consider deeply the impact of our actions, and the way we use Internet enabled technology.</p>
<p>I wrote about a piece last week, which was about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/05/building-internet-of-things-products-you-better-secure-it-says-the-ftc/">first FTC case against an Internet of Things manufactuer</a>, camera maker TrendNet--where much like Tesla, they took no considerations for the fact they were using the open Internet to drive their technology, and more importantly no thought regarding the privacy of their consumers.</p>
<p>The world of APIs fascinates me. It reminds me of the bug zappers, where we are attracted by the openness and power of web APIs, but as you get closer and closer to the API light, you can easily get burned or zapped by the very thing that drew you in.</p>
<p>I strongly believe in the power of web APIs, but I think there will be a lot of unintended consequences from opening up data, resources and the devices that surround us, over the public Internet.  Make sure you are being thoughtful, and seriously considering security, privacy and the other potential repercussions of web APis before jumping in.</p>

<p>In government there is a fear of exposing public data via APIs--rightfully so. This is not just a government concern, it exists in all industries within each an every business and organization.  We all possess private data, and when opening up API driven resources, we need to make sure none of this is exposed in un-desired ways.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe, that after almost 10 years of public APIs, there isn't a reasonable solution to masking, scrubbing and anonymizing data that is made available via APIs.  I wrote about r<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/13/an-api-that-scrubs-personally-identifiable-information-from-other-apis/">esearch into finding a solution at UC Berkeley</a> a while back, but to date I have not seen any real solutions to this problem yet.</p>
<p>I was talking with another Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) the other day about possible solutions for making sure Personally Identifiable Information (PII) doesn't get exposed via government APIs. Afterwards, I got to thinking about possible API options, and I don't think it would be that difficult to get started with a basic solution.</p>
<p>My thoughts are, that you could provide a simple API proxy, that would terminate requests from any <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> defined APIs and easily iterate through each value and apply a series of regular expressions against it to look for common PII or other data that shouldn't be exposed.  The proxy could automatically replace with template values like John or Jane Doe for names, 1234 Street for addresses, etc.</p>
<p>API providers could set a list of areas they are concerned about exposing with the API proxy configuration, and it would enforce all filtering required. The proxy could also look for other common patterns, and make recommendations of other areas that could be masked, scrubbed or anonymized that the API provider didn't consider.</p>
<p>Technically it sounds like a pretty simple solution, that could get smarter and faster over time at identifying sensitive information, to better serve API providers.  This type of proxy could be default in healthcare, education and in other sensitive environments and be default in development environments, or in production environments that are accessible to non-trusted consumers.</p>
<p>Of course this is something I'd love to explore, but I just don't have the time to build it. This is something that wouldn't be too hard to build and evolve, and could have potentially huge impacts across many important industries, and go far to protect all of our sensitive data from potential privacy violations.</p>
<p>As with all of my ideas, I just want to share it publicly, in hopes someone will build it.</p>

<p>The more I immerse myself in government, I'm reminded of the central role that the spreadsheet plays in our business and government operations--primarily Microsoft Excel, but also in some circles, the Google Docs Spreadsheet.</p>
<p>While it is government that is bringing the spreadsheet front and center for me again, I'm reminded of days while working on SAP events and working on budgets, sessions and registrations lists that were past around in complex series of spreadsheets. After this I go further back in time, to the early 2000s when I worked in the non-profit sector, where database management was completely done in a myriad of group and individual spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Beyond the spreadsheet being the <a href="http://www.breakingviews.com/is-microsoft-the-quiet-villain-of-global-finance?/21081118.article">central villain in global operations</a>, I'm seeing it emerge as a character across the API landscape with <a href="http://octopart.com/blog/archives/2013/7/octopart-in-excel">Octobpart Electronics providing bill of materials management in Microsoft Excel that is driven from their API</a>, <a href="http://info.crunchbase.com/2013/06/06/crunchbase-excel-update/">CrunchBase adding 13,689 Companies and 1,462 venture rounds as an Excel download</a>, and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2013/08/twilio-from-excel-and-access.html">Twilio allowing users to make calls and send SMSs from spreadsheets</a>.</p>
<p>As much as us API geeks would love for people to deploy clean, sensibly designed APIs, that meet our visions of the future of APIs--the reality is that much of the worlds data is managed via the spreadsheet.  If we are truly going to deliver on the API economy, we have to consider the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>This spreadsheet bridge is not just about allowing users to publish data via APIs from spreadsheets, but also enabling every day users to cosume valuable API driven data and resources from their native spreadsheet. It has to be a two way street.</p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, the spreadsheet will continue to play a central role in the API space, and represents the future of acessing valuable corporate, non-profit and government resources for everyone.</p>

<p>Building off a similar topic this week, I was asked to dumb down or explain what I meant by "Loosely Coupled Services", alongside a "<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/07/library-of-modular-services/">Library of Modular Services</a>". In this case, loosely couple means independent technical and data services, in the same way you would access services that people are familar with in the mainstream business world.</p>
<p>Think of the services you would access and put to use around your home. Common household services like electrician, plumber, tile layer and sheet rocker. These each represent independent services you would access to tackle a home improvement project. While there is some overlap in these services, generally each service technician specializes in one area, doing one thing and doing it well. The slight overlap between an electrician and plumber would be considered the "loosely coupled" part, where there are dependencies between each specialized service, ie. the plumber needs an electrician to wire the dishwasher after he /she plumbs it.</p>
<p>The concept of loosely coupled services works well when it comes to APIs. The goal is to define APIs to do one thing and do it well, establishing a library of modular services that can be used across a company and organization, its partners as well as provide public access to the most commonly requested resources.  A simple example might be product catalog. You can deliver a web service that allows for accessing, searching and pulling details of products a company offers. All the web service knows how to do is find, list and provide info on products, nothing else. This product catalog will have loosely coupled dependencies with other inventory, shopping cart and coupon services, but in the end its very specialized.</p>
<p>Any organization or company will have a wide variety of potential services that can be defined. It is best to define these in as granular of a way as possible, keeping them entirely independent of other services, except for slightly coupling that allow them to consider certain interactions and facilitate interoperability. A loosely coupled services approach will allow you to mix and match different services for different project, minimizing dependencies and introducing complexity that down the road can be very hard to untangle.</p>

<p>I'm always looking for simpler and more concise language to describe API, while writing stories and white papers for my audience. I recently used the phrase "library of modular web services", in a presentation outline at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This white paper was intended for a non-technical, state government audience, and my collaborator on the presentation asked if I could dumb this phrase down a little for the audience, providing a simpler explanation.</p>
<p>In this case, I think certain phrases get co-opted by the developer and IT crowd, borrowing from the physical world, resulting in them having a perceived technical meaning, but when in reality they are still very rooted in their past, and can be easily explained by taking users back to their previous meanings. One perfect example of this is the phrase, a "Library of Modular Services".</p>
<p>Think of each book, in a physical library as an analogy of a single API service. Much like when building an application on top of API services, when you are developing a research paper in a library, you need a multitude of resources to bring your paper together. When you visit the library to conduct your research you can browse the library directory, find a wide variety of books you will need. Early on you will be testing out many of these books, then setting aside the books that do not deliver the value and information you are looking for.</p>
<p>When you find the specific resources you need, this is when the modular approach comes into play. For example, if you need a book on a specific artist from history, you aren't required to check-out the entire art history section, or even check-out all impressionists artists, you can go for a very specific artist like Monet or pick and choose from the impressionist resources you need.</p>
<p>Using this library analogy for API services works very well. As a company or organization, instead of just going to IT to get technical services, you can visit your library of modular services to find exactly the resources you need for your project.  Maybe your project is just creating a quarterly report, or maybe you want to create a visualization of product sales, all the way to launching a new mobile application.</p>
<p>To support employess in their work, each company should have a library where anyone in the can visit, browse, search and discovery the resources they will need for any project. This library can then be extended to have more marketplace features allowing external partners or even the public to come and browse the library of modular resources, just like they would the public library--allowing them to find just the services they need.</p>

<p>I work with some seriously smart people on a day to day basis, virtually across the web, and in person on some of the projects I'm working on in federal government. Much like APIs, Github is fast becoming a ubiquitous technology that people are using to manage their community, code, documents and much more.</p>
<p>Several times each week I encounter situations where Github is referenced as a potential platform for managing a new project, or cited wen talking about how to solicit feedback, engagement and participation across existing projects. I'm always amazed that in about 75% of these Github conversations, someone chimes in about how Github wouldn't be appropriate because of the barrier to entry for many users.</p>
<p>I find this barrier to entry perspective very interesting. Many of the uses of Github require no knowledge of, or the need to touch code. One meeting in particular, was about providing feedback on the next steps of <a href="http://data.gov">data.gov</a>, when a participant referenced that for users who weren't technical, but wanted to provide feedback, they should use a separate forum to submit feedback.</p>
<p>To understand this I pulled up the data.gov site, clicked on link to Github repository behind the project, clicked on issues tab, then submit new issue. A text box came up much like it would on Facebook or the proposed forum. In reality there are no technical hurdles for these users, except their own perception that Github is a social coding site for programming.</p>
<p>This type of perception is a holdover from the last 30 years of IT and developers making sure they were keepers of the knowledge and instilling fear in users, that treading in this realm is only for the brave, often male world of developers, database and IT folk. In the world of software as a service (SaaS) and APIs, this is no longer a reality, but the perception is still there.</p>
<p>As I work hard to evangelize API tools and resource, in which Github is a huge part of, one of my primary directives is to educate everyday business users about how easy it is to use some of these tools. You don't need to be a developer to use Github. You can sign up for an account, create repositories of HTML, markdown, text, PDF, images and other documents, and even participate, and contribute to other people's projects--without touching code.</p>
<p>In the last year I've seen numerous, very tech savvy users, who are exposed to Github managed projects daily, who have made their first commit, submit their first issue and realize how easily all of this is. I'm always amazed at how little people truly understand about Github, when in reality with a little education, it is a very powerful platform that anyone can use--no coding knowledge required.</p>

<p>The FTC's complaint alleges that <a href="http://www.trendnet.com/?todo=home">TRENDnet</a> was labeling their cameras as secure, when in reality the camera had faulty software that left them open to online viewing and audio access to anyone who had the Internet address of the camera.</p>
<p>The FTC / TRENDnet case is the first, in what I predict is a future filled with security and privacy violations by Internet of Things products and companies.  As we blindly race forward with the exciting Internet of Things, many companies will disregard the security of their hardware and software, just like TRENDnet did.</p>
<p>Hopefully as an industry we can help make sure this doesn't get out of hand, and don't require the federal government to police the situation. As technology providers, we need to make sure the software, hardware and APIs that drive the Internet of Things is properly secured, protecting our customers and the industry.</p>

<p>I was working on series of API endpoints this week, each of them had a basic search parameter, allowing you pass a keyword to filter your API request.  Pretty standard stuff.</p>
<p>After deploying the APIs I wanted to make sure I tracked what people were searching for, so I could use in reporting and other tools. Then I got to thinking, that it would make sense to go ahead and launch an API of API search queries, allowing other users to be able to discover and benefit from insights derived from other API users searches.</p>
<p>Just a random thought as I'm playing around more with APIs in government. I definitely like the stimulation I get from designing, deploying and evolving APIs at my new gig, in addition to my existing monitoring of the API space.</p>

<p>There is a growing number of API conferences going on this year in the US, but the hunger for API knowledge isn't just something going on in this country, we are seeing a demand for API information and conversation growing internationally.</p>
<p>One place that is exploding is in Europe and specifically in the Scandinavian region, and there is one must-go-to event that is driving the API conversation--the <a href="http://nordicapis.com/" target="_blank">Nordic API Conference</a>, September 18th and 19th in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<p>I will be heading out for the conference and giving a talk I'm calling "The Politics of APIs is the Future", my current abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><em>We have found the right balance of technology for APIs, using simple lightweight protocols, built on HTTP. The business of APIs around good documentation, marketing and support to developers and monetization strategies are being proven. The next challenge we face in the API space will be around terms of use, privacy, deprecation and security.</em></blockquote>
<p>In addition to my talk, I will be moderating a panel on the Internet of Things, but specifically on business models, with Ronnie Mitra, Bradford Stephens, David Henricson Briggs and Ellen Sundh:</p>
<p><a href="http://nordicapis.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/nordic-apis/stockholm-image.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>As we just begin getting a hold on monetization strategies and business models for APIs delivering data and resources for mobile development.  How will we begin to understand how to apply what we have learned for the Internet of Things across our homes, vehicles, sensors and other Internet enabled objects that are being integrating with our lives.</em></blockquote>
<p>The Nordic APIs is exactly two weeks away, so its not too late to buy a plane ticket and engage in API conversations with global thought leaders fromt the space, in beautiful Stockholm. I've never been to Sweden and looking forward to going.  I get really pumped by the passion and energy for APIs, interoperability and opening up government businesses outside the United States.</p>
<p>If you can make time, and afford the trip, I look forward to seeing you in Stockholm and having a conversation about the business and politics of the fast unfolding API driven world.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Sep 2013</span>
        <p><a href="/admin/blog/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/bw-irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to APIs, people respond to stories about real world examples, even more than solid technological implementations. If you can demonstrate how APIs are actually providing a solution, you can reach more people than just talking about the technological nuts and bolts. With this in mind I'm working through telling stories around how the IRS leveraged web services to incentivize private sector to develop applications that would provide tax solutions for the every day tax payer.</p>
<p>In my short year and half working for government I've heard the example of "TurboTax" used to describe an example of how the federal government can leverage technology to deliver partner driven solutions, and better serve the public. Obviously this is an example that resonates with leaders in government, but one that I think needs a lot more work to actually flush out the model more deeply, while keeping it as something that anyone can understand and is able to repeat in their own circles.</p>
<p>The story of the IRS e-File program for developers is a important blueprint for how a forms driven federal government system, can deploy APIs and share the burden of delivering important civic services with the private sector. Describing this as a "Turbo Tax Solution", is an extremely simplified analogy, whereTurbo Tax is just one application within an ecosystem of private sector, trusted IRS partners.</p>
<p>As with every other federal agency, the IRS faced the problem of modernizing its systems to keep up with current technologies, while also continuing to improve the US tax process, so that it would better serve americans, and make the massive federal agency more efficient, which resulted in the design of an e-File system, where tax professionals could submit electronic tax form filings via IRS systems. While a web-based approach to modernizing the IRS tax process is a large part of the evolution of the US tax process, it wasn't enough. The IRS isn't in the business of being a software developer, and needed more help when building the next generation of tax solutions--setting the stage for development of web services.</p>
<p>Web services, also widely called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), provide the ability to submit traditional IRS forms over the Internet, directly from existing or new software platforms that are developed by 3rd party, public and private sector partners. These web services don't just speak in terms of IRS forms, they also understand the myriad of business rules that surround the submission of these forms, adhering to not just the legacy IRS forms process, but allow developers to follow the IRS tax code without fully understanding the intricacies of the complex tax system.</p>
<p><a href="/admin/blog/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/irs-efile-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This new set of APIs provides the foundation for what is known as the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4164.pdf" target="_blank">modernized e-File system for software developers and transmitters</a>. By employing APIs, the IRS is securely opening up access to the digital filing of IRS tax forms and supporting business rules, to trusted 3rd party partners from the public and private sector.  This API driven approach allows the IRS to stick with what they do best, and not worry about being the sole developer of online, desktop and mobile applications that interface with the US tax process--giving birth to not just TurboTax, but a whole ecosystem of API driven technology solutions from the prviate sector.</p>
<p>The IRS Modernized e-File (MeF) system provides a blueprint for how the federal government can leverage APIs to establish and evolve a public / private sector partnerships that allows government to more intelligently deliver services. This API driven approach is not purely a technical solution, it is one that acknowledges there are business drivers needed that provide incentives for 3rd party organizations and companies to participate. There are also political considerations in the form of terms of services, privacy policy and security, as well as adhering to the nuances and forward motion of the federal lawmaking process.</p>
<p>This post is just the first in a series of stories and white papers working to better clarify the API driven approach the IRS has taken to better collaborate with trusted private and public sector partners. My goal is to eventually provide a working blueprint that other government agencies can follow when embarking on their own API initiatives, and better serve their constituents.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/09/02/baseline-for-federal-government-open-data-and-api-portals/">Baseline for Federal Government Open Data and API Portals</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Sep 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-portal.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have a whole list of projects around open data and APIs at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Additionally I have numerous other open data and API projects I'd like to tackle across other federal agencies. As I do with other areas of my work, I needed a standardized way to stabilize the datasets and APis I will need for my projects, in the same way any open data and API provider should do for their consumers.</p>
<p>To help support my work, and hopefully the work of others I wanted to create a baseline portal that I could use at the VA, for showing what is possible when hanging open datasets and APIs, in a full featured portal. The success of any open data and / or API portal starts with the technical building blocks, like data and APIs, but have a set of business and political building blocks that are essential to their adoption and growth.</p>
<p>I've spent the last three years studying the business and politics of APIs. During these three years I've looked at almost 10,000 API developer portals, and I've established a <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">base set of what I consider the building blocks</a> of successful API portals, with a handful in which I consider essential to success. I've always wanted a simple API portal template that would reflect this research, and my new <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/">Developer @ VA</a>&nbsp;portal&nbsp;is the first step towards achieving this.</p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/">Developer @ VA</a> is an early stage prototype, whcih I've built to satisfy this need of mine, specifically for my VA projects. I will be polishing this portal and replicating it as a single template that can be used for any API and / or open data portal. This portal exists purely as a <a href="https://github.com/">Github repository</a> and runs on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, using a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll for managing its pages and blog</a>.  Everything else is HTML, CSS, Javascript and JSON, allowing it to be able to run on any server, including other cloud services like Dropbox or Amazon S3.</p>
<p>To start with I've included 20 of what I consider essential API building blocks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Landing Page</li>
<li>Getting Started</li>
<li>APIs</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Interactive Docs</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Gallery</li>
<li>Support  
<ul>
<li>Self-Service  
<ul>
<li>Stack Exchange</li>
<li>Quora</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Direct Support  
<ul>
<li>Issue Management</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Google+</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roadmap</li>
<li>Changelog</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Terms of Use</li>
<li>Privacy Policy</li>
<li>Branding Guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond this project running using open formats and standards, and being deployable in common cloud environments like Github, Dropbox and Amazon S3, everything is machine readable by default. The portal starts with a <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/sitemap.json">sitemap.json</a>, which links &nbsp;to other building blocks that make up the open data and API portal, including a data.json and api.json which provide programmatic access to all resources included in the site:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/api.json">data.json</a> - Machine readable JSON file of all data assets using common core metadata for easy access to all data stored in the portal</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/data.json">api.json</a> - Machine readable JSON, using the Swagger format describing all API resources available within the portal</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I wanted all essential building blocks of the portal to also be machine readable by default:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/code/code.json">Code</a> - JSON library of all code available for use when integrating with datasets and APIs</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/gallery/gallery.json">Gallery</a> - A JSON gallery of web, mobile apps and visualizations, widgets, excel and other integrations on data and APis</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/support/support.json">Support</a>&nbsp;- A JSON listing of self-service and direct support channels for the portal</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/roadmap/roadmap.json">Roadmap</a> - JSON listings of both the future with a roadmap, providing transparency into portal operations</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/roadmap/changelog.json">Changelog</a> - A JSON listing documenting the past with all changes made to the portal</li>
<li><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/legal/legal.json">Legal</a> - A directory of the legal building blocks of the portal with links to terms of use, privacy and branding guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is the product of 3 years of research, and 3 days worth of work. So it is rough. I was able to capture my initial vision in 3 days, but still a lot of work to do. I need to let it simmer a little bit, and round off some of the rough edges and apply some polish. Then the next step is to generate a generic template from it, that will become the baseline for any other portal I derive from this work.</p>
<p>If there is anything you'd like to see in the future, go ahead and use any of the <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/va-developer/support/">support channels available </a>on the site. Once I get the base template set up, I will use that as a top level project to guide the future of this baseline for open data and API portals.</p>

<p>One important thing I've learned while running API Evangelist, is the importance of picking your head up from your work on a regular basis, and tuning into the world around me.  When you are running your API initiative it can be also be easy to go heads down coding, addressing technical issues, managing support channels and dealing with the general day-to-day, internal activity of running a company.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm big on going radio silent, closing the Gmail tab, shutting down TweetDeck, LinkedIn, Facebook, Google+, Skype and my other communication channels. Since I stopped using Google Reader to monitor feeds, and setup my own internal curation, I can easily tune out my API industry monitoring and curation for days sometimes. This is all intended to get shit done and reduce distractions.</p>
<p>Even with my regular tuning out of the world and focusing on work, I make sure and pick my head up, turn on communication channels, read and curate blog posts and generally take a good look at the world around me.  I've worked too hard, building up momentum with my content creation, search engine optimization and social media presence to let it all slide. I can coast for days, or even weeks, but if I drop the ball for too long, I will not only stop any forward motion and growth--I risk losing traction and quickly becoming irrelevant.</p>
<p>My number one mission with the <a title="API Evangelist Network" href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist Network</a> is to educate myself, then secondarily educate the masses about the API space. If I don't pick my head up regularly, tune into the API space and understand the latest trends, technologies and players--I'm doing myself a disservice, as well as the greater interest of the API industry, and whoever I work for.</p>
<p>When running your company, make sure you find time to go heads down, focusing on your work, but make sure you pick your head up regularly and tune into your community, your audience and the wider industry you exist within. Without this engagement you will never achieve your goals.</p>

<p>I used to think that the API space is resistant to defining standards around REST, data formats, webhooks, hypermedia, api definitions and other key areas of the space, because after the top down, strict structure of SOA, the community just wanted to let the space organically define the best approaches.</p>
<p>The API world just seemed like a wild west of strong minded individuals, who had a sort of "markets will work it out" approach, and the best approach will win in the end. You know, kind of like the Amazon cloud API battle?</p>
<p>By 2013, the only thing we've come to agreement on is around oAuth, and by many accounts that was a failure. I used to think that many of the bitter battles by the RESTafarians about API design, RESTfulness and Hypermedia were because these were very smart, stubborn folks trying to craft the best approach possible.</p>
<p>After many years of advocating for open source tooling, open events in the space and sharing of common API design patterns, I don't think there is much goodwill for any of it, because companies are more interested in their intellectual property(IP), seeming competitive and ultimately making the most money and pleasing their VCs.</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong, there are some very fine companies, do good in the space. I'm not saying the entire sector has lots its way. However the majority of the vibe from major players is, we don't want to share design patterns, open tooling, work together to support industry events and gatherings, we will just do it all ourselves, keeping the IP and value for themselves.</p>
<p>I understand I'm less interested in the whole business and VC aspect of this than many of you are, but I think APIs got their start in openness, collaboration and sharing in the spirit of transparency and interoperability. It seems like like after 10 years and finally getting some traction in the space, we are starting to lose our way.</p>

<p>When it comes to API discovery, as an industry we haven't been able to find a satisfactory technological solution yet. While I often feel the right approach hasn't emerged yet, I think we are just overlooking "good enough" solutions, because we are waiting for the holy grail of API discovery.</p>
<p>I can't imagine that indexing, search and discovery of the myriad of web APIs out there is that much harder than indexing, search and discovery of the billions of HTML documents available online.  Sure, when you are talking about programmatic interfaces, you need a little more precision, but I think us technologists are caught up our own beliefs that APIs should be perfect.</p>
<p>It would make sense that we adopt some evolution of the common <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html">sitemaps format</a>, retrofit it to be JSON, accommodate open data catalogs, and allow for various API definitions in <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">I/O Docs</a> or even <a title="API Blueprint" href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API blueprint</a>.  Sure these formats won't have the precision of an evolution of the precious WSDL, or some actually agreed upon standard, but it will get us over the hump we are in.</p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> is 8 years old now, and in 2013, we still don't have any next step, let lone an actual usable solution for API discovery? I just have a hard time believing this is a technological problem, that it is more the stubbornness of the leaders in the space to just take any meaningful step towards API discovery, and lead.</p>
<p>There isn't going to be any money in API discovery, so this isn't something a single startup can emerge to solve. It is something we will all have to discuss and play with until we can find something will get us to the next step, together.</p>

<p>With APIs beginning to enter the mainstream consciousness, it is time to spend more time educating the masses about OAuth. We've had plenty of conversations between two of the OAuth legs, provider and developer, but we now need to <a title="3 legged conversations" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/26/which-of-the-three-oauth-legs-is-the-most-important/">bring the third leg into the conversation</a>--the user.</p>
<p>First, what is OAuth? - An open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not, OAuth has become the industry standard for accessing resources, being served up via APIs, that are being consumed through desktop, web and the fast growing mobile space.</p>
<p><strong>OAuth Platforms &amp; Data Providers</strong><br /> If you are an online platform, OAuth is something you need to understand. At a minimum, if you require users to establish an account, you need to consider allowing users to create their accounts and login in the future using other popular OAuth providers like Facebook, Twitter and Google. Next if you want to provide access to your platform user's data via an API, you need to take a deeper dive into OAuth, and consider establishing yourself as an OAuth provider.</p>
<p><strong>OAuth for Desktop, Web and Mobile Developers</strong><br /> In 2013, if you are a developer, you are probably using APIs. OAuth has been very intimidating for developers for quite some time, but with the increased availability of quality OAuth clients, better implementations and educational materials from API providers, and standardized approaches by startups like <a title="OAuth.io" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/08/13/simplifying-oauth-with-oauthio/">OAuth.io</a>--OAuth is something you shouldn't fear anymore. You need OAuth as a default tool in your developer toolbox.</p>
<p><strong>Everyday Online User</strong><br /> Like the term API, OAuth is something that should be added to the vocabulary of every tech savvy user. You should understand that OAuth exists, and that it gives you the ability to create accounts and login to your favorite platforms without filling out endless new forms and sharing your passwords unnecessarily. The platforms you use daily, like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google all are OAuth providers, and you should leverage these providers to manage your online presence. The control is in your hands to securely manage your online persona using OAuth, and with a little education and maintenance you can ensure you profile(s) are secure, and only the providers you trust have access to your important data.</p>
<p>This is a first post in series of OAuth related information that is looking to educate the masses about the importance of OAuth. Hopefully increasing the number of quality OAuth providers, knowledgeable developers and OAuth aware online users--making OAuth something that is ubiquitous across the web, and enabling meaningful 3 legged conversations that make data accessible, incentivizes developers while protecting end-user's privacy.</p>
<p>I will be deploying an entirely new research project dedicated to OAuth, where I will work on stories about OAuth that hopefully resonate with the masses. As with my other research, it will take me a while to dial in. As I work to do this, I will curate the best stories and tools in the OAuth space, eventually trying to create a polished repository of OAuth resources that providers, developers and users will find valuable.</p>
