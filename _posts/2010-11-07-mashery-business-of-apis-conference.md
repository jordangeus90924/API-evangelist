{% include JB/setup %}<p>I attended Masherys Business of APIs Conference in San Francisco on Thursday.The event was kicked off with a complete history of APIs from Oren Michels the CEO of Mashery.Michels took us from pre-Internet examples of APIs through eBay pioneering in the space, the mashup explosion and to present day.Then Mike Hart, Director of Engineering at Netflix, gave a talk on the evolution of its API strategy from crowd-sourced innovation to its API enabling it to deliver Netflix on 200 individual devices.APis definitely played a part in Netflix out-maneuvering Blockbuster in the online movie space.</p>
