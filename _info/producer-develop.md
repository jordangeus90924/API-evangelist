This stage is about bringing an API to life. That means assembling all the infrastructure needed and generating any skeletons, using frameworks, assembling, and hardening an APIs functionality. The Development might take a design-led approach or a code-led approach. Either way, as long as it follows a common life cycle, it can benefit operations.
