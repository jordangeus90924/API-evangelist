        <span class="post-date">28 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_09_27_at_9.27.34_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wrote about my feelings that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/27/every-government-agency-should-have-a-forms-api-like-dol-does/">all government agencies should have a forms API like the Department of Labor (DOL)</a>, and I wanted to separately <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/others/faq">showcase their FAQ API</a>, and say same thing--ALL government agencies should have a frequently asked question (FAQ) API. Think about the websites and mobile applications that would benefit from ALL government agencies at the federal, state, and local level having frequently asked questions available in this way--it would be huge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a perfect world, like any good API provider, government agencies should also use their FAQ API to run their website(s), mobile, and internal systems--this way the results are always fresh, up to date, and answering the relevant questions (hopefully). I get folks in government questioning the opening up of sensitive information via APIs, but making FAQs available in a machine readable way, via the web, just makes sense in a digital world.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/others/form">forms API</a>, I will be looking across other government agencies for any <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/others/faq">FAQ APIs</a>. I will be crafting an OpenAPI Spec for the DOL FAQ API (man that is a lot of acronyms). I will take any other FAQ APIs that I find and consider any additional parameters, and definitions I might want to include in a common FAQ API definition for government agencies. This is another area that should have not just a common open API and underlying schemas defined, but also a wealth of server and client side code--so any government agency can immediately put it to work in any environment.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/27/thanks-for-reaching-out-about-your-api/">Thanks For Reaching Out About Your API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-email.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get a number of folks emailing me about their API and API-focused&nbsp;services. When I have the bandwidth I spend time in my inbox and respond to these emails. To help me do this a little more efficiently (I'm not always very quick about it), I'm formalizing some snippets I can use in my response(s). I want to thank them for reaching out, while also helping them understand my approach to successfully operating API Evangelist.</p>
<p>Here is one basic email I crafted today, in response to a pretty slick API provider that I will be writing about shortly:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Hi There,</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I received your email. Thanks for the kind words.&nbsp;Appreciate you introducing me to your [API / API related service]. I'm going to have to pass on the posting of the [guest post, infographic, white paper, case study, etc] to apievangelist.com, but I'm happy to keep an eye on what you are up to as part of my regular work.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I visited your site and see that you have a blog (with feed), Twitter, and a Github account. These are the channels I&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on, and when you post a&nbsp;blog post or press release, Tweet something out, or I see a Github repo or commit of interest, I'll definitely include in my research, and craft a story for the blog.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">I have also added your company, blog, feed, twitter, and Github accounts to my monitoring system. Keep on doing interesting things with APIs and I'll make sure it becomes part of my storytelling in the space.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So far, and reviewing your web site and developer, your API efforts [looked pretty polished / could use some work / is not very modern] I&rsquo;ll keep digging around and publish anything interesting that I find.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thanks!</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Kin Lane<br />@kinlane</em></p>
<p class="p1">This is a basic template I will use moving forward. I'll tweak it some for each response, but ultimately I am trying to keep thing consistent with folks who are emailing with me. I'm not trying to be less personal with folks, but as I work to scale API Evangelist, and keep things operating as smoothly as they have been since I returned, I need to automate things a bit.</p>
<p class="p1">This approach also helps encourage API providers to standardize how they interface with the world and helps underline that having a blog, feed, Twitter, and Github accounts makes sense in 2016. I can pay attention to more companies this way, and companies should be able to more successfully communicate with their developers, the general public, and analysts like me with this approach</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/new_personal_access_token.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm building what I am calling "micro tools", that run 100% on Github. To push my work forward <a href="https://kinlane.github.io/github-micro-tool/">I developed a base template I can use for deploying apps that run 100% on Github, using Github Pages, the Github API, and Github OAuth as the engine</a>. As a next step I wanted to develop a simple YAML editor that run on Github, allowing me to edit the YAML core of each tool, that is stored in the _data folder for each Jekyll site I host on Github Pages.</p>
<p>The key to all of this working securely is <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">Github personal access tokens</a>, which every Github user has in their accounts under settings. I have employed this approach to running apps on Github Pages before using <a href="http://OAuth.io">OAuth.io as the broker</a>, something that works very well, and I highly recommend it. I have also run using my own Github OAuth proxy, where I had server side code that would do the OAuth dance for me, when authenticating via these apps. The problem is I want them to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">run 100% on Github</span>, and be forkable by anyone, leaving personal access tokens as my only option.</p>
<p>What would really rock, is if Github provide us with a solution to client-side authentication via the Github API. We can already accomplish the hole thing, we just need Github to offer the same functionality that OAuth.io -- heck I recommend you just buy them and implement. An increasing number of API providers are managing their API operations on Github. From API portal, to documentation and SDKS--they are using Github and Github Pages to take care of business. So having Github OAuth, plus authentication via other providers would be a huge benefit.</p>
<p>Additionally, it would open up Github Pages to be more than just static project pages--they could become little mini apps, or micro tools as I call them. Forking one of my micro tools, then finding your personal access tokens is not that high of a bar, but it would be much nicer if I could just provide them a Github icon, and I could route them through a secure Github OAuth proxy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all without any outside infrastructure</span>. Just a thought Github. Some ramblings about what I'd like to see. For now, I'll rely on the personal access tokens, that is until Github decides to provide us with some sort of OAuth proxy for client-side apps to operate on Github Pages.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/26/taking-another-look-at-the-department-of-labor-api-efforts/">I was taking another look at the API efforts out of the Department of Labor (DOL)</a>, to help refresh my awareness of what they are serving up, and I came across the <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/others/form">DOL Forms API</a>. The API does what it says, providing access on " the most frequently requested Department of Labor forms", which seems like to me should be the&nbsp;default for ALL government agencies.</p>
<p><span>The API returns some valuable details about each agency from including OMB number, URL, file extension, file size, and other meta information like a description, tags, and revision. I know that many in the API community would like all forms to be APIs, but I would be happy if we just started by making the concept of a forms API default across all government agencies first.</span></p>
<p><span>Before I dig into this individual API, I'm thinking that I will craft an OpenAPI Spec for the DOL Forms API, and see if there are any other form APIs available across US federal agencies that I should be considering. With a little work maybe I can merge them into a single open API definition that any government agency can follow, when thinking about which APIs they should be making available.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-design-empathy.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>My friend Matthew Reinbold wrote a great post on his blog asking "<a href="http://voxpop.co/go.cfm?article=What_if_Developers_Arent_Meant_to_Do_API_Design">what if developers aren't meant to do API design</a>"? I think he is touching on an important aspect of why DevOps might not work everywhere in the same expected ways. We all have our strengths, and we all have our weaknesses, and I agree with him that maybe we are asking too much of our developers--API design might not be their strength.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the owner of a small business operated by one person (me), DevOps is hard. I cannot do everything myself, and require a variety of services to help me out, but I still hit areas where I'm deficient like graphic design and editing. I'm getting better at editing, but my graphic design skills never seem to evolve at all. I would like to think I can do everything, but I can't, and if I had a job at a large organization, and was expected to learn every piece of a modern stack--I'm not sure I could do it.</p>
<p>Bringing it back to the API design, though, the question of who does API design still needs to be answered. It can't just be left behind because a developer of an API doesn't have the chops. Ideally, a company could afford to hire an API designer and architect to come in and work their magic, but I know in&nbsp;reality this isn't going to happen within many organizations--so what can be done?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>API Design In Our Tools &amp; Services -</strong> Developers use language and platform specific&nbsp;IDE functionality as a crutch, we need the same enablement for API design in leading API design tools and services. This is why <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/api-stylebook-a-collections-of-resources-for-api-designers/">projects like the API design stylebook are so important</a>&nbsp;because they begin to provide us with the definitions that are needed to drive the advancements.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing Of Common API Patterns -</strong> I feel like such a nag on this subject, but we need to share the common API patterns more. If you are using HAL or Siren, share the story and definition of your approach. If you have OpenAPI Spec or API Blueprint, make them available. If you are a developer, go out and do a little discvoery of existing patterns before you get to work--you don't need to be expert, but do a little homework first.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing of Common Data Patterns -</strong> This exists in the form of <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>. Don't reinvent the wheel when it comes to your underlying schema. Even if you are mapping to completely whacky shit behind, use common definitions on the front. Again, API design tooling and services need to pipe these into your solutions, here are all the OpenlAPI specs for Schema.or to get you going. ;-)</li>
</ol>
<p>These three areas can help augment developers when API design is just not their cup of tea. After that, and short of hiring an API design professionals, developers who are touching on the API layers are just going to have to step up and develop some empathy. I think API design is part science (specs, schema, patterns), and part empathy of everyone who will come in contact with that API. I don't require all developers understand hypermedia or REST, but they damn sure should be required to put some thought into who is going to be developing against the API and consuming it--otherwise they shouldn't be developing an API in the first place.</p>
<p>Coming full circle, I guess this could be an argument for GraphQL right? If you can't find developers who get API design, you can't hire an API professional, and for some reason they are empathy-challenged, you can provide a GraphQL layer that allows developers to get at what they need. IDK. This is one of the reasons I like web APIs (not just REST), is that it allows for this bridging of the often very technical backend, with the often very human interface on the front-end, but I guess it also takes a willingness on developers to empathize with the fact that this exists and are willing to do a little extra work.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/26/doing-away-with-selfservice-api-access-without-approval-like-soundcloud/">I wrote about SoundCloud beginning to require approval before developers get access to any API resources</a>&nbsp;yesterday, a concept that I want to keep exploring. I'm going to be going through the APIs track on, looking for different variations of this, but before I did this I wanted to explore a couple of approaches I already had rattling around in my head.</p>
<p>What if, when you first sign up for API access you only get access to your own data, and content? You couldn't get access to any other users until you were approved. It seems like something that would incentivize developers to publish data and content, build their profiles out, which is good for the platform right? It will also protect other end-users from malicious activity by random developers who are just looking to wreak havoc in support of their own objectives and do not care about the platform--like we saw with Soundcloud.</p>
<p>A good example of how this could be applied is evident in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@krisshaffer/getting-data-out-of-medium-8b8b318057c3#.t2x6wlrls">the post yesterday by Kris Shaffer on Medium, who was looking to get his content out of the platform</a>. I use <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/22/syndicating-api-evangelist-posts-to-medium-using-their-api/">the Medium API to syndicate blog posts to Medium</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSEE</a>), but there is no read API allowing me to pull my content out--I agree with Kris, this is a problem. What if Medium opened up API access, allowing us platform users to get at our own content, but then required approval of any app before there ever is access to other users content?</p>
<p>Some food for thought. I hear a lot of platforms say they don't do APIs because they don't want to end up with the same problems as Twitter. I think this is the result of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/19/putting-the-concept-of-the-public-api-to-rest-as-a-dominant-narrative/">some legacy views about public APIs that should just go away</a>. Not all APIs are created equal, and I feel that APIs shouldn't always be just about applications, and often times <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/29/apis-are-not-just-meant-for-killer-apps-they-can-also-be-a-lifeline-for-users/">are just a lifeline for platform users</a>, helping us end-users better manage their data and content. If my internal systems&nbsp;and other 3rd party systems are integrated together with APIs, the likelihood I will grow dependent on the integration only increases.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2016</span>
        <p>Someone asked me about the current state of the <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/">Department of Labors (DOL) API efforts the other day</a>, and since I hadn't actually taken a look in a few months I wanted to spend some time in there seeing what they have going on. There is no better way to get a feel for what a government agency is up to than going through their API efforts--the DOL is pretty ahead of the game in this area.</p>
<p>The vibe when you land on <a href="http://developer.dol.gov">developer.dol.gov</a> (which is a great subdomain) is nice. It is clean&nbsp;and has all the links that I am looking for, providing access to their APIs, as well as supporting code, while allowing you to ask questions and report bugs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/developer_dol_gov__united_states_department_of_labor_developer_portal.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>One thing I think is interesting in their approach is that they efficiently <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/sdk/">use Github in support of their code</a>, apply <a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=labor">Stack Exchange in support of asking questions</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Developer/issues/new">employ Github issues for reporting bugs</a>. I understand that government agencies do not always have the resources necessary to support their API efforts, so this approach seems sensible to me when providing the minimum viable support for an API.</p>

<p>There is a wealth of valuable economic data available in there. I am not a fan of their API design patterns, I get the same feeling&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/25/taking-a-look-at-whats-next-for-the-environmental-protection-agency-epa-envirofacts-data-service-api/">like I did from Environment Protection Agency</a>--that the information is accessible (yay), but it isn't all the intuitive when it comes to finding everything that is in there. They provide you with an <a href="https://devtools.dol.gov/APISampler/Home/Index1">API sampler</a>, that lets you play with the APIs using a form, but I'd prefer some more investment in the overall design to simplify and make intuitive on the&nbsp;first click.</p>
<p>While I feel a lot more could be invested in API design to make DOL's data more accessible, they are way ahead of other agencies like the VA, so I'll take what I can get. They are also using actively Github, which I think is super promising. The quick look has provided me with a fresh mental image of what the DOL is up to with their APIs, and provided the seeds for a couple other stories--so it was a success. One project I'd like to also play with if I have the time is to see if I can <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/others/api-metadata">auto generate an OpenAPI Spec from the DOL metadata API</a>, and help autogenerate some docs that could help shed light on the wealth of data available within the federal government API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-share-stack.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am perpetually working to publish all of my API definitions <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">my API Stack Github repository</a>, with <a href="http://theapistack.com/">the front available as the API Stack</a>. I regularly push the latest copies of all of my OpenAPI Specs to these Github repos when I have time, but my OpenAPI Specs are far from complete, and are&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/working-to-establish-a-complete-openapi-spec-for-leading-apis/">something I'm always working to make as complete as a I can, and certify when possible</a>.</p>
<p>My primary objective around defining APIs using OpenAPI Spec is all about <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a>, and understanding the request and response surface area for many of the publicly available APIs out there today. Secondarily I'm interested in actually putting these API definitions to use across the API lifecycle in <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, and <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/organizations/">client tools and services</a>.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of work to certify an API definition as complete--a process best executed by the API owner. In the absence of this, I am trying to fill in the gap(s) where I can, but as a one-person operation, I only&nbsp;have so much bandwidth. I have had people ask me if I'd focus on specific APIs they are interested in having, and even have some folks pay me for this work, but what really surprises me is the number of emails, DMs, and Github requests I get from folks telling me about how incomplete they are, and the low number of folks who ever contribute back by sharing their definitions with me.</p>
<p>People really enjoy emailing me to tell me my API definitions are incomplete, but they rarely&nbsp;fork&nbsp;and contribute back any API definitions to my work--even though I regularly ask people if they could (at the very least submit an issue with URL to where it exists on your server). I feel like this is the general tone of the space that has been set by VC investment and unhealthy views of intellectual property defined by companies like Oracle and Google. People are perfectly happy building on the open work other folks do, but very rarely ever give back and share the API definitions that they have in their own collections.</p>
<p>Hypermedia visionaries are often frustrated because people refuse to emulate <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/tools/">the best patterns currently available</a>, and that OpenAPI Spec is just a bridge. My concerns are more that we can't even get people to walk across the bridge to greener pastures because the greedy nature of the space is more focused on scrapping and keeping parts and pieces of the bridge for themselves, leaving it as something nobody will walk across. Let alone getting us to the place where we all share and follow a common set of API and schema patterns across all industries.</p>
<p>Please share your API definitions, it doesn't have to be part of <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack work</a>, but please make them easily found within your API portal.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_algorithmic_sovereignty.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have showcased&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/your-api-access-replicated-into-multiple-regions-around-the-globe-for-additional-charge/">examples of API providers allowing you to deploy your API into various regions around the world like Algolia does</a>, but it is a topic that I think will keep gaining traction as data, content, or algorithmic sovereignty continues to be a privacy, security, or regulatory concern. As the Internet continues to evolve, people and companies are only going to continue being concerned&nbsp;and dare I say become nationalistic about where they digital worlds exist and operate.</p>
<p>When I Google "data sovereignty" I get:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Data sovereignty is the concept that information which has been converted and stored in binary digital form is subject to the laws of the country in which it is located.</em></p>
<p>Where data is stored tends to dominate conversations historically, but I think that increasingly algorithmic sovereignty will become a concern as well. With more platforms employing algorithms at almost every level of operation, at some point where they are operating is going to come into play (ie. the Facebook news feed algorithm might have to have different considerations in the US than it does in EU).</p>
<p>The DNS layer is the first place to start when validating where data is being stored, or an algorithm is being executed, and which rules apply. After that I'd guess that we will need the API layer to help us also broker this, ensuring that web, mobile, and device based clients can articulate&nbsp;where data should be stored, and which algorithms&nbsp;or variations of algorithms can be applied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the growth in regional specific cloud storage and compute solutions this doesn't seem like it will be too difficult to implement, but I'm sure will take a significant amount of time to standardize how API providers actually get it done. I'll keep looking for examples of it in the wild, and contribute to how we can better validate and ensure data and algorithmic sovereignty at the API layer.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/api-sign-up-changes"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/backstage_blog__api_sign_up_changes__soundcloud_developers.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/api-sign-up-changes">SoundCloud recently made changes to the signup process for their API</a> and are now requiring approval before any 3rd party developer can get an API key and access the&nbsp;API. While I encourage API providers to be as open and transparent with their API portal, documentation, and other resources, I honestly can't criticize&nbsp;API providers for locking down APIs and requiring approval--especially when 3rd party developers can be so badly behaved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modern API management solutions allow for API providers to decide how open they want to be with their APIs, and while there are many benefits for having an open presence for an API portal, documentation, and other resources, I predict that many API providers will require approval before you get full access to resources in the future. Especially if it impacts the end user experience in a negative way like it was on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>I support SoundCloud's decision because&nbsp;they kept their overall operations public and because&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/api-sign-up-changes">they shared the decision so transparently on their blog</a>. This type of transparent, communicative approach is important to helping set the tone for the API community&nbsp;and prevent any backlash from developers. There really is no reason API providers have to be 100% open with the data, content, and algorithms &nbsp;thatthey are providing access to, and I think SoundCloud's approach provides a basic model that other providers can consider when they are thinking about exactly how "open" they want to be.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">I was adding dreamfactory as one of my sponsors</a>&nbsp;today. I have them in my in my API monitoring system already, so I have a logo for them, but whenever there is a significant event involving one of the companies I keep an eye on in the API space, I tend to make sure I have an update to date version of their logo. In the case of adding them as a sponsor I definitely want the latest logo--so I did what I always do, I Googled "dreamfactory logo".</p>
<p>A while back&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/01/why-do-companies-who-ask-me-to-update-their-logo-never-have-branding-page/">I wrote about how companies who ask me to update their logo on my site(s) almost never have a dedicated logo page</a>--which might have helped make sure I have had the right logo in the first place. &nbsp;So when I Googled the&nbsp;dreamfactory&nbsp;logo", I was pleased to find <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/logos">tthe dreamfactory logo page as the first result,</a> with a wealth of logos for me to select from.</p>
<p>I can't imagine why logo and branding pages are default for all companies, but I'll focus on making sure API service providers, as well as API providers, invest in this area (by writing about whenever I can). When you open up your data, content, and algorithms to 3rd party developers it just makes sense to have logo assets easy available, allowing them to provide attribution. It also makes sense to have a logo and branding so that journalists, bloggers, and analysts like me can get the most up to date assets as possible, for&nbsp;use in our storytelling.</p>

I do API Evangelist, not to encourage everyone to do APIs and be the next Twitter, it is to help everyone understand the important of sharing machine-readable&nbsp;information in a secure and accessible way, to make all industries healthier, secure, and more viable environments for digital transformation (man I hate that phrase).</p>
<p>APIs are about sharing information in machine readable formats like YAML, JSON, and XML. Modern approaches to API deployment and management makes this information available in a self-service, secure way, ensuring those who should have access do, in a 24/7, always-on environment. Sharing cybersecurity threat information, and sharing of real-world and laboratory data around self-driving cars fall into this area, and APIs should be a&nbsp;default for anyone playing in these industries.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/03/making-scientific-research-more-real-time-and-collaborative-using-apis/">We are seeing API efforts emerge for expediting Zika virus research, by sharing machine-readable data that other researchers can put to work in their own efforts, without reinventing the wheel and duplicating work within many separate silos</a>--we need more of this in other industries. If you need a primer&nbsp;on how APIs can be put to work in your industry feel free to reach out to me. APIs are not the next vendor solution, and if someone is telling you this, you should run the other direction. APIs are about sensibly, and securely sharing critical information by default across your organization, and industry, using low-cost web technology--not buying the next product or service.</p>

I'm super stoked at <a href="https://github.com/sunlightlabs/">the number of projects on Sunlight Lab's Github account</a>, but after identifying the actual gaps between what is there and what is available in their APIs, I want to emphasize the importance of doing our work out in the open on Github when working on these types of projects.</p>
<p>In short, it is really&nbsp;difficult to package up any project once the hammer comes down, and a company or individuals are moving on. You'll never be as thorough with sharing the data, code, and the story behind as if you did in real-time, while&nbsp;in the moment.

<p>Many technologists see sharing your work as it happens as extra work, but in my experience, it is actually the opposite, even before you come up against circumstances where you have to recreate work after the fact. Technologists also tend to view Github as purely for managing open source code, when in reality it can be used for much, much more. After reviewing the Sunlight Foundation's Github repo, here are few area that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - Publishing raw JSON and YAML data, as part of regular updates, including backups in native database format (ie. MySQL, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Server Code</strong> - Using Github to manage all server side code for APIs, with regular commits as the code evolves and changes.</li>
<li><strong>Scraping Code</strong> - Making sure all libraries and code used as part of data and content scraping is shared on Github.</li>
<li><strong>Client /Frontend Code</strong> - This is the most common thing currently with providers, with the sharing of client libraries on Github</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong> - Publishing of data behind, and the JavaScript <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/d3js-visualizations-using-yaml-and-jekyll/">code for all visualization like I'm doing with D3.js</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong> - Jekyll on Github pages provides an easy, free way to publish a blog which can be used to tell the story in real-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything that runs API Evangelist exists on Github. This approach has fed <a href="http://adopta.agency/">my Knight Foundation funded Adopta.Agency work</a>. If you want to see an&nbsp;<a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/adopta-blueprint/">example of what I'm talking about check out the Adopta.Agency Blueprint</a>. It is much easier to make sure all of your work will live on beyond your organization or project's lifespan, if you are publishing your work in real time on Github in this way. If you are using Github to manage your daily data, code, visualizations, and storytelling--you will be transparent by default, no extra work necessary.</p>
<p>No project is immune to what has happened with the Sunlight Foundation. All open data and API projects will go away some day, and if we are going to keep building on each other's work it should happen out in the open, in real time, in a way that anyone can fork. I'm not even touching on the zero costs associated with publishing using Github--which I identified when working on open data efforts for the White House, where I couldn't stand up any hosting environment, but I damn sure could stand up a Github repository. I'm not even talking about the social benefits of doing this in real-time&nbsp;and attracting other key actors and players to your work even before it done. I'm just talking about doing this for the benefits of when the lights are dimmed or shut off completely as they are with the Sunlight Foundation.</p>
<p>I know there has been a lot of rhetoric, both good and bad about using Github in government, but the benefits are real, and this type of work around open data and APIs is too important to ignore. If you need help understanding what I'm talking about, needing open data or API efforts rescued, or specific Github templates developed like my <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/adopta-blueprint/">Adopta.Agency blueprint</a>, feel free to reach out. I'm hoping to carve off some cycles to apply my approach to the existing Sunlight Foundation projects, helping keep them alive, as well as teach this approach to other upcoming open data and API efforts, to help ensure the work lives on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/sunlight_foundation.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">I am saddened to hear <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/">the news of the Sunlight Foundation dimming the lights on their important work around government transparency</a>. They have provided me a constant spotlight on government activity, and provide a model for me when it comes to opening up government data, and providing APIs that can make a difference. Having helped run non-profit organizations, working to make social change, I know this can be a very difficult thing to keep above water.</p>
<p class="p2">I have already reached out to the Sunlight foundation staff letting them know I'm here to help with any API related projects, and happy to fund their existence until I can find a suitable, caring adoption situations for them. First up, I wanted to make sure and <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/">go through their APIs</a>, and make sure there is a current <a href="https://openapis.org/specification">OpenAPI Specification</a> snapshot for each one, in case they get shuttered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://sunlightlabs.github.io/Capitol-Words/">Capital Words API</a></strong> - The Capitol Words API is an API allowing access to the word frequency count data powering the Capitol Words project.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/">Congress API v3</a></strong> - A live JSON API for the people and work of Congress. Information on legislators, districts, committees, bills, votes, as well as real-time notice of hearings,&nbsp;</li>

Summary information for Senate candidate committees, which file on paper, is available as soon as they have been digitized by the FEC.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Next, I wanted to go through <a href="https://github.com/sunlightlabs">their Github repositories</a> and identify any repos that contained data, server, and client code that is API related. In doing this I also found some interesting visualizations built on top of their work, that I think are worthy of showcasing and preserving:</p>

</ul>
<p>I only went back to 2013 looking for projects in the Sunlight Foundation Github account, because I felt if it hasn't been updated or touched in that time, I probably won't have time to touch it myself. In addition to visualizations, going through their Github account showed me that there is also some interesting scraping work that should also be targeted for keeping alive, as well as open data, API, and visualization projects.</p>
<p class="p1">There is a lot of amazing work present in the Sunlight Foundation APIs and Github repositories. I am just as bummed as many of the comments on their blog, and via the Twittersphere express (some friendly, and some not so friendly), but having worked for the White House, and lived in the world of APIs for the last six years I know that nothing is permanent, and all good things will go away in time--usually due to budgetary and investment scenarios. None of it stops me from doing the hard work that needs to be done, and there is still a lot more to occur around the Sunlight Foundation.</p>

<p>I am always fascinated by the online fence sitting persona that is the enterprise tech industry employee. I know many them are there, but few ever retweet my work, respond to my posts via comments, or other channels. Usually, I only know that many of them are there from the occasional&nbsp;like on one of my stories, but I'm slowly developing other ways to build lists of Twitter users from behind the enterprise fence.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to root them out is to write positive stories about their company, products, group, or their flagship clients. When you do this many of the no names, no description Twitter accounts for the enterprise fence sitters will come out of the woodworks. They can't help themselves it seems, when someone writes positively about what they are doing, as many are so starved for genuine praise, they will often retweet a story revealing themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not believe that everyone should be as open and transparent as I am online. Especially if you have a boss breathing down your neck. Though I do like to know that you are there and that I occasionally write things you like. I would also enjoy more signals from you about what is important to you out in the space, and which topics impact your success in the enterprise trenches. You are always welcome to drop me a line via email if you don't feel comfortable talking out loud, or DM now that I have triangulated&nbsp;your Twitter account and followed you.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I come across a number of really useful stories about APIs in my regular monitoring of the space that can't seem to separate the solution their product delivers from the product itself. I get that you want people to know that your product does the really useful thing that you are telling the story about, but I want to help you understand that they are most likely turning people off to the solution by tightly coupling the solution story with your product and company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of storytelling is more sales than it is evangelism. It shows you don't really have a good product in my opinion. If you can't talk endless about what your product accomplishes without mentioning the product name or the company behind, you probably don't have much of a thing in the first place. However, I'm guessing in many cases you just do not have the storytelling experience, both reading, and writing, to understand the difference, and that is why I want to help you reach more people.</p>
<p>I know your boss is telling you to sell, sell, sell, and that you need to make your "numbers". The reality though is people are being sold, sold, sold to all the time, and they really need actual solutions for problems they face and they appreciate the companies who focus on solutions, not yet just another vendor solution to be bombarded with. If you are going to take the time to craft content for your blog, Medium, or other popular channels, then take the time to thoughtfully disconnect your solution from the product--if you do it well, people will know it is you, and find the product or company behind, when they are ready to implement your solution.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/30/graphql-seems-like-we-do-not-want-to-do-the-hard-work-of-api-design/">I wrote a skeptical piece the other day about GraphQL</a>, which I followed up with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/02/i-am-keeping-my-mind-open-and-looking-forward-to-learning-more-about-graphql/">another post saying I would keep an open mind</a>. I've added GraphQL to my regular monitoring of the space, but I don't have its own research area yet, but if the conversation keeps expanding I will. A recent expansion in the GraphQL conversation for me was <a href="http://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api/">Github releasing the GitHub GraphQL API</a>.</p>
<p>In the release blog&nbsp;post, from Github they provide exactly what I'm looking for in the GraphQL conversation--<a href="http://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api/#why">the reasons why they&nbsp;chose to start supporting GraphQL</a>. In their post Github&nbsp;describes some of the challenges API consumers were having with the existing API, which led them down the GraphQL path:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes required two or three separate calls to assemble a complete view of a resource</li>
<li>responses simultaneously sent too many data and didn&rsquo;t include data that consumers needed</li>
</ul>
<p>They also talk about some of what they wanted to accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li>wanted to identify the OAuth scopes required for each endpoint</li>
<li>wanted to be smarter about how our resources were paginated</li>
<li>wanted assurances of type-safety for user-supplied parameters</li>
<li>wanted to generate documentation from our code</li>
<li>wanted to generate clients</li>
</ul>
<p>Github says they <em>"studied a variety of API specifications built to make some of this easier, but we found that none of the standards totally matched our requirements"</em> and felt that <em>"GraphQL represents a massive leap forward for API development. Type safety, introspection, generated </em>documentation <em>and predictable responses benefit both the maintainers and consumers of our platform"</em>. Some interesting points to consider, as I work to understand the benefits GraphQL brings to the table.</p>
<p>I'm still processing the entire story behind their decision to go GraphQL, and will share any more thoughts I'm having in future blog posts. With this major release from Github, I am now keeping an eye out for other providers who are headed in this direction. Hopefully, they will be as transparent about their reasons why as Github has--this kind of storytelling around API design and deployment is important for the rest of the API community to learn from.</p>

<p>Now that I have API Evangelist up to regular levels of operation after a summer break, I'm working to expand where I publish my content, and next up on the list is Medium. Like many other popular destinations I refuse to completely depend on Medium for my blogging presence, but I recognize the network effects, and I'm more than happy to syndicate my work there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help me manage the publishing of my stories to Medium I wired up the <a href="https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs">Medium API</a> into my API monitoring and publishing platform. I use the Github API to publish blog posts to API Evangelist, Kin Lane, and API.Report, and it is pretty easy to add a layer that will publish select stories to Medium as well. All I have to do is tag posts in a certain way, and my "scheduler" and the Medium API does the rest.</p>
<p>I will be evaluating which of my stories go up to Medium on an individual basis. I'm not wanting everything to go there, but would like to open up some of my work for discussion on the platform. While I already share my API Evangelists posts to LinkedIn and Facebook, I will also be syndicating select stories using <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/47445/long-form-posts-on-linkedin-overview?lang=en">LinkedIn Publishing</a> and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2015/09/22/instant-articles-from-CMS/">Facebook Instant Articles</a>&nbsp;next. I will only be publishing my content to platforms that bring value, but more importantly have APIs so I can retain as much control over my work from a central location within my domain.</p>
<p>You can find everything <a href="https://medium.com/@kinlane">published under @KinLane over a Medium</a>, something I might expand upon with specific publications in the near future, but for now, I'll keep it all under my user account.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-brand.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com/">I am tracking on the approaches of API providers who have branding&nbsp;world together when it comes to platform operations</a>. I'm always surprised at how few API providers actually have anything regarding branding in place, especially when it seems like loss of&nbsp;brand control, attribution, and other concerns seem to be at the top of everyone's list.</p>
<p>I was hooking up the <a href="https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs">Medium API</a> to my API monitoring and publishing system, syndicating select stories of mine to the platform and found myself thinking about how important an API branding strategy is (should be) to content platforms like them. Medium doesn't let you pull posts via the API (yet), but if it did, I would make sure branding and attribution was&nbsp;default.</p>
<p>Few API providers have their API brand strategy together, let alone provide easy to understand&nbsp;and find assets to support the strategy. It seems like to me that if you are concerned about brand control, or just want to really extend your brand across all websites and mobile applications where your API resources are put to use, you would want to bake branding and attribution into the API response itself, as well as a robust branding area of the developer portal.</p>
<p>I'm going to explore concepts around branding and attribution as a default layer of API access. Everything from thinking about hypermedia approaches to providing link relations, to maybe <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/http-header-awareness-using-the-link-header-for-pagination/">including link relations in the header like Github does with pagination</a>, but using branding and attribution focused link relations. I would like to be able to provide light footprint options that may not require changing up the JSON response, or add an entirely new media type.</p>
<p>When Medium does open up /GET for posts on the platform, I'd be stoked if there were branding and attribution elements present, driven by settings in my account. I'm not under the delusion that every developer who makes a call to an API will respect branding guidelines, but if it is front and center with every API call, and easy to implement, the chances increase dramatically.</p>
<p>Anyways, some food for thought around branding. I will push this topic forward as I have time&nbsp;and maybe play with a prototype for the API Evangelist&nbsp;blog. I'd love for consumers and syndicators of my content to be able to extend the reach of my brand, or at least send some love my way with a little attribution.</p>

<p>I was watching my partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) build the <a href="https://twitter.com/weaponizedu">weaponized edu Twitter bot</a> using a Google Spreadsheet as an engine.<a href="http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-google-spreadsheets-version-04/"> Something she learned from Zach Whalen, a professor at University of Mary Washington</a>. Audrey is not a programmer, but she has become extremely&nbsp;proficient at building these little bots, and using the Twitter API--demonstrating the potential of Google Sheets as an engine for an API-driven bot solutions, or in this case bot mayhem.</p>
<p>Zach's approach is extremely well defined--you will have to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cbg_6pYN04XtDHpDLtxAP3ExQEBL8PYBXBQ1E5_Sq30/copy">copy and go through the spreadsheet yourself to see</a>. Everything you need to get the job done is there, from step by step instructions, to storing your API tokens, and planting the seeds for your bot intelligence. This is the kind of API stuff I'm always talking about when I say that API shouldn't just be for developers--all it takes is having no fear of APIs, and well laid out blueprints like Zach has provided.</p>
<p>It is an approach I'd like to explore more as I have time. I'm not a big fan of the spreadsheet but I fully get its role amongst muggle society. Spreadsheets keep me fascinated because of the many dimensions of API they possess. Spreadsheets can provide APIs, consume APIs, and as Zach's approach to bot development demonstrates, they can be a pretty serious engine for driving API goodness.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_boost_incentives.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm expanding on my <a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com/">API branding research</a>, putting some thought into <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/22/providing-branding-and-attribution-assets-with-each-api-response/">how we might be able to include branding and attribution in API responses</a>. Next, I'd like to brainstorm ways to incentivize both API providers, as well as API consumers to employ sensible branding practices. You'd think API providers would be all over this stuff, but for some reason, they seem to need as much encouragement, and structure as API consumers do--this is why I'm wanting to explore how I can drive both sides.</p>
<p>First, why do I care about branding when it comes to APIs? Well, the more successful companies are with their APIs, the more their companies brand can be not just protected, but enhanced--the more APIs are seen in a positive light, rather than the threat to brand control that is often cast on them. And, the more APIs we have, the more access to valuable data and content for use in web, and mobile applications.</p>
<p>While there are many nuances to API branding, it often centers around making text, link, and image assets available&nbsp;for developers to use wherever they put API driven data, content, and algorithms to use. APIs have many different approaches to branding requirements and enforcement, but few actually provide rich assets and tooling to support a coherent branding strategy. All it takes is a handful of logos, some JavaScript APIs, and guidance for developers, and branding can significantly extend the reach of any brand--not hurt it as many perceive an API will do.</p>
<p>The benefits of branding to API provider are clear for me, but I'd like to explore what we can do to incentivize API consumers. What if, with all the tracking of where branding and attribution are deployed (aka API brand reach), we tracked each domain or subdomain, as well as each impression of text, logos, and other assets? &nbsp;What if network reach and brand exposure could buy me API credits, and raise my API rate limits as a consumer? I mean, as a developer I'm potentially extending the reach of your brand, providing you with valuable exposure, and potentially inbound links and traffic--if I am rewarded for doing this, the chances I execute healthy API branding practices will ony increase.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts on incentivizing both the API provider and consumer sides of the coin when it comes to API branding. I am going to play around with a design for a simple set of logos and JavaScript APIs for supporting API branding assets. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/22/providing-branding-and-attribution-assets-with-each-api-response/">I'm going to also play around with baking in links to these resources within API responses either as JSON collections or present in headers</a>. Once in place, I'll have a better idea of the type of data I can collect, and how it can possibly be measured, and applied to increasing API rate limits or possible equal credits for API access--all things I know developers will want.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more on API branding in coming weeks...</p>

<p>People love to tell me the limitations of my usage of the acronym API. They like to point out they were around before the web, that they are used in hardware, or are not an API unless it is REST. There are endless waves of dudes who like to tell me what I mean when I say API. To help counter-balance&nbsp;each wave I like to regularly&nbsp;evolve, and share what I mean when I say API--not what people might interpret I mean.</p>
<p>When I say API, I am talking about exposing data, content, or algorithm as an interface for programmatic use in other applications via web technology. Application in "Application Programming Interface" means any "application" to me, not just a software application. Consider visualizations, image rendering, bots, devices, or any other way that web technology is being applied in 2016.</p>
<p>I do not mean REST when I say API. I do not mean exclusively dynamic&nbsp;APIs--it could simply be a JSON &nbsp;data store &nbsp;made available via a Github repo. If machine-readable data, content, and algorithms are being accessed using web technology for use in any application, in a programmatic way--I'm calling it API. You may have your own interpretations, and be bringing your own API baggage along for the ride, but this is what I'm talking about when you hear me say API.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/21/the-psa-peugeot-citrons-apis/">The PSA Peugeot Citroën’s APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/psa_group_for_developers_api_for_connected_cars_peugeot_citroen_and_ds_automobiles.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was turned on to <a href="https://developer.psa-peugeot-citroen.com/">the API program out of&nbsp;Groupe PSA</a>, &nbsp;the French multinational manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles sold under the Peugeot, Citro&euml;n and DS Automobiles brands from a friend online the other day. Rarely do I just generally showcase an API provider, but I think their approach is simple, clean, and a nice start for a major automobile brand, and worthwhile to take note of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies of all shapes are doing APIs, but very few have the awareness to make their API program public, and accessible to the general public. I think the&nbsp;<span>PSA Peugeot Citro&euml;n&rsquo;s APIs are a pretty interesting set of resources for making available to car owners, and worth talking about:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Telemetry</strong> - Request data from the car: average speed, location, instantaneous consumption, engine speed, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Alerting -</strong> Request data from the various events or notifications that can be detected by the car: time before maintenance, fired alerts, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Correlation - </strong>These APIs lets your application evaluate your driving style with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making vehicle data, events and notifications makes sense to me when it comes to vehicles and APIs, and is something that seems like it should just be default&nbsp;mode for all automobile manufacturers. The correlation API seems in a different category, and elevated to more of an innovate class, beyond just the usual car activity. I'm not a huge car guy, but I know people who are, and being able to size up against the competition or a specific community, could become a little addictive.</p>
<p>I've added the&nbsp;PSA Peugeot Citro&euml;n&rsquo;s APIs to my monitoring of the space, and will keep an eye on what they are up to. I'm already following other user manufacturers&nbsp;like <a href="https://developer.ford.com/">Ford</a> and <a href="https://developer.gm.com/">GM</a> who have API efforts, as well as <a href="https://developer.hondasvl.com/">Japanese manufactuers like Honda</a>. I may have to stop, and take roll call in the world of automobiles and see who have official public API develop efforts, and put some pressure on those who do not have their program together yet (like they'll listen).</p>
<p>If you know of any auto related API efforts I do not already have in <a href="http://auto.stack.network/">my auto API stack</a>, please let me know--I depend on my readers to keep me tuned into which companies are the cool kids doing API.</p>

<p>A recent story&nbsp;from Gordon Wintrob (<a href="https://twitter.com/gwintrob">@gwintrob</a>) about how T<a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.wmhz62h57">wilio's distributed team solves developer</a><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.wmhz62h57">evangelism</a>&nbsp;has given me a variety of seeds for stories on API Evangelist this week. I love that in 2016, even after an IPO, I am still writing positive things about Twilio and showcasing them as an example for other API providers to emulate.</p>
<p>Twilio just gets APIs, and they deeply understand how to effectively build a community of passionate developers, demonstrated by this statement from Gordon's story on developing credibility:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>How do you have technical credibility? You have to really be part of your programming community. Each of us is a member of our community, not marketing or trying to sell to it.</em></p>
<p>It sounds so simple. Yet is something so many companies struggle with. An API community is often seen as something external, and often times even the API is seen as something external, and this is where most API efforts fail. I know, you are saying that not all companies can be API-first, where the API is the core product focus like Twilio--it doesn't matter. Not being able to integrate with your developer community, is more about your company culture, than it is about APIs.</p>
<p>Another area my audience will critique me is around sales--you have to do sales to make money! Yes, and even Twilio has a sales team to come in at the right time. This is about building technical credibility with your developer community, by truly being part of it--if you are always trying to sell to them, there will always be an us and them vibe, and you will never truly be part of your own community.</p>
<p>As an API provider, I always recommend that you get out there and use other APIs, to experience the pain of being an API consumer. Using Twilio, and participating in the Twilio community should be the 101 edition of this. Where all API providers spend a couple of months using the Twilio API, and "actively" participating in their community before getting to work on their own API program.</p>

<p>I was working on a&nbsp;<a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">forkable definition of my API portal</a>&nbsp;and I wanted to evolve the icons that I usually use as part of my API storytelling. I primarily use the <a href="http://api.thenounproject.com/">Noun Project API</a>, to associate simple black and white icons which represent&nbsp;the stories I tell, companies I showcase, and topics I cover. One area I find the Noun Project deficient&nbsp;is when it comes to icons for specific technologies, so while working on my project I wanted to find a new source. I fired up the Googles and got to work.</p>
<p>I quickly came across <a href="http://devicon.fr/">Devicon,&nbsp;a set of icons representing programming languages</a>, designing &amp; development tools which you can use as a font or with&nbsp;SVG code. <a href="https://github.com/konpa/devicon">At the Github repo for the project</a>, it says they have&nbsp;78 icons with over 200 versions total. I used a set of the icons to d<a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/code/">isplay API SDKs on my API portal prototype</a>, allowing anyone who forks to turn on and off which programming languages they offer SDKs for.</p>
<p>Being pretty graphically challenged, as you can tell by my logo, I'm a big fan of projects like <a href="http://devicon.fr/">Devicon</a>--especially when they make it so simple, and so good looking, all at the same time. If you are needing icons for your API portal I recommend taking a look at what they are doing. They have images for all the technology that cool kids are using these days, and they seem open to crafting more if you find something missing.</p>

<p>People love to tell me how unreliable APIs are, while also echoing this sentiment across the tech blogosphere. I always find it challenging <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/05/reconciling-how-reliable-apis-are-while-also-embracing-tone-set-by-vc-investment/">to reconcile how the entrenreurs&nbsp;who spread these tales choose to put the blame on the technology</a>, and not the companies behind the technology, or more appropriately the investment behind the companies. APIs are just a reflection of what is going on already within a company, and are good, nor bad--they are just a tool that can be implemented well, or not so well.</p>
<p>I was taking some time this last week to work on my API monitoring system, which I call Laneworks. In addition to having my own API stack, <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">I depend on a variety of other APIs to operate my business</a>. As I was kicking the tires, poking around the code for some of my most valuable integrations I found myself thinking about the stability and reliability of APIs, and how stable some APIs have been for me.</p>
<p>Since 2011 I have stored ALL heavy objects (images, video, audio) used in my API monitoring and research on S3. I have NEVER had to update the code. Since 2012 I have used Pinboard as the core of my API curation system, aggregating links I favorited on Twitter, and added using my browser bookmarklet--again I have NEVER updated the code that drives this. Since 2013 all of my public websites run on Github using Github Pages, employing the Github API to publish blog posts, and all other content and data used in my research.</p>
<p>The Amazon S3, Pinboard, and Github APIs make my business work. Three suppliers who have been working without a problem for 5, 4, and 3 years. The only thing I have had to do is pay my bill, and keep my API keys rotated, and the reliable API vendors to the rest. Storing images, video, and audio, curated the news and other stories I share with you&nbsp;and publish the blog posts and web pages you use to browse my API research. So explain to me, why would you want to build a business on APIs, when they are so unreliable?</p>

<p>As the API Evangelist, I spend a lot of time thinking about evangelism (*your mind is&nbsp;blown*). <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/22/the-expanding-world-of-technology-evangelism/">TFrom what I'm seeing, the world of technology evangelism has been expanding</a>, where database, container, and other types of platforms are borrowing the approaches proven by API pioneers like Amazon and Twilio. As I'm doing work with Erik Wilde (@dret) around his <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">Webconcepts.info work</a>, and reading <a href="https://opcfoundation.org/about/what-is-opc/">an article about industrial automation standards</a>, I'm left thinking about how important evangelism is going to be for standards and specifications.</p>
<p>Standards are super important, so I have to be frank--the community tends to suck at evangelizing itself, in an accessible way that reflects the success established in the API world. I'm super thankful for folks like Erik Wilde, Mike Amundsen, and others who work tirelessly to evangelism API related web concepts, specifications, and standards. The importance of outreach and positive evangelism around standards reflect the reasons why I started API Evangelist--to make APIs more accessible to the masses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I have to get behind folks like Erik who step up to help evangelize standards. I do not have the dedication required to tune into the W3C, IANA, ISO, and other standards bodies, and super thankful for those who do. So if I can help any of you standard obsessed folks hone your approach to storytelling, and evangelism let me know. I'd love to see standards evangelism become commonplace--making them more friendly, accessible, and known across the tech sector.</p>

<p>I have been slowly evolving the data core of each of my research projects from JSON to YAML. I'm still providing JSON, and even XML, Atom, CSV, and other machine-readable representations as part of my research, but the core of each project, which lives in the Jekyll _data folder are all YAML moving forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first started using YAML I didn't much care for it. When the OpenAPI Specification introduced the YAML version, in addition to the JSON version, I wasn't all that impressed. It felt like the early days of JSON back in 2008 when I was making the switch from primarily XML to a more JSON-friendly&nbsp;environment. It took me a while to like JSON&nbsp;because I really liked my XML--now it is taking me a while to like YAML&nbsp;because I really like my JSON.</p>
<p>I do not anticipate that JSON will go the same way that XML did for me. I think it will remain a dominant machine-readable format in what I do, but YAML is proving to have more value as the core of my work--especially when it is managed with Jekyll and Github. I am enjoying having been in the industry long enough to see these cycles, and be in a position where I can hopefully think more thoughtfully&nbsp;about each one as it occurs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://d3.js.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/bar-chart/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://d3.js.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/images/d3-js-bar-chart.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am increasingly using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> as part of my storytelling process. Since all my websites run using Jekyll, and published entirely using Github repositories wich are shared as Github Page sites, it makes sense to standardize how I publish my visualizations.</p>
<p>Jekyll provides a wealth of data management tools, including the ability to manage YAML dta stores in the _data folder. An approach I feel is not very well understand, and lacks real world examples regarding how to use when managing open data--I am looking to change that.</p>
<p>I like my data visualizations beautiful, dynamic, with the data right behind--making <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> the obvious choice. For this work, I took data intended for use as a bar and pie chart&nbsp;and published as YAML to this Github repositories _data folder. This approach to centrally storing machine-readable data, in the simple, more readable YAML format, makes the data behind visualizations much more accessible in my opinion.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/0ee5a0eff2de2038dc3b69b88f563097.js"></script>
<p>The problem with using D3.js visualization&nbsp;is that I need it in JSON format. Thankfully, using Jekyll and Liquid, I can easily establish dynamic versions of my data in JSON, XML, or any other format I need it in. I place these JSON pages in a separate folder I am just calling /data.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/148fd30889a79d324bd21e7c271cbb5b.js"></script>
<p>Now I have the JSON I need to power my D3.js visualizations. To share the actual visualization, I created separate editions for my bar and pie charts, and have the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for each chart, in its own file.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/27a4628dbb9c3f4392b2efb8d7500366.js"></script>
<p>There are two things being accomplished here. 1) I'm decoupling the data source in a way that makes it easier to swap in and out different D3.js visualizations, and 2) I'm centralizing the data management, making it easily managed by even a non-technical operator, who just needs to grasp how Jekyll and YAML works--which dramatically lowers the barriers to entry for managing the data needed for visualizations.</p>
<p>There is definitely a learning curve involved. Jekyll, Github Pages, and YAML take some time to absorb, but the reverse engineerability of this approach lends itself to reuse&nbsp;and reworking by any data curious person that isn't afraid of Github. I'm hoping to keep publishing any new D3.js visualization I create in this way, to provide small, forkable, data-driven visualizations that can be used as part of data storytelling efforts-<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/d3-js-using-yaml-jekyll">everything here is available as a public repo</a>.</p>
<p>As a 25-year data veteran, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2016/08/15/using-github-repos-and-jekyll-as-a-data-store/">I find myself very intrigued with the potential of Jekyll as a data management solution, something that when you combine with the social coding benefits of Github, and Github Pages, can unleash unlimited possibilities</a>. I'm going to keep working to define small, modular examples of how to do this, and publish as individual Github lessons for you to fork and learn from.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am reworking the management layer for my APIs. For the last couple of years, I had aspirations of running my APIs with a retail layer generating revenue for API Evangelist--something which required a more comprehensive API management layer. In 2016, I'm not really interested in generating revenue from the APIs I operate, I'm just looking to put them to work in my own business, and if others want access I'm happy to open things up and broker some volume deals.</p>
<p>To accomplish this I really do not need heavy security or service composition for my APIs, I'm just needed to limit who has access so they aren't just 100% public, and identify those who are using, and how much they are actually consuming. To facilitate this I am just going to use Github as a trusted layer for authentication. Using an OAuth proxy, I'll let my own applications authenticate using their respective Github user, and identify themselves using a Github OAuth token when making calls to each API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each application I have operating on top of my APIs have its own Github account. Once they do the OAuth dance with my proxy, my system will then have a Github token identifying who they are. I won't need to validate the token is still good with each call, something I'll verify each hour or day, and cache locally to improve API performance. Anytime an unidentified token comes through, I'll just make a call to Github, and get the Github users associated, and check them against a trusted list of Github users who I have approved for accessing my APIs.</p>
<p>I'm not really interested in securing access to all the content, data, and algorithms I'm exposing using APIs. I'm only looking to identify which applications are putting them to work&nbsp;and evaluate their amount of usage each day and month. This way I can monitor my own API consumption, while still opening things up to partners or any other 3rd party developer that I trust--if they are using too much, I can drop them a message to have a conversation about next steps.</p>
<p>I'm still rolling out this system out, but it got me thinking about API access in general, and the possibilities that a trusted list of Github accounts could be used to expedite API registration, application setup, and the obtaining keys. Imagine if as a developer I could just ping any API, do an OAuth dance with my Github credentials, and get back my application id and secret keys for making API calls--all in a single flow. As an API provider I could just maintain a single trusted list of Github users, as well as consult other lists maintained by companies or individuals I trust, and reduce friction when onboarding, or automatically&nbsp;approve developers for higher levels of access and consumption.</p>

<p>APIs come in all different shapes and sizes. I focus on a specific type of APIs that leverage web technology for making data, content, and algorithms available over the Internet. While these APIs are available on the open Internet, who has the ability to discover, and put them to use will vary significantly. APIs have gained in popularity because of successful publicly available APIs like Twitter and Twilio, something that has contributed to these types of APIs being the dominant narrative of what APIs are.</p>
<p>A lack of awareness of what modern approaches to API management can do for securing web APIs as well as the dominance of this narrative that APIs need to be open like Twitter and Twilio tends to set the bar to unrealistic levels for API providers. Who has access to a web API is just one dimension of what APIs are, and sharing content, data, and algorithms securely via the web should be the focus. It's not whether&nbsp;or not we should do public or private APIs--it is about how you will be sharing your resources in a digital economy.</p>
<p>While I encourage ALL companies, institutions, and government agencies to be as transparent as they possibly can regarding the presence of their APIs, its documentation, and other resources--who actually&nbsp;can access them is entirely up to the discretion of each provider. You should treat ALL your APIs like they use public infrastructure (aka the web), secure them appropriately, and get to work making sure all your digital resources are accessible in this way, not being bogged down by useless legacy discussions.</p>
<p>Which is why I support putting the concept of the public API to rest as a dominant narrative around what is an API--you shouldn't hear me talking about public vs private anymore. If you do slap me.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Sep 2016</span>
        <p>The power of Jekyll on Github Pages as a data management solutions is not a very widely held concept. I'm always amazed at how technologists and programmers don't understand <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, let alone how it can be used as a data engine--maybe I can help a little by sharing my own usage. As I develop examples of this in action, I want to publish them as <a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/">Github repositories that anyone can fork and reverse engineer to use in their own work</a>.</p>
<p>While it was not love at first sight for me, I'm increasingly becoming a fan of using YAML for storing and managing a significant portion of the data I use across my business. Part of the reasons I'm using YAML is its readability. The other reasons stem from the augmented benefits of using Jekyll and Github Pages to store and syndicate machine readable YAML for use across my storytelling--when you put YAML data into the _data folder for any Jekyll site, it opens up a new world of possibilities.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/325b2f3ca761b5deaf52666f78117b5d.js"></script>
<p>Any YAML data I put into the _data folder immediately become objects I can work with across any HTML page within a Jekyll site, <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">using Liquid</a>. Where this really starts to impact my world is when I started dynamically generating other formats of data stored as YAML.</p>
<p>First up is JSON. Here is the file I am using to generate a JSON representation of my central YAML file stored in _data folder.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/470db918abe87ac309c373c998e7a1c1.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/data/products.json">Which when I view in my browser, via the Jekyll driven, Github Pages published website&nbsp;I get a separate JSON representation</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/01a280996ba007a6806852ae312ef26b.js"></script>
<p>Next up is XML. Here is the file I am using to generate a XML representation of my central YAML file stored in _data folder.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/37f5a98f29869dce1f243ea5a9a4ba7d.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/data/products.xml">Which when I view in my browser, via the Jekyll driven, Github Pages published website&nbsp;I get a separate XML representation</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/4abec529e89e4b87a558a6e15986d8a3.js"></script>
<p>Next up is Atom. Maybe I may want a feed of the latest products added to the catalog, so here is the file I am using to generate an Atom XML representation of my central YAML file stored in _data folder.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/48fbdd576049d25257b2efafba7e0738.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/data/atom.xml">Which when I view in my browser, via the Jekyll driven, Github Pages published website, I get a separate Atom XML representation</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/c4ecdeadf80622c2b54e040355745f2b.js"></script>
<p>From a single YAML file, I just generated a JSON, XML, and Atom representation of the same list of products. <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/xml-json-using-yaml-jekyll">It is all stored in a Github repository, and published as a Jekyll website hosted using Github Pages</a>. This particular Github repo is meant to just be a demonstration of what is possible using Jekyll, YAML, and Github Pages. I will use this work as a base in a variety of other projects, where I use these various formats to drive web and mobile applications, as well as visualizations and analytics used across my API storytelling.</p>
<p>There are a wealth of reasons why I conduct this type of work. First, it is work I will use in my own research and storytelling, which all operates using Github and Jekyll. Second, doing my work out in the open, using open source tools and definitions, published as Github repositories making my work forkable, and reusable by others. There is a learning curve involved with unpacking what is happening here, but I feel pretty strongly that these are reusable modules that anyone can put to use--not just developers.</p>
<p>I will publish other examples of this in action as I develop them. When I need the Liquid scripts to generate JSON, XML, or Atom feeds in any of my projects I will just visit this repo, and copy / paste. When I develop new ones I will generalize and publish here for everyone to use as well.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-portal.jpg" alt="" width="20%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">I am updating my minimum API portal definition</a>&nbsp;so I can apply to my own API infrastructure, and since I operate 100% on Github using Github Page and Jekyll, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/portal-minimum">I have made it a forkable API portal definition that anyone can put to work as their own API developer portal</a>. This edition of my API portal definition uses Bootstrap for its UI, and Jekyll for the CMS, making it pretty extensible, and remixable once you fork it on Github.</p>
<p>My goal was to make a simple, forkable API portal, that could act as a checklist for API providers looking to quickly set up a presence for their API. I know many companies, institutions, and government agencies do not have the resources&nbsp;to host one, let alone the time to pay attention to all the details--that is my job! To help API providers out, I have included what I feel is a&nbsp;complete API portal in the&nbsp;_config.yml for the Jekyll site.</p>
<p>All you have to do is scroll down the API portal definition and comment out what you don't want, and fill in the areas you do, and the Jekyll site should do the rest. I've included the most common areas I like to see from all API providers in my definition.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/minimum_api_portal.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>

<p>This is just the first draft of my forkable API portal definition. I am going to apply to my Kin Lane, and API Evangelist API infrastructure, as well as a handful of independent APIs that I operate. Then I'm going to apply it to a couple of government APIs I want to simplify, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/08/defining-api-surface-area-by-converting-html-forms-to-open-api-specs/">like the USGS Water Services I am working o</a>n, to harden it a little bit. Sometimes all it takes is to better organize the information for an API, to help make it more accessible, and intuitive, reducing the friction when trying to get up and running.</p>
<p>I would wait a couple weeks to fork the API portal definition, until I stabilize it some more against theother APIs, unless you are feeling adventurous. If you aren't afraid of working with YAML, Jekyll, and Liquid driven HTML, the API portal is pretty fun to play with. If nothing else, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/portal-minimum/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml">you can use the&nbsp;_config.yml as a checklist to think about as you review or craft your own API portal</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Sep 2016</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-sketchbook.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I have a vision of an API notebook in my head I desperately want to get out. First of all, I want to come up with another name for it, which is a journey that always starts with playing around with synonyms. Direct synonyms of notebook include a diary, journal, log, workbook, pad, and binder-yes, all of that is relevant to what I would like to see. After that, a few other words resonated, including album, collection, portfolio, and registry.</p>
<p>This isn't just a folder to put my API definitions. It will be the place where I go to find all <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">the definitions of 3rd party API which IÂ depend on</a>, as well as the APIs I'm designing, deploying, and operating as part of my own business. I want to be able to just record ideas, sketches, and thoughts I have as I'm thinking about APIs. I want to be able to annotate APIs that I find, and iterate, remix, and riff off of other API designers and architects work. Maybe an API sketchbook?</p>
<p>An artistic design book is just the beginning. I'd also like it to be my professional sketchbook,Â where my business partners and customers can discover the API I depend on, and share with the world. I want it to be a directory of APIs that are relevant to my business. My sketchbook is where I'm creative, but it is also where I get business done. Maybe acting as an API portfolio? I want it to be fun, but also accommodate my professional existence as well.Â </p>
<p>I just want a place where I can design and evolve the API definitions that impact my world. I want to be able to share them, as well as subscribe to other people's API designs. I want my designs versioned, and be able to play back their evolution, and see a timeline, and possibly the attributions of where I found my API inspiration, or leveraged an existing definition or specification. My API sketchbook / folio should evolve with me, and help me make sense of all the API definitions I use, discovery new ones, and always help me not reinvent the wheel.Â </p>
<p>Crafting my dream API sketchbook / portfolio is easier to write about than it will be to build. Doing it simply and beautifully will be hard. Doing it so it scales, and allows me to manage not just 10s or 100s of APIs, but work from thousands of APIs will be very difficult. I'm hoping it is something that I won't have to build on my own, and is an idea that many will contribute to, helping push forward the converstion around how we craft, store, organize, and collaborate around the APIs that are increasingly playing a central role in our business and personal world.</p>

<p>Leading API providers do not always make me happy with they way they conduct themselves, but it always makes me smile that one of the top API providers consistently over the last five years, continues to do things right, and set a good example that I can write about. I am not delusional to think that everything is perfect behind the Twilio curtain, but a story&nbsp;from Gordon Wintrob (<a href="https://twitter.com/gwintrob">@gwintrob</a>) about how T<a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.wmhz62h57">wilio's distributed team solves developer </a><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.wmhz62h57">evangelism</a>&nbsp;leaves me hopeful (once again) about the potential of APIs.</p>
<p>There are several gems in this post, but one of them that stood out for me, and I think reflects the API potential which more companies should be emulating, is about how Twilio designs, develops&nbsp;and evolves new APIs. I think Gordon tells it the best:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.eigslel5d">We also have a broader concept of our Developer Network, which handles a lot of the coding and writing for our public-facing documentation, blog posts, and our interactions with the community. Typically they&rsquo;ll give feedback on the budding ideas for the new API. This feedback comes long before it goes out to the first beta customers.</a></em></p>
<div><em><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.eigslel5d">The Developer Network brings a fresh set of eyes with less biased perspectives. They&rsquo;ll say things like, &ldquo;You know what? These parts of the API are awesome. This is what I would use it for.&rdquo; or &ldquo;These are the things that need work.&rdquo; That way we know how the API would work for a developer at a hackathon or trying to finish the story points in a sprint. How do we make it as easy as possible for them?</a></em></div>
<p id="fd0b" class="graf--p graf-after--p" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.eigslel5d">Once the API or service comes together, we go to a closed beta process for a small group of customers. If we do a product announcement at all, then we&rsquo;ll have a &ldquo;request access&rdquo; button. We&rsquo;ll use that as a list of people that are really chomping at the bit to get coding. Then, after a period of time, when we have some API stability with people in our private beta process, we&rsquo;ll switch to a public beta. Then it&rsquo;s open to everyone who needs access.</a></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.eigslel5d">We get more feedback before we go fully operational, but there should be no API instability after a public beta period. As an API company, we can&rsquo;t go and change that underlying API once it&rsquo;s in production. That would be a terrible experience. If we really need to change that endpoint API, it should be a new version.</a></em></p>
<p>Forgive me for just copying and pasting this much from your story Gordon, but I think it needs isolation as its own story. This is the approach to designing, developing, and operating APIs that companies need to hear more about. These are the technical product development benefits which being API-first can bring to the table. It's not just about providing data, content, and algorithms available via the web, it is about opening up the conception, design, and iteration of these API resource in a structured, collaborative, and evolutionary lifecycle on the web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what makes Twilio such a great API role model to showcase. I know Gordon is telling pretty stories, originating from Twilio, but like the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">secret to Amazon's success</a>--these stories can have a significant impact on how individuals, companies, institutions, and government gencies approach technology within their own operations. Thanks for such a good story Gordon, providing me with some material to riff on.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">I've been pushing for better API design tooling for some time now</a>, something that significantly overlaps with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">movements I would also like to see around API documentation as well</a>. In my opinion, we have made significant strides with the introduction of Swagger UI, as well as pushed the API documentation conversation to be part of the API design process by Apiary. This is something that was further re-enforced with the evolution of Swagger UI to be part of the Swagger Editor toolkit--where Swagger UI was used in real-time as part of the API design process, not just later down the road as API documentation for consumers.</p>
<p>This demonstrates for me the importance of API documentation, not just in helping API consumers understand what an API does at integration time, but also for API providers at design, mock, test, and any other time during the API lifecycle. Functional, attractive looking, and often interactive documentation that describes what an API does is needed from design to deprecation, and is an area of the API world that I feel is pretty underserved at the moment.</p>
<p>Swagger UI is a 100% client side JavaScript solution, which if you've ever cracked open the code, know that it cannot be used as a base template to move this&nbsp;conversation forward. The more <a href="https://github.com/lord/slate">attractive Slate solution</a> is appealing right up <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">until you realize it doesn't perpetuate the machine readable API core</a> we will need to successfully integrate with every other stop along the API lifecycle. I haven't seen any movement out <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">the efforts to make an OpenAPI Spec driven Slate</a>, but I am pleased with the movements by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/25/a-new-open-source-interactive-api-documentation-from-folks-over-at-lucybot/">Lucybot in their Lucybot Console</a>. These are moving the needle a little bit&nbsp;but won't get us far down the road when it comes to API documentation that can be used across all stops along the lifecycle without friction.</p>
<p>We will need API documentation that can be published in web, mobile, and &nbsp;desktop solutions that are serving the API community. It needs to be easily embeddable, on any platform, and help API designers, architects, consumers, analysts, and anyone else with a stake in the outcome &nbsp;understand what the hell is going on. We need our API documentation to be plug and play in our API portals like Swagger UI has been. We need API documentation to be a driver of the API design and mock conversations like Apiary has injected. We need it to drive other areas of API management like Gelato and Readme are doing, or other areas of the API lifecycle like APIMATIC is doing for helping us managing SDKs.</p>
<p>We need a 100% client-side solution, as well as a diverse range of supercharged server and desktop solutions, that can be used across the API life cycle, whether supporting creation or consumption. We need an open source solution run by a benevolent dictator (not it), who will help ensure its platform agnostic, and has a fully customizable UI and styling, which can be embedded into leading API services and tooling, helping standardize the documentation for each area of the API lifecycle. We need the next steps in the evolution of API documentation, and visualization to be set into motion in 2016.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/16/learning-from-the-success-of-swagger-ui/">Learning From The Success Of Swagger UI</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-openapi-spec.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I feel like we haven't really sat down and studied the success of Swagger UI. I'm not talking about the OpenAPI Spec (fka Swagger Spec), I am only talking about the interactive API documentation that you can find on Github. Aside from the shitshow that was the movement of Swagger to be OpenSpec API, I'm thinking there are some lessons available around just the interactive API documentation itself.</p>
<p>First, we have to acknowledge that many people think Swagger is the documentation, and do not understand the separate nature of the specification, and the UI layer that is meant to be API documentation, and used within API tooling like the Swagger Editor. While there are numerous benefits realized from the concept of the OpenAPI Spec, the number one reason people implement is to deploy the interactive API documentation.</p>
<p>People need documentation for their API to communicate what it does with consumers, as well as other key stakeholders throughout the API life cycle. From what I can tell, this need is not being addressed in any new and innovative ways since the launch of Swagger UI, aside from the small group of API documentation service provider that have emerged. I can get behind paying for additional API lifecycle solutions as part of a service, but API document just seems like it should always be free by default--as well as evolved separately from the concerns of an aspiring startup.Â </p>
<p>Let me try and sum up what made Swagger UI so good. It was forkable. You could fork the repo, make tweaks to the core Swagger JSON file, and if you had it published using Github Pages, you had documentation! I feel like this represents the minimum viable expenditures that API developers are willing to make when it comes to providing API documentation -- WSDL +1 (not very much). If you could understand how to tweak the JSON file, which many just see as a config file for Swagger (UI), you could have good looking (enough) API docs.</p>
<p>Nobody has evolved on this concept. Nobody. I'm sorry, there are some slick implementations within leading API service providers, but nobody has even replicated what is Swagger UI, using the Slate, Lucybot, or other evolved and attractive UI. We need a simple, forkable, OpenAPI Spec driven replacement for Swagger UI--just to compete. Then we need to get to work on a better iteration of it, something that can be used in any web, mobile, or desktop solution. Sadly, API providers don't want to work very hard to publish documentation and other resources, and I'm guessing that if they have to cough up some money, they'll most often just keep looking.</p>
<p>I feel like nobody has stopped to consider the success of Swagger UI. Not even the Swagger team. Nobody is building upon the forkability, and plug and playability that Swagger UI brought to API documentation. You know why? Because everyone is focused on building products. The OG Swagger wasn't a product, it was built to deliver on a need that API providers had. Everyone is focusing on building the next service they can sell, not the next solution API providers will need. I know, we need people building good products and services--I agree. The problem is when EVERYONE is focused on products and services, and nobody is interested delivering the open tooling the community needs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/16/a-look-at-the-state-of-api-documentation-solutions/">A Look At The State Of API Documentation Solutions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/swagger_ui_petstore.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>A friend of mine was asking where he should get started with upgrading the documentation for an existing API, and was asking for assistance on what tools or services he should be considering. The state of things when it comes to API document shifts and changes, which is why I do my research the way I do, to ensure I have <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">a single static location I can go find the latest for my research in API documentation</a>, when I get questions like this.</p>
<p>Discussing API documentation like many aspects of the API conversation can be difficult, due to a wide range of views on exactly what is API documentation. Some people consider the entire API portal, including the documentation, some include other code libraries, etc, but I define it as specific documentation describing the API surface area (auth &amp; request / response). As I begin my work, at first glance, the world of API documentation seems like it has evolved, but after a quick look through my research, I see it really hasn't evolved that much.</p>
<p><strong>Swagger UI Changing How We Document Our APIs</strong><br />In 2011 how we documented our APIs changed significantly with the introduction of the <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger specification and UI</a>. The simple, visual, interactive documentation which was driven by the now OPenAPI Spec, shifted the conversation for how we provide documentation. All you had to do was generate the machine-readable specification, and the interactive documentation was automatically generated--solving one of the biggest obstacles for API providers.</p>
<p><strong>Apiary Providing Design, Mocking, Testing, and Documentation</strong><br />Building on what Swagger UI provided, the service provider <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io </a>entered the game with their own version of the API documentation but shifted the conversation around documenting APIs earlier on in the life-cycle, during the design portion of the work. I consider Apiary to be first and foremost an API design service provider, but they are also a contender when it comes to API documentation because their solution spans multiple stops along the life cycle including design, mocking, testing, portal, and documentation.</p>
<p>In the last five years, I've watched Swagger play a central role in many of the design, and documentation solutions out there, with providers like Restlet and Apigee following the lead for how we document our APIs--further contributing to the success of OpenAPI Spec as the driving specification. I've also watched Apiary evolve as a service, and adopt OpenAPI Spec as well as yusing their own format API Blueprint, as the driving specification for API documentation--setting the stage for a new breed of API service providers.</p>
<p><strong>API Documentation Service Providers</strong><br />Along the way other services have launched, building on what we've seen from Apiary, but I think taking the API portal, and API documentation conversations in their own direction.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gelato.io/">Gelato.io</a> - An API portal plus documentation service that was now purchased by Mashape.</li>
<li><a href="https://readme.io/">Readme.io</a> - Another API portal plus documentation service, with a wealth of API management resources.</li>
<li><a href="https://api-docs.io/">API Doc</a> - A simple, free OpenAPI Spec and RAML-driven API documentation solution from Stoplight.io team.</li>
<li><a href="https://restunited.com/">Rest United</a> - A pretty robust PI documentation and SDK solution that supports all major API definition formats.</li>
<li><a href="http://apidox.net/">APIDox</a> - An XML driven API documentation solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I like the robustness of Readme.io and REST United, but dig the simplicity, and machine readability of API Doc. Honestly, I don't see the sense for an API documentation service provider that doesn't support ALL the API definition formats. I don't care what stops along the API life cycle you are serving you should speak API definition by default. I believe that these API service providers are playing an important role in moving the conversation forward, but I think it is also something that gets balanced out by a number of open source offerings out there as well.</p>
<p><strong>Some Of The Open Source OpenAPI Spec Options</strong><br />As with API management, the quantity of open source API documentation solutions isn't moving as fast as I'd like, but I'll take whatever I can. A handful of open source API documentation solutions have emerged, each with their own take on what is needed--these are the ones I"m tracking on who have built on the OpenAPI Spec:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lucybot/lucy-console">Lucy Console</a> - Utilizes<span> </span>OpenAPI Spec <span>to generate both static documentation and an interactive API console via Node.js.</span></li>
<li><a href="http://wiredcraft.github.io/carte/">Carte</a> - A simple, static Jekyll edition that can run on Github pages.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aleung/jekyll-swagger-ui/">Jekyll</a> - A more robust Jekyll edition with a ruby plugin delivering functionality.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/marcgibbons/django-rest-swagger/">Django</a> - An OpenAPI Spec driven version for Django in Python.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am the biggest fan of anything that runs 100% client side, and secondarily a fan of Jekyll + Github solutions, which open up the options for folks doing APIs at larger organizations, where they might be able to easily stand up hosting environments. Ultimately I think there should be a diverse range of one-click solutions for every platform out there.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Open Source API Blueprint Solutions</strong><br />API providers should speak all API definition formats fluently, but API Blueprint is mandatory for modern APIs. Apiary provides the primary API documentation solution for the API Blueprint specification, but it shows the health of the community that there are also some open source options that have emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio">Aglio</a> - <span>An API Blueprint renderer with theme support that outputs static HTML</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kirkstrobeck/blueprint-docify">Docify</a> - <span>Autogenerate API blueprint documentation with CI for Github pages.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/peterhellberg/hiro/">Hiro</a> - <span>Generates HTML from API Blueprints using the Snow Crash command line tool Drafter and Iglo.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm regularly monitoring Github, looking for other open source options for API blueprint, as I'm rooting it on as an engine for API documentation, or more importantly I think API narration--telling the story around what an API does.</p>
<p><strong>Other Open Source Approaches To API Documentation</strong><br />Beyond OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint driven efforts there are a handful of other open source API documentation solutions I am keeping an eye on. Serving a variety of platforms, and languages, there are a couple I'm looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lord/slate">Slate</a> - <span>Beautiful static documentation for your API.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mapbox/docbox">DocBox</a> - <span>REST API documentation generator in Markdown for React.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs">DevDocs</a> - Combines<span> multiple API documentations in a fast, organized, and searchable interface.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mpociot/whiteboard">Whiteboard</a> - <span>This project started as a fork of the popular </span><a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate</a><span> API documentation tool, which uses ruby, after finding the initial setup of Slate quite cumbersome, it was developed as a NodeJS based project.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure why someone would develop any API documentation without using OpenAPI Spec or API Blueprint as its machine readable core, but that is my very biased and studied view. I'm happy to see a diverse number of solutions available, but a little concerned about the lack of consistency between them when it comes to its central definition, how its deployed, as well as the UI and styling.</p>
<p>For me, it's a no-brainer to define your API surface area using OpenAPI Specs, API Blueprint, and Postman. Once you've done this, then you can start thinking about API documentation, code samples, SDKs. mocks, testing, and other resources after that. If you are looking to tackle documentation and have a budget for using an API service provider I recommend taking a look at Apiary or Readme. However, if you are on a budget, have some coding expertise, I recommend looking at Swagger UI + OpenAPI Spec. If you are concerned with look &amp; feel, and Swagger UI doesn't do it for you, I recommend taking a look at Lucy Console.</p>
<p>I wish the landscape for API documentation was more open, plug-n-play, and one-click deployable. I get the concept of paying for API docs as part of a wider API lifecycle solution, but I'm thinking we haven't fully learned from the success of Swagger UI and making sure there are an enough static and dynamic, open source, API documentation solutions available--designed for a variety of platforms. Something that would help both the open source tooling market, as well as provide consistency across the API service providers.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not sure I helped with this roundup of API documentation. I did remove a couple of dead projects <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">from my research</a>, and made sure it was refreshed with what I've been seeing lately, but I'm thinking I need to stew on the state of API documentation solutions a little more and try to understand why things are stagnating. There seems to be movement in the area of proprietary services, as well as some movement with individual providers doing slick things with their API docs, but I'm not seeing the level of open, interactive, and forkability that I saw with Swagger UI--which leaves me thinking there are some deficiencies at play.</p>
<p>Anyways, more to come...</p>

<p>Looking through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/numbers/">the numbers for my API Evangelist research</a>, and tallying up what I've learned along the way, I feel like the next opportunity out there will be about API design and definitions. The release of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/api-stylebook-a-collections-of-resources-for-api-designers/">API Stylebook</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/the-new-api-design-and-deployment-solution-materia-is-pretty-slick/">Materia</a> reflect this opportunity--serving the growing appetite for API design knowledge, and tooling being generated as businesses continue waking up to the need for APIs.</p>
<p>The API management landscape has been well defined by pioneers like 3Scale and Apigee, and validated by their acquisitions by Red Hat and Google this summer. What is picking up momentum now, is the world of API design services, tooling, and specification set into motion by early <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/api-design-tooling-from-api-blueprint/">pioneers of API design&nbsp;like Apiary.io</a>. I am guessing it will play out over the next six years or so, taking longer than we expect, similar to the way API management has played out.</p>
<p>This is when pioneers like Apiary will do well, but there will also be a steadily increasing need for new ways to help API providers craft their API designs, and leverage these definitions for use across almost every aspect of the API life cycle. Companies who have a good handle on their API surface area, and schema at play, will more successfully deploy, manage, test, scale, and orchestrate with this infrastructure. When you have all the moving parts well defined, the chances you will have a better handle on things only increases.</p>
<p>Modern approaches to defining your APIs using API Blueprint and OpenAPI Spec are allowing us to better define the fast growing and evolving (almost too fast) layers of API we are developing and operating. API design services like Apiary and Restlet Studio are helping us better work with API definitions across the API life cycle. The API Stylebook is helping us share API design knowledge, and Materia&nbsp;is pushing the API design and deployment conversation forward. This is just the beginning of a wealth of new services, open source tooling and specifications that will emerge to help define this next API life cycle opportunity.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2016</span>
        <p>As I was firing back up API Evangelist after a break this summer, I took the opportunity to add in a couple of new areas to my research, that I've had sitting on the backburner, <a href="http://apievangelist.com">bringing the number of areas of my API lifecycle research up to 66</a>. Each area operates as an <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist">independent Github repository</a>, possessing the JSON, YAML, and HTML for each area of my API industry monitoring, research, and storytelling.</p>
<p>I approach my work this way&nbsp;because the individual repositories allow&nbsp;me to put my blinders on when it comes to each project, while also scaling my work to include as many possible areas that influence what we like to call the API economy. Not all areas are as mature as API management, which has been being defined for well over a decade, but each area plays its own significant role that in my mind makes it worthy enough to be its own separate project.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_lifecycle_66_tag_cloud.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">You can always access the list of API lifecycle research projects from the home page of API Evangelist</a>, and I try to provide a sort of pagination on the home page of each project, allowing for a leisurely&nbsp;stroll through all 66 areas of research. Each area will at least have some news I've curated, with some of the more mature areas also having companies, tools, and blog posts that I've written over the years.</p>
<p>As I scroll down the list on the home page I can really see the API life cycle maturing and coming into focus. We still have decades of work ahead of us when it comes to properly designing, defining, and making our API discoverable, but I can see it all coming into focus. The problem is that I can also see the deficient areas like terms of service, privacy policies, patents, and copyright lacking in attention and discussion amidst each wave of growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is why I list the areas of concern right alongside the growing opportunities emerging across the API lifecycle.</p>

<p><a href="https://octopart.com/">Octopart is the products company that I regularly use as a reference for how product-focused companies should be doing APIs</a>. Octopart's is an electronic parts company who have a physical, product centered company which is easy for people to understand, that also happens to do APIs well. Octopart doesn't do APIs just because they are cool, they do APIs because it enables the purchasing of their products in other systems.</p>
<p>When you land on the Octopart website you are given a product catalog search, allowing humans to browse their virtual electronic parts warehouse, but as soon as you scroll below the fold you also see a link to their API. The Octopart API is nothing fancy, but it has all the essentials, including <a href="https://octopart.com/api/home">a simple REST API for accessing /brands, /categories, /parts, and /sellers in their&nbsp;virtual electronic parts warehouse</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can tell Octopart API integrations often center around the spreadsheets, an Octoparts showcases with their bill of material (BOM) solution, as well as open source Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet add-ons, but when you <a href="https://octopart.com/api/app-gallery">browse their application gallery</a> you&nbsp;can find other types of integrations with their catalog as well. Their approach to doing APIs seems like it should be a default for any company with a wealth of products to sell in an online environment.</p>
<p>When browsing through the Octoparts API you don't feel like it is something that was launched as a momentary trendy idea, and it is something that gets just as much emphasis as the HTML edition of the product catalog. The API is keeping spreadsheet editions of the catalog in sync, as well as providing sync capabilities for their BOM-driven order workflow. In my opinion, it has all the characteristics a commerce API provider should possess in a modern digital business environment.</p>
<p>While evangelizing APIs I often find I have to help unwind some of the miseducation companies have received about APIs from vendors trying to sell them external solutions. I find that companies with online product catalogs often see an API as something separate from their website, a separate software solution they needed to buy, where in reality the API is just the wholesale version of the product catalog for use in other web properties, mobile applications, spreadsheets, and systems--something that should be present alongside the HTML edition of your product catalog, and not buried in some help or feature section.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/enterprise"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_09_14_at_10.48.11_am.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/enterprise">While reviewing the details of Twilio's new enterprise plan</a>, the one thing that stood out for me was the strong emphasis of the security and legal elements within this level of business integration. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/security-will-increasingly-be-used-as-component-of-tiered-api-planning/">I've talked out security being included as part of plan details </a><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/security-will-increasingly-be-used-as-component-of-tiered-api-planning/">before</a>, and is something I will keep talking about as leading providers continue to bring it front and center as part of API plans and operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/enterprise">Advanced security is the focal point for Twilio's new enterprise plan</a>, providing audit events, and public key client validation, but shortly after showcasing these security features, the next section is all about providing finer grain access management including customizable role-based access control (RBAC), and Single Sing-On (SSO). Demonstrating how important security is overall to the average enterprise customer.</p>
<p>From what I'm seeing across API providers, security is definitely the number one concern, and something that I'm guessing will keep showing up as part of <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API pricing and pricing tiers</a>. Every time I come across this practice in the wild I will record which elements are being included, and try to do a write up showcasing and sharing the approach. Good security practices and features won't be cheap, and as more companies tightene&nbsp;their belts, I am guessing it will keep bubbling up as paid features in the upper tiers of API access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the same note, the second area of growth I'm seeing, which is also present in TWilio's approach to their enterprise plan, is greater control over accounts, billing, and systems usage--something that includes API access, allowing API consumers to automate. Security is top of mind, but efficiently&nbsp;managing usage&nbsp;and dialing in revenue seems to be just as important to businesses looking looking to optimize their integrations with 3rd party API resources.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2016</span>
        <p>I don't spend a lot of time worrying about the website traffic numbers for API Evangelist. Once a week I'll take a look at my Google Analytics or CloudFlare dashboards. I don't write for page views, but I do like to know which of my areas of research is of interest to the public, and generally what people are clicking on.</p>
<p>To help me visit my numbers each week, I started publishing them to <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist">the API Evangelist </a><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist">repo</a>, and sharing via a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/numbers/">new numbers section</a> on the site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to start with seeing the page views across all of my API research projects, giving me an idea of the interest levels in each area:</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/views/2016-08/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_evangelist_views.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Next, I wanted to see the page views that each guide or white paper was getting in the top left corner of my site:</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/feature/2016-08/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_evangelist_document_views.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>After the views, I wanted to get a better understanding of what people were clicking on when it came to&nbsp;these guides &amp; white papers:</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/clicks/2016-08/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_evangelist_guide_clicks.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I also wanted to see which of the sponsor logos I include on the left-hand navigation were being clicked on by my readers:</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/clicks/2016-08/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_evangelist_sponsor_logo_clicks.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Numbers do not drive what I do. I research and write about what grabs my attention, not based upon what drives traffic. However, I do like sharing these basic numbers with my partners, and readers, so that they can get a feel for my reach, and what areas of my research are of interest to the public.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/numbers/">The numbers reports are simple static views of activity across my sites</a>. I will publish the JSON that drives the reports each week, along with the rest of my industry monitoring each week. Once I get enough data published to do some quarterly reports I will work to slice and dice, and see what I can come up with when it comes to visualizations. I'm enjoying playing with D3.js as a visual layer to the JSON data that I'm publishing to Github, across my API industry research--the problem is that I can get lost for hours doing this.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-press-apis.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Press releases continue to be one of the best ways for me to discover companies who have embarked on their API journey. From what I can tell, even with the shrinkage around funding for startups, the number companies offering up APIs is increasing. The big difference in the current wave of companies doing APIs. is these are just regular businesses, using APIs to provide access to resources in web, mobile, device, and partner integrations--a more business usage of APIs, as opposed to startups where the product is an API.</p>
<p>This class of SMB, and SME API provider tend not to be so good at sharing the documentation, code, and other resources for their API operations via their sites, but do see the value in pointing it out when issuing a press release. The reasons vary for why they showcase their APIs, often times it is just in the little "about" paragraph, but sometimes it is the center&nbsp;of a partnership, an acquisition was made possible, or the focus of a new product or service. I wish companies were more into being public about it, but I'll take what I can get--I am guessing many just haven't thought about it, or don't have the resources to do it right.</p>
<p>I'd say press releases are the number one way I discover companies who are doing APIs, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/02/api-patent-search-as-way-to-discover-companies-who-are-doing-apis/">patent filings as a close second or third</a>. After I publish eachpress release to <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, I have a CRON job running that extracts any URLs referenced in the page, spiders them looking for blog feeds, and Twitter or Github accounts, and makes sure they are entered into my monitoring system. If you are an API service provider looking for interesting leads of companies who are doing APIs let me know--I'm looking to formalize the list of companies I extract from press releases each week. I'm thinking about providing this list as a new API Evangelist service, and subsidize my research with new sources of information about APIs, as well as some potential revenue that can help&nbsp;me keep the lights on.</p>

<p>I am trying to get better at showcasing the early stories I find about APIs making their moves into new industries. It helps to have a post to reference when I add an area as an official research project, and begin tracking on companies more closely in the industry. I'm sure I've seen mortgage-related&nbsp;API rhetoric before, but a post in the <a href="http://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/">National Mortgage </a><a href="http://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/">News</a>, provides a pretty clear mark in the sand&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/technology/to-redefine-mortgage-technology-focus-on-connectivity-1086186-1.html">to begin building the case for redefining the mortgage industry using APIs</a>.</p>
<p>The description of the mortgage industry sounds like other industries where many disparate systems and players exist, with a minefield of technical, business, and politic considerations littering the landscape. One reason I cherry picked this article out of the hundreds of posts I tune into each week, is the focus on a new area like mortgages, but also because it focuses on the reality on the ground, and acknowledges there is no single end-to-end solution that will fix what is going--despite many vendor claims.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"No one actually has an end-to-end solution. And with anyone who claims to be an end-to-end solution, their customers are using other services to round out their capabilities."</em></p>
<p>People will always seek out solutions to their integration issues, this is what shadow IT has shown us in recent history. It is clear the mortgage industry is facing what many other industries are facing, and that they are using many disparate systems, many operating in the cloud, and the need move things around more efficiently is becoming critical. There is no silver bullet in this environment, and APIs are increasingly providing the connectivity that is needed to 3rd party systems, as well as opening up and providing access to internal system resources.</p>
<p>This post provides me with an early line in the sand, showing where I started tuning into the mortgage industry closer. I've added a couple of new keyword search phrases to my API monitoring, and if I keep coming up with conversations around how APIs are being applied in this industry, I will add a mortgage API research area to my work, and begin aggregating the players in the space, along with the tools, services, and processes that are being applied on the ground.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-data-retention.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading<a href="http://blog.bronto.com/product/rules-retention-long-bronto-save-data/">&nbsp;the rules of retention, and how long does Bronto save data</a>. Their clarity around offering a <a href="https://helpdocs.bronto.com/bmp/#concept/c_bmp_data_retention_policy.html">data retention policy</a> grabbed my attention, but I also found the ability to pay for longer storage, increasing data retention worth highlighting as well. If longer storage is an option for inclusion in API plans, it might also make sense to charge for shorter periods? IDK--maybe pay for something to go away sooner, with a shorter overall time to live (TTL).</p>
<p>Before I can see the Bronto data retention policy I have to create an account, so it won't happen today. I will make sure and get in there to document&nbsp;the moving parts of their policy as I am&nbsp;curious how much detail they get into. After that, I"d bee keen on finding any other API provider who provides a data retention policy, and help&nbsp;highlight those who do, while also assembling a list of the common moving parts.</p>
<p>Providing details on what data is being collected is something I'd like to see all platforms do by default, but I'd also like to see increased detail on how long data is stored like Bronto is offering, and possibly some day even see it in a machine-readable format. This blog post is meant to serve as a reminder for me to add data retention to my <a href="http://terms-of-service.apievangelist.com/">API terms of service research</a>, as well as an element to consider when crafting <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans</a>, and an&nbsp;<a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a> strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm thinking I will have to push pretty hard to get providers to even share what data they are collecting, let alone offer up the details of how long it is being stored. By highlighting providers like Bronto, maybe I can convince other API providers of the value of this type of transparency--until it is seen as a standard business practice.</p>

<p>I came across a story about&nbsp;<a href="http://insidebigdata.com/2016/09/08/stage-intelligence-adds-support-for-the-gbfs-open-data-standard-into-its-bico-distribution-solution/">Stage Intelligence Adds Support for the GBFS Open Data Standard</a> in my regular monitoring, and wanted to add the specification to my <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition toolbox</a>, and share here on my blog. Staritng with the basics, what is the <a href="https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs">GBFS Open Data Standard</a>?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>General Bikeshare Feed Specification, known as GBFS, is the open data standard for bikeshare. GBFS will make real-time data feeds publicly available online in a uniform format so that map and transportation based apps can easily incorporate this data into their platforms.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md">Documentation is available on Github, including JSON definitions for the bikeshare data model</a>. All it needs now is an <a href="https://openapis.org/specification">OpenAPI Spec generated for it,</a> providing one possible API definition for the GBFS specification (you know you want to build it). Then people could put the definitions to use in generating open source server and client side API tooling for&nbsp;bikeshare programs to deploy.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv">I was impressed to see 49 separate bikeshare programs are supporting the specification</a>. I am always looking to add open data specifications to my <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition research</a>, even if they are just the data model--maybe with a little nudging I can stimulate some investment in at least the API definitions, if not supporting code, and other tools and resources.</p>
<p>I'll take the list of bikeshare&nbsp;services who are currently using the standard and see if any of them have an API, and maybe aggregate the common patterns already in use on the ground. If nothing else, hopefully, I can shine some SEO on the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md">General Bikeshare Feed Specification</a> and prevent at least one developer from reinventing the wheel.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithm-flow.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I was reading <a href="https://medium.com/@katecrawford/artificial-intelligence-is-hard-to-see-a71e74f386db#.rmv7mf65l">artificial intelligence is hard to see</a> by Kate Crawford (<a href="https://twitter.com/katecrawford">@katecrawford</a>), my brain once again begins crunching the different ways APIs can be applied to help us "see" the algorithms evolving around us. API all by themselves do not move things forward much, but when you combine with modern approaches to applying&nbsp;<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a>, introduce the <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com">access and authentication benefits of OAuth</a>, employ <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com">sensible and robust logging practices</a>, and work to develop <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">API driven visualization</a> layers for algorithms--I'm thinking we can really begin to move the conversation forward.</p>
<p><strong>Defining the Algorithmic Surface Area With An API And API Definition</strong><br />Leading API specifications formats like <a href="https://openapis.org/specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a> are allowing API providers and architects to define the request and response model for web APIs. Many APIs are serving up data and content, but for the algorithmic&nbsp;variety, API definitions allow for the description the inputs and outputs for the algorithm--giving us an important way to describe what an algorithm actually does.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Opening Up Access To Algorithmic Resources Using OAuth</strong><br />It is common for OAuth to be used to help manage authentication and access to data, content, and algorithms being made available via APIs. OAuth is used to securely open up access to the proper 3rd party developers, or in this scenario regulators, journalists, and researchers, in a way that defines the scope of what they have access to, whether they can just read, as well as write via an API. OAuth could easily be applied, and evolved to meet the needs of algorithmic transparency and auditing, giving us access to the levers and controls that are driving decisions behind the algorithmic curtain.</p>
<p><strong>Record And Measure Algorithmic Responses Across A Variety Of Uses</strong><br />Logging is used to measure almost every layer of the Internet today, from the server and database backends, all the way up to the web and mobile applications that are driving our front ends. API management providers have applied logging to the API layer, carefully recording how data, content, and algorithms are being accessed, and the system, application, or user who is accessing them. Logging could be used to record how algorithms are performing across a wide variety of auditing and test scenarios, providing a possible baseline for determining what an algorithm does, and how it can be improved upon--in a open, but secure and controlled environment.</p>
<p><strong>Using An API Driven Visualization Layer To Help Us See Algorithms</strong><br />Using API definitions that give us a way to quantify the inputs and outputs of algorithmic resources, along with the logging of a range of requests, and resulting responses, it is then possible to <a href="http://d3js.org/">craft visualizations using open libraries like D3.js</a>, to help us "see" an algorithm. We can see what goes in, what comes out, and how this works across a variety of scenarios. While visualizations will only be as good as the API itself, and the sampling of requests made, they give&nbsp;us the tools we will need to begin seeing and understanding the impact algorithms are making in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs do not equal transparency, and understanding of how algorithms work, but they can help us define and communicate around what they do, and open up access to researchers, regulators, and journalists looking to validate and make sense of what an algorithm does, or does not do. An API for Facebook or Twitter censorship algorithms will not ensure they are fair and balanced, but they can give us the tools to evaluate, and potentially course correct these algorithms out in the open, as they evolve.</p>
<p>I'm seeing a steady build in the number of questions being asked about how algorithms work or don't work, and are impacting our lives. I do not think it is unreasonable to ask owners and operators of these algorithms to open up their solutions for review by trusted 3rd party researchers, regulators, and journalists. We are going to have to get to work opening up this technical infrastructure, as well as developing the API talent that will be needed for reviewing algorithms in this way. I understand that many companies will be resistant to this, but if your algorithm is impacting our lives, we deserve to understand how they work.</p>
<p>I will keep writing on this subject whenever possible, and hopefully, begin to evolve a more coherent approach to employing modern API infrastructure in the service of "seeing algorithms". We tend to think of using APIs for developing web, mobile, and increasingly device-based apps, but increasingly they are also being used to migrate our bits and bytes around the Internet using what is called Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS), and I see no reason why we can begin to evolve API infrastructure specifically for enabling algorithmic transparency.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_09_12_at_11.03.07_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p style="white-space: normal;">I am preparing for my hangout with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?q=%23TC1019">#TC1019</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://kenscourses.com/tc1019fall2016/">Fundamentals of Software Engineering</a> (3rd-semester course) out of the Tecnol&oacute;gico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara. In my own style, I didn't just want to prepare for the discussion, I wanted to publish it on my blog, providing an outline that students to walk away with, but hopefully is something that can also live on as part of my API research.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;">Where do I start? Well, it is a fundamental of software engineering course, so let's look at how the modern API movement can influence and impact the modern software engineer. I may be biased but I think APIs are significantly changing how we develop software, in some pretty important ways--let's explore.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>History of Modern Web APIs</strong><br />I always recommend anyone interested in learning more about APIs to pause for a moment and&nbsp;consider the history of modern web APIs, even if you think you know the API world already. In my opinion, many technologists take for granted some of the most common platforms out there, and haven't' taken the&nbsp;time to learn more about a specific API, and in many cases do not know that an API already exists for common platforms we use every day.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">History of APIs, a Primer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/27/some-milestones-from-the-last-15-years-of-web-api-history/">Some Milestones From The Last 15 Years Of API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The more we understand the short history of web APIs, and why they are working, the more we can borrow from what is already working. Whether you are looking to provide API resources, consume APIs, or ideally do both--spend some time browsing through the history I've organized above.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Focus On HTTP &amp; HTTP/2 In Modern Programming<br /></strong>The technology driving the web is low cost and ubiquitous, making it perfect for usage to deliver not just HTML to websites, but JSON that can be used in other systems, mobile applications, as well as device-based applications. There are some important standards being applied as part of the current API movement that impact software engineering fundamentals, here are a handful of the core elements.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webconcepts.info/">Web Concepts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You don't have to be a master of everything I've listed--I am far from being up to speed on everything here. However, I recommend spending as much time as you can, on a regular basis, absorbing the concepts at play when it comes to Internet technology&nbsp;and consider how existing API providers are putting them to work in their operations.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><span><strong>Next Step In The Evolution Of The Web</strong><br />It is import to see modern APIs as just the next step in how data, content, and algorithmic resources are made available using Internet technology. One concept at play here, which is included above in the HTTP &amp; HTTP/2 resource is what is called content negotiation--I recommend starting here, and I've included a simple tool to help bring it home.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation">Content Negotiation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://website.apievangelist.com/">Simple Demonstration</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><span>API is not a specific vendor solution&nbsp;or even an open source code base--it is an approach to leverage existing web technology to achieve objectives around operating in a web and mobile, and now Internet of Things (IoT) landscape. APIs are not just about delivering JSON, it is about delivering the resources necessary to get the job done, negotiating exactly the format that is needed.</span></p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><span><strong>Wealth Of Resources Available Via Diverse Number of API Providers</strong><br />I track on many companies doing interesting things with APIs, but I always start with learning about the companies who are selling services, and developing tools that API providers are putting to work. You can browse these API life cycle providers as part of my ongoing research:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://theapistack.com/lifecycle/">API Life Cycle Providers</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="white-space: normal;">These companies don't just sell services to API providers, if they are doing it right they also have APIs themselves. When every step along the life of an API, also has an API, the concept of the programmable web becomes more realistic.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Wealth of API Resources Available To Help Manage The API Life Cycle</strong><br />After the API service providers, I keep an eye on companies who are delivering API resources in specific business verticals, which I call my stack APIs. These areas contain many of the common APIs that developers&nbsp;are using, but also some you hopefully may not know already about.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://theapistack.com/stack/">API Stack Providers</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="white-space: normal;">I am adding to this stack as fast as I possibly can. I'm constantly having to prioritize which APIs and add and remove from this list of API resources. Hopefully, as a software engineer you can find some interesting APIs amongst these stacks.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Making Digital Resources Available In Any Programming Language</strong><br />One of the most common mistakes I see from aPI providers are references to, and dogma from their preferred programming language. Modern web APIs employ REST, employing the HTTP &amp; HTTP/2 pipes, and leave the specifics of individual programming languages behind the API, and within client solutions. To help guide yoru learning I recommend taking a look at the API design best practices of API pioneers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/api-stylebook-a-collections-of-resources-for-api-designers/">API Stylebook</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="white-space: normal;">Successful API designers, architects, and operators transcend any single API programming languages, learning to craft an interface that speaks to as wide as possible audience, allowing the software you build to acomplish more.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><span><strong>Focus On API Definitions, Media Types, And Schemas Over Code</strong><br />When focusing on APIs, I strongly recommend favoring API definitions, media types, and schemas over keeping to much code around. Things move fast in the workd of APIs, and the surface of an API will change, and there are many ways API architects are mitigating change, and remaining agile--I recommending speaking fluent:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openapis.org/specification">OpenAPI Spec</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a></li>
<li><a href="http://webconcepts.info/concepts/media-types">Media Types</a></li>
<li><a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a></li>

<p style="white-space: normal;"><span>If you speak in these formats, as an API architect you will be able to focus on delivering more standardized, and flexible API resource, helping you as a software&nbsp;engineer, be agile and potentially more distributed--truly embracing what makes the web work, and is the fuel for the growth in API usage when it comes to developing software.</span></p>
<p style="white-space: normal;"><span>That is where I recommend starting with the world of APIs&nbsp;when it comes to their impact on the fundamentals of software engineering. As a software engineer, HTTP is the core of what you should be studying and including in your toolbox. I've included a wealth of resources here, for use in our classroom discussion, but also hopefully something the students will be able to study as part of their ongoing API education.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/box_incubator_construction.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Building on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/10/investing-in-your-api-community-like-amazon-and-slack/">my earlier coverage of how API providers are investing in their API community like Amazon and Slack</a>, I wanted to document the <a href="https://developer.box.com/incubator">incubator over at Box</a>. Acknowledging that <em>"the enterprise applications of the future will be cloud-based and massively scalable"</em>, and to <em>"support the development of these applications, Box Platform and Amazon Web Services are teaming up to provide you with everything you need to build and scale your business."</em> Providing yet with another (AWS-powered) partnership and API community investment blueprint to put on the shelf.</p>
<p>Examples like this are why I kicked off my <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">API partner research</a> but also reflects why I expanded to keep an eye on <a href="http://investment.apievangelist.com/">investment that is occurring&nbsp;in the space</a>. I don't want API investment to simply mean VC-led investment when there are such a diverse number of other approaches available for how API providers can invest in their platforms, and API communities. <a href="https://developer.box.com/incubator">The Box incubator</a> offers up&nbsp;free and promotional credits, marketing, and training opportunities as part of the program that opens October 1st, 2016--something I'll work to expand on once they go live.</p>
<p>Eventually, I'd like to have an assortment of blueprints to show how API providers are investing in partners, developers, and the potential businesses that are being built on top of platform APIs. I refuse to accept that VC investment of public APIs is the only way forward, and the dominant narrative for what API investment looks like. Hopefully by sharing other examples from successful API providers will help diversify perspectives and narratives around API investment, incubation, and partnering.</p>
