<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/ClearCode-API-Design.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />In the last 20 years we've seen the how the Internet has altered the role of the developer from a desktop software developer to a[web application][1] developer.

It started with web sites, the need for talented graphic designers who could also assemble some HTML to deliver static web sites.

With languages like [VBScript][2], [JavaScript][3], and Coldfusion, websites began evolving into Web applications, requiring developers to master more dynamic Web programming lanugages.

Then smart phones began making the Internet [mobile][4] and pushing developers to start programming for platforms like [IPhone][5] and [Android][6].

The next phase: **_the API developer_**.

Companies like [Clearcode in the UK][7] are beginning to offer [API design and development][8] services in order to meet the increasing demand for well-designed [RESTful][9] Web APIs.

A whole new generation of developers will evolve to support the growing [API economy][10].
