I'm working on a new trends section of API Evangelist.  One area i'm tracking on is the opportunities around 3D printing and APIs.  

I did some fun research, and [laid down some interest thoughts on APIs and 3D printing in 2011][1].  This was part of some research I was doing while working at Mimeo.  

As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts. With this trends research into 3D printing, I am working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact. 

I've identified 10 major components of 3D printing:

  * **[Creators][2]** - 3D designers of virtual print objects
  * **[Scanners][3]** - Scanning hardware for generating 3D models
  * **Modeling Software** - Applications for building 3D models
  * **[File Formats][4]** - File formats for storing 3D models
  * **[Warehousing][5]** - Virtual storage for 3D models
  * **[Marketplaces][6]** - Arenas for showcasing, distributing and ordering 3D products
  * **[Printers][7]** - Companies and hardware that deliver 3D printing
  * ****
