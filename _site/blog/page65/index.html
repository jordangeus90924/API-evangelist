        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-delivery.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" />3D printing is about delivering a virtual object as a physical object, on demand.</p>
<p>This is where our current shipping industry steps in;  UPS, Fedex, USPS, DHS and other shipping providers will make sure we receive our 3D printed objects.</p>
<p>With growing fuel costs, the need for localized delivery will grow, and here is another area where 3D printing will excel.</p>
<p><a title="3D Printers" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printers-printers/">3D printers</a> can be localized and deliver parts and products locally, with only the need to ship raw materials.</p>
<p>As the green revolution continues, 3D printing will become a key player providing localized manufacturing, and potentially printing made of more sustainable raw materials.</p>
<p>Delivery logistics will be a final and decisive link in an evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>

<p>A 3D scanner is a device that analyzes a real-world object to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance. The resulting data can then be used to construct 3D models.</p>
<p>3D scanning is no replacement for a human designer, but can offer a good start creating a 3D representation.</p>
<p>Each 3D scanner has its benefits and limitations, and resulting data will always need much work before it can be used in 3D printing.</p>
<p>3D scanners can offer a lot of benefit in rapid prototyping, and reverse engineering of existing objects.</p>
<p>Just like 3D printers you will find a wide range of 3D scanners, in both functionality and price.</p>
<p>You can also find innovative hobbyists employing tools like the Xbox Kinect for generating 3D scans.</p>
<p>3D Scanners are just the one possible link in an evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supplying chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>

Apigee, Salesforce,  Google, Microsoft, and Infochimps have all deployed REST API Explorers to support developer integration.<p></p>
Facebook has now joined in....well a sort of.  Facebook employee Simon Cross developed a <a title="Facebook Graph API Explorer" href="https://www.simoncross.com/fb/graph/">Facebook Graph API explorer</a> for developers to use when working with the <a title="Facebook Graph API" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Facebook Graph API</a>.<p></p>
The explorer lets developers specify and endpoint, and generate a JSON response, with or without an user login access token.<p></p>
Developers can also use the <a title="Facebook Graph API Explorer" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/16/the-semi-unofficial-facebook-graph-api-explorer/">Facebook Graph API explorer</a> for working FQL, which is the Facebook Query Language.<p></p>
Interesting that a Facebook employee was the one to develop and deploy the explorer, I'm sure its something Facebook will officially integrate into the Facebook developer area soon enough.

        <span class="post-date">16 May 2011</span>
        Canada's <a title="Yellow Pages Group" href="http://www.ypg.com/en/">Yellow Pages Group (YPG)</a> launched a new developer ecosystem to support their local search and location based services (LBS) API, <a title="YellowAPI.com" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/">YellowAPI.com</a>.
<p></p><a title="YellowAPI.com" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/yellowAPI/yellow-api.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>YPG sees their developer ecosystem much differently than many other companies, they view the YellowAPI as a direct extension of its core business model, and the API dramatically extends the reach of its business network.
<p></p>Within many API communities, the API owners can often seem distant from developers, or even view the development community as a problem.
<p></p>As a developer I've experienced the limitations imposed by Twitter and Facebook, and I often feel ignored by Google when using their APIs.
<p></p>I see YellowAPI's strategy as the future of API ecosystem management.
<p></p>Developers can <a title="apply to be part of the YPG developer community" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/member/register">apply to be part of the YellowAPI.com developer community</a>, once approved they gain access to a wealth of resources, including consultation on application design, quality assurance, legal guidance, technical assistance and can receive funding assistance to take their applications live.
<p></p>In addition to these resources, YellowAPI.com provides opportunities for developers to monetize applications in the following ways:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Paid Search</strong> - Paying for volumes of high quality traffic from applications
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Wigets</strong> - Group buying solutions in Canada and "Deal of the Day" widgets
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Advertising</strong> - Platform specific digital ad network provided by Mediative
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Placement</strong> - Premium paid search using mobile placement products
     </li>
</ul>These aren't side opportunities invented just for the API, they represent YPG's core business.
<p></p><a title="Yellow Pages Group" href="http://www.ypg.com/en/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/yellowAPI/yellow-pages-group.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>Since YPG sees the API and its ecosystem as an extension of their core business, they are opening up revenue sharing opportunities for approved developers within its community.
<p></p>If the YellowAPI community is successful in building sustainable business applications, YPG benefits. And because of the forward thinking API ecosystem strategy, when YPG makes money, the API developer community shares in this revenue.
<p></p>How do you monetize your API, and where do your developers fit in?

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/publishing/pearson-publishing-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Publisher and ed-tech company Pearson <a title="announced a new initiative to build an API platform" href="http://www.pearson.com/media-1/announcements/?i=1432">announced a new initiative to build an API platform</a> that give developers access to the publisher's content.<p></p>
Pearson's Plug &amp; Play Platform claims to unlock the company's large content bank which ranges from <a title="Dorling Kindersley (DK) Publishing" href="http://us.dk.com/">Dorling Kindersley (DK) Publishing's</a> illustrated guides to Pearson Education textbooks.<p></p>
The new API platform will allow developers to mash up Pearson content with other content and data to derive entirely to types of web, mobile and tablet products.<p></p>
Pearson's Future Technologies Group Product Manager, <a title="Diane Stepner" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dianas">Diana Stepner</a>, says:
<blockquote><em>We recognise the world has changed and our content needs to be available for innovative uses outside Pearson. Plug &amp; Play opens up opportunities for DK and Pearson to connect with developers who are seeking the rich content we can share.</em></blockquote>
Pearson will be running initial platform tests using DK's Eyewitness Travel Guide material, then moving on to a wider range of subjects from science and natural history to gardening, parenting and early learning.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/publishing/dk-publishing.gif" alt="" width="175" align="right" /><p></p>
While it sounds promising that the world's largest education technology company is opening up its content via an API platform, Pearson doesn't reveal much information about just what this will entail.  What sorts of content will developers have access to?  What will access cost?  How will developers be able to monetize and license their projects that are based on the API?<p></p>
More details will be forthcoming, as Pearson says the Plug &amp; Play Platform is slated for launch in early 2012.

Amazon also provides a <a title="Product Advertising API" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html?ie=UTF8&amp;pf_rd_t=501&amp;ref_=amb_link_84018271_9&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=&amp;pf_rd_s=assoc-right-1&amp;pf_rd_r=&amp;pf_rd_i=assoc_join_menu">Product Advertising API</a> for its more tech savvy affiliates to take advantage of.<p></p>
The Product Advertising API allows affiliate developers to programmatically access Amazon's product catalog so that they can integrate Amazon products directly into their web sites and applications.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/affiliate/amazon-affiliate-images.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><p></p>
In addition to having access to the millions of products in its catalog, the Product Advertising API lets developers leverage Amazon's other features such as customer reviews, similar products, accessories, and listmania lists.<p></p>
The most important aspect of Amazons approach to its affiliate and API offerings is that it automatically formats the URLs returned by the API to include the associate tag, which is the piece that links a referral and purchase to a developers affiliate account.<p></p>
Amazon has been doing this a while, and they obviously have a solid vision of how an API and affiliate program can work together.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/05/05/hazards-of-developers-evangelist-for-an-api/">Hazards of Developers Evangelist for an API.</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/mimeo_connect_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I'm working to make it easier to get up and running using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
One concept that is tough to understand at first, is that all printing starts with a Mimeo document.<p></p>
Then using the API you can either order that document as is, or merge one or many PDF documents with it, generate a dynamic document, then order this new document.<p></p>
As part of our API, we have a Document Listing Service, except it only pulls documents from a central account I have control of.<p></p>
So if you want to pull one of the documents you created, you have to actually pull the Document ID from your My Mimeo account.<p></p>
Sounds easy right?  Well its available in the URL, and in a properties screen for the document.<p></p>
The Document ID is a GUID, for those of you who don't know what a GUID is:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A globally unique identifier or GUID (pronounced /??u??d/ or /??w?d/) is a unique reference number used as an identifier in computer software</em>
<em>So a Document ID looks like this:</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301</em>
Except for some reason the one that shows in My Mimeo is missing the dashes, and doesn't work when you pass through the API.<p></p>
So I ask my API developer, where is the easiest place to get the Document ID?<p></p>
He says, "In the URL or as property of document".<p></p>
I explain it doesn't work without dashes.<p></p>
His response is, Developers will understand, and know to put dashes back in.<p></p>
And that is a hazard of putting developers as the public face of your API.<p></p>
They make a lot of assumptions based upon what they know.<p></p>
API Evangelists and developer advocates should definitely have programming skills, but ideally they should have a balance of proramming, business and marketing skills.

As an API Evangelist I look for other APIs that enhance the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>, and try to figure out how I can leverage this, or at least tell the story.<p></p>
<a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a> and the <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a> API have been two of my favorites so far.

        <span class="post-date">03 May 2011</span>
        In 2006, Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase <a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Biz Dev 2.0</a> in a blog post explaining how several small companies had approached Flickr wanting to provide services that the photo-sharing site didn't feature.<p></p>
She noted that Flickr executives had little time in their schedules to arrange meetings to hash out these partnerships, and instead encouraged companies to feel free to apply for a Commercial API key and build something off the API.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /><p></p>
<a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://caterina.net/archive/000996.html">Biz Dev 2.0</a>, she called it.<p></p>
Fast forward to 2011, APIs are a common part of the technology and business landscape.<p></p>
Some API providers have evolved their API offerings into platforms, and introduced self-service application development environments.<p></p>
From the pubic side, these are seen as service or application marketplaces where users can find add-ons they can use as part of the core web application.<p></p>
Think <a title="Google Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Marketplace</a>, <a title="Facebook App Directory" href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/directory.php">Facebook App Directory</a>, and <a title="Box.net OpenBox" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net OpenBox</a>.<p></p>
From the developers point of view these offer environments where they can easily build applications that integrate with an existing platform and user base.<p></p>
From the business perspective this is <a title="Biz Dev 2.5" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/bizdev-2-5-with-apis-and-self-service-platforms/">Biz Dev 2.5</a>.  Let me give you an example.<p></p>
When I started as API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> a project that was already in the works was commercial print integration with <a title="Scribd.com" href="http://www.scribd.com">Scribd.com</a>.   After serveral months of negotiations Mimeo was able to get a button within Scribd, Print to Mimeo.<p></p>
This happened before I was around, but right before I was hired Scribd updated their application to HTML5 and the Print to Mimeo disappeared.<p></p>
To get back on Scribd's development radar would take another round of outreach, discussion and integration into their development schedule.<p></p>
Next on my list of cloud storage provider integration after Scribd, was Box.net.<p></p>
Box.net has an API and a self-service application development environment called <a title="OpenBox" href="http://www.box.net/developers/actions">OpenBox</a>.  I can add my application and integrate it into Box.net without coordinating with Box.net staff.<p></p>
Once ready I can submit for approval in the OpenBox directory, or keep private and just send invites out to users with a link directly to my OpenBox application.<p></p>
I have someone I can email at Box.net and discuss business development opportunities, but I don't have to.  I can do all the work myself.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/box-net-250x161.jpg" alt="" align="right" /><p></p>
I'm able to build an application that uses the APIs of a leading web application provider, launch that application integrated into the platform, and access the existing user-base.   When users choose to use my application it adds actions or navigation options for them that are linked to my service.<p></p>
<a title="APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/api-listing.php">APIs</a> + <a title="self-service application development environments" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application development environments</a> allow for entirely new business opportunities without the overhead of traditional business development, and with deeper integration into partner platforms.

It recognizes that APIs drive much of the Internet from social media and cloud computing to mobile applications.</p>
<p>But while there is plenty of information to get the developer community up and running with APIs, there is a shortage of information that can serve to educate the <em>business</em> community about the business of APIs.</p>
<p>The necessity of having that sort of outreach is one reason why I use the term API Evangelist instead of Developer Advocate.  While yes, developers do still need advocates, I also feel that there needs to be more evangelism to the business community about APIs and their benefits as well.</p>
<p>So I've partnered with my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a> to develop a series of guides targeting the business community.  These aim to educate businesspeople about the coming <a title="API economy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>.</p>
<p>We have just published our first guide:  <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business-of-apis.php">The Business of APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the table of contents:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">

<li>What is an API?</li>
<li>Who uses APIs?</li>

<li>Building blocks for a successful API</li>
<li>Fostering an API ecosystem</li>
<li>BizDev 2.5</li>
</ol>
<p>An introduction to APIs, the book is aimed at a business audience, not the developer audience.  I believe that there are a lot of business owners, executives and decision makers out there considering APIs -- they've heard that it's "the thing to do" -- who need to be educated about how APIs work.&nbsp;<a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">The Business of APIs</a> is a primer for just that sort of person.</p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-storage/Box-logo-new.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /> As the <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> API Evangelist one of my jobs is to find other platforms, services and technology that goes well with the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="../../">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
One such platform that I've identified as a Mimeo.com partner platform is <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a>.<p></p>
Box.net provides a complete cloud storage platform, with a powerful developer platform and application directory called OpenBox.<p></p>
Mimeo.com provides commercial web to print services, and with Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API you can integrate print file management from Box.net<p></p>
<em>*** Heads up!! This requires basic understanding of box.net and programming with PHP ***</em><p></p>
To do this I sign up for a <a title="Box.net Developer Account" href="http://www.box.net/developers">Box.net developers account</a> and add new OpenBox application:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Name and Description</li>
	<li>Assign a description page for the application that tells about my printer.</li>
</ul>
An important part of this application is a callback URL for when users first add the Box.net application. This has to be a page you host that handles the Box.net oAuth, which gives this print file manager access to a users account.<p></p>
Another important part of each application are whats called <em>service actions</em>.  Service actions which will show up for any user who adds this application to their Box.net account from OpenBox.<p></p>
For my Open Box Application I create a new service action:  <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/Open-Box.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Service Action a title like, <strong><em>Send Print File toMimeo</em></strong></li>
	<li>Choose which document extensions my print file manager supports, PDF for now</li>
	<li>Enter a callback function which Box.net will send user when printing document</li>
	<li>Enter callback parameters such as URL, Title, Extension of Box.net file to be printed.</li>
</ul>
Save your service action, fill out any other relevant parts of your application and hit save as well.<p></p>
This creates your application at Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need put together the code that integrates Box.net with your Mimeo.com account using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
First you need the OAuth piece of code described above, you can <a title="download at Github" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Box.net">download this at Github</a>.  It requires the following files:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>box_config.php</li>
	<li>boxlibphp5.php</li>
	<li>class.curl.php</li>
	<li>index.php</li>
</ul>
This will allow your print file manager to OAuth with Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need the actual code that lets you pull the file being passed by Box.net and print uses Mimeo.com.<p></p>
Here is a sample code file for doing this:<p></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/950096.js?file=Box.net%20-%20Mimeo%20Connect%20Print%20File%20Manager"></script><p></p>

Any company can use  Box.net to manage their print files, and allow commercial printing using Mimeo.com<p></p>

Now you need put together the code that integrates Box.net with your Mimeo.com account using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
First you need the OAuth piece of code described above, you can <a title="download at Github" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Box.net">download this at Github</a>.  It requires the following files:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>box_config.php</li>
	<li>boxlibphp5.php</li>
	<li>class.curl.php</li>
	<li>index.php</li>
</ul>
This will allow your single sheet printer to OAuth with Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need the actual code that lets you pull the file being passed by Box.net and print uses Mimeo.com.<p></p>
Here is a sample code file for doing this:<p></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/950002.js?file=Box-Mimeo-Single-Sheet"></script><p></p>
The above code sample demonstrates how to build a <a title="single sheet flyer or brochure printer using Box.net and Mimeo Connect" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=90">single sheet flyer or brochure printer using Box.net cloud storage and Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
You can build any custom single sheet document with your Mimeo.com account, with specific paper, folds, coating, and much more.  Then merge this document with any single page document from Box..net<p></p>
Any company can build a Box.net Cloud Printer and publish to the OpenBox directory, to allow commercial printing using Mimeo.com<p></p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-storage/Box-logo-new.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />As the <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> API Evangelist one of my jobs is to find other platforms, services and technology that goes well with the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="../../">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
One such platform that I've identified as a Mimeo.com partner platform is <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a>.<p></p>
Box.net provides a complete cloud storage platform, with a powerful developer platform and application directory called OpenBox.<p></p>
Mimeo.com provides commercial printing of many types of bound documents including spiral bound, magazine style, and perfect bound, and with Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API you can integrate printing of these using Box.net<p></p>
<em>*** Heads up!! This requires basic understanding of box.net and programming with PHP ***</em><p></p>
To do this I sign up for a <a title="Box.net Developer Account" href="http://www.box.net/developers">Box.net developers account</a> and add new OpenBox application:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Name and Description</li>
	<li>Assign a description page for the application that tells about the printer.</li>
</ul>
An important part of this application is a callback URL for when users first add the Box.net application. This has to be a page you host that handles the Box.net oAuth, which gives this bound document printer access to a users account.<p></p>
Another important part of each application are whats called <em>service actions</em>.  Service actions which will show up for any user who adds this application to their Box.net account from OpenBox.<p></p>
For my Open Box Application I create a new service action:  <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/Open-Box.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Service Action a title like, <strong><em>Bound Document Printer @ Mimeo</em></strong></li>
	<li>Choose which document extensions my printer supports, PDF for now</li>
	<li>Enter a callback function which Box.net will send user when printing document</li>
	<li>Enter callback parameters such as URL, Title, Extension of Box.net file to be printed.</li>
</ul>
Save your service action, fill out any other relevant parts of your application and hit save as well.<p></p>
This creates your application at Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need put together the code that integrates Box.net with your Mimeo.com account using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
First you need the OAuth piece of code described above, you can <a title="download at Github" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Box.net">download this at Github</a>.  It requires the following files:

</ul>
This will allow your bound document printer to OAuth with Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need the actual code that lets you pull the file being passed by Box.net and print uses Mimeo.com.<p></p>
Here is a sample code file for doing this:<p></p>

The above code sample demonstrates how to build a <a title="bound" href="../../blog/blog_detail.php?ID=90">bound document printer using Box.net cloud storage and Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
With this bound document printer you can public books, magazines, newsletters, reports and many other types of bound documents.<p></p>
You can build any custom bound document with your Mimeo.com account, with specific binding, paper, folds, covers, and much more.  Then merge this document with any multi-page document from Box..net<p></p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/internal-business-users.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />When it comes to APIs, and who uses them, we often think about partners. Sharing data and resources with partners has long been the number one reason for deploying APIs.
<p></p>With the increased popularity of web APIs, many companies are opening up their APIs to the general public and freelance developers as well.
<p></p>In addition to partner and public developers, there has been a recent trend in APIs being adopted internally, within a company. Many companies are finding success in eating their own dog food and building web and mobile applications using the same API infrastructure offered externally.
<p></p>As an API evangelist, there can be a lot of value in encouraging API adoption by internal users.
<p></p>Internal usage of APIs can increase efficiencies by sharing data and resources between departments and separate company locations.
<p></p>However you can also increase overall company support and resources available to API efforts through internal adoption.
<p></p>With increased internal usage, decision makers within a company see the value first hand and are more willing to approve budgets needed to develop more APIs, tools and resources that can be used by partners, public developers, as well as within the company.
<p></p>Lack of budget and business resources are the number one reason API efforts fail or find limited success.
<p></p>Remember to evangelize internally within your company, not just to partners and the public.

Even with <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/">RESTful</a> approaches to delivering APIs they can be quite different.
<p></p>As APIs grow and as we want to be able to connect apps to multiple inputs and endpoints, there's an increasing need to make the process easier, more streamlined, and interoperable.
<p></p>One example of this is within the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/">cloud computing</a> industry. When using AmazonEC2 and Rackspace, developers have to write separate code to integrate with each platform.
<p></p>Another example is with social networks, when pulling social streams from <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/twitter/">Twitter</a>, developers have to develop separate code for each provider as well.
<p></p>An new approach to solving differences between APIs that deliver similar functionality, but use different approaches, is to build a unified API.
<p></p>Unified APIs bring together multiple APIs into a single interface. Two examples of this are:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DeltaCloud API" href="http://incubator.apache.org/deltacloud/">DeltaCloud API</a> - With the Deltacloud API you can start an instance on an internal cloud, then with the same code start another on <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> or Rackspace.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Windsoc" href="http://www.windsoc.co/">Windsoc API</a></strong> - Using Windsoc API developers can access Facebook, Twitter, GoogleBuzz and other social APIs using a single interface.
     </li>
</ul>Unified APIs do a lot of the work for developers, by providing a single interface to build against, as well as compensating for changes between APIs, and different versions of an API.<a title="Windsoc" href="http://www.windsoc.co/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/windsoc.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a>
<p></p>Cloud computing APIs and social network APIs have been around for a few years now, it makes sense that there is a need for a unified interface.
<p></p>What other industries or types of APIs are in need of an unified API?

<p></p>API contestsand hackathons.
<p></p>API providers like <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> and <a title="Netflix" href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> are using them to attract new users, and to generate buzz and innovation around their API.
<p></p>When I'm out at events, educating business users about APIs, I often get asked about the viability of contests and hackathons to generate free code and applications for an API community.
<p></p>I think there is a common misconception amongst the business community that API owners can get away with not paying developers to build code and applications, by just framing what they want in the form of a contest or hackathon, and developers will all rally, and work for free.
<p></p>While you can potentially develop usable code and applications in this environment, its not always the case, and definitely should not be the focus of an event.
<p></p>API contests and hackathons are purely a marketing vehicle for generating attention around an API. Sure there are some secondary effects, like innovative code, apps, ideas, and developer talent, but these aren't a given.
<p></p>Focus on a healthy, innovative reason for your API contest or hackathon. Apply the resources to make the sure event gets heard about across all relevant developer circles, and when the event happens, make sure it is all about the developers.
<p></p>Envision your API contest or hackathon as the marketing vehicle it is, and the rest take care of itself.

        <p>I'm doing a lot of researching and thinking about the future of commercial printing, 3D printing, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was brainstorming on <a title="3D printing and manufacturing with Google" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/04/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-with-google/">3D printing and manufacturing with Google</a>.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-sketchup/Google-SketchUp.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>

<p>Google SketchUp allows anyone to build 3D models to the <a title="STL file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">STL file format</a>, a standard for the 3D print industry.</p>
<p>3D printers like <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> lets you upload your STL files, print and order them in their physical form..</p>
<p>Google SketchUp provides a free and professional version of the modeling software.</p>
<p>They also provide a <a title="3D Warehouse" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/product/3dwh.html">3D Warehouse</a> where you can find a collection of 3D models that are free to use.</p>
<p>There is a <a title="community of resources" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/community/">community of resources</a> as well as <a title="training" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/training/">training</a> and <a title="education" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/industries/education.html">education</a> materials to learn about the platform.</p>
<p>Everything is there to build models to be used in 3D printing and manufacturing.  The only missing link right now is integration with Google Cloud Print.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/shapeways_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Maybe Google will support STL file printing in the <a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-cloud-print-services-interface/">Google Cloud Print  (GCP) Services Interface</a> soon.</p>
<p>3D printers like Shapeways could register their 3-D printers with GCP like I'm doing with <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a> for commercial printing.</p>

To support 3D printing file formats I'm sure they will have to introduce a new app to the Google Apps suite or evolve Google Drawings.<p></p>
Google Drawings only supports importing of .wmf files and exporting of .jpg, .pdf, .png, and .svg formats.<p></p>
I'm working on some modifications to the Google Cloud Print capabilities definition via .ppd or .xps for commericial cloud printing, I think we could also bend this definition to support 3D printing and mnufacturing.<p></p>
We have a ways to go, but I see the future of cloud 3D printing and manufacturing unfold in front of us with 3-D printing and cloud printing.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/scraping.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" />I'm organizing my code libraries tonight. These are PHP, JavaScript, Regular Expressions, SQL, and other tools I use for different purposes.
<p></p>One such purpose is harvesting and scraping. I have an extensive library of PHP code I've used in the last 5 years to pull web pages, parse tables, submit forms, and what not.
<p></p>As I'm organizing these snippets of code into <a title="Snippely" href="http://code.google.com/p/snippely/">Snippely</a>, I'm thinking about all the effort I've put into getting content.
<p></p>I've harvested government data, craigslist posting, real estate listings, and a wide variety of news, products, and geo-data.
<p></p>If I need some data, I much prefer using an API, but if I have a need and there is data available on a web page...I just harvest it.
<p></p>If a content provider does not have an open API, I view them much differently than if they do. I see them as a source of content, there is no real relationship. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/harvesting.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> When a content provider has an open API, I will use their API. If the API offers enough value, I will pay to use it, and establish a relationship with the content provider.
<p></p>Content providers will have far more control over their content by providing an open API, even if the content is also available on their site. This control will allow owners to track usage and even monetize it.
<p></p>I would much prefer to pull data and other content from an API rather than scrape or harvest it.

The Phaxio API is in private beta, but existing users can send off a Phaxio invitation code that allows other developers to discover and sign up for the faxing service.<p></p>
Application email invites are clearly not something new.  And with the growth of social media, it may be that sharing via Twitter or Facebook has become more associated with the steps necessary to make things "go viral."  Nevertheless, having the ability to send out invitations via email can still provide essential word-of-mouth marketing for your API and shouldn't be overlooked.

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-popularity.png" alt="" width="375" align="right" />How do you measure the popularity of your API, or someone else's API?<p></p>
If its your API, hopefully you have metrics established for every part of your API and supporting API area.<p></p>
But how can we measure the API space as a whole?  I get asked a lot about, what are the top APIs out there.<p></p>
<a title="ProgrammableWeb Measures Popularity" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?sort=mashups">ProgrammableWeb measures popularity</a> by the number of mashups that are built on an API.  Using this metric, Google Maps, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube rise to the top.<p></p>
Not all APIs are suited for mashups, and we definitely need more ideas of how to measure popularity and usage of Open APIs.<p></p>
I would start by using <a title="Alexa" href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a>, <a title="Compete" href="http://www.compete.com/">Compete</a>, and <a title="Quantcast" href="http://www.quantcast.com/">Quantcast</a> who provide SEO related analytics and ranking for web sites.<p></p>
Next I would look at the number of partners an API has showcased in their developers area or web site.<p></p>
After partners I would look for the number of developers showcased as part of an API ecosystem.  Not all APIs provide tools for developers to have a public profile, but if they do, this can be an important measurement.<p></p>
After the number of partner and public users, I would take a close look at how many applications are developed on a platform.  Both internally and community developed applications.  These represent completed projects where developers have successfully integrated with an API.<p></p>
Then I think overall API community activity and resources would be a good thing to measure.  How many code samples, language kits, FAQ, forum posts, and other resources are provided. This reflects the amount of resources a company and community has put into an API.<p></p>
There is no perfect way to measure the success and popularity of an API on the open Internet, but these are a few ideas for variables the industry might consider when developing an algorithm for tracking the popularity of APIs in this fast growing space.

        <span class="post-date">20 Apr 2011</span>
        Presentation assets are the user interface or visual front-end to an application.  Logic assets are the algorithms, analytics or services which take data inputs, do some processing and provide a response.  Data is the raw content but can also include simple transformations of the content.  Different services can be linked together to provide a complete application system.<p></p>
It is important to break out of the mind-set that your company has to deliver all three assets.  It is true that traditionally the only way to deliver applications was for a company to own responsibility of all three.  However the World Wide Web and APIs liberate companies from the need to deliver all three.  Now more and more companies benefit if they focus on their unique value-add.  Once you identify your core assets, it becomes clear which complementary assets will be provided by your partners.  Thus to reach a strategy you are satisfied with, follow the simple steps:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>Identify your own core asset(s)</li>
	<li>Choose the complementary asset which will deliver most value</li>
	<li>Define the strategy to capture the value most effectively</li>
</ol>
For example for <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> the core asset that they distribute via their API is data, in the form of the immense stream of 140 character tweets.  They made a decision early in the company history to focus all their resources on this core asset - notwithstanding recent strategy changes where they are trying to re-assert control of more of the Presentation and Logic assets.  This means that with the original strategy the complementary assets were Presentation and Logic assets.  In these two areas the company would build partnerships to deliver enhanced solutions to meet the diverse needs of Twitter users - a far greater variety that Twitter alone could ever deliver.<p></p>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-38112" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/?attachment_id=38112"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38112" src="http://www.3scale.net/wp-content/uploads/Biz-Model-Complementary-and-Core-Assets.png" alt="API Business Model: Core and Complementary Assets" width="542" height="275" /></a><p></p>
Let us say that of the two complementary assets, Twitter decided to focus on Presentation, because they realised that it is critical to get mobile client coverage.  Then the strategy definition was to power mobile apps.  The company defined the specific APIs and a business model that would attract developers to create new mobile front-ends for Twitter.  An example of a Twitter partner that leverages the API to deliver a mobile client and fulfil this strategy is <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a>:<p></p>

<em>Note that the highlighted boxes are not the only assets that the company provides, but rather they indicate the most important, or core asset.  The remaining two are candidates for complementary partners, even if there may be some level of co-opetition.</em>
<h3>Business Model options with an API</h3>
Once the strategy is agreed, you will find that the use of an API opens up new options in the choice of business model.  For each potential business strategy you need to evaluate which is an appropriate business model to execute. The options related to APIs include:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Product / Service</strong>: if the main way for the company to deliver value is through its API e.g. Twilio from the table above.</li>
	<li><strong>Distribution</strong>: to extend the company's reach, the API allows the company's content or services to be accessed from other applications or devices (such as smartphones).  This could be in the form of a channel business model, but it may simply be to broaden access via partnerships.  There are several options for monetizing the channel option including product resale, whitelabel licensing, or affiliate commissions.   An example of this is Wolfram Alpha's partnership agreement with Microsoft's Bing search engine.</li>
	<li><strong>Promotion</strong>: if an important role is to raise awareness for the company's products or brand, and generate additional traffic.  This is the business model used by Netflix and The Guardian for movies and news content respectively.</li>
	<li><strong>Content Acquisition</strong>: to make it easy to gather content which will then form a strong base for the value of a company.  An example of this when job posting websites cross-post job openings to Indeed via their APIs.</li>
</ul>
These business model options are not exclusive.  In fact the presence of an API will usually mean that several of these are achieved.  A good way to think about it is to choose one focus area for the business model, and additionally one or two supporting areas.  We will elaborate on some detailed examples later.  A related choice to the business model is to identify how directly the value of the API will be monetized.  This is typically not a black-and-white decision, but rather there is a spectrum of possibilities.  The following table gives examples at several points along the spectrum from very direct pricing based on API calls, to completely indirect value capture.

We have now seen a framework to evaluate the best business model options for your API.  It began with an assessment of your core asset to determine what strategy will guide your API.  Then you explore four different directions for business models to find which is the best fit for your strategy.  In parallel with the business model evaluation, you can optionally define some high-level pricing approaches.  In the next post in the series we will look at each of the four business model options in more detail, before applying this framework to a number of existing companies to show how these business models look in the real world.

        <span class="post-date">18 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/journalism/nieman-journalism-labs-icon.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="right" />There is an excellent analysis of Open API usage in news organizations at the Nieman Journalism Lab, called <a title="Wisdom of the crowd: Key lessons from news organizations using open APIs to ramp up R&amp;D" href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/04/wisdom-of-the-developer-crowd-key-lessons-from-news-organizations-using-open-apis-to-ramp-up-rd/">Wisdom of the (developer) crowd: Key lessons from news organizations using open APIs to ramp up R&amp;D</a>.<p></p>
This analysis is a summary of a paper by<a title="Seth Lewis" href="http://sethlewis.org/">Seth Lewis</a>, professor at University of Minnesota, and <a title="Tanja Altamurto" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tanja-aitamurto">Tanja Aitamurto</a>, a Finish PH.D student at Stanford, that was presented at the International Symposium on Online Journalism earlier this month.<p></p>
After studying the approaches of the four biggest players with open APIs are <a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">NPR</a>, <a title="The New York Times" href="http://developer.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>, <a title="The Guardian" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform">The Guardian</a>, and <a title="USA Today" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a>, Lewis and Aitamurto came away with five key lessons:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Open APIs can serve as external R&amp;D labs</li>
	<li>Open APIs present a revenue opportunity</li>
	<li>Open APIs help weave news organizations into the fabric of the web</li>
	<li>Open APIs create an ecosystem effect</li>
	<li>Open APIs can be a challenge, especially within the news organization</li>
</ul>
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/journalism/the_guardian.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /> Lewis and Aitamurto conclude that Open APIs are not the solution to all of the news industries problems, but they are significant step toward a form of online publishing that is in sync with the web, and also allow publishers to take advantage of thewisdomof the (developer) crowd for research &amp; development.<p></p>
These new approaches offer a first glimpse of what <a title="Open Innovation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation">open innovation</a> using APIs could bring to the news business when it comes to revenue and partnerships.<p></p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hackeducation.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I've been watching my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>, evolve her online presence as a freelance writer working for <a title="ReadWriteWeb" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/author/audrey-watters.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>, <a title="O'Reilly" href="http://radar.oreilly.com/audreyw/">O'Reilly</a>, <a title="NPR Mindshift" href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/">NPR Mindshift</a>, and other high profile blogs.
<p></p><a title="@AudreyWatters" href="http://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters">@AudreyWatters</a> has large Twitter following, however she keeps her Facebook very private.
<p></p>A growing portion of her user base are sending her Facebook friend requests, because she keeps her profile private, she doesn't accept. So naturally she created a <a title="Facebook page" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Audrey-Watters/100999103321790">Facebook page</a>.
<p></p>I watched her install the Facebook <a title="like social-plugin" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/">like social plug-in</a> to the single.php file, which will display it on each blog post, and added an <a title="activity feed social plug-in" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/activity/">activity feed social plug-in</a> to the sidebar of her blog. She runs her blog on Wordpress, and was able to do this easily.
<p></p>Facebook social plug-ins make your site social, but by using the <a title="Open Graph Protocol" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/">Open Graph Protocol</a> she was able to offer a deeper integration with Facebook. By having her blog integrated with the Open Graph API she is able to push content to her "fans" Facebook wall, increasing the reach of her blog to their social streams.
<p></p>Audrey got her inspiration to do this from the <a title="Journalist on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/journalist">Journalist on Facebook</a> fan page, a page created by Facebook to educate journalists about best practices using Facebook to disseminate information.
<p></p>I see Facebook doing two things to encourage this kind of API usage:<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook_logo-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>API User Targetin</strong>g - Going beyond the current definition of partner and (internal and external)l developer focus, and identifying other target groups of users beyond the developer community, and providing a Facebook page and other information for a target group.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>API Embed Strategy</strong> - Facebook has a great API embed strategy, providing a suite of embeddable tools that any user can use to make their sites social -- extending their sites reach to Facebook, while also expanding Facebook's presence on to other sites.
     </li>
</ul>I'm seeing shifts in many APIs lately to a more embeddable approach, such as <a title="Twitter Web Intents" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/simpler-twitter-api-integration-with-web-intents/">Twitter's Web Intents</a>, and <a title="LinkedIn Evolution of its Developer Platform" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/13/linkedin-api-platform-and-the-evolution-of-the-api/">LinkedIn's evolution of its developer platform</a>.
<p></p>In addition to an embed strategy, Facebook is creating pages and other resources targeting specific user groups. This is a potentially powerful combination for attracting new users and extending the reach of Facebook across the web.

        <span class="post-date">15 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Freshbooks_610x564.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a title="Sample Code Libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">Sample code libraries</a> are an essential part of an API ecosystem. They give developers a head start when integrating their applications with an API.<p></p>
I've explored the concept of <a title="letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/01/use-your-community-to-build-api-code-libraries/">letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries</a>. Doing this may create a more engaged community and give developers a sense of ownership and attachment to the API.<p></p>
As I <a title="reviewed the Freshbooks API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/13/freshbooks-api-review/">reviewed the Freshbooks API</a>, I noticed they have a very community-driven API code samples area.<p></p>
The Freshbooks API provides client libraries in Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl, JavaScript, ActionScript, Java, .NET, and C++, as well as plug-ins for popular frameworks like Zend, Drupal and Symphony.<p></p>
Many of the <a title="client libraries and plug-ins" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/sample-code/">client libraries and plug-ins</a> are built by the Freshbooks API community, such as:
<blockquote><img style="padding-bottom: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developers/ryan-szrama.jpg" alt="" width="50" align="right" /><em>Drupal plugin by <a title="Ryan Szrama" href="http://drupal.org/user/49344">Ryan Szrama</a>.  Szrama is an active member of the Drupal community.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><img style="padding-bottom: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developers/matt-culbreth.jpg" alt="" width="50" align="right" /><em>Python client libraries by <a title="Matt Culbreth" href="http://mattculbreth.com/index.html">Matt Culbreth</a>, a software developer in Marietta, Georgia USA.</em></blockquote>
By encouraging your API developers to build code samples, plug-ins, and code libraries, you can get necessary tools built for an API.  But just as importantly, you're building community and providing a much needed spotlight for your developers.  This in turn helps them be successful in their careers.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/washington-crossing-the-delaware-cropped.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />We are witnessing some <a title="tremendous growth in the number of new web APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">tremendous growth in the number of new Web APIs</a>.  <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, for example, added 1000 new APIs to its directory over the last year.<p></p>
Many of these APIs are brand new and have very few code samples or libraries to go with them.<p></p>
These new APIs represent a huge opportunity for developers to stake a claim within these communities -- to build their portfolios and their resumes.<p></p>
Recently Google released their <a title="Google Cloud Print Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a>.   The only thing available was some documentation describing the handful of API endpoints for managing printers and print jobs.<p></p>
I went to work trying to understand Google's vision of cloud printing, and I wrote a simple PHP class for working with Google Cloud Print.   I published on <a title="Github - Google Cloud Print" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Google-Cloud-Print-Proxy">Github</a> and <a title="Google Code - Google Cloud Print" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-print-proxy/">Google Code</a> and blogged about my work.<p></p>
By creating a PHP class for Google Cloud Print I established myself as an early mover in the space, and I attracted attention to my work. Even Google noticed and someone from Google contacted me.<p></p>
Since Google Cloud Print was so new, and they are actively encouraging community participation, there was an opportunity for me establish a presence.<p></p>
Many API providers are taking a similiar <a title="community-driven approach to building their API code samples and libraries" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/15/community-driven-api-code-samples-and-libraries/">community-driven approach to building their API code samples and libraries</a>.  Within these communities, there are windows of opportunities for developers to claim their territory, get a little of the spotlight, while building their portfolios and resumes along the way.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/linkedin/LinkedIn-Developer-Network.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a title="LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> refreshed its <a title="LinkedIn Developer Platform" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/">developer platform</a> recently, updating its <a title="RESTful API" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/community/apis">RESTful API</a> and <a title="JavaScript API" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/community/jsapi">JavaScript API</a>.<p></p>
A noticeable change, was its continued evolution towards a more plug and play API environment.<p></p>
When you visit the <a title="LinkedIn Developer Area" href="http://developer.linkedin.com/index.jspa">LinkedIn developers area</a>, the first option on the menu is plug-ins, and the main page is totally dominated by embeddable profile tools.<p></p>
The RESTful API and Javascript API are only accessible off a single menu option, the community has a clear focus on courting non-developer LinkedIn users.<p></p>
With the rise in popularity of RESTful APIs and JavaScript, we are seeing a explosion in <a title="Widget, Embeds, Plug-In" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/06/allow-api-users-to-embed-content-with-oembed/">widgets, embeds, plug-ins</a> and other copy / paste code that any tech savvy user can deploy.<p></p>
Attracting the developer community to new APIs can be tough.  Programmers tend to be drawn to exciting, new, and shiny APIs that provide challenges and new opportunities.   The business and professional focus of LinkedIn doesn't quite put the "shiny" in API.<p></p>
LinkedIn shows an understanding of its user base, and the best way to provide API tools that these tech savvy users can copy and paste on their web site, social networks, and other applications.

Being the forward thinkers they are, they say:
<blockquote><em>If there's an app there's an API, so we've made ours available to everyone...</em></blockquote>
The <a title="GitHub Jobs API" href="http://jobs.github.com/api">GitHub Jobs API</a> allows you to search, view, and create jobs with JSON over HTTP.<p></p>
The APIalso provides support for JSONP, by appending ?callback=myFunction to any API request, it will wrap the response in a function call to myFunction. This is useful when making requests to the GitHub Jobs API using JavaScript.<p></p>
Nothing to revolutionary, or noteworthy about the API, except Github is just way cool, and I love their perspective that, if there is an app there is an API.

        <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2011</span>
        <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Freshbooks_610x564.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I am slowly working my way through <a title="hundreds of APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">hundreds of APIs</a> and doing business reviews of their approach to delivering their APIs.<p></p>
At API Evangelist I'm focused on the business of APIs, with a minor focus on the technology behind those APIs.  So when I publish a business review of an API, I will add it to my API database, then move on.<p></p>
That is, unless I identify a story -- an innovative approach, monetization strategy, or anything that I feel needs to be talked about in more detail.<p></p>
While reviewing the <a title="Freshbooks API" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks API</a> I found three notable building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong><a title="Application Billing" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/billing/">Application Billing</a></strong> - A built in billing and payment framework for Freshbook applications and beyond</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Webhooks" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/webhooks/">Webhooks</a></strong> - Framework for enabling application callbacks, URLs where the Freshbook system can send notifications to third party applications</li>
	<li><a title="Freshbooks Add-On Store" href="http://community.freshbooks.com/addons/"><strong>FreshBooks Add-on Stor</strong>e</a> - Application store and development platform for developers to build custom apps, showcase,  and sell to Freshbook customers.</li>
</ul>
<a title="Self-Service Application Frameworks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">Self-Service Application Frameworks</a> like the Freshbooks Add-On Store are growing more common.  I've talked about similar systems from <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> and <a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a>.  The Freshbooks Add-On store is not 100% self-service, but it is close.
<a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/freshbooks-leaf.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
Webhooks are nothing new, but Freshbook offers a standardized approach to deploying web-hooks that makes them easy for developer to use.<p></p>
A built in payment system is definitely a notable <a title="API Building Block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">API building block</a>.  Providing developers with a baked-in payment system for handling application monetization is very innovative.<p></p>
Where do these three building blocks fit into the big picture?   I try to build profiles for common API building blocks, I don't have profiles for self-service application frameworks, webhooks, and payment systems, but as I evaluate more I will define these as more innovative building blocks for API owners to use.<p></p>
I will definitely be keeping an eye on the <a title="Freshbook" href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">Freshbook</a> approach to their API.

        <img src="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/buddies.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />There are many  approaches to building an API ecosystem.  Some approach it more like building an API community, and others as growing an API ecosystem.<p></p>
<a title="Howard Liptzin" href="http://twitter.com/howardliptzin#">Howard Liptzin</a>, at Avatar Industries prefers a more <a title="organic approach to growing an API community" href="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/2011/02/28/developer-communities/">organic approach growing an API community</a>.  In his own words:
<blockquote><em>What you'll want to do is to create the conditions for a community to form, thrive, produce and grow.</em></blockquote>
Liptzin emphasises gardening over engineering, not managing your community, more facilitate. Before you even start, Liptzin offers a little advice:
<blockquote><em>Make sure your API actually solves a problem that merits solving!</em></blockquote>
Then Liptzin identifies five areas to address when growing your API ecosystem:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Creation</li>
	<li>Activation</li>
	<li>Retention</li>
	<li>Productivity</li>
	<li>Growth</li>
</ul>
It is great to see other API owners and evangelists share their philosophies and approach to growing their community.<p></p>

<p></p>The other day I wrote about <a title="Quantifying your social media impact, using Google Docs and social media" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/apis-are-not-just-for-developers/">quantifying your social media impact,</a> using Google Docs and social media APIs, by<a title="Tom Critchlow" href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/30546">Tom Critchlow</a>.

<p></p><a title="Richard Orelup" href="http://twitter.com/#!/ripsup">Richard Orelup</a> came up with this little hack in response to this tweet:

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/04/10/rdio-shares-revenue-with-api-developers/">Rdio Shares Revenue with API Developers</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2011</span>
        <a title="Rdio" href="http://www.rdio.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/rdio-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a title="Rdio" href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> is a music streaming service, where users can access music via the web or mobile phone for a monthly fee.<p></p>
Using <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, Rdio provides a RESTful API where you can do just about anything you can trough the web interface.<p></p>
Rdio provides a pretty significant incentive for their developers, in the form of revenue sharing.<p></p>
Developers of the <a title="Rdio API" href="http://developer.rdio.com/">Rdio API</a> can earn recurring revenue each month for every new subscriber recruited through their application.<p></p>
Also developers can earn revenue each time someone purchases and downloads an MP3 file from the service.<p></p>
Through the <a title="Rdio Affiliate Program" href="https://cli.linksynergy.com/cli/publisher/registration/registration.php?mid=36727">Rdio Affiliate Program</a> developers can earn from between 2% and 7% for purchases made within a 30-day cookie window.<p></p>
Having an API affiliate program seems like a logical way to incentivize developers to build applications.<p></p>
An API owner should have an established monetization strategy for their API, and it should outline how revenue will be generated.<p></p>
Having a way to track and attribute sales to your API developers makes a lot of sense, and sharing revenue with developers will ensure they will keep building new ways to attract users to a service via the API.
