        <span class="post-date">20 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-security-unknown.png" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I am trying to wrap my head around the next steps in the evolution of <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">API security</a>. I am trying to help separate some of the layers of what we collectively call API security, into some specific building blocks I can reference in my storytelling. I’m ramping up my API security research as I onboard a new API service provider partner, and will have more resources to invest in the API security discussion.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the easy “Known Knowns”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Encryption - Using encryption across all aspects of API operations from portal to base URL.</li>
  <li>API Keys - Making sure everyone who is accessing an API is keying up and passing along with each request.</li>
  <li>OAuth - Getting more granular with access by applying OAuth when there is access to 3rd party data and content.</li>
  <li>Rate Limiting - Limiting how much of a resource any single API consumer can access using rate limiting.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the first things that come to mind when the topic of API security is brought up. I’d say most conversation begin with encryption, but as someone progresses on their API journey they begin to understand how they can key things up, using OAuth, rate limiting, and other aspects of API management to secure their API operations.</p>

<p>Next, I want to think about some the “Known Unknowns”, things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Freeloaders - People with multiple accounts, and generally aren’t healthy consumers.</li>
  <li>Errors - Errors, misconfigured, and malformed requests, responses, and anything that generally gums up the gears of operations.</li>
  <li>Vulnerabilities - Making sure all known software and hardware vulnerabilities are patched and communicated as part of operations.</li>
  <li>Attacks - Defending against the known attacks, staying in tune with OWASP and other groups who are actively identifying, studying, and sharing attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the things we might not totally understand or have implemented, but they are known(ish). With the right amount of resources and expertise, any API team should be able to mitigate against these areas of security. There is always a lot of work to turn the unknowns into knowns in this area, but they are doable.</p>

<p>Now I want to think a little about the “Unknown Unknowns”, likes like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DNS - What is happening at the DNS level as it pertains to my API security?</li>
  <li>Relationship - Relationship between requests, even if they are using different keys, IP addresses, and other elements–where is the overlap?</li>
  <li>Threats - What information is available to me regarding new and emerging threats that I’m only beginning to see, or maybe my partners and others in same space are seeing?</li>
  <li>Sharing - Are there opportunities to share information and see a bigger picture when it comes to vulnerabilities and threats?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a handful of my initial thoughts on what the unknown unknowns might be. Things that are currently off the radar of my known API security practices. API management seems to dominate and in some cases terminate the API security conversation, but I have the feeling there are numerous other considerations out there that we are not seeing. I’m just looking to begin defining this new bucket of security considerations so I can keep adding items to it as I’m doing my research.</p>

<p>From your perspective, what are the biggest threats out there for API security that many API providers are completely unaware of? I’m looking to keep expanding on this frontline of API security and turn up the heat beneath <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">my research</a> while I have the resources to do so. I feel like the API security conversation has kind of stagnated after the last wave of API management growth, leaving many providers thinking they have everything covered.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/gsa/gsa-api-strategy-diagram.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="https://tech.gsa.gov/assets/downloads/GSAAPIStrategy.pdf">The General Services Administration(GSA) has an API strategy</a>, which describes “GSA’s future direction for agency­wide API management including design, development, architecture, operations, and support, and security.” Ok, let’s pause there. I want to point out that this isn’t just an API design guide. That is a portion of it, but it also touches on some of the most obvious (deployment), and the most critical aspects (security) of API operation–important stuff.</p>

<p>The objectives for the GSA crafting an API strategy are:</p>

<p>­* Harness API management to maximize customer value and technical efficiencies.
­* Adopt industry best practices with API design, development, and management.
­* Consider opportunities for revenue through API offerings.</p>

<p>I always enjoy seeing federal agencies talk about efficiencies and best practices, but it gives me hope that all of this might actually work when I see federal agencies actually “considering opportunities for revenue through API offerings”. Especially at the GSA, who provides technical guidance to the other 400+ federal agencies, as well as at the state and municipal level. I am not excited about our government charging money for digital resources, I am excited about our government exploring how it will generate revenue to sustain itself in the future.</p>

<p>I know there are a lot of open data advocates who can’t wrap their mind around this, but this is how the government will generate needed tax revenue to operate in the future–using APIs. Our government currently generates a portion of its revenue from the sale of physical resources like timber, mining, and agriculture, why should things be different when it comes to taxing and regulating digital resources being made available via the web, mobile, and device applications. While there is still lots to figure out on this front, I am glad to see the GSA putting some thought into the role APIs will play in the future of funding the government services we all depend on each day.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-question-shared.png" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>

<p>I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what technology does. I read press releases, pitch emails, documentation, and marketing materials trying to get an idea of what is possible. While many of the APIs I come across are intuitive, and just make sense there is still a significant portion of them that leave me scratching my head regarding what it even does.</p>

<p>As developers, it can be easy to think about the SDKs you will need to support API integration with your API, but I think you are making a lot of assumptions about your consumers when you focus your initial energy here. The first step in any API integration begins with IDK and not the SDK. When a potential API consumer comes across your API, the first question to be answered is: what does this API do? If the answer is I Don’t Know (IDK), we have a problem. A problem no amount of SDKs will solve, no matter how many languages you create them in.</p>

<p>Every API begins with an IDK. What does the Twilio API do? What does the Stripe API do? The answer to this initial question for your API cannot be IDK! As soon as I read your press release, land on the home page of your developer area, I should know what your API does in 5 seconds or less. If I walk away from our first interaction with an IDK, the chances I’ll be coming back are pretty slim. Make sure you always address the IDK, before you get to work on your SDK, for your API(s).</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/supreme-court-statues.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Each story I publish about API patents will usually get a comment, Tweet, LinkedIn, or other comments letting me know that the owner of the patent is only doing it in a defensive pattern. I fully grasp that this is the predominant stance when it comes to defending a patent portfolio, but I prefer seeing six dimensions to this discussion–looking beyond this single position.</p>

<p>When thinking about why a patent exists I see it in six dimensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Idea</strong> - That someone has an idea, thinks it is theirs and feels that this should exist as a patent.</li>
  <li><strong>Patent</strong>- That some have the resources to craft the patent application, and file it with the patent office.</li>
  <li><strong>Filing</strong> - That the patent authority thinks an idea is patent-worthy, and something that should be approved.</li>
  <li><strong>Litigation</strong> - When someone wields a patent as part of litigation, either in an offensive, or defensive stance.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Deals</strong> - When patent shows up as part of an acquisition, partnership, and wielded publicly as part of some deal.</li>
  <li><strong>Backroom Deals</strong> - When patents are leveraged as part of backroom deals when negotiating with companies and investors, and sizing up the value on the table.</li>
</ul>

<p>We only have insight into the middle four dimensions. We really don’t have any view into the individual reasons behind a patent, and we do not get access to how they are wielded and leveraged behind closed doors. I think that defending yourself as part of any court case makes sense, but I’m discussing API patents to help shine a light and understand what is happening within the other dimensions.</p>

<p>Overall I find that the existence of patents to speak volumes about a company’s motivations. The way they showcase or do not showcase their API portfolio contributes to this conversation in important ways. Sadly we will never get a full picture of the individual and backroom aspects of how API patents are used. However, I’m confident I can extract enough meaning from the existence of a patent, the information within the application, and any litigation that has occurred to paint a pretty clear picture of the motivations behind having a patent on your API(s).</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/19/three-rules-of-my-api-communication-strategy/">Three Rules Of My API Communication Strategy</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://communications.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/three-rules-for-a-communication-strategy.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>Communicating effectively around API operations is the number one illness I see across the API space. Engineers are good at writing code and devopping their way to a usable API, but often fall short when it comes to telling the story of what the API does, and consistently beating this drum until people become familiar with what is going on.</p>

<p>An effective API communication strategy is more art than it is science, and I’d like to share three of my rules when it comes to telling stories on the API Evangelist platform.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Honesty</strong> - Be honest with yourself, you’re readers, and those you are writing about. If you can’t find a way to be honest in your writing go find a new job–it won’t be sustainable.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistent</strong> - Communicate every day. Ok, maybe every other day. Regardless of frequency, make sure you are communicating on a consistent basis, setting the tone for what your audience can expect.</li>
  <li><strong>Compelling</strong> - Make it compelling. No, not every single post will be compelling, but make it your primary goal to tell a compelling story that you would read yourself, if it was on someone else’s blog.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is it. Don’t sweat all the technical details. Just write on the blog, spend the time on Twitter, participate in threads on Github, and regularly dive into the bowels of the Slack. Don’t spend all your time worrying about your communication strategy, just make sure you give it a sensible amount of time, and follow these three rules–the rest will come.</p>

<p>As of this moment, there are 2,680 blog posts on API Evangelist, with the first entry in September 2010. These three rules have kept me on track when I was taking money from bigcos like Intel and Mulesoft, and kept me from losing my shit when I was traveling and drinking too heavily. These three rules are what keep me doing this effectively after seven years.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-marketplace-test-drive/?v=17.23h"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/c627d90c-1615-4750-b45c-9658b45596bc.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-marketplace-test-drive/?v=17.23h">The Azure Marketplace has the ability to test drive anything that is deployed in the Azure Marketplace</a>. As someone who has to sign up for an endless number of new accounts to be able to play with APIs and API services, I’m a big fan of the concept of a test drive–not just for web applications, or backend infrastructure, but specifically for individual APIs and microservices.</p>

<p>From the Azure site:  <em>Test Drives are ready to go environments that allow you to experience a product for free without needing an Azure subscription. An additional benefit with a Test Drive is that it is pre-provisioned - you don’t have to download, set up or configure the product and can instead spend your time on evaluating the user experience, key features, and benefits of the product.</em></p>

<p>I like it. I want more of these. I want to be able to test drive, then deploy any API I want. I don’t want to sign up for an account, enter my credit card details, talk to sales, or signup for 30 day trial–I want to test drive. I want it to have data in it, and be pre-configured for a variety of use cases. Helping me understand what is possible.</p>

<p>I want all the friction between me finding an API (discovery via marketplace) understanding what an API does, test driving, then deployment of the API in any cloud I want. I think we are still a little bit off from this being as frictionless as I envision in my head, but I hope with enough nudging we will get there very soon.</p>

  <li>Encryption - Using encryption across all aspects of API operations from portal to base URL.</li>
  <li>API Keys - Making sure everyone who is accessing an API is keying up and passing along with each request.</li>

<p>I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what technology does. I read press releases, pitch emails, documentation, and marketing materials trying to get an idea of what is possible. While many of the APIs I come across are intuitive, and just make sense there is still a significant portion of them that leave me scratching my head regarding what it even does.</p>

<p>As developers, it can be easy to think about the SDKs you will need to support API integration with your API, but I think you are making a lot of assumptions about your consumers when you focus your initial energy here. The first step in any API integration begins with IDK and not the SDK. When a potential API consumer comes across your API, the first question to be answered is: what does this API do? If the answer is I Don’t Know (IDK), we have a problem. A problem no amount of SDKs will solve, no matter how many languages you create them in.</p>

<p>Every API begins with an IDK. What does the Twilio API do? What does the Stripe API do? The answer to this initial question for your API cannot be IDK! As soon as I read your press release, land on the home page of your developer area, I should know what your API does in 5 seconds or less. If I walk away from our first interaction with an IDK, the chances I’ll be coming back are pretty slim. Make sure you always address the IDK, before you get to work on your SDK, for your API(s).</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/16/making-your-api-available-in-marketplaces/">Publishing Your API In The AWS Marketplace</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/box/box-platform-cloud-content-management-apis-aws-marketplace.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’ve been watching the conversation around how APIs are discovered since 2010 and I ave been working to understand where things might be going beyond ProgrammableWeb, to the Mashape Marketplace, and even investing in my own <a href="http://apisjson.org">API discovery format APIs.json</a>. It is a layer of the API space that feels very bipolar to me, with highs and lows, and a lot of meh in the middle. I do not claim to have “the solution” when it comes to API discovery and prefer just watching what is happening, and contributing where I can.</p>

<p>A number interesting signals for API deployment, as well as API discovery,  are coming out of Amazon Marketplace lately. I find myself keeping a closer eye on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?searchTerms=API&amp;page=1&amp;ref_=nav_search_box">the almost 350 API related solutions in the marketplace</a>, and today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06XY1XHGV/?ref=_ptnr_awsblg">I’m specifically taking notice of the Box API availability in the AWS Marketplace</a>. I find this marketplace approach to not just API discovery via an API marketplace, but also API deployment very interesting. AWS isn’t just a marketplace of APIs, where you find what you need and integrate directly with that provider. It is where you find your API(s) and then spin up an instance within your AWS infrastructure that facilitates that API integration–a significant shift.</p>

<p>I’m interested in the coupling between API providers and AWS. AWS and Box have entered into a partnership, but their approach provides a possible blueprint for how this approach to API integration and deployment can scale. How tightly coupled each API provider chooses to be, looser (proxy calling the API), or tighter (deploying API as AMI), will vary from implementation to implementation, but the model is there. The Box AWS Marketplace instance dependencies on the Box platform aren’t evident to me, but I’m sure they can easily be quantified, and something I can get other API providers to make sure and articulate when publishing their API solutions to AWS Marketplace.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">AWS is moving towards earlier visions I’ve had of selling wholesale editions of an API</a>, helping you <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/04/25/your-wholesale-api-for-sale-in-the-major-api-marketplaces/">manage the on-premise and private label API contracts for your platform</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/exploring-the-economics-of-wholesale-and-retail-algorithmic-apis/">helping you explore the economics of providing wholesale editions of your platforms</a>, either tightly or loosely coupled with AWS infrastructure. Decompiling your API platform into small deployable units of value that can be deployed within a customer’s existing AWS infrastructure, seamlessly integrating with existing AWS services.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.box.com/page/box-platform-and-aws">I like where Box is going with their AWS partnership</a>. I like how it is pushing forward the API conversation when it comes to using AWS infrastructure, and specifically the marketplace. I’ll keep an eye on where things are going. Box seems to be making all the right moves lately <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/05/22/box-goes-all-in-on-openapi/">by going all in on the OpenAPI Spec</a>, and decompiling their API platform making it deployable and manageable from the cloud, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/06/16/serverless-blueprints-for-your-api/">but also much more modular and usable in a serverless way</a>. Providing us all with one possible blueprint for how we handle the technology and business of our API operations in the clouds.</p>

<p><a href="http://serverless.apievangelist.com/">Serverless</a> is spreading across the API sector, and is something that leading API providers are beginning to embrace as part of their operations. I saw an interesting example of this out of AWS and Box lately, with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/box-platform-on-aws-marketplace-lambda-blueprints-sample-code/">the announcement of Lambda blueprints and code for integrating with the Box API via the AWS platform</a>.</p>

<p>The Box serverless blueprints show you how to call the Box APIs and connect a Box webhook to a Lambda function via the Amazon API Gateway–providing some pretty interesting use cases for using Box via serverless functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/box-developer-blog/manage-user-authentication-with-box-platform-using-amazon-cognito-8828b5f1d1c9">Manage User Authentication with Box Platform using Amazon Cognito</a> – How to use Amazon Cognito to power a login page for application users.</li>

</ul>

<p>They are some pretty basic use cases, but it is the approach that opens up an entirely new door for API integration for me–Serverless Development Kits (SDK). Every API providers should have a whole catalog of open source serverless scripts that are deployable to Lambda, and other serverless platforms. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">Of course, there are one-click buttons deploy each individual script to the cloud platform of your choice</a>.</p>

<p>I’m diving into the other side of this story for me, where Box is embracing a tighter coupling with the AWS platform as part of their operations. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06XY1XHGV/?ref=_ptnr_awsblg">I am looking at how Box is providing a copy of the Box API for deployment on AWS</a>. This all reflects how I see things working in the future, where you can deploy individual API integration scripts, as well as deploy APIs to a serverless environment like this–empowering anyone to become both API consumer and provider via the AWS, or any other cloud ecosystem.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/blog/2380-new-community-tools">Github has released an interesting new feature to help users better manage some of the community elements of the repositories they use to manage code, definitions, data, and content across API operations</a>. For each repository, you now have a community profile tab, where you’ll see a checklist showing how your project compares to Github recommended community standards.</p>

<p>If you are lacking one of these common elements, it gives you an option to quickly add one of the missing pieces. I still have some repositories where I don’t properly have licensing dictated, even a handful without a README (I know). Almost none of my repositories have a code of conduct or contributing agreement. The new feature adds another task to my list of maintenance items I’ll be tackling to help standardize the projects I manage on Github (which is everything I do).</p>

<p>I like where Github is going with this. <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">It resembles what I am trying to do with API projects by identifying the common building blocks of API deployments, providing a checklist that API providers can follow when publishing their APIs–which is often done using Github</a>. One way that API providers can help standardize these common elements across groups is to create a working API portal prototype that is forkable on Github, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/14/gsa-api-standards-with-working-prototype-api-and-portal/">similar to what the GSA is doing for the federal government with their working API prototype</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the time API architects and eveloper just need a friendly reminder, or possibly a working example they can follow when it comes to standardizing how we deploy and manage the community elements of our API operations. I hope what Github is doing with their community standards baseline will keep evolving, spreading, and eventually be something that Github organizations can templatize, standardize, and define their own criteria regarding the minimum viable aspects of community operations for the repositories they have on Github.</p>

<p>I’m wrestling with the different levels of conversations I’m having around <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">my human services API work</a>. Some of my audience are more technical and are pushing for discussion at the granular level, while other parts of my audience are more about the business of things at the 100K. I appreciate these types of projects, but when there are many different conversations going on at many different levels, it is a lot of work to wrestle things into something coherent that everyone involved will appreciate.</p>

<p>One day I’m thinking about which individual fields are required, then next I will considering how multiple human services API integrators will be syndicating and sharing information between clusters of human service API implementations. While I’m relying on Github, and Slack to facilitate conversations that going on, I am ultimately relying on <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to help me hammer out the contract that will speak to the developers at the granular level but can also communicate the business and political terms of the API contract.  It will describe which fields are required as well as describe the webhooks I need to define how to syndicate and share between implementations.</p>

<p>OpenAPI is pretty focused on helping me with things happening at API sea level, but I’m exploring using APIs.json to help me organize conversations all the way up to the 100K foot level. Things like, where do I signup for my API keys, access partnership levels of access, find the terms of service, or possibly someone to contact and answer a question. Then using the OpenAPI I can publish documentation for developers to understand the surface area of the API (sea level), and while the APIs.json includes a pointer to this discussion, it also provides pointers to other discussions going on around support, communications, changes, privacy, security, so that I can generate documentation for business and partner stakeholders as well.</p>

<p>I’m working on an example of doing this for <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">my Open Referral Human Services API</a>. An APIs.json + OpenAPI that helps articulate what is happening with any single human services API implementation from sea level to 100K. The trick is I also need to articulate how this will work at scale across clusters of human services API implementations, allowing vendors and partners to syndicate and federate. With everything defined as a machine readable index (using APIs.json and OpenAPI), which can be used to generate very technical API documentation, as well as more business-friendly aspects of operations.</p>

<p>One of the projects I’m working on as part my <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">Human Services API</a> work is trying to define the layer that allows developers to add, update, and delete data via the API. We ultimately want to empower 3rd party developers, and external stakeholders to help curate and maintain critical human services data within a community, through trusted partners.</p>

<p>The Human Services API allows for the reading and writing of organizations, locations, and services for any given area. I am looking to provide guidance on how API implementors can allow for POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE on their API, but require approval before any changing transaction is actually executed. Requiring the approval of an internal system administrator to ultimately give the thumbs up or thumbs down regarding whether or not the change will actually occur.</p>

<p>A process which immediately begs for the ability to have multiple administrators or even possibly involving external actors. How can we allow organizations to have a vote in approving changes to their data? How can multiple data stewards be notified of a change, and given the ability to approve or disprove, logging every step along the way? Allowing any change to be approved, reviewed, audited, and even rolled back. Making public data management a community affair, with observability and transparency built in by default.</p>

<p>I am doing research into different approaches to tackling this, ranging from community approaches like Wikipedia, to publish and subscribe, and other events or webhook models. I am looking for technological solutions to opening up approval to the API request and response structure, with accompanying API and webhook surface area for managing all aspects of the approval of any API changes. If you know of any interesting solutions to this problem I’d love to hear more, so that I can include in my research, future storytelling, and ultimately the specification for <a href="https://openreferral.org/">the Open Referral Human Services Data Specification and API</a>.</p>

<p>I’m refining my approach to moving forward the discussion around <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">the Human Services Data Specification and API</a> in an attempt to include more vendors and implementors in the conversation. Part of this work is to streamline how we move forward an increasing number of conversations regarding the schema and API definition.</p>

<p>I am looking help solidify our communication strategy around the human services API, and help make clear which channels participants can tune into:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Github</strong> - Github Issues is where the specific conversation around a variety</li>
  <li><strong>Slack</strong> - A variety of Slack channels for discussing the evolution of API.</li>
  <li><strong>Blog</strong> - Storytelling via API Evangelist, and specific project level blogs.</li>
  <li><strong>GHangouts</strong> - Virtual gatherings to discuss the API via video conferencing.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the channels where the HSDS/A conversations are occurring. It is spread unevenly across these synchronous and asynchronous digital channels. We are using a variety of signals including Github issues, Slack messaging as well as video conference calls, blog posts, and semi-regular virtual gatherings.</p>

<p>I am heavily using the blog post to organize my ideas, distilling down the explosion of information, ideas, and technical details in smaller, coherent, bite-size chunks. This helps me organize and better communicate what’s going on, which includes having a single URL to share with new players. In fact, this blog post is part of me pulling together my communication around the API communications strategy for the human services API project and will be the most current URL I share with people.</p>

<p>One way to help API developers understand API design is to provide them with a design guide, helping set a standard for how APIs should be designed across an organization or group. Another way to help developers follow best practices when it comes to API design is to provide them with a working example they can follow when developing their API(s). In my experience people learn API design best practices through following what they know–emulating what they see.</p>

<p>Hang on to that thought, cause now I’m going to blow your mind. Guess how API providers learn how to provide API design guide and working examples? By showcasing working examples of companies, institutions, and government agencies publishing API design guides, working APIs, and portal prototypes. So that other API providers can learn by example! BOOM! Mind blown. :-) An example of this can be found over at the General Service Administration (GSA), <a href="https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/">with their API standards guide, API prototype, and forkable API portal and documentation</a>–complete with the essential API building blocks.</p>

<p>The GSA’s simple approach to providing a working example of their <a href="https://github.com/GSA/prototype-city-pairs-api/blob/master/standards.md">API standards</a> is refreshing. They have taken an existing GSA data set and launched a prototype API, then they published the API in a complete, working <a href="https://github.com/GSA/api-documentation-template">API developer portal</a> with all the essential building blocks of a basic API presence.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/getting_started.html">Getting Started</a> - What you need to get started with the API.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/console/">Documentation</a> - OpenAPI driven interactive API documentation.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/fields.html">Schema</a> - A reference of the fields / schema used for API responses.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/FAQ.html">FAQ</a> - Some basic questions about the API, and more importantly the API prototype.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/contact_us.html">Contact Info</a> - Using Github issues for support, with an accompanying email.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/GSA/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation">The whole things runs on Github so it is forkable</a>. What is great, is that they also have <a href="https://github.com/GSA/prototype-city-pairs-api">the source code for the API on Github</a>, essentially providing a working, forkable representation of what is expected in the GSA API design guide. This is how you plant seeds for consistent API design across an organization. An API design guide setting standard, with a working example of what you would like to see as the finished product.</p>

<p>I’m really getting into this approach to defining the API conversation within an organization. <a href="http://drone.prototype.apievangelist.com/">I’m working with a handful of large organizations right now to develop API prototypes</a>, evolve <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">my current API portal definition</a>, as well as working to influence the GSA’s approach. If you aren’t familiar with the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov">General Services Administration (GSA)</a>, a significant portion of their mission is dedicated to delivering technology services to the over 430 departments, agencies, and sub-agencies in the federal government. The GSA API design guide, prototype, and portal provide a working example other agencies can follow when defining, designing, deploying, and managing their API presence–important stuff.</p>

<p>I am still driving it around the block, but I thought the second email I got from them when I was signing up was worth writing about. I had received a pretty standard getting started email from them, but then I got a second email from Miles Daffin, their product manager, reminding me that I can reach out, and providing me with a “Yes I Would Like To Talk Button”. I know, another pretty obvious thing, but you’d be surprised how a little thing like this can actually break us from our regular isolated workspace, and make the people behind an API, or API related service more accessible. The email was pretty concise and simple, but what caught my eye when I scanned was the button.</p>

<p>Anyways, just a small potential building block for your API communication strategy. I’ll be adding the list I am cultivating. I’m not a big hard sell kind of guy, and I appreciate soft outreach like this–leaving it up to me when I want to connect. I’ll keep playing with RepreZen API Studio and report back when I have anything worth sharing. I just wanted to make sure this type of signup email was included in my API communication research.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of companies who share their API journey publicly. The comment I hear from readers, as well as attendees of @APIStrat often, is that they want to hear more honest stories from API practitioners regarding every stop along the API lifecycle from defining to deprecation. I encourage API providers to actively share their stories publicly on their blog, and even semi-privately via email newsletters.</p>

<p>Ash Hathaway (<a href="https://twitter.com/ash_hathaway">@ash_hathaway</a>) over at <a href="https://www.stitchdata.com/">Stich Data</a> asked me what I thought about her doing an evangelism email newsletter based on her experiences–to which I responded with, “hell yeah, it is a great idea!”. So she has launched <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/ashleyintexas">The Evangelism Compendium, the successes and (mostly) failures of a developer evangelist email newsletter</a>. She will be sharing her regular thoughts from the trenches, as she is evangelizing for <a href="https://www.stitchdata.com/">the data integration platform</a>.</p>

<p>Sharing stories from the API trenches like this is a great way to generate content for your operations, while also working through your thoughts on what is working (or not), when it comes to evangelism and outreach for your platform. I think the email newsletter has two audiences 1) data stewards looking to learn more about managing your data in today’s online cloud environment, and 2) other data and API service providers who are looking to learn, and hopefully share thoughts on evangelizing your platform. Many folks think I’m crazy for encouraging this type of real-time transparency into your operations, something that can make some feel vulnerability and exposed, but I find it to the best way to generate honest and compelling content.</p>

<p>API Evangelist is the result of me doing this for the last seven years. Sharing my thoughts as I do my work. I find it is a helpful part of my regular workflow to tell stories in this way, as it helps me refine and articulate my approach. It also generates valuable SEO and SMM exhaust for my platform, while also hopefully helping educate others along the way–even stimulating conversation. I encourage all API providers, and service providers to <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/ashleyintexas">tune into what Ash is doing over at Stitch Data</a>, and make sure you are telling your story via your blog and/or email newsletter–no matter which stops along the API lifecycle you are looking share with the community.</p>

<p>I’ve been investing a lot more energy into open data and APIs involved with city government, something I’ve dabbled in as long as I’ve been doing API Evangelist, but is something I’ve ratcheted up pretty significantly over the last couple of years. As part of this work, I’ve increasingly come across some pretty proprietary stances when it comes to data that is part of city operations–<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/06/every-city-county-and-state-should-have-an-api/">this stuff has been seen as gold, long before Silicon Valley came along, with long lines of folks looking to lock it up and control it</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/04/24/separating-the-licensing-layers-of-your-valuable-data-using-apis/">Helping civic data stakeholders separate the licensing layers around their open data and APIs is something I do as the API Evangelist</a>. Another layer I will be adding to this discussion is around taxonomy. How city data folks are categorizing, organizing, and classifying the valuable data needed to make our cities work. I’ve been coming across more vendors in the city open data world who feel their taxonomy is their secret sauce and falls under intellectual property protection. I don’t have any wisdom regarding why this is a bad idea, but I will keep writing about as part of my wider <a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com/">API licensing</a> work to help flesh out my ideas, and create a more coherent and precise argument.</p>

<p>I understand that some companies put a lot of work into taxonomies, and the description behind how they organize things, but like API definitions and schema, these are aspects of your open data and API operations you want to be a widely understood, shared, and reusable knowledge within your systems, as well as the 3rd party integration of your partners and customers. Making your taxonomy proprietary isn’t going to help your brand, or get you ahead in the game. I recommend focusing on other aspects of the value you bring to the table and keep your taxonomy as openly licensed as you possibly can, encouraging adoption by others. I’ll work on a more robust argument as I work through a variety of projects that will potentially be hurt by the proprietary views on taxonomy I’m seeing.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-versus.png" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I process a lot of stories each week, which I do not think is at all unique. While I tend to read short, medium, and longer form pieces, I notice that people tend to tune into my shorter, more concise pieces. I’m an aggregator, analyst, so people probably are looking to me to understand what is going on and in turn I’m looking for individual API providers and service providers to help me keep in tune with what is going on with their operations–I depend on blog posts, change logs, and other common building blocks to do my work.</p>

<p>One recommendation I have for API providers and service providers when it comes to their communication strategies is to provide short concise blog posts regarding specific goings on. Make your blog posts like your API resources–doing one thing and doing it well. You can still do a round-up at the end of the week providing an executive summary, but don’t cut out the short individual blog posts. In my experience, people tend to read titles, tweets, and don’t have much attention span beyond 300 to 500 words. Personally, if I am busy, the first thing I cut out each week is the lengthy weekly roundups from providers–I will scan, but really do not read much of the detail if something catches my eyes.</p>

<p>This advice isn’t for other aggregators and analysts. Your job is to round up and provide and overview of what is going on. My advice is for individual API providers looking to update everyone with what is going on with their API operations, services, tooling, customers, and other common things you should be evangelizing and communicating as part of your regular operations. This is just some feedback from someone who is passionate about consuming as much information as I possibly can each week. Many short stories are better than just a single round-up, and you tend to get better search and social media bang for your buck when you have well-crafted titles, and a short body, that focuses on a single topic. Think of your API communication strategy similar to your microservices approach and I think you’ll get the reach you are looking for.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/13/setting-the-rules-for-api-automation/">Setting The Rules For API Automation</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/twitter-automation-rules.png" align="right" width="40%" style="pading: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Twitter released some automation rules this spring, laying the ground rules when it comes to building bots using the Twitter API. Some of the rules overlap with their existing terms of service, but it provides an interesting evolution in how platform providers need to be providing some direction for API consumers in a bot-driven conversational landscape.</p>

<p>They begin by laying the ground rules for automation using the Twitter API:</p>

<p>Do!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build solutions that automatically broadcast helpful information in Tweets</li>
  <li>Run creative campaigns that auto-reply to users who engage with your content</li>
  <li>Build solutions that automatically respond to users in Direct Messages</li>
  <li>Try new things that help people (and comply with our rules)</li>
  <li>Make sure your application provides a good user experience and performs well — and confirm that remains the case over time</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Violate these or other policies. Be extra mindful of our rules about abuse and user privacy!</li>
  <li>Abuse the Twitter API or attempt to circumvent rate limits</li>
  <li>Spam or bother users, or otherwise send them unsolicited messages</li>
</ul>

<p>Twitter is just evolving their operation by providing an automation update to the <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311">Twitter rules</a> and the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/agreement-and-policy">developer agreement and policy</a>, outlining what is expected of automated activity when it comes to engaging with users account, when bots are tweeting, direct messages, and other actions you take when it comes to Tweets or Twitter accounts. Providing an interesting look at the shift in API platform terms of service as the definition of what is an application continues to evolve.</p>

<p>While there were may automated aspects to the classic interpretation of web or mobile applications, bots are definitely bringing an entirely new meaning to what automation can bring to a platform. I think any API driven platform that is opening up their resources to automation is going to have to run down their list of available resources and think deeply about the positive and negative consequences of automation in the current landscape. Whether it is bots, voice, iPaaS, CI, CD, or any other type of API driven automation, the business, and politics of API operations are shifting rapidly, and the threats, risks, and stakes are only going to get higher.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://usafacts.org/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/usa-facts/usa-facts-federal-business-spending.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I love what the folks over at <a href="https://usafacts.org/">USAFacts</a> have done with their effort to educate everyone regarding how the US works (or doesn’t). I commend Steve Ballmer for the money he’s put into the project and the obviously huge amount of work they have put into making some pretty complex things understandable. However, I just have one critique: I wish they had an API, accompanied with a more sophisticated sharing and embeddable approach to publishing the wealth of valuable information contained within the site.</p>

<p>You can share links to specific sections of USAFacts, but it is just a generic image with a link to each area of the site. The site is exactly what we need in a Trump era, and is full of valuable factoids about how things work, but we need more eye candy for sharing, and the ability to share more granular level details about what is contained within the project. Journalists should be able to craft stories around finance and population via a graph, chart, or other detail that links back to the site. In the current state, you have to be pretty motivated and truly care about this stuff to visit the site and get involved–this represents a pretty light portion of the US population (maybe we could get a chart ;-).</p>

<p>All it would take to accomplish this is a pretty simple JSON API with some <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> or other <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">API visualization</a> magic. With an API, data-savvy journalists, and other 3rd party developers could help carry the load when it comes to developing storytelling tooling that could help USAFacts make a bigger impact. Think about the impact that Facebook and Twitter cards had on the election when it came to sharing news (or fake news) with the public–we need USAFacts to be richly embedded in everyone’s timeline, with meaningful storytelling behind when a user is looking to know more. The facts have to be portable, shareable, visual, and tell a story–this is something an API excels at being an engine for.</p>

<p>I understand that USAFacts is just getting started, and maybe they are working on, but without any sort of road map, I have no way of knowing. If the folks behind the important project want to ensure the site lives on beyond the last wave of press releases they need to invest heavily in an API, as well as an embeddable and social sharing strategy that will help spread the valuable facts across the web where they need to be.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/api-evangelist-speaking.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was reading <a href="https://www.cujournal.com/news/whats-behind-the-hold-up-of-api-adoption-at-credit-unions">what’s behind the hold up of API adoption at credit unions</a> and I’m reminded (again) of the critical need for API evangelists in the space. I am not talking about advocates for a single API, but more evangelists that reflect my mission as the API Evangelist, but dialed in for specific industries.</p>

<p>To set the stage for you, let me share why I started API Evangelist seven years ago. I began writing about the business, and eventually the politics of APIs because I saw the potential with APIs, but I also saw that things were not evolving as fast as they could because technologists were dominating the API conversation. We needed more discussion around the business of doing APIs, and many of the finer political details like security, terms of service, branding, and other concerns of the business leaders who actually controlled the purse strings that would move the space forward at the speed and scale everyone desired.</p>

<p>To help break the log jam within the federal government, healthcare, and other industries someone needed to help assure business and technical stakeholders of the benefits of doing APIs, with sensible discussion regarding how they could mitigate the risk involved. The problem in the banking space is that you only have the vendors and hype pundits dominating the conversation, and much-needed trust is never established. Banks are extremely risk adverse because of money, but also because of regulations, and when you have just technologist, vendors, and hype analysts stirring the pot, nobody ever really helps alleviate bank’s actual concerns around security, privacy, and other areas that keep them up at night.</p>

<p>I remember sitting down at a table in Vegas with Anthem, Kaiser Permanente, and other health insurance providers who were all about business when I sat down, but after an hour or so I convinced them they weren’t in my sales pipeline, and the tone changed completely. They are so used to be sold to and pushed vendor solutions to their problems, they were just seeing APIs as the next vendor product. I help show them I didn’t have a product to sell, and genuinely wanted to help them understand the API potential, and break down the security, business, and other concerns they faced as major players in the space. I have seen this play out over and over, across many different industries over the last seven years, and is something that the waves of enterprise sales teams, vendors, and analysts never fully grasp is actually gumming up the gears of their progress–a bi-product being so narrowly focused.</p>

<p>For the last five years, I have been trying to groom up evangelists who could tackle specific industries like finance, healthcare, education, and others, but it is really, really difficult to patch together a consistent paycheck to keep anyone engaged. Plus, it seems to take a certain type of obsessive-compulsive personality to stay dedicated to what is going on. If folks are really interested in clearing some of the gunk that is slowing the progress in the banking and credit union API space, you all should get together and establish some sort of vendor-neutral group to help fund and provide a platform for financial sector API evangelist(s) to work independently with banks to help alleviate their concerns, and help showcase the positive motion forward when it comes to banking APIs–otherwise things are going to continue to sputter and jerk forward at an uncomfortable pace.</p>

<p>P.S. The evangelists have to actually give a shit about what is going on and be personally invested, otherwise it won’t be sustainable.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-tools-school.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>

<p>I’ve been reading and curating information on GraphQL as part of my regular research and monitoring of the API space for some time now. As part of this work, I wanted to take a moment and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/02/i-am-keeping-my-mind-open-and-looking-forward-to-learning-more-about-graphql/">revisit my earlier thoughts about GraphQL</a>, and see where I currently stand. Honestly, not much has changed for me, to move me in one direction or another regarding the popular approach to providing API access to data and content resources.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/31/rest-linked-data-hypermedia-graphql-and-grpc/">I still stand by my cautionary advice for GraphQL evangelist regarding not taking such an adversarial stance when it comes to the API approach, and I feel that GraphQL is a good addition to any API architect looking to have a robust and diverse API toolbox</a>. Even with the regular drumbeat from GraphQL evangelists, and significant adoption like the Github GraphQL API I am not convinced it is the solution for all APIs and is a replacement for simple RESTful web API design.</p>

<p>My current position is that the loudest advocates for GraphQL aren’t looking at the holistic benefits of REST, and too wrapped in ideology, which is setting them up for similar challenges that linked data, hypermedia, and even early RESTafarian practitioners have faced. I think GraphQL excels when you have a well educated, known and savvy audience, who are focused on developed web and mobile applications–especially the latest breed of single page applications (SPA). I feel like in this environment GraphQL is going to rock it, and help API providers reduce friction for their consumers.</p>

<p>This is why I’m offering advice to GraphQL evangelists to turn down the anti-REST, and complete replacement/alternative for REST–it ain’t helping your cause and will backfire for you. You are better to off educating folks about the positive, and being honest about the negatives. I will keep studying GraphQL, understanding the impact it is making, and keeping an eye on important implementations. However, when it comes to writing about GraphQL you are going to see me continuing to hold back, just like I did when it came to hypermedia and linked data because I prefer not to be in the middle of ideological battles in the API space. I prefer showcasing the useful tools and approaches that are making a significant impact across a diverse range of API providers–not just echoing what is coming out of a handful of big providers, amplified by vendors and growth hackers looking for conversions.</p>

<p>I was learning about <a href="https://developer.box.com/v2.0/reference#recent-item-object">a new API path for the document platform Box, that was designed specifically for showing recently updated objects</a>. I think that the concept of having API paths dedicated to showing recently changed elements makes sense, helping eliminate the need for API consumers to learn about which parameters are needed to achieve their immediate goals, helping expose useful aspects of the platform through API design.</p>

<p>As an API consumer, it can be a lot of work to get at the meaningful and relevant context of an API Platform if you do not know all the right knobs and levers to pull on. This is where API design comes in handy, helping surface the most relevant and contextual aspects of what is going on. While this may not be the approach all API providers should be taking, especially if you have a savvy API consumer audience, in times when you have a wider, more unknown audience who may be looking to just get at what is going on with their users platform integrations, this type of API design can be a good way to reduce friction.</p>

<p>I am writing about the concept of recent API paths, to think about how this can be added to my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design toolbox</a>. While not a REST, hypermedia (wait maybe) design pattern, I think that in some scenarios, having a recent API path makes a lot of sense. Some platforms are only relevant for a specific time period, and the rest of what is happening can be dealt with through search, taxonomy, and other ways of archiving. Once I write about an API design pattern I come across it kinds of activates it in my brain and makes it something I will be thinking about as I review other APIs, as well as design my own APIs, and who knows, maybe it will do the same for you!</p>

<p>It is a lot of work to keep the API evangelism drumbeat going each day on your blog, Twitter, and other social media channels you use for your API operations. Each Tweet, Facebook or LinkedIn Post is one possible signal that might reach existing developers, or possibly reach a potentially new API consumer–educating them about what your API does.</p>

<p>My friends over at the Oxford Dictionaries APIs are getting really good at this API evangelism song and dance, and <a href="https://twitter.com/OxfordWordsAPI/status/872375851580624899">one of the tactics in their toolbox is regularly Tweeting out relevant threads from their API forum</a>. It is a great way to expose conversations that are going on within your API support forum, and help make other developers aware that these conversations are going on in a way that will also boost your overall SEO, making your API support operations more visible to the public.</p>

<p>Another benefit of sending out these regular API signals is that there is always the potential that I will write up what you are doing, and you’ll get the additional exposure of being on API Evangelist. When people ask me what is the #1 thing they can do to be more successful with evangelism for their API, it is always consistency. Regular, consistent drumbeats about what is going on with your platform, the problems it solves is always the best way to make sure your valuable API resources will be found and put to use in meaningful ways.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/oracle/the-oracle-in-the-matrix.jpg" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" />&lt;,/p&gt;Oracle is investing a serious amount resources to become a contender in the API space lately. [They've acquired Apiary](http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/19/oracle-acquiring-apiary/), and are beating a regular PR drum regarding API design, deployment, management, and everything API. The tech giant shows up on my API monitoring daily with new waves of messaging about how it is the platform of choice when it comes to APIs. The problem is these are always from meaningless outlets who publish every press release they get, not the sources the community looks to for answers.

The company is facing an uphill battle because it is extremely late to the game, but also because of it's ongoing API copyright lawsuit against Google. I know from their vantage point they think they can just change their tune when it comes to marketing and PR, and many enterprise zombies will gladly follow along. They also can flex their financial resources and the venture capital behind startups like Apiary will also fall in line, but when it comes to gaining significant mindshare amongst the core API community, they will never be taken seriously until they drop their lawsuit, and make a public announcement demonstrating their commitment to the community.

I'll get the regular wave of haters for this post asking who I think I am. I'm nobody. It's true. Although I must be a micro blip on the radar because Oracle's API team had reached out to me. I asked them if they knew who I was, and had read my work? They said they had, but I think they really hadn't because after a while they stopped responding to me emails regarding their request for a sit-down. I get it. I'm nobody at the Oracle scale, but I am listened to in the API community, which is a different software community than the enterprise world. I'm under no delusions that the enterprise community gives a shit about what I have to say, but many in the API community do, and I'm not backing down when it comes to fighting to keep the API space open and interoperable--even if I end up losing. I'm not in this game to win.

I'm not sure strategically what value Oracle is getting out of their fight with Google. I am sure that they are completely oblivious to the damage the court case has done to their brand. I am also quite sure that Oracle DOES NOT understand API, despite what their current marketing barrage might say. They do not understand the interoperability, reuse, remix, and innovation that APIs afford when done right. I'm sure they seem them as yet another tech trend train they need to ride and need to pay lip service to. I'm sure they have enough cash to throw into the wind on this, but the cost of continuing to sue Google, and throw endless money into marketing and advertising has to be pretty huge.

I know Oracle thinks it is invincible in the face of the API economy, but I'm sure other bigcos from previous generations of the software world thought the same as well. There are elements at play when it comes to APIs that are hard for bigcos like Oracle to fully grasp, and think they can just throw their weight around to get what they want. No matter how many resources they throw at it, Oracle will never be taken seriously by the core API community until it backtracks from the Oracle v Google API copyright case. They damn sure will never appear in a positive light on a blog post or Tweet from @apievangelist until they publicly apologize for the damage they've done--bwahahahaa, but who the hell am I right?

        <span class="post-date">09 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apicurio/apicurio-road-map.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px" /></p>
<p>I have been learning more about Apicurio, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/05/30/apicurio-is-the-open-source-api-editor-i-was-looking-for/">which is the open source API design editor I have been waiting for</a>. There are a number of things I’m interested in when it comes to Apicurio, but <a href="http://www.apicur.io/roadmap/">one side element that caught my attention was their road map</a>.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of encouraging folks to share their roadmap. It is an important part of helping establish a shared future between API provider and API consumer. Apicurio is an API tool, without any APIs (yet), but the roadmap purpose remains the same. I like how Apicurio shares their tech preview, beta, and 1.x plan, in a coherent and organized way–you do not have to be a developer to understand what they are planning.</p>

<p>As I was using Apicurio I had a lot of questions about what it didn’t do. I had a lot of ideas about what it should do, and before I set out writing these ideas on my blog I spent some time with their road map, syncing items on my list with items on their roadmap. After I was done, I had reduced my list of questions and ideas to just a handful of items–which I will write about shortly. Their proactive, coherent, and complete road map saved me time, but also will save them time when it comes to listening to my feedback (if they do).</p>

<p>Complete, coherent, and plain English road maps are another one of those super simple, captain obvious ideas that over 50% of the APIs I review DO NOT HAVE. Which is why I’m writing about it and showcasing a positive example like <a href="http://www.apicur.io/">Apicurio</a>. Please do not forget to share road map with your community–it will save us both time.</p>

<p>There are a growing number of API providers who have published <a href="http://apisjson.org">an APIs.jso</a>n for their API operations, providing a machine-readable index of not just their API, but for their API entire operations. My favorite example to use in my talks and conversations when I’m showcasing the API discovery format is the one for <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">the International Trade Administration at developer.trade.gov</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://trade.gov/">The International Trade Administration (ITA)</a> is the government agency that “strengthens the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promotes trade and investment, and ensures fair trade through the rigorous enforcement of our trade laws and agreements”, provides an index of where you can find their developer portal, documentation, terms of service, as well as a machine readable OpenAPI for their trade APIs.</p>

<p>I couldn’t think of a more shining example of APIs when it comes to talking about the API economy. I am pleased to have helped influenced their API efforts and helping them see the importance of providing a machine readable index of their API operations with APIs.json, as well as their APIs using OpenAPI. <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/apis.json">If you need a well maintained, and meaningful example of how APIs.json works head over to developer.trade.gov and take a look</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/blog/2370-temporary-interaction-limits"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/github/769c0c3c-34af-11e7-9b76-96396c81f051.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about API rate limits. How they can hurt API providers, or as my friend Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>) says incentivize creativity. I think your view on rate limits will vary depending on which side of the limit you stand, as well as your own creative potential and limitations. I agree with Tyler that they can incentivize creativity, but it doesn’t mean that all limitations imposed will ultimately be good, or all creativity will be good.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/blog/2370-temporary-interaction-limits">I found myself contemplating Github’s recent introduction of temporary interaction limits which means “maintainers can temporarily limit who can comment, create pull requests, and open issues among existing users, collaborators, and prior contributors.”</a> While this isn’t directly about API rate limiting, it does overlap, and provide us with some thoughts we can apply to our world of API consumption, and how we sensibly moderate the access to the digital resources we are making available online.</p>

<p>When it comes to real-time fetishism around the digital world those with the loudest bullhorn often get heard and think real-time is good, while <a href="http://kinlane.com/2016/09/01/real-time-is-often-more-about-what-they-desire-than-what-we-want/">I am becoming less convinced that anything gets done in a 24-hour time frame</a>. Despite what many want you to believe, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2016/08/23/fine-tuning-my-real-time-for-maximum-efficiency/">real-time does not always mean good</a>. Sometimes it might do you some good to chill out for 24 hours before you continue commenting, posting, or increase your consumption of a digital resource, whether you want to admit it or not.</p>

<p>Our digital overlords have convinced us that more is better and real time is always ideal. Temporary interaction limits may not be the right answer in all situations, but it does give us another example of rate limiting by a major provider that we can consider and follow when it comes to crafting limitations around our digital resources. This is what rate limitations are all about for me, thoughtful consideration about how much of a good thing you will need each second, minute, day, week, or month. It is a great way to turn a quality digital resource into something better or possibly maintain the quality and value of a seemingly infinite resource by imposing just a handful of limitations.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.openshift.com/kdl-notation-kubernetes-app-deploy/">I am learning about the Kubernetes Deployment Language (KDL) today</a>, trying to understand their approach to defining their notion of Kubernetes API objects. It feels like an interesting evolution in how we define our infrastructure, and begin standardizing the API layer for it so that we can orchestrate as we need.</p>

<p>They are standardizing the Kubernetes API objects into the following buckets:</p>

<p>Cluster - The orchestration level of things.
Compute - The individual compute level.
Networking - The networking layer of it all.
Storage - Storage behind our APIs.</p>

<p>This has elements of <a href="http://dev.apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">my API lifecycle research</a>, as well as a containerized, clustered, BaaS 2.0 in my view. Standardizing how we define and describe the essential layers of our API and application infrastructure. I could also see standardizing the testing, monitoring, performance, security, and other critical aspects of doing this at scale.</p>

<p>I’m also fascinated at how fast YAML has become the default orchestration template language for folks in the cloud containerization space. I’ll add KDL to my <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">API definition</a> and <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com">container research</a> and keep an eye on what they are up to, and keep an eye out for other approaches to standardizing the API layer for deploying, managing, and scaling our increasingly containerized API infrastructure.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/raven-fence.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I read a lot of patents as part of my work as the API Evangelist, and I tend to stalk and tune into the social media accounts of some of the authors. I have noticed that some of them work at large companies, and are counting each patent they file and are announcing each one like it is a badge of honor. I’m fascinated by this. Each company’s approach to showcasing or downplaying their patent portfolio tells a lot about the company, something that I feel trickles down to each individual author.</p>

<p>The theater of showcasing the number of patents is fascinating to me. I’m not saying it’s a bad thing, just something I think is worthy of more discussion in the modern age. I don’t showcase the number of patents I have filed because 1) I don’t have any patents 2) I cannot afford to file any patents 3) I don’t showcase my ideas, I showcase things I do and the stories I tell. Ok, maybe a patent is a story right? A story about what is possible, that you’ve paid a fee to file with the government, and convinced them that the story is true? I’m just trying to get at the thinking behind this theater production, and why some folks feel that it is a badge of honor.</p>

<p>The biggest differentiator here for me is that I cannot afford to file patents. It is a rich man’s game. Is this why people showcase? To declare they are part of the elite?
 Even if I could afford to file one patent, I definitely cannot afford to file many patents, and I cannot ever afford to litigate and defend a patent in a court of law. Making patents completely useless to me, even if I wanted to legally define my stories and ideas like this. Another thing that I notice is that there are no individuals filing patents, it is always an individual filing on behalf of a large company who has the money to file, and to litigate on behalf of the patent portfolio, which for me diminishes the individual merit of showcasing–look ma, I got a new patent (for my company)!!</p>

<p>A patent feels like one of those carrots that get dangled in front of individuals to get them to perform while on the hamster wheel. You get told in high school and college by your mentors that the number of patents you have is a badge of honor. However, you never get told that it is your organization that owns the portfolio, and made aware of the closed door dealings or litigation that will occur around your patent portfolio. IDK, it could be that I’m naive and uneducated about the wider world of patents, and how revenue is generated from patent portfolios–it won’t be the first time I’ve spouted off about something I don’t get, nor will it be the last. I write to understand.</p>

<p>Ultimately I think patents are a rich person game, and how a significant amount of ideas are locked up and made part of larger flows of power, or rendered a non-threat. It isn’t a game I’m part of because I don’t operate at that level, which is why it is foreign to me. I’ve never heard someone tell me that they respect someone for their patent portfolio, or that they were an author on a patent. I think patents are one of those legacy stories that used to have meaning and purpose in the industrial world, and long ago became the game of rich folks, while also becoming pretty distorted in the translation from the physical to the digital. It is a game people still showcase as a badge of honor because of mythical stories they have heard those in power tell–they have little to do with your own success or the value of your ideas.</p>

<p>For me, I measure my success based on the stories I tell about my ideas, and the stories others retell about my ideas. I also measure my success based upon the number of my ideas that become real, and are part of everyday practice in an industry, even if I do not receive royalty checks, or able to litigate and make deals based upon my idea portfolio…but, this is just me. I’m an oddball like that.</p>

This is why I keep an eye on not just how API providers are handling their support, but also how leading support software as a service API providers are setting the bar for how we do support.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/keeping-word-support-sla/">Zendesk support SLA</a> provides us with some valuable information about setting a service level objective, developing support SLA workflow, dealing with a breach, and even some key performance indicators (KPIs) to help you measure success.

How you support and communicate with your customers can be just as important as the technical bullets of your SLA. Most of the SLAs I’ve read in the API space focus on the technical, business, and legal considerations of integration, but Zendesk reminds us of the actual human elements of setting and meeting a specific level of service when it comes to API integration.</p>

<p>I’m reading a lot of <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">API patents</a> lately trying to understand the variety of approaches these “innovative” patent authors are using to help define the API space. Many of the API patents I have historically objected to tend to patent the technical detail that make the web work or significantly contributes to the integration benefits that an API delivers. Today’s patent does all of this but is focused on patenting the legal details that are needed to make this whole API thing work at scale.</p>

<p>Title: <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/8954988">Automated assessment of terms of service in an API marketplace</a>
Number: 08954988
Owner: International Business Machines Corporation
Abstract: An embodiment of the invention comprising a method is associated with an API marketplace, wherein one or more API providers can each supply an API of a specified type, and each provider has a set of ToS for its API of the specified type. The method includes, responsive to an API consumer having a need for an API of the specified type, obtaining the ToS of each of the API providers. The method further includes implementing an automated process to determine differences between the ToS of a given API provider, and a ToS required by the API consumer. The ToS differences determined for respective API providers are used to decide whether to select a particular one of the API providers to supply an API of the specified type to the API consumer.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I think this is an innovative idea. I just don’t think it is something that should be patented. It should be an open standard, with a wealth of open (and proprietary) tooling developed to enable it to be a reality. If you are patenting the thing we need to make the legal partnership details in API marketplace, and ideally on the open web across API implementations more streamlined, you are just slowing meaningful API adoption and integration–it isn’t something you are going to get rich doing.</p>

<p>Imagine if every technical, business and legal detail of the web was patented early on–it wouldn’t exist as it does today. We do need an automated way to assess the terms of service that govern API consumption. We need this now, but we need it to be an open standard that anyone can implement as part of any API marketplace or single API implementation. This is similar to what we are trying to accomplish with <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, trying to make the licensing portion of platform operations machine readable and digestible at integration, as well as at runtime.</p>

<p>I just wish the innovation and resources that went into this patent had gone into an open standard for helping define terms of services so that there could be any innovation when it comes to automating the assessment of API terms of service. It feels like this patent author is just counting on the fact that the API space will eventually mature and reach a point where automating the assessment of terms of service is possible, and then cash in on the fact that they hold a patent on this valuable aspect of the API economy.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/easier-to-offer-ops-apis-to-your-devs-if-your-api-service-provider-has-apis/">I am a big fan of API providers who also have APIs</a>. It may sound silly to say, but you would be surprised how many companies are selling services to API providers and do not actually have an API themselves. So, anytime I find a good example of API service providers launching new APIs that help API providers be more successful, I’m all over it with a story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api/metrics">Today’s example is from my friends over at Runscope with their API Metrics API</a> that lets you “retrieve your API tests performance metrics for each individual test, keep a pulse on your API’s performance over time, and create custom internal or external dashboards with it”. You can filter the request by using 3 different parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>region - The service region you’re using to run your tests (e.g. us1, us2, eu1, etc.)</li>
  <li>timeframe - Hour, day, week, or month. Depending on the timeframe you use, the interval between the response times will be different.</li>
  <li>environment_uuid - Filter by a specific environment, such as test, production, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is a pretty healthy example of everything that is API for me–an API that helps you make sure your APIs are performing as expected. You can not just understand how well your API responds, you can dial that in by region, and paint a clear picture of how well you are doing over time. I like that you can create internal dashboards for communicating this with your organization, but I also like their approach to providing external API performance dashboards so much I am going to add it to my list of building blocks I track on as part of <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com/#BuildingBlocks">my API performance research</a>.</p>

<p>Aight. That concludes today’s showcase of an API service provider making sure they are practicing what they preach and providing APIs for their valuable services. Honestly, I find this to be a fascinating layer of the API sector–the API layer that can orchestrate APIs. I enjoy thinking about what is possible when your APIs have APIs–it makes something like API performance a much more obtainable, scalable, and as Runscope does it, something you can easily communicate with your internal stakeholders and your API community.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.papis.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/papis/papis-api-screenshot.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I try to pay attention to events going on in the API space beyond just APIStrat in Portland this fall (<a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat/program/cfp">submit your CFP!!</a>), and I saw a notification for <a href="http://www.papis.io/">PAPIs in São Paulo in two weeks, as well as Boston in October</a>. I’m glad we’ve always kept @APIStrat a wider community thing, but if I had to pick one vertical to focus on in 2017 and on, it would definitely be machine learning APIs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.papis.io/">PAPIs has been on my radar for a while now</a>, but I think their foresight is going to start paying off this year. While there are a number of trends moving the API space forward, things like microservices, serverless, and GraphQL, nothing will compare to what is happening with machine learning (ML). I think 90% of the ML will be BS, but there will be 5-10% of it that will actually move industries forward in any meaningful way, and the scope of the investment into everything ML is going to be dizzying for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Conferences like PAPIs are going to become increasingly important to help us sit down and have conversations about what ML and AI APIs do, or do not do. I see machine learning, cognitive, artificial intelligence and the buzzwords everybody likes to use just as the algorithmic evolution of the API industry. Where we will be moving beyond just data and content APIs as the default, and having a robust toolbox of algorithmic resources to bake into all of our applications will become standard operating procedure. I’m guessing we’ll see an increased presence of PAPIs conferences in cities around the globe, as well as waves of other ML and AI API-focused events pop up.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://applymagicsauce.com/business.html"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/university-of-cambridge/university-of-cambridge-api-transparency.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I believe that APIs can bring some important transparency to the web, mobile, and device applications that seem to be invading our life. I hesitate using the word transparency because it has been weaponized by Wikileaks and others in the current cyber(in)secure landscape, but for the purposes of this story, it will work. APIs by default do not mean transparency, but when done in the right way they can pull back the curtain a little on what is going on when a company, organization, institution, or agency behind is truly committed to transparency.</p>

<p><a href="http://transparency.apievangelist.com/">I’ve long had a portion of my research dedicated to studying intentional transparency efforts by API providers</a>, giving me a place to publish any organizations, links, and stories that I publish on the subject of API transparency. As part of my API research I was looking at some university API efforts the other day when I came across <a href="https://applymagicsauce.com">the Apply Magic Sauce API</a>, a personalisation engine that accurately predicts psychological traits from digital footprints of human behavior, <a href="https://applymagicsauce.com/business.html">which had a pretty interesting section dedicated to the subject of transparency</a>. Here is some background on their approach:</p>

<p>Our methods have been peer-reviewed and published in open access journals since 2013, and new services that sound similar to Apply Magic Sauce API (AMS) are springing up every day. As this technology becomes more accessible and its impact increases, we would like to ensure that citizens have clarity on who we do and do not work with. We are therefore committed to keeping an up to date list of every organisation that we have formally authorised to use AMS for commercial purposes. These clients are advised to follow our ethical guidelines and are bound by our terms and conditions regarding the need to obtain the informed consent of individuals about whom predictions are made. We encourage other providers of predictive technologies to honour the principles of privacy, transparency and relevance and publish a similar list of their own.</p>

<p>The Apply Magic Sauce API provides me with a solid example of an existing institution, “…committed to keeping an up to date list of every organization that we have formally authorised to use AMS for commercial purposes”, and encouraging their partners to “publish a similar list of their own”. What an important example to set when it comes to APIs, especially APIs that involve the amount of personally identifiable information (PII) that a social network possesses. It provides a positive model that ANY application who allows for the OAuth’ing of a user via their Twitter, Facebook, or another social network should be emulating.</p>

<p>Honestly, I’m still not 100% sure about what they are up to at <a href="https://applymagicsauce.com/">the University of Cambridge with their Apply Magic Sauce API</a>–I am still getting going with my dive into their operations. However, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/05/31/an-example-of-api-ethics-out-of-cambridge-university/">from the amount of work they’ve put into the ethics behind their API platform</a>, as well as the high bar for transparency being set, I’m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are up to good things. I’ll keep diving into their API, and monitor the activity in the community to make sure they are standing behind their pledge, and see whether or not their API partners are respecting the pledge as well.</p>

<p>I am hoping that the University of Cambridge provides me with a solid ethical example of not just how an API provider can behave and communicate around the transparency of their API consumption, but also how they can set the same expectations within their API community. If I had my way this would be the standard operating procedure for EVERY company, organization, institution, and a government agency that possess any PII for ANY citizen–100% transparency of EVERY single partner, customer, and application developer who has access to any personal data.</p>

<p>I was answering some questions for <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">my partners over at DreamFactory</a> when it comes to APIs in government, and one of the questions they asked was about some examples of the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI specification</a> being used in government. To help out, I started going through  my list of government API looking for any examples in the wild–here is what I found:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) (<a href="https://api.open.fec.gov/swagger/">OpenAPI</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://gsa.github.io/sam_api/sam/console/">System for Award Management</a> (<a href="http://gsa.github.io/sam_api/static/api_docs/api_docs.json">SAM</a>) (OpenAPI)</p>
  </li>

    <p><a href="https://usdigitalregistry.digitalgov.gov/">US Digital Registry</a> (<a href="https://api.gsa.gov/systems/digital-registry/v1/swagger_docs/api-docs.json">OpenAPI</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://micropurchase.18f.gov/api">18F Open Source Micro Purchasing API</a> (<a href="https://micropurchase.18f.gov/api/v0/swagger.json">OpenAPI</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS">NASA</a> (Couldn’t find OpenAPI in less than 30 seconds)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://qpp.cms.gov/api/">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) API for Quality Payment Program Measures</a> (<a href="https://qpp.cms.gov/api/api-docs.json">OpenAPI</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/transportation-incentives-laws-v1/">National Renewal Energy Labratory Transportation Laws and Incentives API</a> (<a href="https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/transportation-incentives-laws-v1/api-docs.json">OpenAPI</a>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I am sure there are more OpenAPI in use across government, but this is what I could find in a five-minute search of my API database. It provides us with seven quality examples of OpenAPI being used for documenting government APIs. I don’t see the OpenAPI used for much beyond documentation, but it is still a good start.</p>

<p>If you know of any government APIs that use OpenAPI feel free to let me know. I’d love to keep adding examples to my research so I can pull up quickly when I am asked questions like this in the future, and be able to highlight best practices for API operations in city, county, state, and federal levels of government.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/33466/Watson_washington_0250E_14776.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/documentation/api-documentation-research-visualization.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I have seen a number of research projects looking at API documentation, but this is the most detailed study into how people are seeing, or not seeing the API documentation and other resources we are providing. It is a dissertation for Robert Bennett Watson out of the University of Washington on <a href="https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/33466/Watson_washington_0250E_14776.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">the Effect of Visual Design and Information Content on Readers’ Assessments of API Reference Topics</a>.</p>

<p>I gave the research paper a read through and it is some lofty academic stuff, but it touches on a number of the things I write about on API Evangelist when it comes to the cognitive load associated with understanding what an API does. I found the resulting conversation from the research to be the most interesting part, discussing how we can improve the flow with our API documentation and reduce interruption time, or as I often call it, “friction”. There are a wealth of ideas in there for helping us think more critically about our API documentation, which has been repeatedly identified as the number one problem area for our developers.</p>

<p>If you are in the business of creating any new API documentation startup your team should be digesting Mr. Watson’s work. This is the first official academic work I’ve seen on the subject of API documentation and is something I’ll be revisiting regularly, attempting to distil down any words of wisdom for my readers. I feel like this work is a sign of larger movements towards the API space beginning to get more coherent in how we approach our API operations. I’m hoping it is something that will lay the groundwork for some more useful API documentation services and tooling.</p>

<p>There are so many API patents out there, I’m going to have to start posting one a day just to keep up. Lucky for you I begin to get really depressed by all the API patents I lose interest in reading them and begin to work harder looking for positive examples of API in the world, but until then here is today’s depressing as fuck API patent.</p>

<p>Title: <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/8997069">API descriptions</a>
Number: US 8997069
Owner: Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC
Abstract: API description techniques are described for consumption by dynamically-typed languages. In one or more implementations, machine-readable data is parsed to locate descriptions of one or more application programming interfaces (APIs). The descriptions of the one or more application programming interfaces are projected into an alternate form that is different than a form of the machine-readable data.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to be a complete dick here, but why would you think this is a good idea? I get that companies want their employees to develop a patent portfolio, but this one is patenting an essential ingredient that makes APIs work. If you enforce this patent it will be worthless because this whole API thing won’t work, and if you don’t enforce it, it will be worthless because it does nothing–money well spent on the filing fee.</p>

<p>I just need to file my patent on patenting APIs and end all of this nonsense. I know y’all think I’m crazy for my beliefs that APIs shouldn’t be patented, but every time I dive into my patent research I can’t help but think y’all are the crazy ones, and I’m actually sane. I just do not understand how this patent is going to help anyone and represents any of the value that APIs and even a patent can bring to the table.</p>

<p>I really dislike acronyms, so the irony surrounding me being the API Evangelist is always present for me. API isn’t just about RESTful APIs to me. API is much more than just the technical, it is also the business and politics of our digital world–something that doesn’t come across in three letters.</p>

<p>As part of my storytelling, I enjoy unpacking the complexity that acronyms are often used to shadow, hopefully making the world of technology a little less intimidating for folks. While space out at lunch the other day I unpacked API and wrote this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A - application - the action of putting something into operation.</li>
  <li>P - programming - the action or process of writing computer programs.</li>
  <li>I - interface - interact with another system, person, or organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like this has helped unpack not just the acronym, but also the words behind them, helping better speak to what APIs actually do in my opinion. I feel like mobile applications always take the lion share of meaning when it comes to the meaning behind the word application. I also feel like humans are left out of the interface discussion. Storytelling around the acronym helps me provide a little more depth regarding what is API, giving me some easy definitions I can recall throughout my storytelling and API conversations.</p>

<p>Telling stories as allowed me to evolve as a technologist. I used to never see the problem with using acronyms as shorthand for technical complexity, but after telling thousands of stories about a single acronym, I’ve come very acquainted with how they are used to exclude and obfuscate not just technical complexity, but the business and political undertow that exist in technological circles. I really have come to dislike acronyms, and being the API Evangelist keeps this dislike front and center for me, helping me to remember to unpack the complexity whenever I can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2017</span>
        <p>I know this will sound funny to many folks, but when I see APIs, I see language and communication, and humans learning to speak with each other in this new digital world we are creating for ourselves. My friend Erik Wilde (<a href="https://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>) tweeted a reminder for me that APIs are indeed a language.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">APIs are languages. show me one <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/API?src=hash">#API</a> aspect that cannot be adequately framed in the context of language design practices and challenges.</p>&mdash; Erik Wilde (@dret) <a href="https://twitter.com/dret/status/871429314876645376">June 4, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Every second on our laptops and mobile phone we are communicating with many different companies and individuals. With each wall post, Tweet, photo push, or video stream we are communicating with our friends, family, and the public. Each of these interactions is being defined and facilitated using an API. An API call just for saying something in text, in an image, or video. API is the digital language we use to communicate online and via our mobile devices.</p>

<p>Uber geeks like me spend their days trying to map out and understand these direct interactions, as well as the growing number of indirect interactions. For every direct communication, there are usually numerous other indirect communications with advertisers, platform providers, or maybe even law enforcement, researchers, or anyone else with access to the communication channels. We aren’t just learning to directly communicate, we are also being conditioned to participate indirectly in conversations we can’t see–unless you are tuned into the bigger picture of the API economy.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/xmen/xavier-internet.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>

<p>When we post that photo, companies are whispering about what is in the photo, where it was taken, and what meaning it has. When we share that news link of Facebook, companies have a discussion about the truthfulness and impact of the link, maybe the psychological profile behind the link and where we fit into their psychological profile database. In some scenarios, they are talking directly about us personally like we are sitting in the room, other times they are talking about us like we are just a number in a larger demographic pool.</p>

<p>In alignment with the real world, the majority of these conversations being held between men, behind closed doors. Publicly the conversations are usually directed by people with a bullhorn, talking over others, as well as whispering behind, and around people while they completely unaware that these conversations about them are even occurring. The average person is completely unaware these conversations are happening. They can’t hear the whispering, or just do not speak the language that is being used around them, about them, each moment of each day.</p>

<p>Those of us in the know are scrambling to understand, control, and direct the conversations that are occuring. There is a lot of money to be made when you are part of these conversations. Or at least have a whole bunch of people on your platform to have a conversation about, or around. People don’t realize that for every direct conversation you have online, there are probably 20 conversations going on about this conversation. What will they buy next? Who do they know? What is in that photo they just shared? Is this related post interesting to them? API-driven echoes of conversation upon conversations into infinity.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like Dr. Xavier from the X-men in that vault room connected to the machine when I am on the Internet studying APIs. I’m seeing millions of conversations going on–it is deafening. I don’t just see or hear the direct conversations, I hear the deafening sounds of advertisers, hackers, researchers, police, government, and everyone having a conversation around us. Many folks feel like the average person shouldn’t be included in the conversation–they do not have the interest or awareness to even engage. To me, it just feels like a new secretive world augmenting our physical worlds, where our digital selves are learning to speak with each other. What troubles me though, is that not everyone is actually engaged in the conversations they are included in, and are often asleep or sedated while their personal digital self is being manipulated, exploited, and p0wn3d.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/introducing-auth0-extend-the-new-way-to-extend-your-saas/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/auth0/auth0-extensions-screenshot-editor.png" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/introducing-auth0-extend-the-new-way-to-extend-your-saas/">Auth0 has released a pretty interesting way to extend your web applications using what is an embeddable, serverless, webhooks environment</a>–for lack of a better description.  It’s a pretty interesting way to extend applications in a scrappy, hackable, scriptable, webhooky kind of way. The extensions are definitely not for non-developers, but provide a kind of scriptable view source that any brave user could use to get some interesting things done within an existing web application interface.</p>

<p>Here are some of the selling features of Auth0 extensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They are deployed outside of your product and managed externally.</li>
  <li>They run securely and in isolation from your SaaS application. The SaaS will not go down due to a faulty Webhook.</li>
  <li>They are generally easy for a developer to create, whether it’s your own engineers, customers, or partners.</li>
  <li>They can be authored in a number of programming languages.</li>
  <li>They can use whatever third-party dependencies they need.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it is an interesting approach to extending existing applications using Webhooks. I’m guessing some users might be intimidated by it, but I could see it be something that developers and tech savvy users could hack together some pretty interesting implementations. Then when you start saving these interesting scripts, making them available to power users via a catalog–I could see some useful things emerge. I remember several jobs I’ve had that had some sort of universal SQL text area within a system, allowing power users to craft and reuse useful SQL scripts–this seems like a similar approach, but for the API age.</p>

<p>I’m curious to see where this kind of solution goes. It is a quick way to extend SaaS functionality, allowing users to get more from an application without expensive developer cycles, and offloading the compute to external services. I think it is a creative convergence of what I see as embeddable, serverless, and webhooks–all part of an effective API strategy. I’m hoping it injects some creativity and extensibility into existing apps, allowing them to better serve the long tail of users needs in an API serverless webhook way.</p>

<p>I got my regular email from Algorithmia this last week and I like where they are going with some of their machine learning APIs. They have been heavily investing in machine learning applied to video, allowing for the extraction of information from video, as well as applying interesting transformations to your videos.</p>

<p>Here are some of the video tools they have been working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-to-video-transform/">Introduction to Video Transform</a>: apply image transformations to every frame of a video automatically.</li>
  <li><a href="http://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-video-metadata/">Introduction to Video Meta-Data Extraction</a>: apply any image recognition algorithms to every frame of a video automatically.</li>
  <li><a href="http://blog.algorithmia.com/deep-dive-into-parallelized-video-processing/">Deep Dive into Parallelized Video Processing</a>: Check out how we built a highly parallelized video processing pipeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all things I’m interested in using as part of my drone and other video work that I’ve been working on as a hobby. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/learning-about-machine-learning-apis-with-my-algorithmic-rotoscope-work/">I’m interested in the video pipeline aspect because it’s fun to work with the video I capture</a>, but I also see the potential when it comes to drones in agriculture and mining, and I am also curious <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/exploring-the-economics-of-wholesale-and-retail-algorithmic-apis/">the business models associated with this type of a video pipeline</a>. I think video, images, plus APIs, coupled with the API monetization strategy Algorithmia already has in place is their formula for success.</p>

<p>I’m keeping an eye on what Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are up to, but I think Algorithmia has a first mover advantage when it comes to the economic of all of this. I’m glad they are investing more into their video resources. I think there are endless uses for API-driven pipelines that process images and video and apply machine learning models using APIs, then metered, and made <a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms">available via an algorithmic catalog like Algorithmia offers</a>.</p>

<p>I’m always fascinated by the patents that get filed related to APIs. Most just have an API that is part of the equation, but some of the patents are directly for an API process. It’s no secret that I’m a patent skeptic. I’m not anti-patent, I just think the process is broken when it comes to the digital world, and specifically when it comes to APIs and interoperability. Here is one of those API patents that show just how broken things are:</p>

<p>Title: <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/9462011">Determining trustworthiness of API requests based on source computer applications’ responses to attack messages</a>
Number: US9462011
Owner: CA, Inc.</p>

<p>Abstract: A method includes receiving an application programming interface (API) request from a source computer application that is directed to a destination computer application. An attack response message that is configured to trigger operation of a defined action by the source computer application is sent to the source computer application. Deliverability of the API request to the destination computer application is controlled based on whether the attack response message triggered operation of the defined action. Related operations by API request risk assessment systems are disclosed.</p>

<p>I get that you might want to patent some of the secret sauce behind this process, but when it comes to APIs, and API security I’m thinking we need to keep thinks open, reusable, and interoperable. Obviously, this is just my not so the business savvy view of the world, but from my tech savvy view of how we secure APIs, patented process help nobody.</p>

<p>When it comes to API security you gain an advantage by providing actual solutions and doing it better than anyone else. Then you do not need to defend anything, everyone will be standing in line to buy your services because securing your APIs is critical to doing business in 2017.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2017/06/pinboard_acquires_delicious/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/pinboard/pinboard-buys-delicious.png" align="right" width="35%" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:kinlane">social bookmarking API Pinboard</a> is my favorite API. I feel like it is a model we should all be considering crafting our API-focused businesses. I’ve used Pinboard to curate what I do as the API Evangelist ever since 2011, and it has been one of the most stable and versatile APIs in my stack, doing one thing, and doing it well, reflecting everything that is API from a business perspective.</p>

<p>I feel that Pinboard provides entrepreneurs with a positive model for not just a SaaS business, and API operations, but showing startups that you don’t always need to scale to achieve success. <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2017/06/pinboard_acquires_delicious/">Pinboard acquired their rival Delicious bookmarking site</a> this last week, which has been bought and sold five times now, demonstrating the volatility of startup culture, as well as the viability and potential stability a well-run API business can bring to the table. Providing a model that won’t necessary work in all business scenarios, but does provide us with plenty to consider for our API ideas that probably aren’t VC scale.</p>

<p>I know there will always be startups who are obsessed with the VC model for launching, scaling, and selling a business. I am fine with dealing with some of the volatility brought by these types of companies, but I feel like the lion share of the actual API business will be conducted on the shoulders of giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and via smaller operators like Pinboard. I’m going to make Pinboard into a textbook example of how to do APIs, helping entrepreneurs understand what healthy patterns already exist out there, providing them with something they can emulate when crafting their SaaS / API business.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.hitchhq.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hitch/hitch-dashboard.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>When I play with <a href="https://www.hitchhq.com">my Hitch service</a> I am always left thinking about the many dimensions of API monitoring. When you talk about API monitoring in the tech sector conversations almost always start with the API providers and the technical details monitoring of individual APIs. Hopefully, these discussions also focus on API monitoring from the API consumers point of view, but I wanted to also shine a light on companies like Hitch who are adding an additional dimension from the API service provider view of things–which is closer to my vantage point as an analyst.</p>

<p>I am an advisor to Hitch because they are a different breed of API monitoring service, that isn’t just focused on the APIs. Hitch brings in the wider view of monitoring the entire operations of an API–if documentation changes, an SDK on Github, or update via Twitter, or a pricing change, you get alerted. As a developer I enjoy being made aware of what is going on across operations, keeping me in tune with not just the technical, but also the business and politics of API platform operations.</p>

<p>Another reason I like Hitch, and really the reason behind me writing this post, is that they are helping API providers think about the bigger picture of API monitoring. Helping them think deeply, as well as getting their shit together when it comes to regularly sending out the critical signals us API consumers are tuning into. When you are down in the trenches of operating an API at a large company, it is easy to get caught up in the internal vacuum, forgetting to properly communicate and support your community–Hitch helps keep this bubble from forming, assisting you in keeping an external focus on your community.</p>

<p>If you are just embarking on your API journey I recommend tuning into API Evangelist first. ;-) However, <a href="https://www.hitchhq.com">if you are unsure of how to properly communicate and support your community I recommend you talk to the Hitch team</a>. They’ll help get you up to speed on the best practices when it comes to API operations, and understand how to send the right signals to your community–something that will make or break your API efforts, so please don’t ignore it.</p>

<p>Disclosure: I am an advisor for Hitch, and they are my friends.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2017</span>
        <p>This post is a straight up copy and paste from an email newsletter I get from Peter Gruenbaum of <a href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a>. I am a big supporter of API service providers like SDK Bridge, who has been doing API documentation the entire time I’ve been the API Evangelist. Peter isn’t looking to be the next big startup, he’s just operating a successful API service that addresses one of the biggest problems API providers face–documentation. Some of my readers might not be aware these types of services exist, which is why I’m copy / pasting this, and helping spread the good word.</p>

<hr />

<p>People often ask me what the best tool for API documentation is. There is no simple answer to this question. It depends a lot on what your API looks like, who your developers are, and what kind of support you can give your content system. This is a quick newsletter to pass on a review of free and open source API documentation tools that you might consider using.</p>

<p>Also, there’s a 60% off sale on our Udemy courses for you newsletter readers for the first 10 students to sign up:</p>

<p><strong>Free and Open Source API Documentation Tools</strong>
Diána Lakatos has written an excellent description of several free and open source tools that can read the standard API definition formats OpenAPI, RAML, and API Blueprint. In addition, she covers API documentation tools that require non-standard formats, and general purpose open source documentation tools that can be used for API documentation that you may want to consider.</p>

<p>She provides screenshots and links to demos for each of these tools. If you want a quick overview of the tools, scroll to the bottom to read the summary table.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/02/the-github-repo-stripe-users-to-manage-their-openapi/">The Github Repo Stripe Uses To Manage Their OpenAPI</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2017</span>
        <p>I’m beating a drum every time I find a company managing their OpenAPI on Github, like we would the other code elements of our API operations. Today’s drumbeat comes from my friend Nicolas Grenié (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a>), who posted Stripe’s Github repository for their OpenAPI in our Slack channel for the super cool API Evangelists in the sector. ;-)</p>

<p>Along with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/01/new-york-times-manages-their-openapi-using-github/">New York Times</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/05/22/box-goes-all-in-on-openapi/">Box</a>, and other API providers, <a href="https://github.com/stripe/openapi">Stripe has a dedicated Github repo for managing their OpenAPI definition</a>. This opens up the Stripe API for easily loading in client tools <a href="https://restlet.com/modules/client/">like Restlet Client</a>, and <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, as we as generating code samples and SDKs using services like APIMATIC. Most importantly, it allows for developers to easily understand the surface area of the Stripe API, in a way that is machine-readable, and portable.</p>

<p>It makes me happy to see leading API providers manage their own OpenAPI using Github like this. The API sector will be able to reach new heights when every single API provider manages their API definitions like this. I know, I know hypermedia folks–everyone should just do hypermedia. Yes, they should. However, we need some initial steps to occur before that is possible, and API providers being able to effectively communicate their API surface area to API consumers in a way that scales and can be used across the API lifecycle is an important part of this evolution. With each OpenAPI I find like this, I get more optimistic that we are getting closer to the future that RESTafarians and hypermedia folks envision–providers are doing the hard work of thinking about the definitions used in their APIs in the context of the entire API lifecycle, and the API consumers who exist along the way.</p>

<p>I am regularly using APIs to slice and dice large datasets to help make sense of what is contained within the database behind in a way that other folks can then develop visualizations, reporting, and other applications for use by folks who are closest to the problem we are trying to solve–this opportunity is one of the reasons I have been evangelizing APIs at all level of government over the last seven years.</p>

<p>After many years of hard work in the federal government by <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">smart folks at 18F</a>, and at the agencies they serve, we are beginning to see some tools emerge that begin to help us make sense of the overwhelming amount of data that comes out of the government on a regular basis. You can see this in action with <a href="https://qpp.cms.gov/api/">the API for Quality Payment Program Measures, out of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)</a>–helping make sense of how spending is working, or not working when it comes to healthcare.</p>

<p>It has taken years for projects like this to get approved and rolled out. It represents the future of how we make sense of big government, and begin to understand where the waste is, while still also understanding the good that it is occurring. Sadly, as I tell the story, and we see this first wave of APIs coming out of government, the current administration is slashing the budgets behind this type of work. In 2017 I am very concerned for projects like this, as well as future iterations of these API efforts, at a time where we need increased investment in important areas like APIs cracking open health care spending.</p>

<p>If you are in healthcare, make sure and spend some time playing with the API, providing CMS with feedback on what works and what doesn’t. If you have the skills, and the resources, maybe you can also invest in developing some visualizations, applications, or other storytelling around the CMA API for Quality Payment Program Measures, helping to demonstrate the value in understanding how our healthcare dollars are being spent, and the value of APIs helping us slice and dice what both the good and the bad of the impact government has in our world. If you do, make sure and reach out to me so I can tell the story along the way.</p>
