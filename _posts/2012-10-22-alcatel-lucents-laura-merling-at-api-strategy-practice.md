{% include JB/setup %}<p>When 3Scale and I first decided to do the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference in New York, one of the first people I reached out to about speaking and sponsoring the event, was Laura Merling (@magicmerl), SVP Applications Enablement Platform and Strategy at Alcatel-Lucent.As soon as I told her about the event, she said “We are in!What do we need to do, to support it!” I’m stoked to have Laura kick off the event on Thursday, November 1st with a keynote as well as having Alcatel-Lucent as a gold sponsor.If you’ve never heard Laura speak, I highly recommend making sure you are there.</p>
