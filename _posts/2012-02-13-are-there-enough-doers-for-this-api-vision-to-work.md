I am an eternal optimist, especially when it comes to APIs. I really feel that [APIs can decouple businesses assets and resources][2], making these companies much more efficient.

We’ve seen the power of the API when it comes to companies like Twitter, Twilio, Facebook and many others. But to build something on top of an API, you have to be a do-er.

A do-er is a term invented by Jeff Lawson ([@jeffiel][3]) of Twilio:

> _[Do-er][4] (n): A particularly driven individual, esp. a developer, who picks up their tools and builds something special._

Do-ers are a fundamental ingredient in API ecosystems, and when I go to many conferences and walk by booths I see a fundamentally different process of holding peoples hands and showing them what they need to know. I also see many companies relying on this process to even make money.

So I have to ask--are we creating enough do-ers?  

I am very optimistic about the future of API growth, but I do worry sometimes about there being enough doers to make APIs continue to grow. Many individuals are so used to the regular sales cycle and corporate training, they don’t seem equipped to find solutions to their problems on their own.

Are you a do-er?  Do you think there are enough do-ers out there?
